 HERE'S THE STORY: Critics said it wouldn't last, but the phenomenon that is 
television's "Brady Bunch" turns 25 today. Ever wonder where the Bradys lived? 
It was never revealed on the show, but the suburban home seen in countless 
reruns still stands in North Hollywood (B1). . . . Not everyone is celebrating 
the anniversary. "I'm not a believer in milestones," said series creator 
Sherwood Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 DRIVING COSTS: So how much does it set you back to get to and from work? 
According to the nonprofit Commuter Transportation Services, the average 
commuter spends $86 to get to work each month. . . . The most expensive form of 
commuting is riding the train, at $97 monthly. Second is driving alone, at $92. 
Car-pooling is $68, and riding the bus $52. The cheapest is van-pooling, which 
averages $51. 
</P>
<P>
 OLDER RASCAL: His real name is Ernest Weckbaugh. Who? Well, maybe it would be 
better to just call him Stinky. That's who Burbank's Weckbaugh (above), played 
more than 50 years ago in the "Our Gang" comedies featuring the original Little 
Rascals (B5). . . . "I was one of hundreds of kids chosen to interact with the 
main characters," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 ON TRIAL: Two years ago, John Hoglund became the first Maywood police officer 
killed in the line of duty. This week, three men go on trial for the slaying, 
which authorities believe was part of a robbery spree that also killed Lee Chul 
Kim, a Van Nuys market owner, in May, 1992. . . . Authorities say Kim was shot 
about a dozen times, allegedly by two of the same suspects in the Hoglund case 
(B1). 
</P>
<P>
 WHICH CAMPUS? The starting premise is easy enough: Students who live within a 
mile of a school should attend that campus because they can walk to it. But 
what to do in Santa Clarita, where five of the six elementary schools are 
within a mile of each other? . . . Plus, a seventh school, outside the city 
limits, is due to open next fall, and some students will have to be moved, 
which has some parents unhappy (B6).

RAIDERS LOSE TO CHARGERS BY DECISION; PRO FOOTBALL: SAN DIEGO'S ROSS CHOOSES 
CORRECTLY, SHELL WRONGLY AS AFC WEST LEADERS REMAIN UNDEFEATED, 26-24. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wake-up call? Raider Coach Art Shell dialed the wrong number Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to shake his team out of its lethargy and get back in a game he 
trailed, 20-3, Shell passed up a near-certain field goal in the closing minute 
of the first half at the Coliseum and went for a first down on a 
fourth-and-three at the San Diego Charger six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of opting for the dependable arm of quarterback Jeff Hostetler, Shell 
went to his shaky running game, calling on Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams came up a yard short and the Raiders wound up two points short, 
eventually losing, 26-24, before 55,385. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough call for Shell? No one can sympathize with him better than Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego coach also had to make a crucial fourth-down call. He also went 
for the first down, but his fourth-quarter gamble paid off eventually in the 
game-winning points. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a fourth and one at the Raider 32-yard line in the closing minutes, 
Ross turned his back on a possible 49-yard field goal attempt by John Carney. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ross rolled the dice and came up with an eight, quarterback Stan 
Humphries completing an eight-yard pass to running back Ronnie Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
 That enabled the Chargers to drive close enough for Carney to kick a 33-yard 
field goal with two seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 With one thrust of his right leg, Carney boosted San Diego into sole 
possession of first place in the AFC West at 4-0 and booted the Raiders out of 
early season contention, leaving them three games back at 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That kick also allowed the Chargers to hold off a Raider rally that enabled 
them to come back from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit, a 20-3 halftime 
disadvantage and a 23-3 third-quarter San Diego lead to gain a 24-23 edge on 
Lionel Washington's 31-yard return of an interception with 7:01 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole complexion of this game had changed at the end of the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a miserable half for the Raiders, as dismal as any they have had 
in stumbling out the starting gate this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outscored, 82-23, in the first two games, both losses, the Raiders 
had broken through a week ago by beating Denver, 48-16. 
</P>
<P>
 But those were the defensively inept Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the re-charged Chargers, who came into town with an effective blend 
of old and new faces, the league's top-ranked passer in Stan Humphries and the 
AFC's leading sack unit with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 They showed a little bit of everything in that first half, starting with the 
instant they first got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 That was after the Raiders' opening drive stalled. Jeff Gossett kicked a 
53-yard punt to Darrien Gordon, who appeared as if he was going to be tackled 
by James Trapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gordon got away on the right side of the field, headed left, blew 
past Patrick Bates, who was blocked on the play, and found only Gossett between 
himself and the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to grab the back of his shoulder pads," Gossett said. "I ended 
up grabbing the side of his facemask, so I had to let go. I couldn't quite get 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon outraced the next closest defender, Rob Holmberg, to the end zone for a 
90-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders seemed stunned. Once again, the game had started and nobody seemed 
to have told them. It's a trend that has become all too familiar to this club. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, seeking its fourth consecutive victory at the Coliseum, added a 
38-yard field goal by Carney and a one-yard run by Natrone Means. Means' 
touchdown was set up by a 50-yard pass interference call against Eddie 
Anderson, the second time in as many weeks the Raiders have been on the 
receiving end of such a call. Last week, Washington got the call against 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, when Humphries, on a third and 12 from his 49, headed for the line 
of scrimmage, safety Anderson bit on the move and came up. That left receiver 
Shawn Jefferson alone near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson tried to recover and race back. Attempting to make up for lost time, 
he hooked Jefferson's arm. The throw was short, but Anderson was cited for 
impeding Jefferson's path to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Means was in the end zone. An exchange of field goals, 43 
yards by Jeff Jaeger and 24 by Carney, made the score 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders turned to quarterback Jeff Hostetler and wide receiver Tim Brown. 
They responded by hooking up on a 24-yard completion on the first play of the 
Raiders' last drive of the half. The team drove 71 yards to the Charger six, 
where it was fourth and three with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something," Shell said, "to wake up the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went up the middle for two yards, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a message that we wanted to win," Williams said. "We wanted 
seven points, not three." 
</P>
<P>
 Had they made the first down, the Raiders would have had only 48 seconds to 
get into the end zone, but Jaeger also had no problem with the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he (Shell) should be given credit for going for it," Jaeger said. 
"They don't ask my opinion. I'm just his weapon. If he sends me in, I go. If he 
doesn't, I just stand there and cheer. He's the head coach, but you've got to 
cut him some slack. He's just trying to do what's right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did plenty that was right in the second half. After Carney's 
27-yard field goal gave the Chargers a 20-point lead, the Raiders finally came 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler scored from a yard out and then went to Rocket Ismail on a 24-yard 
touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 With San Diego trying to regain the momentum in the final quarter, Humphries 
sailed a short pass to Shannon Mitchell. Raider rookie linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson batted the ball into the air, where Washington was able to grab it 
and cruise untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Chargers got the ball, they needed only three points to win. Had 
the Raiders let Jaeger kick at the end of the half, San Diego would have had to 
get into the end zone to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell took a gamble. Now he must take the criticism. And unless his team can 
turn around a season that has turned sour before it is a month old, he'd better 
get used to it.

GEORGE RAMOS: HANK AGUIRRE: AN EVEN BIGGER HERO OFF THE DIAMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite all the bums in baseball -- the players who went on strike and the 
owners who canceled the World Series -- there really are some heroes of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Aguirre was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a decent pitcher, spending 10 of his 16 years in the majors with the 
Detroit Tigers. He was selected to the American League All-Star team three 
times despite having the reputation as one of the worst hitters in the game. He 
pitched for the Dodgers for a year before retiring after the 1970 season. 
</P>
<P>
 He's remembered as a lanky southpaw with a blazing fastball. As a rookie for 
the Cleveland Indians, he struck out Ted Williams the first time he faced him. 
After the game, he sought out Williams and asked the future Hall of Famer to 
autograph a baseball. Williams obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in that season of 1955, the Splendid Splinter faced Aguirre again and 
whacked the ball out of the park. As the Boston Red Sox slugger rounded the 
bases, Williams yelled out to Aguirre, "Hey kid, if you get that ball, I'll 
sign it for you, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the ballplayer who was born into a Mexican immigrant family and reared 
in San Gabriel, his greatest fame came after his playing days were over. His 
fame and good deeds were such that he was called a "Mexican god." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After he quit playing, Aguirre wanted to help Mexican Americans and other 
minorities. "I'm grateful for what I had been able to acquire," he said. "The 
least I could do is give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 A distant relative, East L.A. priest Arnold Gonzalez, said Aguirre had a 
fierce pride in being Mexican, a trait instilled by his parents, who were from 
Jalisco. "He wanted others to climb up the ladder of life," the priest said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Aguirre mortgaged his home to borrow $350,000 to start up a 
manufacturing business in southwest Detroit. He called it Mexican Industries. 
He figured he could provide jobs by breaking into the auto industry as a parts 
supplier for the Big Three. His factory produced headrests, steering wheels and 
air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 He started with eight employees, all of them minorities. Today, more than 
1,000 people -- 85% of them Latinos -- work there. Revenues total more than 
$100 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexican Village -- Detroit's version of East L.A. -- Aguirre became a god, 
plant officials said. He was a constant presence in the barrio, offering an 
encouraging word. He pushed city government to pay more attention to Latinos 
and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 He established a scholarship fund for local schools, doling out an estimated 
$50,000 each year to deserving students. He helped pay for after-hours 
recreational programs for inner city kids. He even pushed major league baseball 
to bring more minorities into management. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own plant, he did things that few others dared to do. He offered 
English classes for his Spanish-speaking workers and Spanish classes for 
non-Latinos who were interested. On occasion, he sat with his workers and ate 
nopales -- cactus salad -- in the lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always pooh-poohed what he did," recalls friend Bob Copley, "but he did it 
so often that his reputation for doing things became well-known." 
</P>
<P>
 His contributions were recognized last year when Mayor Dennis Archer showed up 
for the groundbreaking of Mexican Industries' new plant on Howard Street in 
Mexican Village. Aguirre's name, the mayor said, "is like magic and gold 
wherever I go and wherever I've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, this god's work was virtually unknown back home in L.A. But he 
never forgot about the San Gabriel Mission, where he worshiped as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so devoted to the mission that he used to wish it had a high school so 
he could continue going to classes there. Instead, he went to Mark Keppel High 
in Alhambra and later to East L.A. College, where he was discovered by baseball 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 He was horrified to see the damage the historic mission sustained in the 1987 
Whittier Narrows earthquake. Helen Nelson, director of the mission's 
restoration effort, asked Aguirre if he wanted to help the $1.2-million 
rehabilitation project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do I make out the check to?" he replied. He gave more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was big news in Detroit three weeks ago when Aguirre died of prostate 
cancer. He was 62. But in L.A., his passing got scant mention in The Times and 
virtually none on local TV and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't matter to Father Gonzalez, Nelson or the more than 500 who jammed 
the San Gabriel Mission for services and his burial there. Two planeloads of 
Mexican Industries employees flew in to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, Father Gonzalez said, was more than a Mexican god. "His name will go 
down in history but not as a star," the priest said. "He was a genuine hero."

 RICHARD MOORE 
</P>
<P>
 President, Santa Monica College 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Moore spent two decades at Santa Monica, making him the 
longest-serving community college president in California. He also earned a 
reputation as an innovator and creator. Moore announced a few weeks ago that he 
had accepted an offer to become president of the Community College System of 
Southern Nevada. He talked with Brenda Paik Sunoo about his experience at Santa 
Monica College.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I first arrived at SMC, it had a highly academic faculty and a technical 
staff that was superb in relating to the immediate post-World War II 
occupational needs of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I had never been a college president before, and I found it fascinating to be 
responsible for all the elements of a college. But I knew it had two problems: 
The college reported to a (regional) unified school board, and it didn't have 
its own voice and autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 My vision was that all adults should have the right and privilege to attend 
community college, yet we were notably not serving large segments of the adult 
population such as those over 25 and seniors over 55. We also didn't have a 
correct proportion of females, minorities and disabled people attending the 
college. So I started about 12 programs within my first year, including a 
women's center. Now we have finally established a women's college, the Emeritus 
college for seniors (between 55 and 90), and we send more blacks and Latinos to 
UCLA than any other U.S. college. 
</P>
<P>
 My vision has been drawn from within myself and from others like Elizabeth 
Vance -- a woman I brought over from Moorpark College -- and Ilona Jo Katz, who 
had two boys who were blind. She taught me how to change this campus for the 
handicapped. In fact, one of the first things we did was to put the members of 
the academic senate and administration into wheelchairs for one day. At the end 
of the day it was clear that our campus had been hostile to (the disabled). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not very strong about things until some moral chord within me feels 
violated. When it does, I then know what to do. I would guess that somewhere in 
my youth I was bullied. I'm determined that others will not be bullied in front 
of me while I'm president. 
</P>
<P>
 I was raised in the Presbyterian church and I debated for years if I wanted to 
become a minister. But through education, I could become a change agent for 
society. If there were barriers, it was my job to knock them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, a new spirit has been generated on this campus -- that it can 
accomplish whatever it wants to do. One of the best projects has been KCRW. 
General manager Ruth Seymour has done much to change the intellect of people in 
cars, and the station is one of the most intellectual voices for this region. 
It's about ideas, and ideas don't occur just in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has hopes and dreams of changing the world. All they need is to share 
it with someone with a few coins in the pocket and a little guts. And the world 
starts to change.

 Gandhi's Birthday: On Sunday, Oct. 2, Indians observe Gandhi Jayanti, the 
125th anniversary of Mohandas K. Gandhi's birth.His doctrine of nonviolent 
resistance helped win Indian independence from the British Empire shortly after 
World War II. Born in 1869 in Porbandar, India, Gandhi was assassinated in New 
Delhi Jan. 30, 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 To commemorate his birth, readings from the world's major religious texts,

 Rick and Mai-Wan have worked hard putting their new home in order. They are 
about to receive their first guests, Rick's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mai-Wan proudly shows her in-laws through the meticulously prepared house. 
However, the older couple is surprised when they look into the master bedroom. 
Although the furniture is in place, Rick and Mai-Wan have been sleeping on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwanese-born Mai-Wan had consulted with a Chinese almanac about the most 
propitious time for the couple to settle into their new home. The book had 
recommended a date more than three weeks after she and Rick actually moved in. 
However, Mai-Wan believed that if they did not sleep in the bed, technically 
they would not have taken possession and thus might ensure good luck while 
living there. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese almanacs are not the only ones to give advice about moving. The Old 
Farmer's 1994 Almanac recommends the new moon as the best time. The UCLA 
Archive of American Popular Beliefs and Superstitions contains myriad examples 
of days considered either good or bad to change residences. Friday seems by far 
the most risky, as expressed in this proverb: "Friday flits have not long 
sits." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Many people believe that particular days for moving can affect the new 
resident's future.

Temple in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been explaining the basics of Sukkot to my 5-year-old son Aaron for 
weeks. It's a sort of Jewish Thanksgiving -- a weeklong harvest festival that 
runs through Tuesday this year. During Sukkot, Jews construct little booths 
reminiscent of the ones the ancient Israelites dwelled in on their pilgrimage 
to the temple in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 I've told him that we're going to build our own sukkah, just like the ones our 
ancestors built, and that we're going to eat and sleep in it as the Bible and 
Talmud command. How much of this Aaron actually understands I don't know. But 
the sleeping out in the back yard part has definitely sunk in. 
</P>
<P>
 We put down the back seats in my wife's Jeep and drove off to a unique Los 
Angeles establishment called "Feldman's Sukkah Kits." They've been around, as 
their letterhead proclaims using the Jewish calendar's way of reckoning time, 
"since 5739," which is 1978 to most people. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow we maneuvered the long clumsy box of poles, hardware, fabric and slats 
into the car. It hung out the back a little so we strapped the whole thing 
down, tied a red flag on the end, buckled ourselves in and headed for home. 
Aaron rode shotgun in his safety seat; sunglasses, juice box and all. 
</P>
<P>
 We felt a certain pride in hauling our cargo. It was, I suppose, the Jewish 
equivalent of strapping a freshly killed deer to the bumper. A 5-year-old and 
his dad -- two mighty Jewish hunters returning home with their prey. 
</P>
<P>
 We had big plans for our sukkah. First we put it together. My tools: Black & 
Decker; Aaron's, Fisher-Price. It looked a little rickety when we finished, but 
that's how everything looks I assemble at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, it was off to Toys R Us to buy a couple of Power Ranger sleeping bags. 
Then we packed some snacks, popped some corn, mixed up the hot chocolate, 
poured it in the thermos, put on our sweats, unrolled the sleeping bags, fired 
up the flashlights and hiked right out there into the back yard. The rabbi and 
his son, urban adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
 I had it all planned: Ghost stories and songs, jokes and deep talk about the 
distant stars and whether or not God put them there; about why goldfish and 
grandparents die and where they go when they do. Then we'd sip some hot 
chocolate and drift off into a peaceful sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, most of the hot chocolate got spilled inside, outside and underneath 
the sleeping bags. There were lots of bathroom breaks and lots of rocks 
underneath the sukkah floor. Cats came around and made scary noises. Birds sang 
but not so sweetly. The grass was wet. My feet were cold. And there wasn't much 
talk of goldfish, God or anything else. Just a couple of guys who'd have been 
better off in their own beds.  
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at it though, Aaron and I learned a lot from the expedition. It 
was a little reminder of the chill so we might appreciate the warmth. A little 
fragility so we might appreciate the people who give us strength. A little 
humility and homelessness so we might appreciate the material richness of our 
lives. A little reminder that even the best sukkah, and even the best life, is 
fragile and temporary, exposing us sometimes to the cold.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; IN 
TODAY'S YOUTH OPINION, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO HAITI 
CITE DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AS ONE REASON. ARE THEY TRYING TO HELP SOLVE THOSE 
PROBLEMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has issued another call to arms on behalf of keeping the 
peace in another country -- this time Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Americans have resisted sending their young people into battle. 
The high school students interviewed here reflect that tradition, largely 
opposing intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Since young people so often cite domestic problems as their primary concern, 
it seems only fair to ask if they're doing anything about it. The answer is a 
resounding, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an incredible increase in the number of young people volunteering," 
says Eli Segal, chief executive officer of the federal Corporation for National 
Service. "Sixty-seven percent of all college freshmen volunteered for some kind 
of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Segal, his program, AmeriCorps (a sort of domestic Peace Corps), 
received more than 100,000 applications for 15,000 spots when it was first 
launched. Participants earn only a small stipend but get full benefits, 
including health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Altruism is far from the only reason -- or even the main reason -- that young 
people volunteer. In a tight economy, many young people say they do volunteer 
jobs as a way to improve their resumes. Many schools are also requiring that 
their students do volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think students are very ambiguous" about it, says Ronald Fagan, professor 
of sociology at Pepperdine University. "In one sense, they are idealistic. They 
want to influence social values. But they want to make money and be powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not seeing huge numbers of people going into social work or 
public-service kinds of professions," Fagan says. "You are, however, seeing 
people who are lawyers and doctors volunteering to read to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 While few people would compare service in the military to service in a 
domestic volunteer program, there is some similarity: the hope that doing a 
service eventually will lead to a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military does continue to have programs for educational support but, in 
real dollar terms, the level of support has declined dramatically over the past 
15 or 20 years," says Robert Hanneman, professor of sociology at UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanneman, who does not believe that the armed services does an adequate job 
training its recruits for civilian life, notes that the best route to a better 
job is a college degree. "If you can't invest enough in education to escape the 
growing low-income service sector, the military is better than flipping 
hamburgers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no matter how a young person serves his or her country, any kind of 
volunteerism apparently makes for a better society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our early democratic thinkers assumed that for democracy to work, the people 
would be informed and would be involved," says Fagan. "Our democracy is built 
on the concept of people volunteering."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; COULD YOU 
SPEND SIX MONTHS AWAY FROM YOUR JOB, HOME AND FAMILY ON THE O.J. JURY?

</P>
<P>
 Director, Los Angeles Conservation Corps 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot commit to jury duty that long for financial reasons. What they ought 
to have is a jury that's professionally trained by the courts, one that's 
constant. That would solve a lot of problems. The theory behind having an 
impartial jury is ridiculous: Juries are selected by attorneys, and aren't 
necessarily made up of a defendant's peers. No one on the O.J. jury (will be) a 
black person living in Brentwood or an ex-football player. So what does "a jury 
of peers" really mean? I think professional juries would be better equipped to 
deal with these questions. JULIE DODD-THOMAS 
</P>
<P>
 Director of market applications, Pacific Bell, lives in San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the mother of three children, ages 6 to 13, and I have a husband who is 
also a professional. Our children are very involved in their schools and 
activities -- Little League, soccer, drama. Being removed from them for that 
long would certainly impact my ability to attend their functions.  
</P>
<P>
 From a professional standpoint, I'm a director, a middle-management position 
with a lot of responsibility. I would be able to take a laptop PC with me and 
use it during the breaks. There would probably be some downtime during the day 
and I'm used to going without lunch. Using voice-mail and E-mail and having my 
staff stay in constant contact, I would probably not be as timely with my 
activity, and probably sleep a lot less; but I would be able to handle a lot of 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury was sequestered and denied the opportunity to use (communications) 
technology, it'd be almost like being on personal leave. ALEX ALBARIAN 
</P>
<P>
 Dentist, Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 It would be interesting. Usually, it's the most interesting cases that take 
that long. But I've got a business and I've got employees I have to pay. I 
can't afford closing. Actually, I've been asked to serve on jury duty a few 
times and I've always gotten out of it by sending a letter saying that it would 
cause a financial hardship. I don't think any professional could afford to do 
something like that unless they're retired. ROGER HOLGUIN 
</P>
<P>
 Professor, East L.A. College 
</P>
<P>
 The jury selection process really creates a problem because it eliminates the 
middle-class worker; if they don't work, they can't pay their bills. The people 
left are either retired or out of a job. That doesn't give you a broad base of 
the community. It winds up excluding a lot of people and giving too much power 
to defense attorneys selecting jury members. Then they prep witnesses like 
actors, telling them how to dress, how to act. They're no longer doing law, 
they're practicing drama. All they have to do is get one juror in doubt and 
that's it, they win the case. They're not dealing with facts anymore, just 
appearances. So because such a large segment of the population is missing out 
on jury duty, we're losing one of our important civil rights. TIM FONG 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant professor of Asian-American Studies, Cal State Northridge  
</P>
<P>
 Since I work for the state I presume, though I haven't checked this out yet, 
they'd make allowances for people who take jury duty time. It's not like I'm 
independent or a student where I'd have to be at a certain place at a certain 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard the jury might be sequestered. I'm here in Southern California 
teaching full time and my wife is up in Northern California. We never get used 
to being separated, but we've faced that issue before. If I'm qualified for the 
jury and it's an interesting case, I would be willing to do that. My wife, 
who's an attorney, would, I think, understand as well. BETTY JEAN TURNEY 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic building administrator, Orange County Health Care Agency 
</P>
<P>
 I just returned from vacation and found my little greetings from the North 
Orange County Municipal Court for jury duty. As taxpaying residents, we all 
have the right (and obligation) to serve on a jury. We should not try and get 
out of it. One of my favorite sayings is "If you don't participate, don't bitch 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Serving for six months would be a big learning experience, if it was 
non-sequestered. I would still be able to see my family and friends and check 
in at work and handle some of the problems over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Being sequestered would give me a very isolated feeling, not knowing what's 
going on personally and professionally. It would be an extremely hard thing to 
be six months away from my job. Because of the size of the clinic, a lot of 
things can change from one moment to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired people would be great for jury duty, but I don't know how they would 
handle the sequestering. I really don't know what kind of person could handle a 
lengthy, sequestered trial. LAURA CATHCART  
</P>
<P>
 Publicist, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 It's just too much of a hardship for the average working person. I certainly 
couldn't do it. Even two weeks would be tough. I just got a jury notice and am 
trying to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A dream solution would be having homeless people on juries. They are never 
heard from, and don't participate in society, but they have opinions too -- I 
think they deserve to serve. Realistically, I think those who are unemployed 
should be considered first for jury selection because they would suffer the 
least financially and they're available during the day. PAUL SAUCIDO 
</P>
<P>
 Actor, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't serve that long because I have to work, unless my employer would be 
willing to pay for it. The problem is, the people with the time and money to do 
it are more affluent, and that means you don't have a good mix of people on the 
jury. You need good critical minds, particularly in this O.J. case. You need 
people who are very open. I'm not saying that older people couldn't do a good 
job, but you have to have people who aren't set in their ways and who haven't 
made up their minds beforehand. But this O.J. thing is unique in that everyone 
has been influenced.

<P>
 We should not put our young men and women in harm's way under false pretenses. 
It seems that the young are always doing the killing for the old. They just 
call the conflict a different name. Like peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we really care that Haiti is a democracy or is governed by a military coup? 
I really don't think that is the issue when it comes down to making these 
decisions. I think Rwanda is a perfect example. While the carnage was going on, 
we did nothing. Where was the call for the peacekeeping mission then? VENESSA 
JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Claremont High School 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that every generation has had to spill blood for some reason or 
another in this country. A friend of mine, who joined the Navy last year, could 
be involved in one of these so-called peacekeeping missions. And I would hate 
to see anything happen to him. Especially if the violence he was involved in 
could have been avoided. It seems that fighting has always been something that 
every generation has had to deal with. I just don't like the idea of soldiers 
dying for something that could have easily been settled through diplomacy. We 
need our young here to help out with the problems we have here -- not in some 
foreign county. ADAM FRIEDBERG 
</P>
<P>
 Junior, 16, Irvine High School 
</P>
<P>
 I can't help but wonder how the U.S. can deal with Haiti given the history 
between the two countries that dates back to 1918. Can we get into and out of 
the situation if necessary?  
</P>
<P>
 I understand that in order to keep the peace in the world, that it may require 
bloodshed. I just hope that if we do decide to use it, it will be as a last 
resort. Since the conflicts that are occurring now, and in the near future are 
now directly affecting my generation, I hope that the U.S. policy would be 
selective and inform the public what the entire policy entails. I would hate to 
see my generation get bogged down in some unwinnable land war. If we must 
intervene, I would hope that our plans to pull out would be fast with no blood 
spilled. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a bad feeling about Haiti. I would rather not see us get involved. EDDY 
CHEN 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 16, Arcadia High School 
</P>
<P>
 I am 100% against any involvement by U.S troops anywhere as long as we have so 
many problems right here in our own country. We need to worry about our own 
people more and not the problems of the world. To send in our troops and put 
their lives in danger is completely absurd. Maybe this sounds isolationist, but 
how can we go into a country to fix it when we have so much to fix right here 
in our own back yard? We might have an obligation to help out in some 
instances, but not carry the whole thing on our back. LILA CHAHBAZI 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Irvine High School 
</P>
<P>
 I would hope that more of my generation would question the purpose of U.S. 
policy. Too many of my generation don't stop to examine the situation. But it's 
not just the youth, but all Americans. It's our duty to voice our opinion on 
what we think is a bad policy.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
FAM CAMP: IDYLLIC GETAWAYS FOR URBAN FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trip to a shopping mall, the beach or a city park hardly qualify as a 
vacation, but the options for low-income families that want to spend time 
together are limited.  
</P>
<P>
 And for those who live in areas with drug, gang or crime activity, neutral 
recreational turf can be hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Fam Camp, a program developed by the California Park Service, introduces these 
families to the peaceable possibilities and inexpensive realities of state 
parks. Community organizations like the Los Angeles Housing Authority link the 
Park Service with interested families and help to organize an overnight trip to 
a state park. Typically seven or eight families spend a weekend together at a 
campsite. The experience offers a taste of affordable recreational 
opportunities, with campsite fees of $16 a night for a family. Since the 
program began in 1992, more than 1,500 people have been introduced to 
California state parks. WHAT RECREATION COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how much a Southern California family of four spends for an average 
trip to: Basketball game: $179 
</P>
<P>
 Amusement park: $145 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball game: $90 
</P>
<P>
 (Includes admission, parking, food and inexpensive souvenirs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Source: individual amusement parks and sports teams WHO PITCHES IN TO SET UP 
FAM CAMP: 
</P>
<P>
 The park service sets aside campsites and provides tents, stoves, sleeping 
bags, lanterns and coolers. 
</P>
<P>
 A community-based sponsoring organization reviews basic safety issues before 
the trip and helps families arrange transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers bring food, cookware and other incidentals such as board games and 
fishing poles. 
</P>
<P>
 California Conservation Corps crews offer set-up assistance and lead hikes and 
nature talks. National service participants from AmeriCorps are also slated to 
assist Fam Camp. THRIVING IN THE 'WILD': 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Parks and Recreation staff teach Fam Camp participants camping 
skills such as what to do if you become lost in the woods to how to pitch a 
tent and cook at a campground. But there are other opportunities for learning, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Maricela Hernandez, director of community services at the Ramona Gardens 
Community Service Center in East Los Angeles, worked with state parks and 
recreation superintendent Jack Shu to help organize the Fam Camp overnight trip 
to the Silverwood Lake State Recreation Area near San Bernardino pictured 
above. Families from two low-income housing sites in Los Angeles participated. 
Here's what she said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fam Camp gives families an experience they can bring back to the city. The 
stress of living in public housing is a constant part of your life. At the 
campsite you know that the only thing behind you is a tree. Maybe it's hard to 
realize how nice it is at the park until after you come back. But then the 
family has learned a new way to get away and enjoy time together without 
spending too much." TO GET INVOLVED

LAWSUIT OVER RECYCLED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Miller Brewing Co. has filed a lawsuit to stop a plan by the Upper San 
Gabriel Valley Mulenicipal Water District to speed up the natural water 
recycling process and use that water to replenish an underground aquifer in the 
San Gabriel Valley (Sept. 14). The company's fears, couched in legal terms, 
seem more based on public relations perceptions than on fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of time, new water molecules have not been created -- they 
are recycled. This occurs naturally through evaporation, precipitation and 
percolation. Waste-water treatment facilities speed the cycle somewhat, and 
reclamation facilities take that water to an even higher level of purification. 
Upper San Gabriel's plan is simply the continuation of a natural process that 
has been going on for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Earth's natural water cycle, even "pure, Rocky Mountain spring 
water" could have been, in an earlier century, Napoleon's bathwater. And from 
the time humans first settled along river banks, downstream communities have 
been drinking the effluent from upstream communities. With proper treatment, 
all water can be used and reused. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially at a time when it is so important that we make the best possible 
use of all our natural resources, Miller's concern seems misplaced.

 The article on the use of "sewage" as a water source for the Miller Brewing 
Co. was extremely misleading. Everyone knows that Southern California is a 
desert. Two-thirds of the region's water is imported from sources more than 400 
miles away. These source are fragile ecosystems that have become degraded 
because of Southern California's ever increasing demand for water. Because of 
the impact on these ecosystems and the endangered species within them, the 
Southland's supply of water from these sources is restricted. The region must 
find new ways to meet the demand of 15 million thirsty residents and reclaimed 
water is the cheapest, most reliable new source of water here. 
</P>
<P>
 Using recycled water to the maximum extent practicable is one giant step in 
the right direction. Unfortunately, there are interests that would like to stop 
innovative projects for their own self-serving purposes. This is exactly what 
the Miller Brewing Co. has done. It has made statements that have no scientific 
background and it is playing on the fears of a largely uninformed public. If 
the public believes Miller's rhetoric, then the ramifications for water reuse 
in the region could impact water reuse projects across the entire state. The 
quality of recycled water that is used for ground water recharge exceeds most 
drinking water standards. Let's stop worrying about nonexistent health risks 
and start protecting the West's natural resources by supporting water reuse in 
California.

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH PLAN

<P>
 In their article "Loophole-Free Reforms Needed" (Commentary, Sept. 14), John 
Garamendi anled Laura Rosenthal address details of how and why they feel that 
businesses should be forced out of existing employee health insurance 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that before this whole thing goes any further, a time-out should be 
taken for a reality check. First of all, providing subsidized medical care for 
more people is going to cost more. Who is to pay for this: Consumers through 
business taxes? All workers through reduced pay scales or higher income taxes? 
The new recipients, much as though they had been forced to buy present-day 
individual coverage? Clearly, "squeezing" Medicare will not. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, who is pushing for radical change rather than repairs? In 
this democracy, politicians are supposed to represent the views of the majority 
of the citizens who care enough to vote. Of course, there are a few districts 
where the majority do have radical views. But, it appears that the vast 
majority of such constituents are concerned (read that as hysterically scared) 
that "government" will "wreck" (somewhat like the retirement savings plan 
called Social Security) their hard-won present arrangements and coverage terms. 
Where and by whom is this majority view being addressed?

 Garamendi and Rosenthal eloquently describe the ills of our current fragmented 
health care system run by the insurance industry. What they do not tell you is 
that Proposition 186 on California's November ballot is the cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 186 establishes a single nonprofit, publicly funded insurance fund to 
pay for all medical care of legal Californians from the doctor of their choice. 
By getting the profit-motivated insurance industry out of our health care 
system, we save up to 30 cents per dollar that insurance companies currently 
waste on bureaucracy, paperwork, marketing and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The last few years have seen more and more Californians and their families 
herded into HMO's and forced to change doctors as they watch their benefits 
diminish and their premiums continue to rise; all the while, insurers keep 
making more profits -- up 32% between 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Prop. 186, Californians and their families are assured of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Highest quality medical care at the doctor and hospital of your choice without 
a co-payment. 
</P>
<P>
 The security of medical benefits that can never be taken away, even if you get 
so sick that you cannot work. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying less than you do now for better benefits -- 2.5% of a family's taxable 
income replaces all that you must pay now in premiums, co-payment and 
deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Incremental reforms cannot work because they continue to rely on an insurance 
industry that has had 50 years to prove that it can administer our health care 
system effectively and has failed because it puts profits above access to care, 
preventive care and choice of provider.

 Proposition 186 seeks to replace private health insurance with a state-run, 
government controlled health care system. This initiative will place a 
surcharge on personal income tax of 2.5% to 5.0%. The supporters of this 
measure want to slap business with payroll tax increases of 4.4% to 8.9%, 
depending on number of employees. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, under this initiative, health care provider and hospitals can 
opt out of the government-run system. Many Californians could be forced to 
change physicians because their current physician rejects the government-run 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic studies reveal that this government-run system would have more than 
$40 billion in budget shortfalls on top of the new taxes. In the event of 
shortfalls, the elected health czar would either have to cut back health 
services, increase co-payments and/or go to the Legislature and ask them to 
raise taxes -- again. Imagine urgently needed health care becoming unavailable 
because there is no money while the Legislature debates whether to cover 
shortfalls. Will your hospital or physician take a California state IOU?

MARION BARRY'S WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am perplexed by your Sept. 15 editorial decrying Marion Barry's primary win 
and likely elleectoral victory in the Washington mayoral race. The Times stated 
that Barry's comeback will "exacerbate" middle-class flight from Washington and 
will "aggravate" members of Congress.However, the only reason you give for your 
dislike of Barry is his addiction to crack cocaine and his arrest and 
subsequent conviction on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Your implication is clear: A person who becomes addicted to drugs is unfit to 
hold public office even in recovery. This is nonsense. Addiction and subsequent 
recovery, for those who are able to put drugs and alcohol behind them, can have 
a profound effect on the recovering addict. Recovery teaches one about 
humility, service to others, and respect for and belief in a power greater than 
oneself: qualities one rarely sees in politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Redemption of the man could very well lead to redemption of the city. If you 
think that Barry is a bad choice as mayor of Washington, then you should give 
persuasive reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Recovery can only improve a person. Barry, if he is truly in recovery, is 
probably a better person than he was before he took up drugs. That can only 
make him a better mayor. 
</P>
<P>

 After watching the enthusiastic people backing Barry for mayor, I am reminded 
of an old adage: "No matter how dumb you think people are, they're always a

REFORMING A WAYWARD INITIATIVE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago today we made our case that California's initiative process, while 
it empowers citizens, is extremely flawed and is in urgent need of reform. 
Today we spell out the details of a reform we like. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in the shape of a future ballot initiative that addresses reform of the 
initiative law itself, and it may be presented to the voters as soon as 1996 if 
legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) is successful. The 
Costa reform, which incorporates recommendations contained in the very valuable 
work of the Citizens' Commission on Ballot Initiatives, attempts to make 
lawmaking by the Legislature and by initiative a new kind of cooperative 
process, rather than an adversarial one. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed are a variety of changes, including several that affect financial 
disclosure and improve presentation of competing initiatives in the ballot 
pamphlet. When several such measures appear on the ballot at once, as happened 
with the controversial automobile insurance initiatives of 1990, this part of 
the reform could help the beleaguered voter wade through it all with greater 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the other key changes: One would permit initiative proponents to 
correct drafting errors in an initiative even after it had qualified, so long 
as the corrections were consistent with the initiative's intent. Another would 
encourage the Legislature to cooperate with the proponents of an initiative by 
meeting with them and, wherever possible, quickly passing laws that achieved 
the same purpose, thus obviating the need for yet another statewide ballot 
measure. A third would permit initiative proponents, under such circumstances, 
to withdraw an initiative. And the fourth would permit the Legislature to 
modify an approved initiative through a two-thirds vote, so long as, again, the 
modification was consistent with the initiative's original intent. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of Costa's reform is to spur the Legislature to take actions the 
voters want. Now, no matter how poorly written or unwieldy an initiative is, 
once the measure is qualified for the ballot it cannot be corrected or 
modified. The voters often vote for, in effect, "the bottom line" as they did 
when they overwhelmingly supported Proposition 13. Voters wanted lower property 
taxes, period. Problem was, that law was and remains unfair to anyone who 
purchased property after 1975. It would have been good if that flaw could have 
been corrected. But the current laws don't provide any flexibility. Once an 
initiative has qualified, its words are in stone. Unless, of course, you can 
come up with yet another initiative to fix the one already passed. 
</P>
<P>
 There's got to be a better way. The proposal by Costa is a start. Voters want 
their voices heard through the initiative process. But if there's a way for 
them to be heard without cluttering the ballot with incomprehensible measures, 
so much the better. The proposals of the Citizens' Commission on Ballot 
Initiatives and of Costa are extraordinarily valuable and should be pursued.

WILL BOSNIA PRY THE U.S. FROM NATO?; CONGRESS MAY DRAW ITS OWN LESSONS FROM 
EUROPEAN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haiti is on the foreign-policy front burner now, of course. On the back 
burner, Bosnia simmers on and may come to a brief boil in mid-October. But the 
unwatched pot that may yet boil over is NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is now caught between the Bosnian preferences of 
Congress and those of our major European allies. Britain and France, in effect, 
see the creation of a new "Serboslavia" as the path to stability in the region. 
They furiously oppose the majority in Congress that wants the United States 
unilaterally to lift its arms embargo on official Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, has lately joined his British and French 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders have rejected the peace proposal that was put forth by 
the United Nations and ferociously escalated their "ethnic cleansing" of 
northeast Bosnia. The astonishing European response to this new aggression has 
been a campaign to begin easing sanctions against Serbia. The U.N. Security 
Council did exactly that last week, lifting embargoes on air travel, cultural 
and sports exchanges with the rump Yugoslav government, though it did vote 
economic sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs and forbade their leaders to visit 
other nations. Bosnian Serbs in turn halted U.N. convoys and threatened 
retaliation for a NATO air raid. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic publicly opposes the Bosnian Serb 
rejection of the United Nations' peace plan, his country continues privately to 
supply and otherwise assist the Bosnian Serbs. Rather than expose Milosevic, 
however, the "contact group" of four European powers (Russia is the fourth) 
plus the United States recently chose to provide him the cover of token 
international monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border: 135 monitors, far too 
few to cover the long border, and all under tight Serbian supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 As the U.N. Security Council rewards Milosevic's "cooperation," Bosnian Serb 
aggression will only continue to escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress' view that Serb aggression must be halted by the stick rather than 
the carrot, by strengthening the Bosnian military deterrent rather than by 
enriching the Serbian economy, is far more realistic. However, realism also 
dictates that the United States not pursue a European policy in defiance of our 
three most powerful European allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has set Oct. 15 as a deadline for the Bosnian Serbs to 
accept the peace plan. When that date comes the Administration will most 
probably ask the 15-nation U.N. Security Council to lift the arms embargo on 
the Muslim-led Bosnians. 
</P>
<P>
 France, Britain, China, New Zealand, Spain, Argentina and the Czech Republic 
will abstain. Veto-wielding Russia will oppose. The United States' request will 
be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus will Europe have won in its struggle with the U.S. Congress. But Congress 
may be prepared to make virtue of this necessity. The moral that Congress may 
draw is that a U.S. withdrawal from formal European collective security may be 
an idea whose time has come. A growing number in Congress may say: Yes, let 
France, Germany and Britain handle post-Cold War Yugoslavia on their own. But 
let them also handle post-Cold War Russia on their own. They have all the 
money, troops and weapons they need for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe will not, in a major way, assist the United States in handling North 
Korea or Cuba or Haiti or other security problems defined as Washington's 
alone. Congress may wish to introduce a kind of parity. 
</P>
<P>
 European, particularly British, comment on U.S. solicitude for the Bosnian 
Muslims has typically faulted it as moralism from afar and on the cheap. But 
the U.S. appetite for the role of world moralist, much less world policeman, is 
smaller than such commentators think. The risk is that Europe's attitude toward 
Bosnia may yet become America's attitude -- toward Europe.

ANOTHER BIG JOLT FROM THE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're wrong if you think all of the big-ticket repair and retrofit bills from 
the Northridge earthquake have been tallied. Now comes a figure that is 
staggering for a single institution. UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young told the 
Board of Regents last week that $650 million is needed for quake repairs and 
retrofitting. Most of the money -- about $500 million -- would go to retrofit 
UCLA's health sciences complex. Young also called for $500 million more to 
upgrade the health sciences structures, perhaps by erecting new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials stress that these are rough estimates and that architectural 
and engineering studies are still in progress. Still, these are huge numbers. 
For comparison, look no farther than quake-ravaged Cal State Northridge, where 
direct damage has been estimated at about $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The degree to which UCLA might be helped by the federal government is unclear; 
whether the university's wish list is pared down, and by how much, depends on 
what Washington can and will do. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a single university asking for as much as $1.15 billion 
will no doubt strike some as egregiously indulgent and unrealistic. However, 
UCLA's importance to the local medical system -- not to mention to the region's 
educational, cultural and intellectual life -- cannot be overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County and the region, for example, depends on the UCLA Medical 
Center. It is a state-of-the-art trauma center and also a tertiary referral 
center, accepting patients whose problems are too difficult for other hospitals 
to handle. It is the second-largest organ transplant facility in the nation and 
a top-level pediatric and neonatal intensive care facility. The magazine U.S. 
News and World Report ranked it as the best hospital in the West, and 
third-best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were a list of hospitals that absolutely must be able to withstand a 
major earthquake, surely it would have to include UCLA Medical Center. The only 
question is the cost and how much can reasonably be done to afford such 
protection.

PERSPECTIVE ON RUSSIA; 'AID' THAT LINES THE GIVERS' COFFERS; WE'RE SUPPOSED TO 
BE HELPING RUSSIANS HELP THEMSELVES, NOT PAYING BIG FEES TO U.S. FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. KRAMER, David J. Kramer is executive coordinator of Russian and 
Eurasian Programs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boris Yeltsin arrives in Washington this week after considerable 
behind-the-scenes debate in the Clinton Administration about U.S. aid policy to 
Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union. The State Department 
has decided to shift the focus of U.S. aid from technical assistance aimed at 
improving the investment climate in Russia to, in essence, subsidization of 
U.S. trade and investment. Such a shift is a serious mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's coordinator for assistance to the newly independent 
states, Ambassador Thomas Simons, strongly pushed for an expanded role for our 
Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corp. Another major 
beneficiary from the change in policy is the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 
an independent government agency that provides funding through non-reimbursable 
grants to American firms for feasibility studies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Trade and Development Agency is popular in the House and 
Senate as a means to funnel assistance to corporations in members' districts. 
At a time when legislative pork-barreling is under attack, this agency merits 
serious scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late 1991, the trade agency has also been in the business of doling out 
aid money intended to help reform in Russia and the other states of the former 
Soviet Union. But instead of helping to promote economic development in Russia, 
the agency is subsidizing feasibility studies for companies interested in 
exploring business opportunities there. This is not the way to help the 
Russians help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the agency awarded 19 economic assistance grants that "will 
strengthen the commercial ties between the United States and Russia," according 
to an agency press release. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the awards, however, reveals that the only "strengthening" being 
done is in American corporate coffers -- at U.S. taxpayer expense and at the 
expense of effective aid to the newly independent states. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 grants provide $6 million in "feasibility study funding" for a wide 
range of projects. A number of the companies involved have already established 
a presence in Russia. Moreover, one would think that General Electric, with 
revenues of $62.2 billion last year, Owens Corning ($2.9 billion) or Marriott 
International ($8.7 billion) could afford feasibility studies in Russia on 
their own without U.S. government support. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott International, for example, will receive $435,000 from the trade 
agency for a study on construction of a Marriott hotel to replace an Intourist 
hotel in downtown Moscow. Spending U.S. taxpayer dollars on such a study is 
truly difficult to justify. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agency says that it must play a "facilitative role" in selecting 
grantees, or the "project would not move forward." It is hard to imagine that a 
General Electric study on co-production of large gas turbines in St. Petersburg 
would have collapsed without $600,000 in trade-agency support. 
</P>
<P>
 Since reform in Russia was launched in 1992, Western governments and 
international lending agencies have been urging the Yeltsin administration to 
reduce state subsidies to enterprises. Successful transformation from a 
centrally planned system to a market economy, after all, requires an end to the 
reliance of plants and factories on government funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet contrary to the advice it is giving Russia, the U.S. government is 
bolstering its role in American firms' trade and investment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian authorities are used to dealing with foreign partners on a 
government-to-government basis," said Daniel Stein, the trade agency's regional 
director for the newly independent states, in Senate testimony last year. U.S. 
competitors, he said, "often have the direct or indirect support of their 
governments . . . . Not only does this give our competitors a clear financial 
advantage, it also raises their profile in the eyes of their (newly independent 
state) partners because of the active support and participation of their 
respective governments. (The trade agency) is in a unique position to help 
American companies overcome some of these barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of downplaying the state's role, the Clinton Administration has 
decided to get the U.S. government more involved to try to "even the playing 
field." Such involvement perpetuates, even increases, both the Russian and 
American governments' roles in what should be private-sector activity. Shifting 
even more resources to the trade agency, as advocated by the State Department, 
clearly sends the wrong signal to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing business in Russia and the other states of the former Soviet Union is 
not for the faint of heart, and foreign business activity will not pick up 
unless the investment climate there improves. For the Russians, this means 
creating a simpler, less burdensome tax structure for foreign ventures and 
clearer investment legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Trade and Development Agency) provides an incentive for U.S. companies 
that are interested in developing business in Russia, but are unwilling to 
assume all of the inherent political and economic risks," Stein testified last 
year. "Despite the opportunities in the (newly independent states), many U.S. 
companies remain hesitant to commit their own resources to developing the 
market . . . . There are many less risky places to do business." Yet the trade 
agency puts U.S. tax dollars at risk to fund feasibility studies -- through 
non-reimbursable grants, no less -- because corporations are reluctant to do 
risk their own money. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government, Stein testified, "has a broader strategic interest in 
promoting U.S. private-sector involvement" in these countries. The trade agency 
is surely a poor way to accomplish that goal.

IF IT'S VOLUNTARY, IT'S NOT REFORM; HEALTH INSURANCE: ANY SCHEME WITHOUT 
MANDATES WILL ENCOURAGE THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE TO GO WITHOUT, AS THEY DO NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA REMSON MITCHELL, Laura Remson Mitchell is a public-policy analyst and 
writer and the government-issues coordinator for the California chapters of the 
National Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers and some conservative Democrats may see the death of 
universal, comprehensive national health-care reform as a great political 
victory, but it's bad economics. Thanks to Proposition 186 on the Nov. 8 
ballot, however, Californians still have a chance to do something before an 
insidious process known as "adverse selection" trashes what's left of our 
health-care "system." 
</P>
<P>
 Adverse selection is the tendency of people with poorer than average health 
expectations to sign up for insurance more than healthier people. If you have a 
health problem, you know how important coverage is and you'll probably put 
insurance high on your spending priority list. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the choice, a significant number of people won't get insurance 
unless an employer pays for most or all of it. For people with very low 
incomes, it may come down to a contest between food and health coverage. 
Without significant subsidies, insurance will be at the top of the list only 
for those with the worst health problems. Meanwhile, many young, healthy 
individuals will see no reason to spend their own cash on health policies. 
After all, they may think, "I'm strong as a horse, and there are plenty of 
other ways I'd rather spend my money. Although purchasing pools may help small 
employers get a better deal in the insurance market, some employers (large or 
small) will rate health coverage for their workers lower than other business 
spending options.  
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that without a mechanism to cover everyone, many healthy 
individuals simply won't be part of the insurance pool. That means people with 
health problems will make up an ever-larger percentage of the pool, thereby 
pushing up premiums. Unfortunately, as premiums continue to climb, price will 
drive more and more employers and low-risk individuals out of the market. This 
is the destructive cycle that will ruin any system that depends on purely 
voluntary, private decisions about health coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 The uninsured who become sick will, after spending their private resources, 
fall back on public, poverty-based programs at taxpayer expense. The tinkering 
advocated lately by some in Washington would simply hide the fact that more 
people are being dumped on those already overloaded programs. Result? The worst 
possible kind of "single-payer" system -- an underfunded, stigmatized, 
poverty-based one. 
</P>
<P>
 Major victims of adverse selection will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The poor. Without significant subsidies to help them pay for private 
coverage, even more people will find themselves relying on government health 
programs of last resort, often at a much higher cost to the public than a 
comprehensive system of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Middle-class Americans and the working poor. This group is among the 
hardest-hit now. According to a report in the April issue of the California 
Journal, the fastest-growing portion of the Medi-Cal caseload consists of 
households with incomes between $16,000 and $24,000 for a family of three. 
Without the kind of universal coverage that now appears available only through 
enactment of Proposition 186, the combination of higher insurance premiums and 
higher taxes to support an increasingly overburdened safety net for the poor is 
likely to make things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * People with disabilities and serious pre-existing conditions. This is the 
same group that insurers routinely reject for coverage now. Even if Congress 
ultimately requires insurers to take everyone, regardless of health status, 
escalating premiums will effectively price this group out of the market for any 
health plan that could possibly meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 *Employers. Cost-shifting to pay for treating the uninsured, along with an 
increasingly high-risk insurance pool, means that many employers who want to 
cover workers will either find themselves at a competitive disadvantage with 
companies that don't offer health benefits or else be priced out of the market 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the misleading rhetoric that often masquerades as analysis of 
health-care reform these days, the best protection for all of us is universal 
coverage for a basic benefits package that is comprehensive enough and flexible 
enough to meet individual needs in a cost-effective way. Thanks in large 
measure to the very forces that oppose it, Proposition 186 is now the only 
viable way to achieve that goal.

JUDGING THE JURY IN THE SIMPSON CASE; JUSTICE: FINDING A DOZEN PROSPECTIVE 
JURORS WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THE DETAILS SHOULDN'T BE THE GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STACK, Richard Stack is an assistant professor in the School of 
Communication of the American University in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can O.J. Simpson get a fair trial? Can a dozen unaware citizens be found to 
serve on his jury? 
</P>
<P>
 The question of seating unaware jurors is misleading. Unaware is not 
synonymous with impartial , and the Constitution speaks of impartial juries, 
not jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The belief that juries were essential protectors of liberty culminated in the 
adoption of the Sixth Amendment, which states: "In all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial 
jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving this right does not depend on locating jurors with no opinions or 
biases, but rather on the dynamics of interaction among 12 community members, 
and their knowledge and background. 
</P>
<P>
 The media's influence on prospective jurors is an old debate. A seminal case 
was the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr. Burr argued against seating any 
jurors who were aware of his longstanding, well-known political feud with 
President Thomas Jefferson. Ruling on that motion, Chief Justice John Marshall 
defined "impartial jury" as consisting of citizens who would fairly hear the 
testimony and would reach a verdict on the evidence and applicable law. (Burr 
was acquitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1878, the question was whether someone aware of the facts of a case could 
serve as a juror. In Reynolds vs. United States, the court reasoned that every 
opinion a potential juror holds need not disqualify that individual from jury 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, in 1961 in Irvin vs. Dowd, overturned a murder conviction for lack 
of an impartial jury. It established the framework through which juror bias 
might be shown. Some knowledge of the facts and issues alone will not 
necessarily render someone unfit for jury duty. The court ruled that an 
opinion, unless so strong that it cannot be overcome by evidence, is 
insufficient to disqualify a prospective juror. If "the juror can lay aside his 
impression . . . and render a verdict based on the evidence," the juror can 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 In Murphy vs. Florida, a 1975 case, the court again found that qualified 
jurors need not be ignorant. The issue was whether the potential jurors' 
knowledge of the defendant's previous convictions made them ineligible. For 
juror prejudice to be found, the defendant must show the "actual existence" of 
an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's acceptance that jurors could be constitutionally impartial even if 
they had formulated opinions was underscored in the 1984 Patton vs. Yount 
decision. The defendant was convicted of rape and murder but his conviction was 
overturned when his confession was ruled invalid. A second trial also found 
Yount guilty. Eight of the 14 jurors impaneled said that they had at one time 
formed an opinion as to his guilt. It's hard to imagine a case in which bias 
could be more easily demonstrated. Yet the court ruled that "the relevant 
question is not whether the community remembers the case, but whether the 
jurors . . . could . . . judge impartially." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's rulings show that the standard for proving actual prejudice of 
jurors is extremely high. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are an active, vital part of the trial process. The Supreme Court has 
determined that for a potential juror to be considered impartial, he or she 
must be willing to listen to the evidence as offered at trial and then to 
assess the facts in light of common sense and experience. The linkage of 
impartial with unaware assumes that ideal jurors are ignorant. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the legal system benefits from juries composed of informed 
citizens.

U.S. COLLAPSES AGAINST SWEDEN; TENNIS: SAMPRAS DEFAULTS, MARTIN LOSES, SWEDES 
REACH DAVIS CUP FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson thought he was dealing with tennis' Dream 
Team II; the first incarnation had won the title in 1992. He discovered he was 
working with damaged goods, a team as heavily favored as it was heavily 
bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unraveling the team's trainers and doctors could not stem, the United 
States blew a 2-0 lead and lost to Sweden, 3-2. On Sunday, the world's No. 1 
player, Pete Sampras, defaulted to Stefan Edberg after one set because of a 
hamstring injury and it was left to Todd Martin to beat a player ranked 27 
places below him. He could not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, as it had here in 1984, upset the United States and won the Davis Cup 
semifinal. Sweden will play at Russia in the final Dec. 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only the third time in history that the U.S. team has lost after holding 
a 2-0 lead. The other losses came in 1960 and 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite astonishing coming back after being two matches down," Edberg 
said. "It's incredible. I was quite skeptical on Friday, but anything can 
happen, and this shows it." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States saw its 2-0 lead from Friday erode to 2-1 with Saturday's 
doubles loss. Its mandate on Sunday was to win one of the two singles matches. 
Disaster struck in the form of Sampras' hamstring injury and Edberg, who won 
the first set, 6-3, earned the point that evened the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, this week our guys have spent a lot more time in the trainer's 
room than the tennis court," Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assignment of playing the decisive Davis Cup match seemed not to faze 
Martin, who had been devastating in beating Edberg on Friday. Despite his 
various physical troubles -- knee, groin, etc. -- Martin, by any logic, was 
expected to beat Magnus Larsson. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the caprice of Davis Cup, where the No. 34 player in the world can 
dismantle the world's No. 6 and make a mockery of the rankings, which pale in 
the face of flag and country. Larsson clinched it with only minor difficulty, 
5-7, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 While defaults happen with some frequency on the tour, they are not common in 
Davis Cup. There have been only six defaults by Americans since Davis Cup began 
in 1900. Sunday's was the first default that has made a difference to the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous default involved Andre Agassi in the 1990 final against 
Australia. The United States had already clinched the title with a 3-0 lead 
going into the last day of singles. Agassi split sets with Darren Cahill, then 
announced he was injured. He was later heard to say he had faked the injury 
because he saw no reason to play a meaningless match. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Chang won the next match and the United States won the title, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, like Agassi and so many other of the top American players, chose not to 
play in the Davis Cup this year. Jim Courier had been a stalwart for the U.S. 
team all year, but he needed a break and was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, we look like we've got a lot of depth," Gullikson said. "But when 
players start filling their schedules, it gets pretty thin." 
</P>
<P>
 Had other Americans been available, Sampras might not have felt compelled to 
play here with such a glaring lack of fitness. U.S. Davis Cup physician George 
Fareed said the hamstring strain might have occurred during Friday's four-set 
match against Larsson. Fareed said the muscle, which he said was slightly torn, 
might take a month to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras was in good spirits after the match, even though his hope was dashed 
of ending the season on a high note after disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't lift my foot or bend the leg," he said, his foot propped up on a 
couch. "One thing after another. It feels like it's kind of been an interesting 
year. A great year but also very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' stomach has been wrecked by anti-inflammatory medication and it can't 
tolerate the drugs usually prescribed for muscle strains. Nevertheless, he was 
given ibuprofen, a mild anti-inflammatory, during the fifth-game changeover. It 
was more to make the trainers feel useful than something that would offer 
immediate help to Sampras. His leg was bandaged a few games later, but that 
only further restricted his movement. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment he walked on the court for warm-ups, it was clear that 
Sampras' ability to move was severely compromised. He limped rather than walked 
at the baseline and getting to the net consisted of a series of hop-skips. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg knew that it would have been acceptable for him to hit for the lines 
and run Sampras around, but he would have none of it. Perhaps Edberg, who 
defaulted out of the final of the 1990 Australian Open because of a pulled 
stomach muscle, had some empathy for Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the way you like to win," Edberg said. "I noticed in the first game 
that he wasn't going full speed on his first serve. After four or five games it 
was getting noticeable. He made it difficult for me to play the last games. 
What should I do? You could see that he was not moving. It was a matter of 
time, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Having placed his teammate in a pressure-filled position, Sampras sat glumly 
in the stands and watched Martin being taken apart by Larsson's pinpoint 
serving. The 24-year-old Swede had 16 aces and many more service winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 4,256 at the Scandinavium arena came to life late in the match, 
sensing impending victory. Body language told it all. Larsson walked briskly 
after points; Martin dragged, with his head down. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if nerves had played a role in his loss, Martin shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never nervous," Martin said. "I just purely got outplayed." 
</P>
<P>
 After the final point, Larsson leaped over the net and shook Martin's hand. 
The Swedish team went into a mass hug and began to jump up and down while 
cheers rained down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans packed their rackets and liniment and gauze and limped off into 
the night.

MONTANA, CHIEFS HAVE NOTHING ON RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: KANSAS CITY SUFFERS FIRST 
LOSS OF YEAR AND QUARTERBACK SUFFERS FIRST SHUTOUT OF CAREER, 16-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The miracle comeback had to be there all day in the minds of those watching 
and playing. Two touchdowns and a pair of two-point conversions, and shake down 
the thunder, though the odds be great or small, Joe will win over all. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of one more miracle finish for Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana, 
however, the Rams made him eat dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (2-2) not only handed Montana his first defeat in eight starts in 
Arrowhead Stadium, 16-0, before 78,184, but they also became the first NFL team 
to shut out a Montana-led team. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way did I think this game was over until Jerome (Bettis) got the last 
first down with less than two minutes to play," Ram cornerback Darryl Henley 
said. "I can't tell you how many times it's happened to me before up north (San 
Francisco) with Joe Montana doing his thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs had Montana, the momentum, a 3-0 record and a promise from Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer that if they did their duty and dispatched the Rams, they 
would have an additional day off in the upcoming bye week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, however, were also motivated. Coach Chuck Knox, advised of the bait 
being dangled before the Chiefs, pulled his team together, and announced: "Men, 
I want a level playing field: We win this game and you will not have to report 
back to work until Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 No contest. The Rams not only earned two paid holidays, but a measure of 
respect in defeating one of the AFC's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew Chuck Knox would come in and make the game shorter and close by 
controlling the ball," Schottenheimer said. "He did one better than that -- it 
wasn't even close." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs suffered their first shutout at home since being blanked by the 
Rams by the same score on Oct. 20, 1985. Montana was last shut out on Sept. 9, 
1978, in a 3-0 loss to Missouri while he was playing for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in here and the fans were calling us all kinds of names," safety 
Anthony Newman said. "You could tell the way the players for the Chiefs were 
lollygagging around in pregame warm-ups, laughing and all that, that they 
didn't have any respect for us. They had a bye coming up, figured they had the 
Rams and were in for a rest. They forgot one thing: They had to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs opened the game on offense with Montana, who required medical 
attention before the game for flu, directing the team with apparent ease. Once 
inside Ram territory, however, the Ram defense became irritated. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Fred Stokes began to harass Montana on almost every pass 
attempt, and as a result, the Chiefs were stuck at the Ram 34-yard line on 
fourth and 13. Instead of calling on a kicker, the Chiefs went for it, and a 
scrambling Montana was forced into throwing the ball short of his intended 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense took over, and Chris Chandler, starting in place of an injured 
Chris Miller, put his team in position for a 29-yard Tony Zendejas field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs' offense was forced to punt after gaining four yards on three 
plays, and the Rams took possession at their 28. Bettis was stopped for no gain 
on first down, and Chandler took aim at wide receiver Jessie Hester on second 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson, meanwhile, was also running a pass route in 
the same vicinity as Hester. Cornerback Dale Carter jammed Anderson and forced 
him out of bounds before tripping and falling to the turf. Anderson returned to 
the playing field as Chandler's pass was flicking off Hester's fingertips. 
Anderson caught the ball and ran untouched into the end zone for a 72-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We designed that play," Knox said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 10-0, Montana got the ball at his 22 and immediately came under pressure 
again from the Rams' defensive line. Montana tried to throw the ball away to 
avoid being sacked, but tossed it instead into the waiting arms of linebacker 
Roman Phifer at the Chiefs' 20. Five plays later, Zendejas kicked a 23-yard 
field goal, and the Rams, who were two-touchdown underdogs, had a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chiefs showed us no respect," said tight end Troy Drayton, who had three 
catches for 20 yards. "We had to gain our respect back. When you don't get 
respect, you're going to take it personal. Today we proved they are vulnerable 
just like every other team in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 A team directed by Montana, however, is supposed to be immune to such 
indignity. But on this day, the Chiefs actually had Steve Bono warming up on 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs advanced as far as the Rams' 29 in the second quarter, but once 
again went for it on fourth down rather than kick. On fourth and eight, Montana 
failed to connect with Willie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took over, moved to the Chiefs' two-yard line with nine seconds to 
play in the half and no timeouts remaining, and failed to score when running 
back Howard Griffith couldn't hold Chandler's pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was set for Montana's second-half comeback, but instead of scoring 
touchdowns, Montana finished the day having been intercepted three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real proud of our team," said Knox, who received a Gatorade dousing 
after the victory. "We came into a pressure situation, a stadium with 80,000 
people and all the noise and we made the big plays we needed to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler completed 13 of 21 passes for 207 yards and Bettis ran 35 times for 
132 yards, his third consecutive game of more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Chandler did a great job for us," cornerback Todd Lyght said. "He came 
in and ran the offense to perfection and never put the defense in bad position. 
Then he turned the game over to Jerome, who was just great." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght danced at midfield during the final seconds while pointing at the 
Chiefs' sideline. "I just wanted to let K.C. know who beat them," he said.

 Trivia time: Before Saturday, when was the last time UCLA was shut out by 
Washington State in football? 
</P>
<P>
 Old news: The notion that Chuck Roseberry, 46, of Kutztown University in 
Pennsylvania is the oldest player ever in college football has been disputed. 
</P>

 How about lunch?The Strathallan Hotel in Rochester, N.Y, is offering a special 
and expensive package for the 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill Country Club.  
</P>
<P>
 Rooms are $300 a night, with a seven-night minimum. However, the price 
includes breakfast and dinner daily, a bottle of champagne upon arrival, 
tickets for local museums and an art gallery, and a welcoming party.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a long waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Old timer: Miami safety C.J. Richardson on Washington Husky running back 
Napoleon Kaufman: "He's the best running back in the nation, and the best I've 
seen in college. And I've been in college five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations.

 Contingency plan: The 70,000-seat domed stadium in St. Louis is half finished 
and should be open in 1995. What happens if the Rams move to Baltimore instead? 
</P>

 The Red Sox have had 13 managers since 1953, and Pinky Higgins held the job 
twice.

 McCumber had a par on No. 18 and closed with a three-under-par 67 for a total

 "He got it in a place that was good for me and bad for Kenny," McCumber said 
of Perry's tee shot on the par-four 18th hole. The shot sailed left and 
disappeared over a slope, landing beside a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, it was match play," McCumber said. "I took advantage of one 
bad shot that Kenny hit. I drove to the right side, played an intelligent 
second shot to the middle of the green and then two-putted." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry had tied for the lead with a birdie at the 16th. He and McCumber matched 
pars on the 17th before Perry faltered with his poor tee shot on 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry couldn't get his second shot out of the rough, and his third shot went 
over the green. He finished with a bogey when his chip came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to give one away," Perry said. "You don't get in position to win too 
often. To play the last hole so poorly hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 McCumber's second shot on 18 landed in the center of the green and he was able 
to two-putt for the par that gave him the ninth PGA Tour victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry shot a 68 to finish at 266. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time defending champion David Frost and Mike Donald finished two strokes 
behind McCumber at the Oakwood Country Club, which was spared heavy rain for 
the first time in four days. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Isao Aoki birdied the 17th hole to win the rain-shortened $700,000 Brickyard 
Crossing Championship at Indianapolis by a stroke, his second consecutive 
victory on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki shot a five-under 67 for a two-round total of 11-under 133. The first 
round was rained out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wargo had a one-shot lead going to No. 17, but he three-putted the 
par-three hole after hitting his tee shot within 12 feet of the hole. Wargo and 
Jimmy Powell tied for second at 134. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell shot a record 30 on the back nine, including a hole in one on the 13th. 
</P>

 Vijay Singh of Fiji ended a daylong battle with Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez 
with birdies on the 16th and 17th holes for a one-shot victory in the Lancome 
Trophy tournament at Saint-Nom-La-Breteche, France.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What we have now is an overachieving 2-2 team and an underachieving 1-3 team. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thought the Rams would have a better record than the Raiders after 
four games deserves a pair of free season tickets next season in Baltimore or 
St. Louis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the salary cap and free agency, the Raiders were able to retain most 
of the talent that came within a touchdown of reaching the AFC title game last 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem might be that Coach Art Shell and much of his staff also were 
kept. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have been outcoached too often during the Shell reign that began 
on Oct. 9, 1989, and I am afraid that it happened again Sunday at the Coliseum. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers won on a field goal with two seconds remaining, but they couldn't 
have done it without some curious L.A. play-calling late in the first half. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you settle for a field-goal attempt and the chance to move within two 
touchdowns of the lead when you are trailing by 17 points, you have no 
timeouts, and it's fourth and three on the six with less than a minute 
remaining in the half? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If not, don't you throw the ball into the end zone? Instead, Harvey Williams 
attempted to run up the gut. He was stopped short of a first down, the Raiders' 
rushing total zoomed to 33 yards for the half, and the Chargers kept their 20-3 
advantage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shell's coaching rival, Bobby Ross, would be the one getting criticized if his 
fourth-down gamble that set up the winning field goal hadn't worked. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross' team appeared to be more fundamentally sound and better prepared 
than Shell's team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 While building their first-half lead, the Chargers weren't assessed a 
penalty.The Raiders were penalized six times for 65 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't the Raider brain trust have made some kind of adjustment on third 
downs when Stan Humphries kept completing passes to a wide-open Ronnie Harmon 
coming out of the backfield? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two of the toughest guys on the field were the quarterbacks, Humphries and 
Jeff Hostetler, both of whom climbed off the canvas in the fourth quarter. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the loudest ovations of the day at the Coliseum greeted the 
announcement of the Rams' 16-0 victory over Kansas City. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Both Raider and Charger fans cheered the news of the AFC West rival Chiefs' 
upset loss at home, the most improbable shutout of Chuck Knox's 22-year 
coaching career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If UCLA fans were going to boo Wayne Cook Saturday at the Rose Bowl, they 
shouldn't have stopped there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rest of the Bruins weren't any better than their quarterback 
during the 21-0 loss to Washington State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars looked confident, even cocky, from the start. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Bruins appeared to lack confidence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's what happens when your most dangerous weapon, J.J. Stokes, is not 
well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA set an NCAA record for consecutive games without being shut out, 245, 
from 1971-92. Its latest scoring streak ended at 19 games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bright spots for USC in a 37-27 victory over Baylor that could have 
been a lot more lopsided were the return of quarterback Rob Johnson to 1993 
form and the finest performance by a Trojan tailback, Shawn Walters, this 
decade. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was the best Saturday of the year for the Pacific-10 Conference. It won 
all three of its nonconference games and got the biggest upset of the day from 
Washington, which beat Miami at the Orange Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies ended the Hurricanes' NCAA record 58-game home winning streak 
despite the fact that tailback Napoleon Kaufman was held to 80 yards in 28 
carries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Bill Walsh sure knows how to get a team fired up -- the other 
team, that is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, our heavyweight champions are Oliver McCall and Michael Moorer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There usually is controversy when a Don King-promoted fighter wins a title, 
but referee Lupe Garcia did Lennox Lewis a favor by stopping the fight in the 
second round Saturday night and awarding McCall the World Boxing Council title. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was rubbery legged, dazed and leaning on the referee after being decked 
by a right hand. It was early in the round and he was saved from what could 
have been a devastating beating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Do you suppose Lewis' manager, Frank Maloney, and Riddick Bowe's manager, Rock 
Newman, regret not having signed for a heavyweight title unification bout a 
couple of years ago that would have brought both parties huge purses? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Perranoski got a bum deal from the Dodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski, who was fired Friday, was the most successful pitching coach in 
the National League over a 14-year period. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He should have been allowed to keep his job throughout Tom Lasorda's tenure as 
Dodger manager.

<P>
 We know you'd want the latest on the Cowboys, even if they didn't play Sunday, 
so here's a recap of recent events: 
</P>
<P>
 Before last Monday's game against the Lions, owner Jerry Jones, basking in the 
2-0 start, said this team was so good, he could coach it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys then lost to the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' old coach, Jimmy Johnson criticized Jones' new coach, Barry Switzer, 
for absenting himself to see his son play a college game the night before the 
Cowboys' second game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shocked me," Johnson said. "Not even showing up for the meetings. . . . 
A couple of players told me they better not be criticized for not focusing when 
their coach doesn't focus either. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the players said, 'What difference does it make? He doesn't do 
anything anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer coached Johnson and Jones on the Arkansas freshman team, but wasn't 
glad to hear from his old pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jimmy has told the world, told everybody that football is first for 
him and family wasn't a priority for him," Switzer said. "It's been documented. 
That's not my case. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I told my team and coaches prior to going to see my son play, if there was 
anything that I could do on Saturday night that would make a difference in the 
ballgame tomorrow, that I would be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' quarterback, Troy Aikman, said diplomatically that Johnson "has a lot 
of friends here," suggesting Johnson still enjoys some loyalty from his 
ex-players, so stay tuned. BUDDY, THE QB KILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan's defensive teams are famous for hunting quarterbacks and his 
Arizona offense is no slouch either. Three games into the season, the Cardinals 
have already tried Steve Beuerlein, Jim McMahon and Jay Schroeder and Buddy is 
casting around for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest prospect is Phil Simms, 38, the ex-Giant-turned ESPN commentator. 
Two weeks ago, Ryan said the Giants were a better team without Simms but 
apparently now feels the Cardinals would be better with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, Simms is interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting to see if they make me an offer I can't refuse," Simms said on 
ESPN's pregame show. "If they do, I'll play for the Arizona Cardinals." 
</P>
<P>
 If it doesn't work out, how about . . . . Marc Wilson? THAT DAN REEVES LOOKS 
BETTER ALL THE TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco players, including John Elway, who noisily welcomed easy-rider Wade 
Phillips when Coach Dan Reeves left, now see a death watch forming for their 
0-3 coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so such thing in my vocabulary as a vote of confidence," owner Pat 
Bowlen said. "We're 0-3. That's the sad part. We're going to get this thing 
turned around and get going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Bill Walsh, the hot rumor to replace Phillips, might be running 
out of friends on the college level after insulting most of his Pac-10 
colleagues. But Walsh insists privately that he would return to the NFL only as 
a quarterback coach or a consultant. PRIME TIME BY THE BAY: THAT'S 
ENTERTAINMENT? 
</P>
<P>
 People still wonder how the 49ers squeezed Deion Sanders under that rubberized 
salary cap of theirs. Sanders showed he's worth the effort, intercepting Jim 
Everett's pass and prancing 74 yards in a 24-13 victory over the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Several NFL owners, less than amused, are urging Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
to investigate the case, and especially to check out reports that Sanders took 
a smaller offer from the 49ers because Nike kicked in more than $1 million to 
get their star into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a farce," Saint owner Tom Benson said. "The New Orleans Saints live 
by the book and everyone else should live by the book. What kind of a Mickey 
Mouse organization are we running out there?" TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Broncos, help is on the way. It might not be enough, and 
it might be too late, but it's on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 At 0-3, the Bronco offense has been held back only by injuries and the 
improbability that quarterback John Elway has thrown three interceptions that 
were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 To shore up the defense, Denver signed Dennis Smith, who will start at safety. 
In addition, linebacker Mike Croel, cornerback Ben Smith and safety Rondell 
Jones should be able to play after an assortment of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's favorite receiver, Shannon Sharpe, will be back from his injury, and 
running back Rod Bernstine will also help take pressure off Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills beat the Houston Oilers, 15-7, last week despite not scoring a 
touchdown. Steve Christie made five field goals and the Bills' record improved 
to 2-1. The Bronco defense has a way of helping struggling offenses, so 
Christie probably won't get as many chances. The Broncos have given up an 
NFL-worst 110 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Thurman Thomas had his second consecutive 100-yard rushing game 
by gaining 112 against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Bruce Smith had four sacks against the Oilers and leads the AFC 
with 4 1/2. He had seven tackles in that game and linebacker Darryl Talley had 
eight. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk's touchdown run on Indianapolis' opening drive was the rookie's 
fourth rushing touchdown of the season and matched last year's total by the 
entire team. . . . Jim Harbaugh's 41-yard run to set up the first Indianapolis 
touchdown was the longest of his career and the longest by a Colt quarterback 
since George Taliaferro had a 50-yarder in 1953. . . . Punter Rohn Stark played 
in his 185th game for the Colts, third-highest in franchise history. David Lee 
is second on the list with 188 games and Johnny Unitas is first with 221. . . . 
The Detroit Lions (2-2) had at least shared the NFC Central Division lead after 
each of their last 19 games, but Sunday's 23-17 loss to New England dropped 
them to second place behind Minnesota (3-1). The 19-game run had been the 
longest current streak in the NFL. . . . Detroit's Barry Sanders scored his 
first touchdown in nearly a year. He last reached the end zone on Oct. 24, 
1993, with a five-yard run against the Rams. . . . Drew Bledsoe needs 10 yards 
to move into sixth place on New England's career passing list. . . . Detroit's 
Mel Gray moved into first place on the all-time kickoff return list. Gray's 
25-yard return in the fourth quarter gave him 276, one ahead of Ron Smith 
(1965-74). . . . Houston kicker Al Del Greco had two field goals and two extra 
points, giving him 291 career points and moving him past Ken Burrough (288) 
into seventh place on the Oilers' career scoring list. . . . San Diego center 
Courtney Hall sat out the game with the Raiders because of a torn left biceps 
tendon. It was the first game he has failed to start since joining the Chargers 
in 1989, snapping a streak of 83 consecutive starts. He was replaced by Curtis 
Whitley. . . . With Sunday's touchdown reception, former Raider Trey Junkin, a 
12-year veteran who plays mostly on special teams for Seattle, has 17 career 
catches, seven for touchdowns. . . . The Seattle game started two hours later 
than usual because the university had a freshman convocation at the stadium two 
hours before game time. . . . The 49ers have not yet been able to start the 
same five offensive linemen in consecutive weeks dating back to the first 
preseason game. . . . Chris Warren matched a Seattle record by scoring a 
touchdown in his seventh consecutive game. David Sims set the mark in 1978. . . 
. Eugene Robinson became the Seahawks' all-time leading tackler with 820 in 10 
seasons. The previous record was 813 by Keith Butler (1978-87). . . . 
Robinson's first interception of the season gave him 39 for his career, third 
on the Seahawks' career list behind Dave Brown (50) and John Harris (41). . . . 
Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell was intercepted four times in a game for 
the first time in his five-year, 44-game career. . . . Art Monk caught a 
six-yard pass in the second quarter, extending his streak of consecutive games 
with a reception to 168. The Jets' receiver is nine short of Steve Largent's 
record. . . . Monk also is fourth in career receiving yardage with 12,149. . . 
. The Bears were the only team in the league without a field goal until Kevin 
Butler made a 44-yarder late in the second period. . . . Johnny Johnson's 
90-yard run broke the Jets' record of 79 yards by Bill Mathis in 1965 against 
Houston. It was the second-longest run against the Bears, surpassed only by a 
97-yarder by Bobby Gage of Pittsburgh in 1949. . . . Boomer Esiason went over 
30,000 yards passing for his career with a third-quarter completion to Johnny 
Mitchell, and finished with 30,008. IN A GAME EAGERLY AWAITED BY ABSOLUTELY 
NOBODY . . .  
</P>
<P>
 David Klingler, a star at the University of Houston, came home with the 
winless Bengals to face the winless Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers won, 20-13. Houston quarterback Cody Carlson, who suffered a 
shoulder separation in the opener, broke his nose in the third quarter and 
completed 12 of 33 passes. And he was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler, the loser, was sacked seven times and intercepted three times. 
</P>
<P>
 'It was an ugly game," Klingler said. "We knew it would be going in." MAKING 
THE WORLD DOLPHIN-SAFE 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Dolphin Coach Don Shula claimed that Minnesota's defensive linemen 
go for quarterbacks' knees. Viking defensive coordinator Tony Dungy replied 
that Shula, chairman of the NFL's competition committee, should stop whining 
and write some new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday's game, Dungy and Shula chatted briefly and shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a private conversation," Dungy said. "We talked about some of the 
things that had been said and (decided) it's better off to just leave it alone. 
The game should be about what happened on the field -- two great teams and a 
lot of excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait til Shula sees the replay of running back Terry Kirby's injury, which 
occurred when Kirby was bent in two by a Viking defender. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT 
TALL GUY WHO USED TO THROW BACKING UP? 
</P>
<P>
 Things are starting to look tricky for former Ram quarterback Jim Everett, 
what with the Saints' once-potent rushing offense having suddenly become 
extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's loss at San Francisco, the Saints rushed for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett gained five on a scramble. Wide receiver Michael Haynes got 13 on a 
reverse. Punter Tommy Barnhardt gained 21, running after a high snap from 
center -- the Saints' longest rush of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Saint running backs combined for 10 yards in 16 carries. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Jet quarterback Boomer Esiason suffered a badly sprained left ankle and left 
the game after being sacked by the Bears' Albert Fontenot. . . . Kirby injured 
his right knee on an unsuccessful two-point conversion in the loss at 
Minnesota. "He's got ligament damage and it looks like he's going to be out for 
the year," Shula said. . . . Tampa Bay middle linebacker Hardy Nickerson was 
carried off the field after severely spraining his left ankle on the first play 
from scrimmage at Green Bay. X-rays were negative, but the Buccaneers said the 
injury will be re-evaluated when the swelling goes down. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Patriot cornerback Maurice Hurst on the Lions' Barry Sanders, who gained 131 
yards to give him 325 in two games: "He just can't be stopped. No matter what 
you do, he has a way to beat it. I really don't think one guy can bring him 
down in an open-field situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who threw six interceptions in his first 
two games and three touchdown passes Sunday against the Colts: "I'll take the 
blame for everything if I have to because I know I can handle it. I've been 
blamed for a lot of things in my career. I know how to shake things off and not 
let it take away from preparing for the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit defensive back Ryan McNeil, after winning at Dallas but before losing 
at home to the Patriots: "We may just have grown into a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever-intense Dolphin linebacker Brian Cox, asked about having been penalized 
15 yards for retaliating against a Viking player: "What the . . . . you think? 
What the . . . . you think? You think I like getting 15-yard penalties? If you 
do, you're out of your mind or you're dumb."

 "For all of you who are into discipline," said Coach George Seifert, "I'm 
fining Deion $100. I told him to start high-stepping at the 20 and he started 
at the 25. And I'm paying the fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Several NFL owners, less than amused, are urging Commissioner Paul Tagliabue 
to investigate the case, and especially to check out reports that Sanders took 
a smaller offer from the 49ers because Nike kicked in more than $1 million to 
get their star into the spotlight. TONIGHT'S GAME

 Denver at Buffalo

</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Broncos, help is on the way. It might not be enough, and 
it might be too late, but it's on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 At 0-3, the Bronco offense has been held back only by injuries and the 
improbability that quarterback John Elway has thrown three interceptions that 
were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 To shore up the defense, Denver signed Dennis Smith, who will start at safety. 
In addition, linebacker Mike Croel, cornerback Ben Smith and safety Rondell 
Jones should be able to play after an assortment of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's favorite receiver, Shannon Sharpe, will be back from his injury, and 
running back Rod Bernstine will also help take pressure off Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills beat the Houston Oilers, 15-7, last week despite not scoring a 
touchdown. Steve Christie made five field goals and the Bills' record improved 
to 2-1. The Bronco defense has a way of helping struggling offenses, so 
Christie probably won't get as many chances. The Broncos have given up an 
NFL-worst 110 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Thurman Thomas had his second consecutive 100-yard rushing game 
by gaining 112 against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Bruce Smith had four sacks against the Oilers and leads the AFC 
with 4 1/2. He had seven tackles in that game and linebacker Darryl Talley had 
eight. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Packer kicker Chris Jacke now holds the team record with 122 field goals, two 
more than Chester Marcol's old mark set during an eight-year career from 
1972-74 and 1975-80. Jacke is still far short of the NFL record, held by Jan 
Stenerud with 373. . . . A squirrel darted across the field near the line of 
scrimmage in the second quarter of the Tampa Bay-Green Bay game and took refuge 
behind the goal post. The critter ran up the tunnel when a police officer tried 
to catch him with a net, delighting the crowd of 58,551. . . . Marshall Faulk's 
touchdown run on Indianapolis' opening drive was the rookie's fourth rushing 
touchdown of the season and matched last year's total by the entire team. . . . 
Jim Harbaugh's 41-yard run to set up the first Indianapolis touchdown was the 
longest of his career and the longest by a Colts' quarterback since George 
Taliaferro had a 50-yarder in 1953. . . . Punter Rohn Stark played in his 185th 
game for the Colts, third-highest in franchise history. David Lee is second on 
the list with 188 games and Johnny Unitas is first with 221. . . . The Detroit 
Lions (2-2) had at least shared the NFC Central Division lead after each of 
their last 19 games, but Sunday's 23-17 loss to New England dropped them to 
second place behind Minnesota (3-1). The 19-game run had been the longest 
current streak in the NFL. . . . Detroit's Barry Sanders scored his first 
touchdown in nearly a year. He last reached the end zone on Oct. 24, 1993, with 
a five-yard run against the Rams. . . . Drew Bledsoe needs 10 yards to move 
into sixth place on New England's career passing list. . . . Detroit's Mel Gray 
moved into first place on the all-time kickoff return list. Gray's 25-yard 
return in the fourth quarter gave him 276, one ahead of Ron Smith (1965-74). . 
. . Houston kicker Al Del Greco had two field goals and two extra points, 
giving him 291 career points and moving him past Ken Burrough (288) into 
seventh place on the Oilers' career scoring list. . . . Chargers center 
Courtney Hall sat out the game with the Raiders because of a torn left biceps 
tendon. It was the first game he's failed to start since joining the Chargers 
in 1989, snapping a streak of 83 straight starts. He was replaced by Curtis 
Whitley. . . . With Sunday's touchdown reception, former Raider Trey Junkin, a 
12-year veteran who plays mostly on special teams for Seattle, has 17 career 
catches, seven for touchdowns. . . . The Seattle game started two hours later 
than usual because the university had a freshman convocation at the stadium two 
hours before game-time. . . . It was the 50th meeting between the Saints and 
49ers with San Francisco winning its fourth in a row at Candlestick Park. 
Overall, the 49ers lead the series 34-14-2. . . . The 49ers have not yet been 
able to start the same five offensive linemen in consecutive weeks dating back 
to the first preseason game. . . . Deion Sanders did more for San Francisco 
than return an interception for a touchdown in the final moments. He also led 
the team in tackles with seven and knocked down two passes. PINCH HIM, HE'S 
DREAMING 
</P>
<P>
 Hadn't he seen this somewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon, who watched his old Oiler teammates blow a 35-3 lead at Buffalo 
in the '93 playoffs, looked on in horror as his new Viking teammates coughed up 
a 28-0 lead over the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding it was time to take events in his own hands, Moon asked offensive 
coordinator Brian Billick to let him open up. "Let me do what I do best," said 
Moon later. "Let me throw the ball down the field. If I screw it up, I screw it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Unleashed, Moon led Minnesota on a 70-yard touchdown drive and the Vikings 
won, 38-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been thinking of that game in Buffalo? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Moon: "You're darn tootin'." MAKING THE WORLD DOLPHIN-SAFE 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Dolphin Coach Don Shula claimed that Minnesota's defensive linemen 
go for quarterbacks' knees. Viking defensive coordinator Tony Dungy replied 
that Shula, chairman of the NFL's competition committee, should stop whining 
and write some new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday's game, Dungy and Shula chatted briefly and shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a private conversation," Dungy said. "We talked about some of the 
things that had been said and (decided) it's better off to just leave it alone. 
The game should be about what happened on the field -- two great teams and a 
lot of excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait til Shula sees the replay of running back Terry Kirby's injury, which 
occurred when Kirby was bent in two by a Viking defender. FOR RAMS FANS AND THE 
REST OF THE EVERETT FAN CLUB... 
</P>
<P>
 Things are looking tricky for Jim Everett in New Orleans, what with the 
Saints' once-potent rushing offense having suddenly become extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's loss at San Francisco, the Saints rushed for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett gained five on a scramble. Wide receiver Michael Haynes got 13 on a 
reverse. Punter Tommy Barnhardt gained 21, running after a high snap from 
center -- the Saints' longest rush of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Saint running backs combined for 10 yards in 16 carries. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby injured his right knee on an unsuccessful two-point conversion in the 
loss at Minnesota. "He's got ligament damage and it looks like he's going to be 
out for the year," Shula said. . . . Tampa Bay middle linebacker Hardy 
Nickerson, was carried off the field after severely spraining his left ankle on 
the first play from scrimmage at Green Bay. X-rays were negative but the Bucs 
said the injury will be re-evaluated when the swelling goes down. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Brown quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who threw six interceptions in his first 
two games and three touchdown passes Sunday against the Colts: "I'll take the 
blame for everything if I have to because I know I can handle it. I've been 
blamed for a lot of things in my career. I know how to shake things off and not 
let it take away from preparing for the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit defensive back Ryan McNeil, after winning at Dallas but before losing 
at home to the Patriots: "We may just have grown into a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever-intense Dolphin linebacker Brian Cox, asked about having been penalized 
15 yards for retaliating against a Viking player: "What the . . . . you think? 
What the . . . . you think? You think I like getting 15-yard penalties? If you 
do, you're out of your mind or you're dumb."

VIKINGS WIN BATTLE OF QUARTERBACKS, 38-35; INTERCONFERENCE: MOON THROWS FOR 
THREE TOUCHDOWNS, OUTDUELING MIAMI'S MARINO, WHO LEADS TEAM BACK FROM 28-POINT 
DEFICIT.

 Enough. Warren Moon had seen enough. Enough Dan Marino. Enough record-setting 
comebacks against his team. Enough runs off tackle and short passes. Enough 
protecting the football. 
</P>
<P>
 So after watching his Minnesota Vikings blow a 28-0 lead to Marino and the 
Miami Dolphins on Sunday, Moon told offensive coordinator Brian Billick, "Let 
me do what I do best. Let me throw the ball down the field. If I screw it up, I 
screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't screw it up. Moon led Minnesota on a 70-yard touchdown drive that 
was capped by Scottie Graham's three-yard run with 7:25 to play and the Vikings 
held on for a 38-35 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, in his first season with the Vikings (3-1), helped the Houston Oilers 
take a 35-3 lead over the Buffalo Bills in the 1992 postseason. But Moon and 
the Oilers did nothing the rest of the game and Buffalo rallied for a 41-38 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Marino completed 29 of 54 passes for 431 yards -- the fifth-best total 
of his career -- and threatened to put Moon and the Vikings in the 
regular-season record book alongside the New Orleans Saints, who blew a 
28-point lead in losing, 38-35, to San Francisco in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Dolphins (3-1) made it 28-28 on Bernie Parmalee's 10-yard run 
with 10:34 left, Moon completed passes of 13 and 22 yards to Jake Reed, and 
Terry Allen had a 30-yard run before Graham scored the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought about the Buffalo collapse as he watched Miami rally, Moon 
said: "You're darn tootin'. But I also thought that this is where I have to 
rise and make a play and I went over to Brian and said, 'Let's just throw it 
down the field and let me be the guy to either make or break this thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew I had to raise my level. I put it more in my hands to throw the 
ball down the field and get something going. That's what I thought they brought 
me here for, to make big plays when it's time to make big plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon had his best game as a Viking -- 26 of 37 for 326 yards, including three 
touchdown passes to Cris Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins still had a chance to win, but Parmalee failed to handle the 
ensuing kickoff and Fuad Reveiz kicked a 38-yard field goal to make it 38-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami got the ball back once again and Keith Byars scored on a one-yard run 
with 1:04 remaining, but Chris Walsh recovered the onside kick to wrap up the 
victory. Air Marino 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino has passed for 400 or more yards 11 times in his career, the most 
in NFL history. Joe Montana is second on the list, with seven.

PRO FOOTBALL; LOSS TURNS LION KINGS INTO PAUPERS; INTERCONFERENCE: FOLLOWING 
BIG VICTORY OVER DALLAS, DETROIT LOSES TO NEW ENGLAND, 23-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Sanders couldn't do it all by himself, not even against the NFL's worst 
defense. Especially when that defense made two late interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a post-Monday night letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The New England Patriots defeated the Detroit Lions, 23-17, Sunday despite two 
vintage touchdown runs of 35 and 39 yards by Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we might have a shot today because I knew the difficult situation 
Detroit was in, coming off a big win on Monday night," Patriot Coach Bill 
Parcells said. "I've been in that situation before and I know how tough it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if we were sharp, we'd have a pretty good shot to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells was talking about last Monday night, when Sanders rushed 40 times for 
194 yards in the Lions' 20-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. The Lions 
arrived home late after the long flight back from Dallas and practiced poorly 
all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They outplayed us," Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes said. "It's a big-time league 
and you have to be up every week or you're going to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Bledsoe, who had passed for more than 300 yards in each of the Patriots' 
first three games -- making New England's offense the best in the league -- 
completed 21 of 33 for 251 yards against Detroit, including a seven-yard 
touchdown pass to Ben Coates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized the Lions might be down after their big win at Dallas," Bledsoe 
said. "But this is still a huge win for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders carried 18 times for 131 yards. Scott Mitchell was 14 of 29 for 189 
yards, but his two second-half interceptions thwarted the kind of comeback the 
Lions staged in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all sensed we weren't emotionally into the game as we should have 
been," Mitchell said. "But good teams find a way to win and play over that, and 
we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Detroit's mistakes -- a shanked punt by Greg Montgomery that traveled 
only 22 yards, one of Mitchell's interceptions and a bad guess by the coaching 
staff -- led to field goals by Matt Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit had a fourth and one at its own 38 on its first possession of the 
game, but the Lions elected not to punt and sent Mitchell on a quarterback 
sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 It failed, and the Patriots soon had a 3-0 lead on a 20-yard field goal by 
Bahr. His other field goals were from 28 and 21 yards.

PRO FOOTBALL; SANDERS' FINE PERFORMANCE CLINCHES WIN; NFC: 49ER CORNERBACK 
RETURNS INTERCEPTION 74 YARDS AND IS 'FINED' $100 FOR HIGH-STEPPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to Deion Sanders to get fined for prematurely breaking into his 
high-step routine in his starting debut for the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders returned an interception 74 yards for a touchdown with 32 seconds 
remaining, prancing the final 25 yards, as the 49ers overcame offensive 
problems to beat the New Orleans Saints, 24-13, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When he joined the 49ers nearly two weeks ago, Sanders promised he wouldn't 
high-step more than 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all of you who are into discipline, I'm fining Deion Sanders $100," 49er 
Coach George Seifert said. "I told him to start high-stepping at the 20 and he 
started at the 25. And I'm paying the fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Said 49ers fullback Marc Logan: "If he doesn't I will. At midfield, he just 
took off. That's why he's 'Prime Time.' He did it in a prime time in the game, 
right when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco was clinging to a four-point lead and Jim Everett was moving the 
Saints when Sanders stepped in front of Michael Haynes for the interception. He 
bolted down the right sideline, cut across midfield and was in the clear as he 
broke into his high-step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to catch the ball, and when I catch the ball I have an 
opportunity to do some things with it," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said quarterback Steve Young: "It was a fourth-down pass. He could have 
knocked it down and we would have won anyway. But it was fun watching him run 
it back. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a free agent who chose San Francisco over the Saints and several 
other teams, was making his starting debut at cornerback after playing in a 
reserve role against the Rams last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He took over at right corner for Merton Hanks, who shifted to free safety. 
That move paid dividends when Hanks thwarted another Saints drive with an 
end-zone interception with 1:54 left after Everett guided New Orleans to the 
San Francisco 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 49ers were very strong defensively, and with Deion out there, that makes 
them even better," Everett said. "They made the plays -- huge ones -- when they 
needed them. Hanks made a helluva play. You've got to give Deion credit for 
making a great play, but the pass wasn't where I wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, playing behind an injury-decimated offensive line, was sacked five 
times but managed two touchdown throws to Jerry Rice. Center Bart Oates was the 
only starter from San Francisco's opening-day line. Guards Derrick Deese and 
Chris Dalman and tackles Frank Pollack and Harry Boatswain all started in place 
of injured regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bedlam," Boatswain acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Buck's interception of Young stopped a fourth-quarter San Francisco 
drive, but New Orleans took over at its two and couldn't get a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Young finished with 247 yards, completing 25 of 39. Everett completed 31 of 55 
for 291 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventeen (offensive) points was so-so," Young said. "Obviously, we can play 
better. I think it's a critical challenge and I think we're handling it."

PRO FOOTBALL; FAVRE SHARP AS PACKERS WIN BATTLE OF THE BAYS; NFC: QUARTERBACK 
PASSES FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN 30-3 VICTORY OVER BUCCANEERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Not all the ex-Packers had a good time at Green Bay's annual homecoming game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre was 30 of 39 for 306 yards and three touchdowns and Chris Jacke 
kicked three field goals as Green Bay routed Tampa Bay, 30-3, Sunday, spoiling 
the return of ex-Packers Jackie Harris, Vince Workman and Charles Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty former Green Bay players, including four Hall of Famers and six who 
played on the 1944 championship team, were at Lambeau Field for the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 They got to see the Packers, who had scored 37 points all season, finally find 
their offensive touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was better," Green Bay Coach Mike Holmgren said. "It was important for 
our offense to get going. It was a hard week because we have such high 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacke's second field goal, a 20-yarder with 16 seconds left in the half, was 
his 121st, which breaks the team record. Chester Marcol, who was at the game, 
kicked 120 field goals in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacke's third field goal, a 23-yarder, with 6:58 left in the third quarter, 
made the score 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
 After Michael Husted's 24-yard field goal made it 16-3 later in the quarter, 
Favre threw touchdown passes of 20 yards to Ed West and three yards to Sterling 
Sharpe to finish the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's maybe the best I've felt since I've been here," Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who signed with Tampa Bay this summer after Green Bay declined to 
match a four-year, $7.63 million contract offer, caught only two passes for 48 
yards and none until the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Favre's touchdown pass to Harris' replacement, West, a 33-year-old tight end, 
gave Green Bay (2-2) a 23-3 lead with three seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I audibled with five seconds left on the play clock and everybody ran 
something different," Favre said. "It was a great wrong route by Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Cobb, who left Tampa Bay for a two-year, $2.2-million deal but hasn't 
been the answer to the Packers' anemic ground attack, rushed 12 times for 46 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Trent Dilfer, the sixth pick in the 1994 NFL draft, replaced Buccaneer 
starter Craig Erickson to start the fourth quarter after the veteran went seven 
of 20 for 123 yards with one interception and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer quickly guided Tampa Bay (1-3) 62 yards to the Green Bay one, but was 
stopped on third-and-goal and sacked by Bryce Paup on fourth down. Dilfer 
finished five of 10 for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not knocking Erickson, but you've got to get this guy in and see what he can 
do," said Buccaneer Coach Sam Wyche.

 The Atlanta Falcons proved two things Sunday: They can win at RFK Stadium, and 
they can win without a significant contribution from standout wide receiver 
Andre Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff George was 22 of 35 for 270 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Falcons 
to a 27-20 victory over the Redskins, their first victory at Washington in 11 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 1-0 in the new era," George said. "Everything else is in the past. It's 
all forgotten. We're moving forward now." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, who was leading the NFL with 29 receptions going into the game, caught 
four passes for 74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of looking for Rison, George found Terance Mathis nine times for 92 
yards and a touchdown, and Bert Emanuel for four catches and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (2-2) capitalized on two interceptions and a fumble by Redskin 
quarterback John Friesz to score 20 unanswered points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ugly game," said Atlanta Coach June Jones. "We didn't play well on 
offense, but we made the plays we needed to. We've played ugly and sputtered 
here and got beat. The bottom line is we won this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins (1-3) slowed Atlanta's run-and-shoot offense several times, 
notching six sacks and forcing seven punts, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The game changed early in the second half as Atlanta turned a 13-7 halftime 
deficit into a 27-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Redskins' offense sputtering, Turner benched Friesz in favor of Heath 
Shuler with 8:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie from Tennessee led Washington on a 50-yard drive that ended with a 
three-yard touchdown run by Ricky Ervins with 1:57 to play, making it 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington then forced Atlanta to punt, but their last chance ended when 
Shuler's Hail Mary pass was intercepted by Scott Case at the 10-yard line with 
one second left. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler was 10 of 16 for 93 yards, while Friesz was 17 of 29 for 230 yards with 
one touchdown and three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not disappointed I was pulled," Friesz said. "I'm disappointed I didn't 
play better and give us a chance to win. I need to do a better job of finding 
the tight end or getting the ball to the back quicker, so they will have more 
of a chance to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz hooked up with Henry Ellard on a 73-yard touchdown pass play that gave 
the Redskins their 13-7 halftime lead, but Atlanta scored on its second 
possession of the second half when Emanuel made a one-handed grab of a 31-yard 
pass.

PRO FOOTBALL; TESTAVERDE PICKS APART COLTS' DEFENSE, 21-14; AFC: CLEVELAND 
QUARTERBACK, CONFERENCE'S LOWEST RATED, THROWS FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS, INCLUDING 
TWO TO METCALF. 
</P>

<P>
 A porous Indianapolis pass defense was all Vinny Testaverde needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest-rated quarterback in the AFC, Testaverde threw for three 
touchdowns, including a 57-yarder to Eric Metcalf and a 65-yarder to Leroy 
Hoard, as the Cleveland Browns beat the Colts, 21-14, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have looked easy, but it's never easy when you're doing it," 
Testaverde said. "The execution through the week of practice always helps, and 
I think that was part of the reason why we were able to be as successful as we 
were today." 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde completed 16 of 28 passes for 266 yards and was sacked only once. 
He did it facing a Colt defense that was ranked 25th against the pass and 27th 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns (3-1) led, 14-7, at halftime after Metcalf's second touchdown 
reception, a 15-yarder late in the second quarter. Indianapolis (1-3) tied the 
game on a 13-yard touchdown catch by Roosevelt Potts in the third quarter, but 
the Browns needed only two plays for the go-ahead score early in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 An end-around run by Derrick Alexander gained 11 yards to the Cleveland 35, 
then Testaverde connected with Hoard, who sidestepped one tackler and ran 65 
yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest rush of the game was by the Colts' Jim Harbaugh, whose 41-yard 
gain in the first quarter was the second-longest by a quarterback in team 
history and set up the first Indianapolis touchdown. Harbaugh led the Colts 
with 63 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk, who came in as the AFC's leading rusher with 308 yards in 
three games, was held to 61 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Metcalf's 57-yard catch came on Cleveland's first possession. The Browns 
managed only one first down after that until late in the second quarter.

PRO FOOTBALL; SEAHAWKS STEAL IT FROM STEELERS; AFC: SEATTLE DEFENSE FOLLOWS 
PLAN AND GETS FOUR INTERCEPTIONS OFF O'DONNELL IN 30-13 VICTORY.

 Chris Warren rushed for 126 yards and a touchdown and Seattle intercepted Neil 
O'Donnell four times -- three in the fourth quarter -- in a 30-13 victory over 
Pittsburgh on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you run for 100 yards against a good, aggressive defense, it's 
satisfying," Warren said. "Eventually, if you pound away at a defense, they're 
going to get tired." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pittsburgh's two previous games, both victories, its defense allowed only 
five rushing first downs. Seattle had nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks' defense had a game plan too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pittsburgh's plan is to run right over you and then kill you with the short 
pass," Seattle safety Eugene Robinson said. "We knew if we kept their receivers 
in front of us, we'd get some picks." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson keyed a crucial goal-line stand early in the second half and also had 
one of Seattle's fourth-quarter interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell wasn't pleased with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my strong characteristics is making strong decisions," he said. "Today 
wasn't one of them. Overall, it was a frustrating day. It wasn't one of my 
better days." 
</P>
<P>
 On 26 carries, Warren had his eighth career 100-yard rushing game and second 
of the season to outperform the Steelers' Barry Foster, who got 96 yards in 21 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren scored on a three-yard run in the opening quarter and set up the 
Seahawks' second touchdown -- a one-yard Rick Mirer pass to Trey Junkin -- with 
a 28-yard run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 59,637 watched the Seahawks (3-1) play their second home game of 
the season at University of Washington's Husky Stadium because the Kingdome is 
undergoing a ceiling and roof repair job. 
</P>
<P>
 The game started two hours later than usual because the university had a 
freshman convocation at the stadium two hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie cornerback Orlando Watters, starting his first game in place of injured 
Patrick Hunter, ran back an interception 35 yards for Seattle's third touchdown 
with 4:15 to play, making it 27-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's John Kasay kicked field goals of 31, 40 and 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell got Pittsburgh (2-2) its touchdown with a 36-yard pass to Charles 
Johnson with 3:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers lost despite a 452-297 advantage in total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell completed 21 of 43 passes for 282 yards. Seattle's Rick Mirer was 14 
of 24 for 166 yards and a touchdown with one interception.

PRO FOOTBALL; THIS HOMECOMING NOT A FUN ONE FOR KLINGLER; AFC: CINCINNATI 
QUARTERBACK HAS TOUGH TIME IN RETURN TO HOUSTON; OILERS WIN, 20-13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston defense sacked David Klingler seven times and intercepted three of 
his passes as the Oilers defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-13, Sunday for 
their first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler, who grew up in Houston and played at the University of Houston, and 
the Bengals dropped to 0-4.The Oilers (1-3) have won 10 in a row against 
Cincinnati at the Astrodome since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad performance for me, especially coming home, but we'll work it 
out," Klingler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Brown scored two touchdowns for Houston. The Oilers' offense, however, 
continued to struggle even with the return of starting quarterback Cody 
Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson looked shaky in his first game since sustaining a second-degree 
shoulder separation in the season opener. His timing was clearly off as he 
completed only 12 of 33 passes for 211 yards. He was sacked three times, twice 
by end Alfred Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson suffered a broken nose in the third quarter and was taken to a 
hospital after the game for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler completed 10 of 30 passes for 112 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals rallied with a 21-yard field goal by Doug Pelfrey midway through 
the third quarter and Corey Sawyer's 82-yard punt return for a touchdown three 
minutes into the fourth quarter. Pelfrey added a 49-yard field goal with 6:45 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati fought right down to the final second. Klingler completed a 27-yard 
pass to Darnay Scott to midfield but defensive tackle Ray Childress 
administered the final sack to kill the Bengals' final effort.

 O'Donnell completed 21 of 43 passes for 282 yards. Seattle's Rick Mirer was 
14-for-24 for 166 yards and a touchdown with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 In what proved to be the most critical series of the day, Pittsburgh took the 
opening second-half kickoff and drove 68 yards in 13 plays -- one yard short of 
a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers had first-and-goal at the Seattle 2 but could get only one yard. 
On fourth-and-one, Foster was stopped by Robinson's solo tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawks punter Rick Tuten was a big factor in his team's win. With 4:26 gone 
in the fourth quarter, he pinned the Steelers back on their own 3 with a 
58-yard punt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks led 20-6 at halftime as the Seattle defense limited the Steelers 
to field goal by Gary Anderson from 31 and 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A 45-yard pass from Mirer to Brian Blades, Seattle's longest play of the 
season, highlighted the Seahawks' first touchdown drive that went 61 yards in 
six plays. That gave Seattle the ball on the Pittsburgh 6 and Warren scored on 
his three-yard run with 2:38 gone.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; WHAT IN THE WORLD IS BORA DOING NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The European media spent much energy looking into Bora Milutinovic's recent 
flirtation as a potential coach for AC Monaco, which plays in the French first 
division. That's because they don't know Bora. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic is one of the most noncommittal coaches to stand in front of a 
chalkboard. He signed to coach the U.S. team to the World Cup, but that 
contract did little to anchor him to the country. In the summer of 1993 there 
were rumors that Milutinovic would leave to become the national coach of a 
South American team. Far from categorically denying them, Milutinovic smiled 
coyly and said something to the effect that he works for Mr. Alan and he loves 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all for the benefit of Mr. Alan that these rumors start. Mr. Alan 
Rothenberg is Milutinovic's boss and, more to the point, pays his salary. When 
asked what his plans were after the World Cup, Milutinovic said he always has 
his bags packed, he's a coach. This is the life. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Milutinovic managed to say that his future was tied to Mr. Alan 
and if Rothenberg won reelection as president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, 
then he'd stick around. Rothenberg won, and still Milutinovic's name is floated 
for coaching openings around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even given Milutinovic's reputation as a successful coach of national teams 
and the U.S. team's surprising performance in the World Cup, it's strange that 
the soccer world doesn't view Milutinovic as a coach working and looking to 
stay in the United States, because he's still under contract until the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most, Milutinovic would like to be paid more money. To gain leverage with 
his boss, Milutinovic must demonstrate that he's a sought-after talent who 
might leave at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The more Milutinovic's name is out there, the more gilded his reputation 
becomes, the higher his salary will become. On this, Milutinovic is not 
wishy-washy. And in this regard, he has taken on true American characteristics. 
As he might say -- My friend, this is the life. 
</P>
<P>

 While goalkeeper Brad Friedel continues to get the runaround regarding his 
work permit in England, Cobi Jones, at least, got into his first game in the 
English Premier League last week. 
</P>
<P>
 His team, Coventry City, beat Leeds United in Jones' debut. It was also 
Coventry's first victory of the season. Jones was responsible for one of 
Coventry's goals when he was pulled down for a penalty kick after making a 
swift run and eluding a handful of defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jones' role was only grudgingly acknowledged. The Observer's account 
of the game referred to Jones as "the little U.S. player." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the English Football Assn. to eliminate shootouts in some 
lower division matches should be cheered by anyone who remembers the World Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the experimental system that will be used in November, if the game is 
tied after 90 minutes, one player from each team is removed every five minutes 
for the next 20 minutes, until there are seven players per side. 
</P>
<P>
 If the game is still tied, another 10 minutes of sudden death are played. 
Officials haven't figured out what to do if neither team scores after that, but 
the fact that soccer's staid officials are tinkering with ways to make the game 
more fan-friendly is a welcome development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The French have presented the logo of the 1998 World Cup -- a soccer 
ball/globe representing a sunrise. World Cup organizers always treat the 
unveiling of the logo as a landmark event. What it does is signal the beginning 
of the merchandising stampede. It also allows sponsors to get the logo on those 
soda cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing to come out of the news conference was a remark by FIFA 
official Guermillo Canedo. In light of the fact that France failed to qualify 
for the 1994 World Cup and considering France is host of the next one, Canedo 
remarked that while he liked the logo, "We don't know yet if the French team 
will be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in France, after two unusual incidents of violence recently, club 
officials say they will start bringing legal action against fans who cause 
trouble at matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Louis Levreau, vice president of Marseilles, needed stitches after 
suffering a gash in his cheek, caused by a fan who threw a stone after a match 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to sue," Levreau said. "This is not football, this is war." 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, the goalkeeper for Lens was punched and knocked down by a 
fan who rushed on the field at Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 The French are accustomed to relative tranquillity on the field -- if not off 
-- and have a low tolerance for mischief. The threats of lawsuits should signal 
that club officials are serious. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Soccer might be becoming too much of a good thing in Italy. A group 
representing 4,000 Rome restaurant owners has asked the Italian prime minister 
to intervene in a situation that, last week, allowed Roman soccer fans to watch 
a live match every night of the week except Monday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant owners complain that televised matches keep their potential 
clients at home, in front of the TV. During the middle of the week the various 
European club and national competitions are televised and Italian league games 
are shown on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the players are beginning to complain. Roberto Baggio noted that with so 
much soccer on television, fans will stop attending games. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant owners have a point, but there's one problem with their plea to 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi: Berlusconi owns the country's biggest team, 
AC Milan, and a television channel that broadcasts European soccer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Germany and South Africa would like to play host to the 2006 World Cup finals. 
The countries offer sound and similar arguments for their candidacy: 
politically reunited nations that can boast strong fan support for soccer. 
Germany has the advantage of a superior infrastructure and organization, in 
addition to well-placed officials within FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa also has large, modern stadiums. Its advantage is FIFA would like 
the symbolism of placing the World Cup in South Africa -- soccer as a means for 
peoples of the world to come together in peace -- and, like the United States, 
Africa is a vast and still-untapped resource for soccer talent and future 
revenues. Like the United States, however, South Africa's sprawling size might 
work against its bid as will nagging doubts about its political stability. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, when the bids are awarded, much can change.

FAIRPLEX; CONFIDENCE PAYS OFF FOR BOOTH

 Trainer Jan Booth had to weigh some options before deciding to enter Seahawk 
Gold in any race at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old gelding had shown a fondness for the track, winning the 
Fairplex Breeders' Cup Stakes as a 2-year old in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had also had been injured in a 12-horse race on the short track last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawk Gold's form was the decisive factor. Although he hadn't won a race in 
more than a year, he had been running against some of the top horses in the 
nation and Booth decided it was time to drop him a notch in class and give him 
a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be the right move as Seahawk Gold, under a patient ride by G.F. 
Almeida, stalked the early leaders, Marmoe and Dusty Screen, took the lead at 
the top of the stretch and pulled away to beat Gogarty by 4 1/2 lengths in 
winning the $50,000 C.B. Afflerbaugh Stakes on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty Screen, ridden by Fernando Valenzuela, faded to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Marmoe, a Cal-bred sprinter ridden by the meeting's leading rider, David 
Flores, used up too much energy when challenged for the lead by Dusty Screen. 
Marmoe held off Recommendation to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just following instructions," Almeida said of his winning ride. "He 
(Booth) told me to stay close, don't lose too much ground, and make my move at 
the three-eighths pole. When I asked him, the horse responded beautifully. I 
never used the horse. All I had to do was let him go, and this horse just 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite not having won this year, Seahawk Gold had the sharpest form of any of 
the six horses in the 1 1/16-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran third to Journalism in the San Francisco Handicap on the Bay Meadows 
turf course on Sept. 5. He has also run well against Region and Tinners Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always gives us an honest effort," Booth said. "When we decided to come 
here, we just wanted to pick the right spot. We were tired of hooking up with 
the lions." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth was extremely confident going into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best horse I have, by far, and he has been running and training 
well. He was ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, who has a nine-horse stable at Hollywood Park, plans to run Seahawk 
Gold next at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 When the first post time was moved from 2 p.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, it 
proved to be a moderate success as a meet record 9,190 turned out at Fairplex 
Park. The total attendance, which includes the satellite locations, was also a 
record -- 22,723. . . . Awe Shucks, ridden by Roxanne Losey, won the $7,500 
Pomona Arabian Invitational Handicap, a seven-furlong race for Arabians that 
turned into a four-horse race when morning-line favorite T C Tomtyr was 
scratched. Steve Valdez, who was suspended for careless riding during the first 
week of the meeting, will return today. He is still the leading rider in mixed 
breeds with four victories.

THEATER REVIEW; THERE'S LIFE IN THIS 'ROOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What the Old Masters understood about suffering, wrote W.H. Auden, is "how it 
takes place while someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking 
dully along." In "Marvin's Room," Scott McPherson's 1990 play now at the 
Tiffany Theater, it takes place at a bench in Disney World, with only a person 
in a cartoon-gopher suit to wave for help. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson died at age 32, soon after his play opened to acclaim at New York's 
Playwrights Horizons. The playwright seems to have had a preternatural 
understanding of what he would need to know in this life. "Marvin's Room" 
centers on Bessie (Mary Steenburgen), a woman who has devoted most of her adult 
life to caring for her sick father Marvin and dotty aunt Ruth (Jane Cecil). 
McPherson penned this black comedy before he met his lover, Daniel Sotomayer, 
whom he nursed until Sotomayer's death from AIDS, and before he himself was 
sick with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson understood, for instance, the absurdist humor he would need to face 
the horror of a doctor who discusses an incurable illness with the sensitivity 
of a mechanic telling you to junk the car. When we first encounter Bessie, she 
is having blood taken, bravely smiling while Doctor Wally (Tim Monsion) forgets 
her name and then drops the information that the nurse quit because of a 
"deep-seated phobia about cockroaches." 
</P>
<P>
 In Steenburgen's touching performance, we understand immediately that beyond 
Bessie forced smile, she lives in an almost constant state of grace, taking 
care of two elderly dependents without any bitterness, dealing with her own 
impending death without despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Bessie's estranged sister Lee (Jean Smart), however, has a harder time with 
grace. Unlike Bessie, Lee is the recipient of charity -- she has been taken in 
by nuns. Smart is vibrant and funny as the confused, brassy blonde single mom 
struggling to be civil to one son, Hank (Cad Cox, looking a little like the 
young, very intense Orson Welles), on leave from a mental institution, and 
another, Charlie (Jonathan Charles Kaplan), who's so internalized that he reads 
Isaac Asimov at Disney World. Lee's idea of positive reinforcement is to greet 
Hank's news that "they're not strapping me down anymore" with "well, don't 
abuse that privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bessie finds that she needs a bone marrow transplant, Lee hauls her sons 
down to Bessie's Florida home, perhaps to atone for the guilt of a sibling who 
has let her sister single-handedly care for an aging father. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching these people nervously reunite, and grow from a group portrait of 
guilt to a true family, a theatergoer will begin to understand the metaphorical 
place that McPherson called "Marvin's Room." Literally, Marvin's room is at the 
back of the stage, behind a glass so thickly beveled that we can barely see 
what goes on there. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the room where Bessie gives her father his pills, changes his diapers 
and where the man makes wonderful cooing sounds when Ruth waves a compact 
mirror that catches the light and sends it dancing off the glass. This is the 
place of dying, but also the place where people learn what it means to give 
love with no thought of gain. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson, obviously, was quite young when he died and was not yet a fully 
formed dramatist. Although she can be tough, Bessie's selflessness borders on 
the saccharine because she really never veers from it or shows any desire other 
than to be of help to others. Dennis Erdman's direction of the play is a lower 
key, more naturalistic one than the simpler, bolder tone that David Petrarca 
took when he directed the play in Chicago (where it originated), Hartford and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Erdman's direction unfortunately sometimes emphasizes the play's one main 
fault: that Bessie is not really a person so much as she is an ideal, a kind of 
perfect fantasy for the dying. Steenburgen delivers Bessie's epiphany, in which 
she defines her life as the sum of the love she has felt for other people, 
straight out to the audience in a dead-on way that underlines the importance of 
what is obviously Bessie's big speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smart's less sentimental role is delivered beautifully, with perfect comic 
timing in both her bottled hysteria at dealing with her son's behavioral 
problems and her struggle to absorb her sister's grace in facing the 
responsibilities of true adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, "Marvin's Room" raises one of the great mysteries of black 
comedy. Why do we laugh at Jean Smart's horrified expression after she takes a 
peek at her decaying, urine-soaked father or when we hear Marvin's 
uncomprehending moans when he thinks he's hallucinating when he sees his two 
grandsons. One reason is because McPherson perfectly sets up the jokes, but the 
more important reason we laugh is because we can. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he never got the chance to be an Old Master, Scott McPherson did live 
to create a room, mysterious behind thick glass, for the very sick and also a 
place for the very lucky. "Marvin's Room" is a theatrical landscape where 
people come together and amaze each other with bright lights for a while before 
the inevitable.

 'Timecop' on Top: It's "Timecop" time again. The Universal release starring 
Jean-Claude Van Damme was the No. 1 movie at the nation's box office for the 
second weekend in a row. The film grossed $8.2 million, according to early 
industry estimates. "Timecop's" action movie competition, Hollywood Pictures' 
"Terminal Velocity," opened in second place with $5.5 million. In third, 
Paramount's "Forrest Gump" took in $5.4 million, bringing its cumulative 
earnings to $263.6 million. "Gump" has passed "Jaws" to become the seventh 
all-time highest grossing film in the United States. Hollywood Pictures' "Quiz 
Show," still in limited release, with $3 million, took fourth place. In fifth 
was Paramount's "Clear and Present Danger," with $2.7 million. Columbia and 
Castle Rock's "The Shawshank Redemption" had a very strong opening in limited 
release. The movie, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, took in $750,000 
on 33 screens for a per-screen average of $22,727. 
</P>
<P>
 'True' Controversy: The Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "True Lies" opened in 
Indonesia last week, and Muslim leaders there aren't happy about it. The 
leaders asked the government to ban the movie, which they say insults Islam. 
The Council of Muslim Scholars said in a statement that the film, about an Arab 
terrorist leader and an American secret agent, has raised unrest in the Muslim 
community. About 90% of Indonesia's 190 million people are Muslims. The film 
also drew criticism from American Arab groups when it opened in the U.S. during 
the summer.

 Rare Find: A rare color movie starring martial-arts legend Bruce Lee has been 
discovered by the Hong Kong Film Archive after gathering 30 years of dust on a 
British shelf. There are many black-and-white copies of "The Orphan," the 1960 
drama believed to be Bruce Lee's last Cantonese movie before he moved to the 
United States, but no known color copies existed. The archive, which found the 
movie in excellent condition at the Rank Film Laboratory in London, said it 
wants to have the film copied for public showings. TELEVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey and the Lawsuit: Steve Harvey, a star of ABC's new sitcom "Me and the 
Boys," has sued two Texas residents for allegedly defaming him in a letter sent 
to ABC entertainment executives. The Los Angeles Superior Court complaint 
alleges that David N. Lumpkins and Donna R. Kyser wrote a letter stating that 
the actor "scammed investors" and "suckered hard-working residents" in Texas 
before launching his career in Hollywood. Harvey is seeking an injunction 
barring the plaintiffs from making defamatory statements about him. Harvey's 
attorney declined to comment on the background of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedically Able: Black, female and gay performers have all had their own TV 
comedy specials, but KCET will offer a new spin on Nov. 28 with disabled 
comedians in "Look Who's Laughing." Kathy Buckley is hearing-impaired, Brett 
Leake has muscular dystrophy, Alex Valdez is blind, J.D. England uses a 
wheelchair and Chris Fonseca and Geri Jewell have cerebral palsy. In the 
one-hour special, these six working comedians will share their humor and 
personal experiences to help viewers better understand the 40 million disabled 
people in America. AUCTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon on the Block: Christie's auction house says it has the genuine Maltese 
Falcon -- really -- and will put it up for sale Dec. 6. In May, 1993, 
Christie's announced it had the genuine movie prop for sale, then had to pull 
it back when its authenticity was challenged. In the 1941 movie "The Maltese 
Falcon," Sydney Greenstreet tells private eye Humphrey Bogart that there was no 
limit to the value of the falcon they sought. But Christie's estimates that the 
lead falcon, one of two made for the film, will fetch $30,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nureyev's Collection: Old Master paintings, furniture, prints and sculptures 
from Rudolf Nureyev's New York City apartment will by sold by Christie's on 
Jan. 12-13. The eclectic collection should bring in $3 million to $4.5 million. 
It was kept in the landmark Dakota building, where John Lennon was shot. 
Proceeds from the auction will benefit the Rudolf Nureyev Dance Foundation. 
Nureyev died in January, 1993, of complications from AIDS. STAGE 
</P>
<P>
 'Quiz Show' on Stage: The hype surrounding the Robert Redford movie "Quiz 
Show" hasn't upset plans for a play about the same subject -- the TV quiz show 
scandals of the 1950s. "Night and Her Stars," which opened at South Coast 
Repertory last spring, is scheduled to open in a Manhattan Theatre Club 
production in New York on April 19. Playwright Richard Greenberg said he won't 
see the movie until after his play opens in New York, but "with any luck," the 
movie "will arouse interest in the story." POP/ROCK

 Saturday in the Park With Fleetwood Mac: Classic rock station KLSX-FM (97.1) 
will present a day of free music featuring Fleetwood Mac and former Byrds lead 
singer Roger McGuinn at Woodley Park in Van Nuys on Oct. 15 from 1 to 4 p.m.

MUSIC REVIEW; CAMERATA'S A BIT FRUSTRATING BUT NEVER BORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music Director Ami Porat led the Mozart Camerata in performances bursting with 
well-conveyed, decisive conceptions Saturday night at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. In the hands of his able group, these ideas sometimes took crystalline 
shape, and other times remained rough-hued. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, as in Mendelssohn's "Hebrides" Overture, the orchestra achieved 
an urgent poeticism. There was little of the potential foreboding here, yet 
much power and even poignancy, particularly in the lower strings' luxurious 
melody. Clarinetists Caroline Tobin and Helen Good lent thoughtful somberness 
to their solos. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading of the closing movement of Mozart's "Paris" Symphony -- for which 
Porat demanded a very fast Allegro -- also showed the Camerata at its best, 
capable of crisp articulation and apt voicing, while maintaining an aura of 
good-natured excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 While this season's opening concert never bored, it did sometimes frustrate. 
Much of the dramatic punch of the Allegro assai in the symphony, dissipated in 
a patina of legato, when greater definition and judicious use of accent was 
warranted. Moreover, further attention to balance would have created more 
involving dialogue between string sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Porat featured Yuli Turovsky during half of the program. The cellist -- a 
former member of the Borodin Trio and founder of I Musici de Montreal -- 
brought intensity and point to his work, despite occasional technical slips. As 
protagonist in Gaspar Cassado's arrangement of Mozart's Third Horn Concerto, K. 
447 (here edited by Porat), Turovsky brought impressive virtuosity and ardor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even these qualities, however, could not keep this listener from yearning for 
the timbral colors -- which, on French horn, differ so markedly according to 
register -- and contrasts that Mozart exploits in the original version.

COUNTERPUNCH: EXECS LOVE THE SHOW, BUT IT SKEWS TOO OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GILBERT and BERNI GOULD, Alan Gilbert was producer-writer of Let's Make 
a Deal and Berni Gould was head writer. Both men have extensive lists of 
credits in television game shows. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our personal experience underlines the truth of Howard Rosenberg's statement: 
"Despite an estimated 30 million Americans being over the age of 65, you 
sometimes get the impression from its programs and commercials that TV is 
almost exclusively youth oriented" ("That's Not Gray in Tom Snyder's Hair, It's 
Steel," Calendar, Aug. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 As longtime producers and writers of major network game shows, we created a 
musical game show for those 50 and above. We pitched it to major production 
companies -- none of them cared to see a run-through. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't interested in any shows, they told us, that skewed older than 45. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we pitched it to a major syndicator, and did a run-through for them. After 
the run-through a mole in the office gave us a report. Everybody on the 
syndicator's staff, including the president, rated the show A+: It entertained 
and strongly involved the audience and could be produced at a reasonable price. 
In fact, our mole told us, they all thought it was a terrific show. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just one problem. The head salesman said he couldn't give the show 
away. It skewed too old. After all, who cares about Cole Porter, George 
Gershwin or Irving Berlin and all those other dead guys? 
</P>
<P>
 (Note: When PBS stations need money, they always feature legendary stars 
singing the legendary songs of these and other legendary song writers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster Rosenberg's statement, here's a quote from a 1989 L.A. Times book 
review of "Age Wave" by Ken Dychtwald and Joe Flower: 
</P>
<P>
 "The 60 million Americans over 50 -- one-fourth of the total U.S. population 
-- (are) the most powerful and affluent consumer group in American history. 
(They) currently have a combined personal income of over $800 billion and 
control 70% of the total net worth of U.S. households -- nearly $7 trillion of 
wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 By the way . . . the show is still available.

COUNTERPUNCH: HOLLYWOOD AND ITS DEAD MOMMY SYNDROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA WEBBER, Virginia Webber is the mother of two young children. She 
lives in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mommies are dropping like flies in Hollywood these days. First it was just 
Disney's plucky characters who were drawn motherless. All the classic cartoon 
ingenues -- Snow White, Cinderella, Ariel, Belle and Jasmin -- are motherless. 
The same goes for Peter Pan, Pinocchio, Mowgli and Bambi. Simba, the young Lion 
King, joins Dumbo and Sleeping Beauty in being functionally orphaned by a 
mother who is largely absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead and absent mommies are not just the purview of animated features. 
These days, the newest story-line stooge, on big screen and small, is the 
perfect mommy, whose preternatural funeral sets the story in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The moms are nudged off screen with a virtual medical manual of deadly 
maladies. "A" is for the aneurysm that felled the mommy in last season's "To My 
Daughter With Love," tragically leaving Rick Schroeder's character wifeless and 
his TV daughter motherless. "C" is for the cancer that widowed Tom Hanks' 
character in the hit movie "Sleepless in Seattle," causing him to be, 
touchingly, both mother and father to his young son and to endear himself to 
the lovely Meg Ryan. "H" is for the heart attack that did in the 38-year-old 
wife of James Woods' character in the highly rated CBS movie, "Jane's House," 
leaving him to sensitively struggle with his two motherless children and make 
engagingly shy advances toward Anne Archer's character. (We're nearly half-way 
through the alphabet. Look for an out-of-the-blue case of Legionnaire's disease 
to knock off some future on-screen mom.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way they could know it was going to happen," Rick Schroeder's 
character says to his daughter about her mommy's untimely death. Well, 
actually, there were a couple of ways to suspect that her days, and the days of 
the other mommies, were numbered. These women were all just too perfect for 
this life. These were not mommies for the long haul. Type-A perfection will 
finish off a mother faster than any other disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a coincidence that Roseanne and Grace, the most smart-mouthed of the 
on-screen moms, are also the most physically robust. These imperfect mothers 
will survive to see their prime-time grandchildren, unlike Schroeder's TV wife 
who didn't even make it to her daughter's 6th birthday. I myself knew she was 
at risk the moment I saw her in her impossibly tiny jeans, designing her own 
dream house, and hesitating to take money from her parents. She was wise and 
empathetic when her husband came grousing in at 1:30 in the morning after 
bowling with the guys on a work night. She had gorgeous waist-length dark hair 
and clear blue eyes, and she was dead as a doornail before the first commercial 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 The mommy in "Sleepless in Seattle" was not only a flawless apple peeler, but 
she also, the little motherless Jonah tells us, "never yelled at me." This is 
astonishing. The mother of a 7-year-old boy, a boy who is the type to fly to 
New York City without permission, "never" yelled at him. This, in my book, 
moves "Sleepless" right off the Romantic Comedy shelf and across the video 
store to the Fantasy/SciFi section. And the Tom Hanks character says, just to 
complete the portrait of the Mommy Who Never Yelled, "she always made 
everything beautiful" at Christmas. The patience of Job and the nesting 
artistry of Martha Stewart. And, it goes without saying, when she appears to 
Hanks in a melancholy vision, she is a radiant angel, and not just due to her 
otherworldly circumstances, but mostly due to her exceeding perfection of face 
and form. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When James Woods' character gazes at the photo of his departed wife in last 
season's "Jane's House," she is also luminous. Woods' TV wife probably had the 
most advanced case of the deadly Perfect Mommy syndrome. This mommy kept a 
schedule to ensure that, as long as she was alive, she never duplicated her 
children's sack lunch entrees. They got something different every single day. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, no wonder these women are dead. Those of us left standing -- the 
yellers, the slobs, the imperfect peanut butter-and-jelly-sandwich-every 
day-of-your-life mommies -- could teach them a thing or two about surviving the 
Darwinian demands of real motherhood. If you waste all your strength dieting 
down to a size 2 and devising different menus for sack lunches, of course you 
are not going to have anything left to fight off those chest pains and 
headaches with when they come. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend shows no sign of letting up. More recently, Whoopi Goldberg's spunky 
Corrina says, "Well, nobody's perfect," of Ray Liotta's dead wife in "Corrina, 
Corrina." Don't you believe it. She was a '50s mom, with "the bluest, bluest 
eyes," and "a real sweetness about her," who makes one posthumous appearance in 
a flickering family movie, radiantly frolicking with her family in a red 
polka-dot dress. I haven't been able to get out to see every one of the slew of 
new motherless movies, including "Lassie," "Angels in the Outfield," "My Girl 
2," and, most recently, Melanie Griffith's "Milk Money," but I'll wager that if 
the departed mommies get any mention, it will be to sing their praises. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't even considering the missing mommies on series television, from 
"The Courtship of Eddie's Father" to "Who's the Boss?," from Valerie to 
Blossom, from "Nanny and the Professor" to just "The Nanny." On last season's 
"Byrds of Paradise," Timothy Busfield's character says his late wife was "the 
most unselfish person I ever met." Well, of course she was, to make her 
graceful exit and let the family high-tail it to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 There was serious talk of marrying off Bob Saget's widowed-father character on 
the long-running series "Full House," but the people in charge of the show 
nixed the idea. Good thinking. Why tamper with a winning concept? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lori Laughlin, the petite brunette who plays the perfect wife of Uncle 
Jessie and the perfect mommy of the newest twins on the show, should watch out 
for falling objects. A wedding episode might have been a one-time ratings 
bonanza, but a funeral could mean a spin-off series. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, it's much better for the ratings and the box office to have all 
the mommies off-off-off camera, languishing somewhere near the junction of 
Heaven and Stepford.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'RAPA NUI' MISUSES ITS LITERARY LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JO ANNE VAN TILBURG, Jo Anne Van Tilburg, Ph.D., is a Research Associate of 
the UCLA Institute of Archeology. She has conducted research seasonally on Rapa 
Nui since 1982, and is the author of Easter Island: Archeology, Ecology and 
Culture (British Museum Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his recent review of Kevin Reynold's unfortunate film "Rapa Nui," critic 
Kenneth Turan is rightfully amused by the "goofy" dialogue and "giddy South 
Seas" fantasy quality of this "throwback to Cinemascope epics of a simpler 
time" (" 'Rapa Nui' Presents a Fantasy Island of a Simpler Past," Calendar, 
Sept. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 The extremely small audience of which I was part hooted and jeered, not only 
at the cliched dialogue but at the transparently phony melodrama. In fact, I 
thought New Zealand actor Eru Potaka-Dewes as the silly ariki mau was 
hilariously funny, and some of his scenes with George Henare (the evil priest) 
approached the unintended level of Three Stooges comedy. I concur with Turan in 
his negative view of the film, but write to take issue with him on two points. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I think his willingness to view some of the footage as "good fun in a 
Saturday-matinee way" is generous but inappropriate and uniformed. The footage 
he is most impressed with portrays the ancient tangata manu or "birdman" rite. 
This profoundly sacred ritual ordeal is totally misread by director-writer 
Reynolds, who treats it as a crassly undertaken, viciously competitive 
"ironman" contest. While dramatic and daringly filmed, this ridiculous sequence 
betrays a profound ignorance of Polynesian ritual and Rapa Nui belief. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Turan fails to note the pseudo-documentary disguise this film wears. 
At the beginning we are told, in a voice-over thick with dramatic import, of 
the Polynesian settlement of Rapa Nui. At the end, a tagline states 
unequivocally that "archeological evidence" proves that Pitcairn, lying some 
1,400 kilometers westward, was settled from Rapa Nui. This is a patent 
falsehood that cannot go unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcarin Island was once inhabited and then abandoned by Polynesians, as were 
several other Pacific islands. There is virtually no hard evidence of any kind 
to demonstrate that Pitcairn or any other East Polynesian island was settled 
from Rapa Nui. While we may rationalize away, if we choose, the "artistic 
license" this film's creators have taken with Rapa Nui history ("Does 'Rapa 
Nui' Take Artistic License Too Far?," Calendar, Aug. 26), such deliberate 
distortion of scientific fact (or ignorance of its existence) is totally 
indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Much ink has been spilled in the concerned scientific community about this 
film's huge negative impact on the island's natural and cultural environment. 
In some ways, all of the turmoil would have been bearable if a good film had 
resulted, a film that did justice to the sacrifices made and gave honor to the 
past. Rapa Nui, which is an especially artistic culture, had a right to expect 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapa Nui has always inspired artists, writers, adventurers and scientists. 
Thor Heyerdahl sailed the Kon-Tiki on a wave of publicity into the imagination 
of two generations of travelers. No less a talent than Robert Frost wrote a 
poem about one of the monolithic statues. But the island, because of its 
incredible megalithic accomplishments and dramatic isolation, also has been the 
reluctant center of fantastic speculation, bad research and pseudoscience. This 
film not only contains most of the discredited and discarded myths once 
advanced about the island, but some of the newer unreasonable and unproven 
speculations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is but the latest in a long and lamentable history of drivel written about 
Rapa Nui.

PLAYBOY FILM FEST OFFERS A BIT OF SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "From Bix to Bird" was Hugh Hefner's chosen title for the Playboy Jazz Film 
Festival, and the programming for the three-day event precisely reflects that 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a total of 17 individual screenings at Laemmle's Sunset-5 theaters in 
West Hollywood, the newly created film gala has a bit of something for almost 
every taste in mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the festival is "A Great Day in Harlem," a documentary that 
chronicles a remarkable morning in 1958 when 60 jazz artists -- including Dizzy 
Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Lester Young, Count Basie and dozens of others -- 
were gathered together for a photo session on the steps of a brownstone in 
Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than descend into the too-familiar documentary-style recitation of 
names, dates and places, film-maker Jean Bach chose to go for the fun and the 
sheer singularity of the event. It was a wise decision. By combining an 
abundance of still photos and some priceless 8-millimeter film taken at the 
shoot with a group of retrospective interviews, she captured a series of 
extraordinary moments: the irrepressible joking and game playing that goes on 
between musicians (Dizzy Gillespie is sticking his tongue out at Roy Eldridge 
in the photo); the ways in which musicians positioned themselves (Monk chose to 
wear a light-colored jacket, anticipating others would wear dark suits; Count 
Basie elected to sit on the curb with a group of fascinated local children); 
the genuine, openly expressed awe with which many of the players regarded each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a family reunion," recalls Horace Silver in a voice-over comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine," adds Marion McPartland, "if they'd all had their 
instruments and were playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner's current fascination with Bix Beiderbecke is confirmed by the presence 
of two films -- one a documentary, the other a dramatized bio -- devoted to the 
short-lived jazz trumpeter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best is "Bix: Ain't None of Them Played Like Him Yet," Brigitte Berman's 
examination of Beiderbecke's shooting-star career -- a masterful historical 
document, filled with data, that never loses touch with the elusive personality 
of one of jazz's most legendary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking any film footage of her subject, Berman relied on still photos, 
vintage period film and interviews with Bix's family members and musical 
associates. The process worked, in part because the assembled visuals are 
joined aurally by an underscore sparkling with the clarion call of 
Beiderbecke's trumpet, a sound so unique that -- even today -- it more than 
justifies the Louis Armstrong phrase that is part of the picture's title: 
"Ain't None of Them Played Like Him Yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the festival's other important items are documentaries that explore the 
lives of four of the most preeminent performers in jazz: Louis Armstrong, Duke 
Ellington, Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker. "A Duke Named Ellington" only 
begins to touch the great complexity of either Ellington or his music. "Alto 
Madness" takes a more penetrating look at Parker, but it, too, fails to unravel 
the intricacies of an enigmatic personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holiday and Armstrong documentaries are more revealing. The ups and downs 
of Holiday's life -- the brilliant musical successes, the humiliating 
encounters with racism and the drug-driven physical decline -- are surveyed in 
considerable detail. 
</P>
<P>
 But, perhaps appropriately, the finest moments occur during her relatively 
rare performance segments: a chilling reading of "Strange Fruit" and a 
scratchy, but still moving version of "Don't Explain." Best of all is an 
exquisite Holiday blues in a segment from a mid-1950s television special. After 
her vocal, Lester Young, her closest musical companion during the prewar years, 
steps forward to play a characteristically epigrammatic chorus -- like Holiday, 
jazz improvisation distilled to its barest essence. Halfway through his solo, 
the camera cuts to a smiling Holiday, completely in sync with Young, nodding 
agreement as he plays an especially pointed phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other documentaries, "A Batch of Satch" doesn't suffer from a lack 
of performance material. More than any jazz artist, Armstrong was both 
entertainer and musician, and his career -- from the earliest short subjects -- 
has been highly visible in every imaginable media. Gary Giddins' knowledgeable 
script takes a meticulously detailed chronological approach, intercut with a 
wealth of still photos, performance clips, commentary from musicians such as 
trumpeters Wynton Marsalis, Doc Cheatham, singer Tony Bennett and producer Milt 
Gabler, as well as some pithy interview material from Armstrong himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of Armstrong's trumpet soloing is worth the price of admission. Less 
apparent, but equally notable, are his splendid vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other film bios, "Let's Get Lost" and "Time Is All You've Got" reflect, 
both in their pluses and their minuses, the uncommon qualities of their 
subjects -- Chet Baker and Artie Shaw. The Baker picture is a deeply personal 
examination of yet another star-crossed jazz life, but filmmaker Bruce Weber is 
far too present for the full richness of Baker to emerge. The Academy 
Award-winning Shaw film, also by Brigitte Berman, is more well-rounded. 
Thorough to a fault, it still does not quite disclose the full complexity of 
jazz music's most quixotic character. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's most visible theatrical films -- Clint Eastwood's "Bird" and 
Bernard Tavernier's "Round Midnight" -- are well- done, if darkly somber 
visions of the jazz world. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; TCHAIKOVSKY MAKES FOR A PLEASANT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the fireworks -- a happy bonus at best. What audiences come for at a 
Tchaikovsky Spectacular -- for example, the 10,779 listeners who showed up at 
the eighth annual such event given by Pacific Symphony at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre Saturday night -- is the music. Tchaikovsky's scores are the aural 
equivalent of comfort food: reassuring, tasty, hearty and warm. 
</P>
<P>
 As conducted affectionately by Edward Cumming and played by a Pacific Symphony 
contingent measurably lacking in familiar faces, four of these works -- 
"Capriccio Italien," "Romeo and Juliet," the Violin Concerto and the "1812" 
Overture -- restated the composer's deserved popularity. It would have been 
difficult to leave the outdoor showplace unhappy on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all the remembered passion and energy in this music materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly an efficient musical guide, Cumming -- assistant conductor of the 
orchestra -- did not in every moment remind his players how urgent all these 
emotionally ascending musical lines have to be to reach the unengaged. Merely 
playing through these works, even as cleanly and neatly as the orchestra did at 
this, its final summer performance, is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong instrumentalism, though at low levels of musical heat, characterized 
the honest playing achieved before intermission, when Cumming led nicely 
detailed performances of "Capriccio Italien" and the "Romeo" fantasy overture. 
The heat was turned up for the closer, the "1812" Overture, accompanied by a 
pleasant, if one-dimensional, fireworks show better viewed by the patrons in 
the cheap seats than by those located closer to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The high point of this event was the return of Eugene Fodor, the 
internationally prize-winning, Colorado-born 44-year-old American violinist. 
</P>
<P>
 Fodor revived the familiar Violin Concerto with poignancy, an effortless 
brilliance and myriad details of articulation and suave tone. Of course, he 
sailed through the difficulties without mishap. More important, he allowed 
over-recognizable tunes their pristine emotions, giving them a fresh sincerity 
with which to touch listeners anew. Cumming & Company provided deep support. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving indoors, and back to its winter home in Segerstrom Hall at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, the Pacific Symphony will begin its next season 
Oct. 19-20.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GIRL: POETIC MINIMALISM AT ITS FINEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything But the Girl, the British duo that played the Troubadour Saturday 
night, may be the most understated group in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt, both slender, genteel types in their early 30s, are 
the antithesis of flash -- speaking softly and dressing in the most plain and 
simple fashion.Their music is minimalist to the extreme -- partly a throwback 
to early '60s pop-folk, with touches of soul and jazz thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of their local shows over the years, this one was terrific. Thorn 
and Watt, who have been recording together since 1983, spotlighted music from 
their excellent new album, "Amplified Heart." The sound was warm and cozy and 
the music quietly compelling. The songs, mostly about despair and heartache, 
were packed with emotion that sneaked up on you. Before you knew it, you were 
transfixed and moved by songs like "Rollercoaster," "Troubled Mind" and 
"Walking to You." 
</P>
<P>
 Thorn, who handled most of the vocals, hardly sang above a whisper. She 
sounded like a very subtle, restrained version of Annie Lennox, with 
undercurrents of the styles of Sade, Carly Simon and early Paul Simon weaving 
in and out. Watt, who co-writes the music with her, did some lead and backup 
singing, but mostly played guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to nit-pick, you could chide them for a total lack of variety -- 
no up-tempo tunes, no sunny songs, no significant change in tone. But if you 
enjoy immersing yourself in gloomy, poetic minimalism for 90 minutes, an 
Everything But the Girl show is sheer heaven.DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BLUR SEEKS MAGIC IN AMERICAN TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "La la la la la, oh, he wants to go to magic America," sang Blur vocalist 
Damon Albarn early in the band's set at the Palace on Saturday. The sarcastic 
bite dripping from his delivery was, after 30 years of English bands being 
measured by their success Stateside, a bit refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Blur -- a quartet augmented on this tour by a keyboard player -- 
is a rare case of an English pop phenom that could measure up in this "magic" 
land. One sign was the Beatlemaniacal squeals that accompanied the group's 
entrance and the openings of the KROQ-familiar songs "Girls & Boys" (a clever 
look at modern sexuality that was one of this summer's catchiest singles) and 
1991's "There's No Other Way." But it's the uncommon appeal and quality of the 
band's songs that really make the case for Blur's potential U.S. glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Blur's songs are, in fact, quintessentially English: alternately forceful and 
pastoral meditations on distinctively English characters and conditions in the 
noble tradition of the Kinks, Mott the Hoople, the Jam and XTC. Albarn didn't 
show the dramatic flair of a Ray Davies or Ian Hunter, but he's got enough 
natural charisma to approach that level. 
</P>
<P>
 Just inviting such comparisons is a remarkable leap from the vaguely promising 
debut of three years ago, when Blur seemed stuck behind the likes of EMF and 
Jesus Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it enough to conquer America? We'll see.STEVE HOCHMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DREAMY POP FROM COLORADO'S SAMPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Palace Friday night, the Samples, a quartet from Boulder, Colo., played 
some of the dreamy pop that's made them such a success -- something they've 
managed without the backing of a big-time record company. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a brief experience recording for a major label, this band, which 
has been at this since 1987, has made it through independent record releases 
and an endless touring schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by singer-guitarist Sean Kelly, they were at their best on Friday when 
they were deep into the forlorn pop groove of their new "Autopilot" album. 
Behind them on stage was a movie screen showing endless clips from 1960s 
television, '90s newscasts and contemporary scenes of nature -- a disjointed 
mix that somehow reflected the band's uneasy balance of spacey folk and slow, 
edgy rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were problems near the end of the show. When the Samples abandoned 
the long, melancholy instrumental passages in favor of danceable crowd-pleasers 
-- falling into easy-pop formulas -- they quickly lost their sound's 
distinctive flavor. STEVE APPLEFORD

SCREENING ROOM: A BITTERSWEET PORTRAIT OF 'LAST KLEZMER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sunset 5's Cinema Judaica series continues Wednesday with a one-week run 
of Yale Strom's "The Last Klezmer," which introduces us to the ebullient, 
irresistible Leopold Kozlowski, Eastern Europe's last remaining prewar master 
of klezmer, Jewish folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 We not only witness Kozlowski's tireless efforts in ensuring the survival of 
klezmer but also accompany him from his home in Krakow on his first visit in 
more than 40 years to his hometown outside Lvov in the Ukraine.The experience 
is bittersweet in the fullest sense: He is confronted with the places where his 
parents and brother died in the Holocaust while experiencing a joyous reunion 
with the friend with whom he managed to escape from a death camp and hide in a 
forest until liberation by the Russians.  
</P>
<P>
 This fine documentary is not the first to suggest that Polish Gentiles have 
become intrigued with Jewish culture now that there are so few Jews left in 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay Stories: "Boy's Life" (opening Friday at the Sunset 5) is composed of 
three sensitive short films dealing with a young gay man's coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Sloan's "Pool Days" brings gentle humor to a 17-year-old lifeguard (Josh 
Weinstein) whose sexual identity becomes defined when mutual attraction occurs 
between him and a handsome swimmer (Nick Poletti); Raoul O'Connell's wryly 
amusing "A Friend of Dorothy's" tells of a boyish NYU freshman (O'Connell 
himself) coping with his attraction to his roommate (Kevin McClatchy), and 
Robert Lee King's "The Disco Years," the most complex of the three, deals with 
a high school student (Matt Nolan) who has a dream romance only to find his 
lover (Russell Scott Lewis) go swiftly into denial.

COMEDY REVIEW; FOXWORTHY SPREADS OUT HIS LAUGHS TO EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Foxworthy's appearance at a packed Wiltern Theatre Saturday dispelled any 
suspicion that he might be a one-trick pony who specializes in one of the most 
worn categories of the stand-up repertoire: the goober joke. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the stuff that makes up his "You're a Redneck If . . . " may owe its 
atmospheric popularity to our multicultural era of the hair-trigger ethnic and 
sexual temper, where it seems nobody can laugh at anybody without inviting a 
letter of censure, or even the threat of a lawsuit, from some seething advocacy 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you have to wonder, watching those lurid daytime TV talk shows and 
observing the similarity among overweight guests with strange hair and teeth, 
if a new generic figure isn't beginning to emerge for everyone else to gang up 
on: the person who has no shopping option but Piggly-Wiggly, or the person, as 
Foxworthy jokes, "whose family tree doesn't fork." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a subtle difference between cruel stereotype and affecting 
caricature that resides in fondness for the thing observed. The healthiest 
humor is based on bemused recognition that quickly finds its way back to one's 
self. 
</P>
<P>
 In his good-ol'-boy Georgia accent, the 36-year-old Foxworthy brings up the 
list of redneck categories ("You're a redneck if your mother's hair gets caught 
in the ceiling fan") that has elevated his comedy CD to No. 12 on the Billboard 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a short list in a large program that eventually includes everyone who 
has been single (meaning, as a rule, poor -- where you hope that couch someone 
threw out on the sidewalk will still be there after dark, so that you can take 
it home and put it in your living room next to the road cone) or married or a 
parent or a child or a grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 If the categories are all-encompassingly broad (though they settle on the 
working class), Fox-worthy fills them in with an exceptionally gifted eye for 
the telling detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the ebullient young Andy Griffith, Foxworthy seems a natural. He has all 
the tools of a terrific comedian: sustained material, presence, energy, rhythm, 
surprise, multiple payoffs, and the inescapable observation. A desperate laugh 
of surrender erupted in a roar from the men in his audience when he caught the 
way they lie to their wives, and each other, on their boys' night out. He has a 
lot to say about women too, but he manages to point out how they generally do a 
better job of things, without patronizing them.

'JUDAS PROJECT' NEEDS DOSE OF DIVINE IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN * MPAA-rating: PG-13. Times guidelines: Generally OK for kids, 
although blood is shed during the Crucifixion scenes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What if Jesus Christ came for the first time in 1993?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's the provocative question being posed in radio commercials for the 
evangelical fantasy film "The Judas Project."(The 1993 part isn't meant to 
imply it happened and we missed it; rather, the ads just haven't been updated 
since the feature had a regional run in the South last year.) Hypothesizing how 
the Son of God might act in modern times has long been a discussion topic for 
church youth groups, and this is the picture that dares to posit some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Would a modern Christ socialize with sinners in beer bars? Answer: Yes, but 
he'd have a cup of joe. Would Jesus spread the word on "Oprah"? Sorry, no. 
Would he shop at J. Crew? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 But writer, director and songwriter James H. Barden is less interested in the 
creative possibilities of this millennia-crossing than in simply producing the 
Passion Play in modern dress, badly. Jesus is named "Jesse," the Judas figure 
is -- hey! -- "Jude," it's "Pete" who thrice denies Christ, and that's as 
imaginative as it gets. If a mysterious cartel of world leaders assassinated a 
modern Christ, how would they do it? By, um, crucifying him. 
</P>
<P>
 Most movie-savvy Christians will feel more embarrassed than inspired. Much of 
the low budget appears to have gone into a few superior special-effects 
skylines produced by veteran Richard Edlund. But as the thunder clouds part, a 
glow surrounds "Jesse" and the basso profundo Almighty announces, "This is my 
son, with whom I'm well-pleased. Listen to him," the devout most of all may be 
praying for a Pythonesque punchline as divine relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed are the cheesemakers, indeed.CHRIS WILLMAN * MPAA-rating: PG-13. Times

THEATER REVIEW; 'THE FOOL' IS A HIGH-SEAS DRAMA FULL OF DERRING-DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Dorn Moody's "The Fool" at the Met Theatre is the theatrical 
equivalent of an N. C. Wyeth painting, a colorful adventure yarn full of brawn 
and derring-do. The play concerns the piratical exploits of Francis Drake who, 
facing arrest and ignominy in his native England, sails off to the New World to 
raid Spain's coffers so that he can return home a hero, covered with gold and 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's rich, multilayered play, which vividly captures the language and 
history of the late 1500s, was understandably nominated for a Pulitzer in 1985. 
Manly exploits abound on this bounding main, but in addition to the purely 
physical feats of courage and endurance, there's also an intellectually 
satisfying Hegelian dialectic, personified by Drake (Don Harvey) and his bosom 
friend and second-in-command Thomas Doughty (Wayne Pere). 
</P>
<P>
 The low-born Drake is a man of action, all bluff, bravado and bulldog 
tenacity, whose primary purpose on his perilous voyage is the amassment of a 
huge fortune, money he hopes will purchase him a pardon and win him favor with 
Queen Elizabeth (O-Lan Jones).  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Doughty, as courageous as his name implies, is a gentleman 
intellectual who needs no such material enticement to win advancement with the 
queen. 
</P>
<P>
 When in balance, Drake and Doughty are two halves of a formidable whole. 
However, when opposites collide, as they inevitably must on this fateful 
journey, Drake is forced to destroy his better half, the sole exalting impulse 
of his otherwise base nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Director James Gammon captains Moody's three-act drama with great energy, 
though occasionally the play enters the doldrums. Gammon has assembled a 
capable cast but has not fully succeeded in imposing a consistent period style 
upon his actors, some of whom seem to be playing more for a camera rather than 
an audience, an unfortunate technique that leaves us cupping our ears even in 
this modestly sized house. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake was only 35 at the commencement of his voyage, long before his escapades 
had rendered him respectable, but even so, Harvey seems a tad too young and 
fair to jibe with one's historical notions of the great sea captain. 
Preconceptions aside, however, Harvey's air of gruff command and sheer physical 
vitality propel the play. Pere is particularly affecting as Doughty, a 
life-loving man whose ideals doom him to martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The production's technical elements are superb. Patrick McFadden's handsome 
and versatile set, Denise Caplan's period costumes, Leonora Schildkraut's 
sound, and Chris Collins' superbly rendered lighting design contribute great 
excitement and authenticity to this high drama on the high seas. 
</P>

STREET SMART: SHOOTING ACROSS 3 LANES TO REACH FREEWAY IS UNSETTLING AT BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a conscientious driver, I am concerned about the intersection of Nisson 
Road and Red Hill Avenue in Tustin. Each day I drive west on Nisson, make a 
right turn on Red Hill and a left turn onto northbound Santa Ana Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the distance from Nisson to the Santa Ana Freeway overpass 
is only about 100 feet. It is therefore necessary to cut across three lanes to 
be in the appropriate lane and thus be able to make a left turn onto the 
northbound freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not sufficient time or space to turn into the right lane and make 
separate lane changes to the left. I wonder if one could be ticketed for that.  
</P>
<P>
 The same situation exists upon returning. Turning right from the freeway 
south, then left onto Nisson requires quickly cutting across several lanes in 
record time to be in the left-lane pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 I do this daily, but feel very uneasy about it. Do enlighten me, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline M. Thomas 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 You're right about the scramble to get from Nisson to the freeway on-ramp, but 
there are no plans to change it, said Douglas Anderson, transportation engineer 
for Tustin. The lay of the land simply is not spacious enough to reconfigure 
the lanes and their relation to the freeway on-ramp, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Anderson suggests you take Tustin Ranch Road as an alternate route to enter 
and exit the freeway. It may be a bit out of your way, but there is less 
traffic compared to Nisson, and sufficient room to make lane changes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for jetting across several lanes of traffic without yielding lane by lane, 
you would get a ticket if you cut somebody off in the process, said Sgt. Bill 
Fisher of the Tustin Police Department. He suggests you wait until there is no 
traffic to make your move or consider using an alternate route to Nisson.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was following a car that had a sign in the back window indicating that it 
was delivering blood. It had on the bumper a vehicle number, obviously for the 
delivery company to keep track of which car is which in its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 This vehicle had a regular license plate, not a commercial plate. Am I wrong 
or doesn't a vehicle being used for a business require a more expensive 
commercial license registration? 
</P>
<P>
 I was under the impression the additional cost for a commercial registration 
was due to the above normal use of the highways. If the commercial plates are 
required, why are these delivery vehicles allowed to be registered as a 
personal vehicle, and who is supposed to enforce this? Also, does this pertain 
to the cars used by different stores and restaurants to deliver their products, 
i.e. Domino's Pizza, etc.?  
</P>
<P>
 Dean Chikami 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial licenses are required only for big rig trucks and vehicles that 
transport people for hire, such as taxicabs and airport shuttle buses. Drivers 
who use their cars to deliver things, such as pizza or dry cleaning or blood, 
need only have a regular vehicle registration, according to the California 
Vehicle Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Big trucks are classified as commercial vehicles by virtue of their weight, 
said Evan Noshoff, a spokesman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles 
in Sacramento. These vehicles are putting more stress on each mile of highway 
they cover than, say, a traveling salesman would when using his own car, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van pools or car pools that charge their passengers also are not considered 
commercial vehicles, Noshoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We are often admonished by the press, TV, newspapers, etc., for using 911 for 
non-emergency problems, but I have never read or heard of any suggestions about 
reporting important, but non-emergency information and how to determine which 
is which. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many cellular phones on the road today, it seems important to me to 
report dangers that could become emergencies. Can you provide some help along 
this line?  
</P>
<P>
 Gladys M. Trousdale 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Your letter won a lot of Brownie points from the California Highway Patrol. 
They were pleased that someone cared enough to find out how not to overload the 
911 system. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth is, calling 911 often is your best option for reporting most 
kinds of problems you encounter on the freeways. Anything that could cause a 
death or injury or affect traffic flow on the freeway warrants a 911 call, said 
Steve Kohler, a spokesman for the CHP in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Debris in the road, a motorist who appears to be driving impaired, or a 
disabled vehicle all are legitimate 911 calls, Kohler said. On the other hand, 
you wouldn't need to call 911 if you come upon a crash that looked as though it 
had been there awhile with people stopped or out of their cars, he said. This 
is an indication that the crash is not all that recent and someone else 
probably has reported it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you spot debris on an Orange County freeway during regular business hours, 
you can avoid 911 and instead call Caltrans' general number at (714) 724-2000. 
It can send a crew immediately. Caltrans also has a hot line, (714) 724-2500, 
which can be called during business hours about graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All northbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway will be closed from the El Toro 
Y interchange to Alton Parkway from 11:59 tonight to 5 a.m. Tuesday. Caltrans 
workers will be doing construction as part of the El Toro Y 
interchange-Interstate 5 improvement project.  
</P>
<P>
 The suggested detour is the San Diego Freeway northbound to Irvine Center 
Drive, right on Irvine Center Drive, right on Alton Parkway, and back to the 
northbound Santa Ana Freeway. For up-to-the-minute information, call the 
Transportation Hot Line at (714) 724-2077.

CHATEAU BRADY; LANDMARKS: THE HOUSE WHERE TV'S FAMOUS FAMILY LIVED OUT THE 
EARLY '70S STILL DRAWS FANS TO STUDIO CITY. TODAY MARKS THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
SERIES' START.

<P>
 On this day 25 years ago, the lovely lady married the man named Brady and one 
of America's grooviest sitcom families -- "The Brady Bunch" -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissed by critics during its initial run on ABC from 1969-74, the modest 
television show starring Florence Henderson and Robert Reed went on to become a 
cult phenomenon in reruns, spawning numerous reincarnations of the 
squeaky-clean Brady clan in television movies, spin-off series and a campy 
stage production. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on this Brady anniversary, it is perhaps fitting to examine the history of 
one of the San Fernando Valley's most quietly famous landmarks: the split-level 
suburban home in Studio City immortalized by the half-hour program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1969, as crews were preparing to shoot the show's first 
episodes for a fall debut, the call went out for a suitable Brady dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Weddington Carson was newly widowed, living alone in the two-bedroom 
house that Luther B. Carson had designed and built for the couple 10 years 
earlier on a sprawling Valley lot. Construction of the Ventura Freeway had 
forced them from their previous home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the house's middle-class appearance that attracted the show's producers 
when they came around asking to make it the residence of Mike and Carol Brady, 
their six kids and Alice the housekeeper, recalled Carson's son, Guy Weddington 
McCreary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just had a good look to it," he said. "It symbolized California living." 
</P>
<P>
 Series creator Sherwood Schwartz agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it to be too affluent, we didn't want it to be too 
blue-collar," he said. "We wanted it to look like it would fit a place an 
architect would live." 
</P>
<P>
 There was just one problem: The real house was only a modest split level while 
the interior set already under construction on Paramount Studios' Stage 5 in 
Hollywood was that of a roomy two-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hollywood set designers came to the rescue, attaching a phony window atop 
Carson's house to give the appearance of a full second floor.  
</P>
<P>
 McCreary doesn't remember how much his mother -- who died earlier this month 
-- was paid for the use of her home, but it wasn't very much, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beige, ranch-style house first appeared in the series' second episode, 
aired on Oct. 3, 1969, and in all of the 115 episodes that followed. Viewers 
saw the house from a variety of angles during each show, usually as a vehicle 
for taking viewers inside the home, but all the clips were filmed before the 
series' debut and recycled throughout its five-year run. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary, who was by then attending college away from home, said that although 
he didn't often find time to catch glimpses of his family's home along with the 
prime-time antics of the Bradys, his mother did watch the show. And, he 
recalled, she didn't mind the house's fame, even when it meant strangers 
stopping by to gawk at it. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1973, during the show's fourth season, the widowed Carson found 
the house too large and sold it to Violet and George McCallister. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After 21 years in the famous home, Violet McCallister -- now a widow -- has 
become reticent about revealing her address, fearing an increase in the number 
of fans and tour buses that still visit her quiet street from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fans are respectful of her privacy, McCallister said, although the 
looky-loos trespassing to peek into the Bradys' living room -- which existed 
only on a Paramount sound stage -- caused her to build a fence around the front 
yard a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their home became one of the most recognizable dwellings in the 
world, McCallister said that she and her husband never regretted their purchase 
-- or their association with the series. "It was a good family show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding on the wave of nostalgia ushered in by the ratings success of the 1988 
television movie "A Very Brady Christmas," Paramount returned to McCallister's 
house in 1990 to shoot a new set of exteriors for "The Bradys," a short-lived 
dramatic series on CBS that reunited most of the original cast. One episode 
involved the Bradys moving their home across town when freeway construction 
threatened the neighborhood, an eerie echo of the reason the real house was 
built.  
</P>
<P>
 Although "The Bradys" provided a contemporary look at the house, Paramount 
chose not to use it for a movie based on "The Brady Bunch" that was filmed this 
past summer. With the front-yard fence and 25 years of tree and shrub growth, 
it no longer resembled the home viewers might remember from the original 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers also needed two homes with adjacent driveways -- which was not 
the case at McCallister's house -- because much of the movie's plot involves 
the relationship between the Bradys and their scheming next-door neighbors, the 
Ditmeyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by photographs and measurements of McCallister's house, location manager 
Mike Neale and his crew built a facade of the Brady dwelling around the home of 
an Encino couple for an undisclosed five-figure sum. It wasn't an identical 
copy, but "close enough that when you saw it you'd think it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, Penny and John Herbst, admit they were a bit puzzled when 
Paramount asked to use their property for the motion picture. It wasn't just 
that their single-story house in no way resembled the Brady abode, but also 
that decades had passed since Penny Herbst recalled her children loyally 
watching the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went, 'The Brady Bunch'? Aren't they all grown up?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film is a satire, scheduled for release next spring, which takes the 
1970s-era Bradys, played by a new group of actors, and transplants them into 
the strange and hostile world of present-day America -- a world that doesn't 
quite know what to make of the anachronistic family. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot at several Valley locations, including Taft High School in Woodland 
Hills, the production made headlines earlier this month during shooting of the 
movie's opening scene. Freeway signs warning of apocalyptic road hazards such 
as killer bees and a gang riot tied up traffic on the Ventura Freeway for 
several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Herbsts' house, filming went so smoothly that Penny Herbst said 
she'd be happy to welcome the filmmakers back for a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady purists may grumble at what series creator Schwartz calls the movie's 
"affectionate satire." But the screenplay is slightly less campy than "The Real 
Live Brady Bunch," a recent stage production in which adult actors performed 
original "Brady Bunch" episodes live. 
</P>
<P>
 And Schwartz maintains that while humorous, the movie remains faithful to the 
original series -- a program whose popularity shows few signs of diminishing a 
quarter-century after its debut. According to Elizabeth Moran, author of the 
book "Bradymania!" the show has "never been off television." KTLA-TV Channel 5 
continues to broadcast two reruns back-to-back daily and researchers there 
estimate that the noon-hour episodes draw an average of 50,000 to 100,000 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Schwartz why "The Brady Bunch" endures and he'll modestly say it's the 
stories themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's because the stories are drawn from a child's point of view, 
which is rare in television history," he said. The plots, he added, are 
universal. "It deals with stories that were true 100 years ago and that will be 
true 100 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Moran, who as a child desperately wished to be like sensitive middle-child Jan 
Brady, said that the series strikes a chord with many members of Generation X 
who grew up in families bearing little resemblance to the happy, successful 
Bradys. "It showed that two different families that are thrown together can get 
along," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz has no plans for future Brady projects, he said, but he predicts that 
regardless of the film's fortunes, the Bunch will live on in reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think new kids will always watch because the stories will appeal -- because 
they always appeal," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Guy McCreary, who lives a short distance from his family's former home and 
passes by often on neighborhood walks, has never been much of a "Brady Bunch" 
fan. But he said that an occasional glimpse of the house on television still 
triggers fond memories of his own family. "I think of my folks and I think it 
was fantastic that they were involved in that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that the house will be duplicated on the silver screen next year, he just 
chuckled. "It's pretty wild, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 David Brady (his real name) grew up watching "The Brady Bunch."

 Dear Street Smart: The exit from the westbound Ventura Freeway at Canoga 
Avenue has three lanes for the turn onto Canoga. There is one left-turn lane 
and two right-turn-only lanes. Why can't the middle lane be made for both right 
and left turns? It seems to me that many more cars are turning left onto 
Canoga. 
</P>
<P>
 S. Rothfeld 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: We took your question to Pat Reid of Caltrans who told us that 
yours was the first request to study remarking the lanes. So traffic engineers 
will investigate the situation and if, as you say, there is a demand for more 
left-turn lanes, they will decide whether to add them. 
</P>
<P>
 We will keep you posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: My question has to do with the on- and off-ramps of the 
Ventura Freeway at Topanga Canyon Boulevard. In the middle of the northbound 
off-ramp and the southbound on-ramp are circular park areas with trees and 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these areas are being slept in on a nightly basis by homeless people. 
I don't like these people sleeping there because it is a hazard to residents of 
the community and a hazard to motorists who break down. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the trash is horrendous. It is almost a health hazard. It used to be so 
pretty and now it is so ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rabinowitz 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Caltrans is responsible for maintaining the landscaping along the 
freeway. Reid told us that crews have made an extra effort in the last two 
weeks to keep trees in that area pruned. She said the last time trash was 
picked up there was last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many of your fellow motorists are to blame for tossing their 
junk out the window. Keeping the city clean is everybody's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the transients, they are another unfortunate sign that times are tough. 
California Highway Patrol Officer Tito Gomez said the situation along the 
Ventura Freeway is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens everywhere in Los Angeles County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said officers will generally ask transients to move along if they are 
blocking traffic or if they are posing a danger to themselves or motorists. For 
the most part, though, law enforcement officers are too busy to spend their 
days rousting the homeless.

TRIAL OF MEN ACCUSED IN 2 SLAYINGS STARTS TODAY; COURTS: THE THREE ARE 
SUSPECTED OF KILLING A POLICEMAN AND A STORE OWNER DURING A STRING OF ARMED 
ROBBERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than two years have passed since Officer John Hoglund's love affair with 
law enforcement ended violently outside a Maywood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunned down as he arrived in response to a silent burglar alarm, Hoglund 
didn't even have a chance to draw his gun. He died inside his patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the slaying was the work of at least three men who are 
responsible for an armed robbery rampage throughout Los Angeles that included 
the fatal shooting of Lee Chul Kim, a Van Nuys market owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will re-create the killings of Hoglund and Kim for a Los Angeles 
jury this week, when the murder trial is scheduled to begin for Jose Contreras, 
Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to murder, the men face as many as 31 other charges stemming from 
seven robberies of markets and restaurants from Van Nuys to Paramount, in a 
crime run that began on New Year's Eve, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 With the images of Hoglund's assailants clearly captured on a security 
videotape from inside the store, the jurors "will be able to identify the 
defendants," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard, one of two prosecutors 
assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say they are seeking the death penalty against all three men, each 
in his early 20s and from Central America, in the Hoglund shooting. Fuentes and 
Contreras also face death if convicted of killing Kim at his Woodley Market on 
May 4, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, 49, had gone to the bank to make a large cash withdrawal, which was 
routine because he operated a check-cashing booth in his store. Prosecutors 
allege that Fuentes, Contreras and two other robbers were in the store when Kim 
returned, and that they shot and killed him during a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hit about a dozen times," Grosbard said. "It all happened in the 
freezer of the store, so they were within feet of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund was shot less then a month later, and police noticed similarities 
between the two killings, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Speer, the other 
prosecutor. Detectives used the videotape from the Maywood market to get still 
photos of the suspects, which were used to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund, 46, was the first officer in the history of the Maywood Police 
Department to be killed in the line of duty. He was shot in the head and chest 
as he stepped from his patrol car on May 29, 1992, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they shot the cop they turned the gun on an eyewitness who was five 
feet away, but the gun was out of bullets," Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two defense attorneys said they do not plan to call their clients to testify; 
some attorneys said they will try to minimize the nature of their clients' 
involvement in the murders in hopes of averting a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prosecution in possession of the store's security videotape, "the big 
question is going to be life or death," said James Coady, a deputy public 
defender representing Fuentes, Hoglund's alleged assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the prosecution can't prove that Fuentes is the actual shooter, it could 
be tough for a jury to come back with the death penalty," Coady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro's attorney, Eric K. Davis, described his client as the "lookout" 
during the Maywood robbery, one who could not have been involved in the 
shooting because he fled after he spotted Hoglund. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never even saw the police officer get shot," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Leonard, an attorney representing Contreras, said he will acknowledge 
that his client is "a robber, but not a murderer" during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that he did not kill anyone," Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
 Grosbard said that during the robberies, some of the defendants hit employees 
over the head with their guns, and used stun guns to persuade other employees 
to hand over money. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suspect, Oscar Paredes, who was arrested in March in connection with 
the Hoglund shooting, is awaiting trial, Grosbard said. Two other suspects 
remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening statements are scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said they plan to introduce testimony about their clients 
that they hope the jury will consider when deciding their fates. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro was abandoned by his parents as a child, grew up amid the war in El 
Salvador, and came to the United States in the late 1970s, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite cultural differences, "he is willing to pay for his responsibility," 
Davis said. "But he's in a position where they are trying to exact a price that 
is too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leonard of Contreras: "I think when the jury hears all the evidence about 
his life and history, they will see him not in the light of just a robber, but 
also as a person with redeeming features." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, who like Contreras is from Honduras, was forced to drop out of school 
in the third grade to peddle newspapers to help support his family, Coady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a better philosophy of life than me," the attorney said. "He's more 
accepting of whatever is in store for him than I am."

DEMOCRATS SEEK TO BOOST RANKS OF BLACK VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Led by gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, 
Democratic leaders on Sunday caravaned through parts of Los Angeles to launch a 
statewide campaign to boost the number of blacks voting in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive -- which kicked off with a concert, speeches and a motorcade to 
several state Assembly district offices in Southwest and South-Central Los 
Angeles -- is aimed especially at the approximately 170,000 blacks in 
California who vote only occasionally in state elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer afford to be non-participants in this democracy," Jackson 
declared. "We must get involved and cast our votes to change our future." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley -- in his second political appearance in 
less than a week -- described voter turnout as critical to addressing social 
problems and influencing the political complexion of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who fail to go to the polls can make a difference in an election," 
Bradley said. "I know that from experience." 
</P>
<P>
 (Bradley failed in two bids for governor, in 1982 and 1986. The first loss was 
by a narrow margin, and in the 1986 election the voter turnout among African 
Americans here was lower than it was in 1982.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is a really crucial year for African American voters," especially 
with anti-crime legislation and cuts in state services that are seen as most 
threatening to low-income residents, said Darolyn Davis, a spokeswoman for the 
African American Vote Plan and press secretary to Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) for one reason or another, apathy has really set in to the minority 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley evidently agreed with that assessment, telling the rally, "What this 
campaign needs at this point is more enthusiasm. That's going to be our route 
to victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the state's Legislative Black Caucus, the African American press 
and religious leaders, the Vote Plan is a response to a continued decline in 
voter participation among blacks, said the plan's campaign manager, Sam Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is being directed exclusively at registered and potential 
Democratic voters who form a majority in most black communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vote Plan expects to stage more rallies and send mailers to encourage 
voter registration among black Democrats, especially among those who have voted 
perhaps only once or twice in the past five years, Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who rode in one of the lead cars, 
said she is especially concerned about the impact that the "three strikes" 
crime bill will have in neighborhoods where blacks already feel alienated from 
the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people feel out of it," Watson said. "So often our people feel 
disenfranchised. We've got to bring these issues that are bread-and-butter 
issues home to them."

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: YES, YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE

<P>
 Nobody relishes the morning commute, and the afternoon haul, well, that just 
goes without saying. Yet nearly a third of Southern California commuters -- 31% 
-- say their daily schleps are actually getting better.  
</P>
<P>
 That little surprise is contained in the sixth-annual "State of the Commute," 
a 134-page tome prepared by the nonprofit Commuter Transportation Services 
detailing everything everyone ever wanted to know about the region's commuting 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, only 28% of commuters in five counties say they are fairly often 
or very often bothered by traffic congestion. Maybe that explains why freeway 
shootings have tapered off in recent years. And a full 24% of Los Angeles 
County commuters said their trips to work are "always good." 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? And why are they so content? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's because there are fewer commuters heading to work; that's the 
speculation of Caltrans and other transit wonks. Since 1990, regional 
employment has dropped from 6.9 million to 6.6 million, and almost all those 
job losses have been in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Another explanation for this rosy outlook might lie with Darwin. Species 
evolve. They adapt. Maybe, the traffic doctors theorize, motorists have simply 
grown accustomed to the pace of their sluggish commute. 
</P>
<P>
 While a volume of traffic statistics might seem esoteric bedtime reading, 
commuting is one of the few things in this modern Babel that passes for a 
common experience. Each year, Californians spend 1.2 billion -- that's with a b 
-- hours driving in congested traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 And as often as the drive is lamented and the taillights ahead are cursed, 
most commuters follow the same old routine day after day after day, according 
to the survey of motorists in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino 
and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 81% still drive alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody does it, but everybody does it just a little differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Men commute longer than women -- 72 minutes round-trip contrasted with 60 
minutes for women -- and farther -- 18.5 miles each way compared to 14 miles. 
And men are more likely than women to drive on the freeway -- 62% to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Collier, research director for Commuter Transportation Services, said 
such figures reflect the differences between men and women in day to day life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will travel longer distances for greater incomes," she said. Women on 
average are paid less than men, so are less likely to drive farther to 
higher-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their shorter commutes, women are stressed by traffic more than men, 
Collier said, speculating that it may have something to do with the fact that 
women's commutes are generally more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 23% of women make multiple stops on their way to work. Although about 
21% of men also make stops, their reasons are different. Of women, 53% stop to 
drop off or pick up a child at school or day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a quarter as many men -- 12% -- make similar stops. They are more likely 
to stop to eat, to buy gasoline or to run a work-related errand. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar disparities are noted when the commutes of different ethnic groups are 
compared. While 84% of whites and Asians drive alone to work, roughly 78% of 
African Americans and 73% of Latinos do. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the more money a driver makes, the more likely he or she is 
to drive alone to work. 
</P>
<P>
 For all groups, the average commuting distance is 16.5 miles each way, 
slightly up from 15 miles last year. Average time to work is 31 minutes. The 
average drive home is 36 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the discrepancy? More drivers are going more places in the afternoon than 
in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So why should anyone care that 36% of commuters arrive at work before 7:30 
a.m.? Or that 55% leave before 5 p.m., making the rush "hour" run from 4 p.m. 
to 6:30? 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the numbers won't even make good barstool trivia. Transportation 
scholars will take the statistics and try to devise better ways of luring us 
out of cars and into other forms of transit. 
</P>
<P>
 It is harder than it sounds. Almost all of the 2,625 commuters in the survey 
said they were aware of alternate ways to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet only 14% carpool, 2% ride the bus and 1% each walk, bicycle or vanpool. 
The rest have a list of reasons why they can't leave their car parked for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Damn the congestion, they say, full speed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a long time to transition out of this mindset," Collier 
said of the love of solo motoring. Traffic will have to worsen for people to 
change their habits, she added. "If you're not disgruntled or unhappy, you're 
not going to change what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, though, 39% of commuters still say traffic is getting 
worse. Maybe next year, they'll be in the carpool lane. Traffic Views Results 
of Commuter Transportation Services survey of 2,625 people show more 1994 
respondents rate current freeway traffic better than previous year's. Responses 
from 1991-94. 05,08,06,06,06,06 1991 1992 1993 1994 Better 11% 12% 19% 31% Same

SALSA MOVES INTO THE PLAYOFFS ON WINNING NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Wright finished the American Professional Soccer League regular season 
with his second consecutive two-goal game Sunday night in Titan Stadium, 
lifting the Salsa to a 2-0 victory over Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Salsa ends up in second place in the APSL and gains the 
home-field advantage in the semifinal playoff series against Montreal, 
beginning at 4:30 p.m. (PDT) Friday in Montreal. Game 2 of the playoff series 
will begin at 6:05 p.m. Sunday in Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal series, Colorado will play Seattle (14-6), which 
finished first in the regular season. The top team in the regular season meets 
the fourth-place team and the second-place team plays the third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa and Colorado, each with 12-8 records, split their four-game series 
this season with two victories each. Montreal also compiled a 12-8 record, but 
claimed third with more points than Colorado, the defending APSL champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's two goals also gave him his first APSL scoring title over teammate 
Paulinho. Both players finished with 27 points, but Wright takes top honors 
because he had one more goal. Wright had 12 goals and three assists; Paulinho 
had 11 goals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's Most Valuable Player is still undecided, and Salsa Coach Rick 
Davis says he would have trouble choosing between Wright and Paulinho, who won 
it last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paulinho does so much for our team," Davis said. "When we were struggling 
earlier in the season, Paulinho was struggling, but when Paulinho came into 
form, we came into form. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to consider Wright because he's been so consistent for us, and look 
at the way he's played in the late stages of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright also scored two goals Wednesday night, including a last-second 
game-winner, in the Salsa's 3-2 victory over Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright thinks the addition to the team this month of Hugo Perez, who played 
for the United States in this summer's World Cup, also has been a key factor in 
his goal surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hugo has opened up a lot of stuff for me," Wright said. "That's had a lot to 
do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis agrees. "Hugo has definitely made a difference," he said. "This becomes 
an opposing team's nightmare with three scorers like those three. You can 
sometimes stop one scorer, maybe two, but not three. Those three guys are as 
good as any three players in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis also said Perez has now made the Salsa "the most talented team in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa had 15 shots on goal compared to Colorado's five, all in the first 
half. Neither team scored in the first half, although the Salsa missed on 
several good opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright scored the match's first goal on a penalty kick in the 66th minute, 
then added his second on an assist from Zak Ibsen in the 79th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Thor Lee and defender Danny Pena will miss the Salsa's first game 
of the playoffs because of yellow cards in the game. The Salsa's Michael 
N'Doumbe missed Sunday's match after receiving the mandatory one-game 
suspension for getting his fourth yellow in Wednesday night's victory at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa is 0-3 against Montreal this season, but Davis is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has been showing how good it really is," Davis said. "For the last 
three or four weeks we've been healthy. We played Montreal three times before 
early August, and that was before the team hit its form."

PRO FOOTBALL; MIGHTY DUCKS LOSE; NOW ALL THEY CAN DO IS SIT; HOCKEY: PITTSBURGH 
BEATS ANAHEIM, 3-2, AS PLAYERS WONDER WHAT FUTURE WILL HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five goals were scored and nine assists were credited, but that didn't keep 
the Mighty Ducks' final exhibition game from seeming pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks stepped off the ice Sunday after a 3-2 loss to Pittsburgh at The 
Pond wondering when they will play again -- in days, weeks or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball shot itself in the foot. I hope we don't have the same gun in our 
hands," said Coach Ron Wilson, who feels like a man in the middle between the 
players and management. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman says the season will not 
start until a new collective-bargaining agreement is reached, and the Ducks 
have nothing but practice and uncertainty between now and their scheduled 
opener, Saturday at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew you had exhibitions before," Wilson said. "You knew those games 
would be played. Now is when the real thick cloud hangs over everything." 
</P>
<P>
 With the situation so uncertain, the Ducks have stopped making roster moves, 
and still have 30 players on the team at a time when they would usually have 
fewer than 25. Instead of regular-season intensity, they played a game that 
center Bob Corkum called "lackadaisical at best." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks and Penguins staged a solidarity handshake at game's end, but were 
met with some scattered boos among the crowd of 16,799. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players have the impression owners are going to take all the heat if there's 
a lockout," Wilson said. "But nobody sympathizes with the players anymore. They 
don't sympathize with the owners either. I don't think anybody has any sympathy 
for pro sports at all anymore, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Corkum: "I think the fans are just frustrated and understandably so." 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, the Ducks' player representative to the NHL Players Assn., said he 
believes the fans do not understand the issues. "They lost out on baseball and 
now they're in jeopardy of losing hockey," he said. "It's an understandable 
reaction to be a little bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille, who didn't play against the Kings Friday because of a tender 
ankle, is playing on a powerhouse line with Ron Francis and Jaromir Jagr after 
being traded to the Penguins in July. He had a goal and an assist, and was 
greeted with the familiar "Luuuuuc" cheer -- even when he was called for a 
cross-checking penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very bad for the game. We're at a real high right now," he said. 
"We've got to stick together as players. We've all got to be strong as a union 
right now." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille took another veiled swipe at King management and Wayne Gretzky, 
who he believes helped engineer his trade. "Players here are just playing the 
game. It makes a big difference," he said. "They don't have to worry about 
what's going on upstairs or what's going on outside the team. Sometimes you'd 
rather score less goals and win the Stanley Cup." . . . Duck management has 
planned for the potential postponement of the season by securing and agreeing 
to pay for ice time at Glacial Garden for practice beginning Oct. 1, said Bob 
Corkum, the NHLPA representative. He said he is not sure what the union stance 
on organized practice would be because players will not be paid. . . . Paul 
Kariya finished the exhibition season with eight points in seven games, and had 
only his second pointless game Sunday. . . . Guy Hebert is expected to rejoin 
the team Tuesday or Wednesday after going home to New York because of a family 
medical emergency. . . . Rookie defenseman Nikolai Tsulygin, who negotiated a 
contract that calls for him to return to Russia rather than play with San Diego 
assuming he doesn't make the team, scored his first exhibition goal. Coach Ron 
Wilson, who thinks Tsulygin should play in San Diego and continue to learn 
English, called his plan to return to Russia "a big mistake."

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: DID FOX STAY FOR PETE'S SAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign ad for Gov. Pete Wilson touts such job-saving efforts as tax 
incentives, a cut in regulations and forming "strike teams" of officials to 
keep business in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the ad makes this claim: "That's why Fox studios stayed in L.A. instead 
of moving to Nevada." 
</P>
<P>
 How true is the claim? Privately, sources at Fox insist that realistically the 
odds were virtually nil that the studio would end up in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fox spokesman declined to comment on the claim, as did Fox Executive Vice 
President George Vradenburg, whom a Wilson campaign "factual substantiation" 
lists as a contact to verify the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with the Wilson Administration insist Fox seriously considered 
Nevada, and that the claim that the studio stayed due to Wilson's efforts is no 
exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Fox executives say they were grateful for Wilson's support during 
their lengthy battle in gaining approval to upgrade their aging Century City 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But they add that suggesting they were on the verge of moving to Nevada is 
stretching it. Fox did consider leaving the city of Los Angeles during the 
marathon fight to win approval, they say, but the most serious alternative site 
was Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of relocating the entire studio, the disruption to employees and the 
need to be near Hollywood's creative community pretty much precluded moving out 
of state, even though the threat to leave was raised as a negotiating tactic, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox did recently say it will build an animation studio in Arizona, but because 
its creative team wanted to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 David Handelman, Fox's former general counsel, says that some preliminary 
discussions on Nevada occurred, but adds that "in fairness there were not 
active negotiations to move. We weren't on the curb with our suitcases packed." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Fox employees and their families moved to Nevada, the course of the 
election might well have been changed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its top officials at the time was news executive Van Gordon Sauter, now 
a consultant to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 He also happens to be Kathleen Brown's husband. Movie With a Bite 
</P>
<P>
 If the anxiety over killer bees isn't enough, now we have giant mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemdale Communications recently announced plans for "Mosquito," a film about 
"a swarm of deadly six-foot mosquitoes out for blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot involves a meteor crashing in a forest, unleashing a swarm of the 
mosquitoes "ten thousand times their normal size." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's heroes, Hemdale says, "fight with chain saws, shotguns and anything 
they can get their hands on to so these giant mosquitoes in an explosive battle 
for the fate of mankind." What Financial Future? 
</P>
<P>
 First, baseball players lost an estimated $150 million out of pocket because 
of the season-ending strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, hockey players are faced with the threat that their season won't start 
due to labor turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is one of the topics at a seminar Friday at the Beverly Hilton 
sponsored by the Beverly Hills Sports Council? "Planning the Athlete's 
Financial Future."

 Korean car maker Kia Motors Corp. appointed its U.S. operations chief to its 
board of directors. W. Greg Warner, 51, becomes the first American executive of 
an Asian car company to sit on its board. Elevating its U.S. subsidiary's top 
American executive to the board is a good move for Kia, analysts said, but is 
unlikely to set off a round of similar appointments by other Asian auto makers.

 National Medical Annual Meeting: "Any way you look at it," begins the 
chairman's message in National Medical Enterprises' 1994 annual report, "it was 
an unforgettable year. . . . " Unforgettable indeed, portending a lively 
gathering when National Medical has its annual meeting at the Loews Santa 
Monica Beach Hotel on Wednesday. The meeting comes three months after National 
Medical agreed to pay $380 million to settle federal criminal fraud claims 
related to practices at some psychiatric hospitals previously owned by the 
Santa Monica-based hospital company.Similar allegations of fraud led to an 
earlier agreement by the company to pay $215 million to settle lawsuits with 19 
insurers. Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow may prefer to dwell on the year's 
successes: how NME quickly resolved a staggering array of legal problems; 
restructured its businesses, including the divestiture of psychiatric 
facilities, and triggered a sharp rebound in its stock. And Barbakow may have 
good news about the disclosure last week that National Medical is in 
negotiations to acquire Nashville-based HealthTrust Inc. and American Medical 
Holdings of Dallas in a multibillion-dollar deal that would create the nation's 
second-largest hospital company.

 Utility Commission Hearing: The California Public Utilities Commission on 
Tuesday will hold in Pasadena another in a series of public hearings on a 
controversial plan to deregulate the state's investor-owned utilities. The 
commission has proposed a competitive marketplace in electricity -- somewhat 
akin to the existing market for long-distance telephone service -- that would 
begin for large industrial users in 1996 and be available for residential rate 
payers in 2002. The hearing will begin at 7 p.m. in the Donald R. Wright 
Auditorium of the Pasadena Public Library on East Walnut Street.

 Airline Slots at John Wayne: The Orange County Airport Commission will 
consider on Wednesday whether to recommend a proposal that would allow new 
airlines to start service at John Wayne Airport by affiliating with carriers 
that already operate there. The proposal was prompted by Reno Air, which wanted 
to acquire landing slots under an agreement with American Airlines that would 
have allowed it to begin offering service between Orange County and San 
Jose.That arrangement drew protests from other carriers and intervention by 
federal authorities. Officials at John Wayne, which limits flights to meet 
strict noise regulations, say they hope the new plan will allow low-fare 
carriers to offer service that would give passengers more options. The 
commission will meet at 7 p.m. in the Thomas F. Riley Terminal building at the 
airport.

 New Home Sales Report: Builders across Southern California will be paying 
close attention to Thursday's Commerce Department report on August new-home 
sales.Rising mortgage rates hurt sales throughout most of the summer, and 
developers are hoping for a late burst of activity before the traditional fall 
and winter doldrums set in. However, not all builders are optimistic that sales 
will rebound, and many are already canceling or delaying new projects. Last 
week, the Commerce Department said the number of housing projects started in 
August tumbled 14% in the West, where California accounts for about half of all 
construction activity.

ANN CONWAY: DIANA HALPRIN: BATON, BOWS AND PLUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't look for her to wear white tie and tails when she makes her conducting 
debut with the Orange County Chamber Orchestra this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "No pants," says Diana Halprin, who divides her time between Santa Fe and 
Orange County. "I feel a conductor must be very powerful. And I believe there 
is a feminine power that matches in every way a masculine power. Look for me in 
a simple black gown." 
</P>
<P>
 The violinist, who for eight years was the chamber orchestra's concertmaster, 
is planning to take a high-profile step onto the Orange County society scene in 
coming months. " Then you'll see me in color," she says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved parties," says Halprin, who once lived in New York. And the 
idea of going to them here, she says, is not only to kick up her heels but to 
help promote awareness of the need for music education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be an educator here. I want to establish a lecture series. Poor 
people aren't the only ones who are deprived in the area of the arts -- you can 
have very wealthy people who are deprived of an artistic grounding too." 
</P>
<P>
 If Halprin has her way, audiences that attend the chamber orchestra's 
performances at the Irvine Barclay Theatre will have an educated appreciation 
for what they hear. "You can't just walk in and understand a great piece of 
music," she says. "You need a guide -- some information to hang your mind on. 
Orange County needs the wellspring of an educational thrust." 
</P>
<P>
 She also wants audiences to understand that a chamber orchestra is to a 
symphony orchestra what a watercolor painting is to an oil. "It is a small 
orchestra of woods and strings," she explains, "more intimate than a symphony 
orchestra. However, there are moments when the depth and breadth of what we 
express are equal to the greatest of oil paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a violin virtuoso who has performed around the world, Halprin has had a 
hefty share of the limelight. (She played for the Barbra Streisand concerts at 
The Pond at Anaheim and served as concertmaster recently for tenor Jose 
Carreras when he appeared at Radio City Music Hall in New York.) "It has been 
wonderful, glorious," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 A child prodigy, Halprin made her violin solo debut with the Philadelphia 
Orchestra when she was 7. "My parents put a toy piano in my hand at the age of 
2 and discovered I had perfect pitch," says Halprin, who is in her 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put a fiddle in my hand when I was 3, and before I was 4, I was on stage 
over 50 times. It was very difficult, to put it mildly. But I survived it. The 
challenge was to grow up to be a person. I always fought for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, being a person has as much to do with her life in New Mexico -- which 
she shares with fiance Joe Goodman -- as it does with being an orchestra 
conductor in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with attending concerts and educational courses in Santa Fe, the couple 
enjoy evenings with friends. "It's not only a social world we enjoy there," 
Halprin says, "it's a world where you can get in touch with nature and art. Art 
is everywhere -- from the bank to the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Halprin's home in Santa Fe is full of the collectibles she acquired during her 
New York days -- Art Deco pieces by Erte, a faux silver collection by Chase 
("in the '30s, the poor man's sterling," she says) and two unused garage 
refrigerators stuffed with other treasures "we don't have room for." 
</P>
<P>
 She may haul her stored collectibles -- some pieces of beautiful Roseville 
porcelain, among them -- to Orange County when she finds a permanent residence 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "(In Orange County) I have found my artistic home," Halprin says passionately. 
"I can't wait to start conducting." 
</P>
<P>
 For her debut next Sunday, Halprin will not only conduct, she will perform 
Beethoven's Violin Concerto. As a violin soloist with the orchestra for eight 
years, she has earned a following. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have heard that I will conduct are saying, 'Aren't you going to 
play anymore?' So I thought, OK, I'll do a marathon -- show them I can play and 
conduct at the same concert." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that Feminine Power thing at work again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have felt pregnant with something all my life, and, finally, I have a 
chance to give birth to that something in a way I haven't had before."

JACK SMITH: LIFE, THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was sitting the other day in Bullock's Pasadena while my wife shopped for a 
wedding present. I was in a room that seemed to be filled with objets d'art, 
such as porcelain figurines. I was thinking of nothing in particular, just 
waiting for my wife and watching other shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 I was seated at a desk on which I saw a small gold case filled with note 
paper. On the top sheet was written, in ink, the word Why? Nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat there contemplating the anonymous "Why?" I began to wonder why 
whoever had written it had done so. Evidently the author was a person, 
presumably a woman, who, like the rest of us, had no real answer to that 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps she had been waiting for someone else, too, and felt, as I did, rather 
desolate and abandoned. The question, of course, goes back to first things. Why 
are we here? 
</P>
<P>
 As I think I mentioned here recently, the brilliant British physicist Stephen 
Hawking says in his book "Black Holes and Baby Universes" that he too is 
searching for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1974," he says, "I have been working on combining general relativity 
and quantum mechanics into a consistent theory. One result of that has been a 
proposal made in 1983 with Jim Hattle of the University of California at Santa 
Barbara: that both time and space are finite in extent, but they don't have any 
boundary or edge. They would be like the surface of the Earth, but with two 
more dimensions. The Earth's surface is finite in area, but it doesn't have any 
boundary. In all my travels, I have not managed to fall off the edge of the 
world. If this proposal is correct, there would be no singularities, and the 
laws of science would hold everywhere, including at the beginning of the 
universe. The way the universe would begin could be determined by the laws of 
science. I would have succeeded in my ambition to discover how the universe 
began. But I still don't know why it began." 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests to me that my guess as to why we are here is as good as his, 
though I know nothing of quantum mechanics and can't even get my VCR-Plus to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was raised plaintively in that refrain of some years ago: "What's 
it all about, Alfie?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those among us who believe in God have no problem. God created us for reasons 
of his own. But I keep wondering why, if God is infallible, did we turn out so 
bad? Assuming that he created us for his own entertainment, he must find 
watching us much like we find watching sex and violence on television. Surely 
he could have found some better way for us to procreate than by sexual union. 
Why did he create two sexes to begin with? Surely he could have foreseen the 
problems that would cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evolutionist view, we simply began as one-celled creatures who 
developed over the millennia into monkeys and then into human beings. That 
still leaves the question: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein once said, "I shall never believe that God plays dice with the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't understand what Einstein meant by that any more than I understand his 
fourth dimension. But it suggests that he believed in God, and that God was 
responsible for us. That still doesn't answer the question of why? 
</P>
<P>
 (As I was sitting there in Bullock's, several young women strolled by. Some 
had toddlers at their sides or in strollers. It was a Friday. Why weren't these 
young women working at their jobs while their children were in day-care 
centers? Isn't that the way it is?) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a physicist, but I'm entitled to my own theory. I think we have 
evolved from one-celled creatures, but I think that somewhere along the line 
something went wrong. Perhaps the creator erred in giving us two sexes and 
letting us choose our mates. Obviously we have made a lot of other bad choices, 
and the result is war, crime and what's happened to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 As for why we're here, I think Hawking and his colleagues will discover some 
day that we're here because there's nowhere else to be. 
</P>
<P>
 We might go to the end of the Earth looking for somewhere else to live, but of 
course, as Hawking points out, the Earth has no end. One good thing about the 
Earth being round is that you can't fall off. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife finally came back for me. She was empty-handed. She had been unable to 
find a proper present. "What have you been doing?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, thinking," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," I said, "nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 What's it all about, Alfie?

 In the news: Jay Leno, on the upcoming trial of alleged Hollywood madam Heidi 
Fleiss: "It's one of the few cases where the defendant charges more per hour 
than the attorney. Which is unusual, because essentially they are doing the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on the start of jury selection in the O.J. trial: "The defense is going 
to be looking for younger males, because they traditionally distrust authority. 
But the prosecution is going to be looking for really unhappy Hertz customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on accusations that the LAPD went too far in 
gathering evidence with a limited search warrant in the Simpson case: "A recent 
revelation is that they also searched the offices of Daniel Ellsberg's 
psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on the recent study showing that doctors who listen 
to their favorite songs during surgery are more efficient: "That's just as long 
as the music doesn't drown out the sound of the cash register." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the slow change of leadership in Haiti: "Between 
leaders, a transition team always comes in -- Junta Temps." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on finding fossils from the oldest known human 
ancestor -- 4.4 million years old -- in Ethiopia: "Remains included teeth, 
skull fragments, arm bones, and tickets to an early George Burns concert. . . . 
Scientists said the species is a mosaic of primitive and advanced features, 
'not unlike the bass player for Aerosmith.' "

 September marks the anniversary of Francis Scott Key's inspiration to write

it standing up."

 When his daughter, Claire, was 4, reader John E. Bolen of Huntington Beach 
bought her a videotape of "Beauty and the Beast." Among the scenes in the movie 
that caught her attention was when the Beast allows Belle to go anywhere in the 
castle, except the west wing: He roars, "It is forbidden." 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing the movie several times, a puzzled Claire came to me and said 
there was something she couldn't understand.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who is this Bidden guy?" she asked. "And why can he go into the west wing and 
Belle can't?"

IN THE END, LUCK ALWAYS COMES TO RESCUE; THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE BY ROBERT 
EVANS ; HYPERION $24.95, 412 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a perverse moment in history, I was fascinated by the real estate shows on 
cable television, the ones where you get to glide through a house that's for 
sale while a soothing voice describes the details. 
</P>
<P>
 There was something about the tortured syntax that amazed me: The sentences 
weren't just backward, they were fractured in the middle and reset, wrong ends 
out. It was English from outer space. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Robert Evans wrote their scripts on the side. The most astonishing 
thing about a good Hollywood memoir is supposed to be who slept with whom, or 
who was supposed to be cast in the part that someone else got. There is plenty 
of that here, enough to satisfy any show-biz junkie, and fascinating stuff 
about how a place like Paramount works. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am here to tell you, it's not easy to get at. This guy writes the 
chewiest, most discombobulated prose I've ever read (and I am not a grammar 
prude; I end my share of sentences with prepositions and have been known to 
sacrifice propriety for effect). 
</P>
<P>
 There is an absolutely identifiable set of Evans grammatical tics that will, 
depending on your disposition, leave you apoplectic or laughing hysterically. 
Try: "One night in the middle of a rather intimate embrace, four hands grabbed 
me from the back." Is he making love with an octopus? 
</P>
<P>
 Or: "Not wanting to leave him alone at Paramount, Roman moved into my guest 
house," when the him in the first part is also the Roman Polanski of the second 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 To decode all of this: Evans is Sammy Glick in a higher-income bracket, one of 
three impossibly handsome and ambitious children born to Dr. and Mrs. Shapera: 
He the one dentist brave enough to practice and, so, to profit in Harlem; she a 
loving mom. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans and his brother, Charlie, got into women's pants (his joke, not mine) 
just at the moment in history when pants were deemed politically correct, and 
so, before you could say Evan-Picone, he was not only good-looking, he was 
filthy rich. 
</P>
<P>
 So his on-again-off-again acting career turned into a producing career, in 
part because he had the money to buy up properties, in part because he wanted 
to have the one job where he wasn't dependent on the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 I am making this sound much more linear than it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Evans met, married and divorced Sharon Hugueny, Camilla Sparv, 
Ali MacGraw and Phyllis George -- and to hear him tell it, bedded more than his 
quota of lovely damsels, sometimes in between marriages and sometimes during.  
</P>
<P>
 He has worked with Erroll Flynn, Ava Gardner, Francis Ford Coppola, Robert 
Redford, Polanski and Mia Farrow. Jack Nicholson is his avenging angel, Henry 
Kissinger his close personal friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans has had interesting enemies, too, including Steve McQueen, Frank Sinatra 
and plenty of others; this is a cast-of-thousands memoir if ever there were 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges? That Evans has a particular talent for recognizing great 
material and helping to guide it through the Hollywood maze, a not 
inconsiderable skill, even if he can't always depend on it. This is the man who 
brought us "The Godfather" and "Chinatown" -- then turned around and tried to 
sell us "Sliver," a movie whose most provocative question remains, did Sharon 
Stone get to take the wardrobe home? 
</P>
<P>
 If it's difficult to tell where happy memory leaves off and fact begins, 
that's the luxury of writing your own life story. Did Evans really salvage an 
unreleasable "Godfather"? Perhaps we'll have to wait for Coppola's memoir to 
hear the other side. For that matter, did he learn anything from the romances 
he botched? Evans seems to have led a strangely charmed life, one with just 
enough success, just enough last-minute good fortune, to spare him from ever 
stopping to reflect, too deeply, on the life he's lived. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't expect a sadder but wiser tragic hero. Evans ends up as arrogant and 
full of bravado as he started out, not so much because he figured out how to 
maneuver, but because luck continued to break his way. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just the sort of story that civilians love to read, because it keeps the 
dream alive.

 DOUBLE LIFE: They may have made their reputations as novelists, but a handful 
of Orange County authors, including Doug Muir and Jo-Ann Mapson, have another 
title: teacher. This fall, writer Elizabeth George is meeting weekly in her 
Huntington Beach home with 10 students from her Coastline Community College 
class. Says the best-selling George: "I think it's easier for the teacher and 
the students to relate to each other if both are currently working on novels." 
</P>
<P>
 GOING BACK: The hiring of Australian author Thomas Keneally in 1991 to teach 
in UC Irvine's graduate program in writing was a boon to the program. But the 
author of "Schindler's List" says leaving the program at the end of the school 
year will not be easy (E1). . . . "I feel guilt-stricken every time I think 
about it," says Keneally, who has frequently returned to Sydney, Australia, to 
tend to personal and professional business: "It's purely this problem of being 
binational and straddling the Pacific, which is a good way to get a hernia." 
</P>
<P>
 MOVIE DEAL: A movie of UCI writing program alum Whitney Otto's 1991 novel 
about eight members of a quilting bee, "How to Make an American Quilt," begins 
shooting next month under Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment banner. The 
cast includes Winona Ryder, Anne Bancroft and Ellen Burstyn. "We believe we 
have stayed true to the spirit of the book," says producer Sarah Pillsbury. . . 
. Otto is not the first UCI grad to have a book she wrote as her thesis made 
into a movie. In 1991, Marti Leimbach's "Dying Young" became a starring vehicle 
for Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGH TECH: Forget old-fashioned book tours. Now it's TV and radio "satellite 
tours." Laguna Niguel author Nancy Taylor Rosenberg recently did her first live 
satellite feed to promote her new legal thriller, "First Offense." From a New 
York studio she spoke to a succession of 23 different television stations 
around the country. "It's kind of nerve-racking, but it works," she says. . . . 
In addition, Rosenberg's new novel will be advertised on the cable television's 
Court TV during the O.J. Simpson murder trial.

IRVING M. FELT; DEVELOPER AND PHILANTHROPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irving Mitchell Felt, 84, a developer, executive and philanthropist who was 
the guiding force behind the latest incarnation of Madison Square Garden, died 
Thursday at his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 The former chairman of the board of Republic Corp. and onetime head of the 
National Conference of Christians and Jews also had been active politically on 
both coasts. He had been a major fund-raiser for the late Sen. Jacob Javits of 
New York and campaign chairman in 1990 for Republican congressional candidate 
Jim Salomon in his race against veteran San Fernando Valley Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his direction of the creation of the New Madison Square Garden 
Sports and Entertainment Center in New York City that brought his widest public 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It was conceived by Felt in the 1960s as part of a $500-million redevelopment 
project on the eight-acre site of the Pennsylvania Station in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 It included the garden, an amphitheater and a 29-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation also acquired the touring Holiday on Ice shows, the New York 
Rangers hockey team and the New York Knicks basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Felt also served on the boards of Columbia Pictures Inc., Sterling National 
Bank of New York, W & J Sloane, and the Mayflower Hotel in Washington and the 
Plaza Hotel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, he was a director of the Metropolitan Opera, a founder of the Los 
Angeles Music Center, founding patron of Lincoln Center in New York and a 
trustee of the Joffrey Ballet. He was honored by Christian and Jewish 
organizations and by the city of New York when then-Mayor Robert Wagner gave 
him the city's Bronze Medallion for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebrew University of Jerusalem named a Felt Centre of Legal Studies in honor 
of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Serene, two sons, Jonathan and Randolph, a sister, 
Ruby Leader and four grandchildren.

land use laws for the first time in about 20 years. Because there is little 
vacant land in the city, the ordinance will affect mostly "in-fill" 
developments, smaller lots that are combined to form a parcel large enough for 
residential or commercial projects. Under the ordinance, owners of properties 
within 300 feet of the proposed development must be notified of such a 
combination.

 Mission Viejo is Orange County's fasting growing city, according to county 
statistics. Its population increased 11.8%, from 75,241 in 1992 to 84,087 in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fast-growing city is Laguna Niguel, where the population increased 
5.2% (from 50,157 to 52,552), according to the Orange County Progress Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim lost the most residents. Its population dropped 7.4% during the same 
period, from 279,124 to 258,477. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mission Viejo may not hold that distinction for long. A state report 
projects that population growth in the city will slow considerably in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Today 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the proposed North Irvine High School will be unveiled at a 
community meeting from 7 to 8 p.m. at the Woodbridge Community Church, 5000 
Barranca Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects from the Blurock Partnership will review the project along with 
school district facilities planner Corinne Loskot. 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity for public comment will follow the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials want to build the campus in the Northwood area, one of the 
fastest growing villages in Irvine.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: BURBANK GRAPHIC ARTIST LOOKS BACK ON LIFE AS A LITTLE RASCAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by rambunctious children at their neighborhood triplex, Ernest 
Weckbaugh recently watched the Universal Pictures release of "The Little 
Rascals." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the kids enjoyed the film more than Weckbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Depression years, when his mother was struggling to feed her two 
sons on seamstress wages, their Beverly Hills neighbor, director William 
McGann, decided the angelic-looking boy should be in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 And so he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie played the character Stinky between 1937 and 1940 in a half-dozen "Our 
Gang" comedies featuring the original Little Rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 221 episodes of the "Our Gang" series produced between 1922 and 
1940 by Hal Roach at Warner Bros., immortalizing such characters as Alfalfa, 
Buckwheat, Spanky, Farina and Butch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of hundreds of kids chosen to interact with the main characters," 
recalls Weckbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I occasionally had speaking parts, I was usually the little, 
curly-haired blond kid on the tricycle crying, 'Hey, wait for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The part called for curly hair, but Weckbaugh's was straight, so his mother 
sent him off to Horace Mann Elementary School with his hair in curlers. He'd 
have to wear them until the studio called him to the set. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers episodes shot at what was then Warner Bros. Ranch and is now 
Warner Center. It was there he got his lessons in the wonders of movie magic, 
Weckbaugh recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Weckbaugh recalls enduring blasts of water used to suggest a rainstorm, and 
being told to pretend that uncooked oatmeal was really snow. 
</P>
<P>
 He also remembers Alfalfa being told to jump into a small lake, the problem 
being the actor couldn't swim. So a man hid underwater carrying Alfalfa on his 
back while he pretended to swim his little heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 After the "Our Gang" series, Weckbaugh appeared as a Boy Scout who came to the 
rescue of William Powell in "The Thin Man," and as the son of Claude Rains and 
Gail Sondegaard in "Sons of Liberty," about the life of Hyam Solomon, who kept 
the colonial army supplied with money during the Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he grew older, parts grew scarcer. By the time he graduated from Santa 
Monica High School, he was out of show business. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in the Air Force, got married and graduated from Cal State Los 
Angeles with a fine arts degree. Weckbaugh went to work as a graphic artist, a 
skill he still practices through his Burbank company, Casa Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 While teaching a Sunday-school class, he came up with a way to help the 
youngsters in memory retention. It worked so well with the kids that he wrote a 
quartet of books on how to acquire the skill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, he created a program to self-promote his books. He says the 
program worked so well that he and a co-author, publicist Barbara Gaughen, 
self-published a book called "Blitz: Getting Your Book in the News." 
</P>
<P>
 For those needing more hands-on help, Weckbaugh is also playing Svengali. He's 
become a ghostwriter for people with a story to tell who lack the skills to 
tell it.  
</P>
<P>
 His graphics company can print the finished works, and his marketing 
techniques, he says, will get it sold. Chaminade School Honors 5 Little 
Leaguers, Moms 
</P>
<P>
 Jodi Sisson, the community relations manager at Chaminade Intermediate School 
in Chatsworth, watched with pride this summer as the Northridge Little Leaguers 
won a national baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a special interest because five of the team members attend Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisson wondered what they would be like when they returned home after being 
given a parade at Disneyland, having met Mayor Richard Riordan at City Hall and 
fooled around with Orel Hershiser on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 Sisson and Principal Christine Hunter decided to schedule an assembly in honor 
of the boys and their parents before the guys got back to hitting the books 
instead of baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Medals were struck for the boys and roses were to be given to the moms, whose 
efforts Sisson also wanted to honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sisson says that any fears about the kids getting big heads and swollen egos 
were soon dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "All five of our boys and their parents attended the assembly," says Sisson. 
Everything went well, and afterward the Chaminade boys -- Spenser Gordon, 
Nathan Dunlap, Justin Gentile, Jonathan Kigashi and Michael Nesbitt -- all 
appeared to be slipping back into normal school life. Overheard

KING THE WINNER ON A KNOCKOUT; BOXING: MCCALL'S VICTORY PUTS PROMOTER BACK IN 
HEAVYWEIGHT PICTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merely another quiet, chaotic Saturday evening in the heavyweight division: 
Obscure Oliver McCall won a title, logy Lennox Lewis finally paid for his 
awkward style and a familiar face was back as the division's main power broker. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall won the fight, but, even his enemies admit, the second-round technical 
knockout of Lewis for the World Boxing Council title was Don King's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, King, who -- not for lack of trying -- was shut out of heavyweight 
title action since Buster Douglas shocked Mike Tyson more than four years ago, 
has a piece of it again. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tyson, who has repeatedly said he will return to fighting and almost 
certainly will do it under King's aegis, is due to be released from prison in 
May after serving a rape sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, 29, sneered at as merely another sparring partner in the days before 
the bout, stunned Lewis on Sunday morning in London, blasting him with a right 
to the jaw when Lewis, as is his habit, wobbled off balance and exposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, in large part, was Don King's victory," said Rock Newman, who, as 
manager of former champion Riddick Bowe, had lined up a now-irrelevant deal to 
fight Lewis for the WBC belt in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "And whether you like him or dislike him, you've got to respect this guy's 
work ethic and his ability to keep moving forward no matter how much the chips 
are down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kept plugging away, kept stacking the deck with those heavyweights 
and getting them ripe. He kept swinging at the ball and last night he hit one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tenacious guy. I think he's despicable, but I've got to give him 
credit, he's a tenacious despicable guy." 
</P>
<P>
 King, of course, is still facing a nine-count federal indictment for wire 
fraud that could send him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 And Michael Moorer, set to meet 45-year-old George Foreman Nov. 5, still owns 
the other two shares of the heavyweight championship -- the World Boxing Assn. 
and the International Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 But after working his way to the WBC title by getting McCall a mandatory 
challenge as the No. 1 contender, and with Tyson's comeback the most 
anticipated boxing event of this decade, King clearly once again is holding the 
division in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 His options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Already, King is laying the groundwork for a few low-key McCall defenses 
against two or three of the many other rated King fighters, then a title match 
probably in late 1995 against Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 King said McCall's next opponent could be Franz Botha of South Africa or Peter 
McNeely of Boston. King also holds the rights to Tony Tucker, ranked No. 2 and 
about to be ranked No. 1 by the WBC, WBA and IBF, Bruce Seldon, ranked No. 3 by 
the IBF and WBA, and many other top 10-rated fighters in all three divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oliver will make two or three defenses and by that time Mike Tyson will be 
out of prison," King said to reporters in London. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall sparred with Tyson before the ex-champion defended the undisputed title 
against Douglas in February 1990 at Tokyo, where Douglas knocked out Tyson in 
the 10th round. Douglas got the title shot by outpointing McCall in July 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my ultimate goal, you hear," McCall said in London. "To knock out 
Tyson, the No. 1 guy, who I helped prepare for nine title defenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Moorer manager John Davimos: "King's going to hold that title, going to 
make it even more worthless by having McCall fight nobodys and hold it for 
Tyson. McCall's a caretaker." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agree to a rematch with Lewis, who claimed that referee Lupe Garcia stopped 
the bout too quickly at 31 seconds of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 But a rematch would risk handing the title back to promoter Dan Duva, who also 
promotes Moorer, and that is extremely unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lewis' rematch) chances are slim and none," King said, "and slim is out of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cut a deal with Newman for a McCall-Bowe fight, with the winner facing 
Tyson in a mega-title bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe is widely regarded to be the most talented fighter in the division, and 
is a proven pay-per-view draw, but is not tied to King or Duva and has not been 
able to position himself for a mandatory challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bowe is in a deep, cold place right now," Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, who has maintained a fiercely independent path for Bowe, Sunday 
sounded like he was ready to negotiate with King, perhaps willing to give King 
some part of Bowe's future in return for a McCall fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don King is very, very aggressive, and he's very, very smart," Newman said. 
"And I think an intelligent and aggressive guy who has Oliver McCall would 
recognize what an opportunity it would be to have himself associated with 
Riddick Bowe." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moorer, recognized as the legitimate heavyweight champion by most 
of the boxing world because he beat Evander Holyfield, faces the possibility of 
being pushed out of the Tyson sweepstakes -- and out of the public's attention 
span. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does the public think Mike Tyson is the best? Is Riddick Bowe the best? Hey, 
the only one who won it in the ring is Michael Moorer," Davimos said. "He's got 
to be recognized as the heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as people get to know him, I think he'll become more marketable." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of Moorer-Foreman, meanwhile, faces a mandatory defense situation 
against King's fighter, Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 If Moorer defeats Foreman, another possibility would be Moorer vs. Bowe. But 
Davimos says that though Bowe has credibility as a fighter, he has no leverage 
after losing the Lewis match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Riddick had as bad a night last night as Lennox did, that the 
repercussions to Riddick are beyond what anybody could conceive," Davimos said.

MONTANA, CHIEFS HAVE NOTHING ON RAMS; COMMENTARY; SLATER GETS IN SWING OF 
THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 18 years of being slapped in the head, gouged in the eye, kneed in the 
groin, leg-whipped in the thigh, elbowed in the ribs, kicked in the shins and 
clawed in the neck, Jackie Slater, revered Ram father figure, finally lost it 
here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened during the waning moments in the kind of game we've all come to 
expect from the Rams by now -- Rams 16, Joe Montana nada -- right after Slater 
cleared out Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith and waved Jerome Bettis on 
through for nine yards and one last clock-killing first down. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sound of the whistle, Slater hopped to his feet, grabbed an imaginary 
bat, stepped into an imaginary fastball and took a long, slow, exaggerated 
swing through the pitch -- mimicking the annoying little routine Smith performs 
every time he beats someone like Slater and sacks a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who know Slater, this was akin to watching cows fly, goal posts 
spontaneously combust or Joe Montana get picked off thrice in four quarters by 
the Ram defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," Ram safety Marquez Pope said, his voice full of wonder, "that's weird." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was beautiful," cornerback Todd Lyght assessed, totally bemused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't stop laughing," nickel back Robert Bailey said. "Because it's, 
like, 'Wow, we're beating the best team in the NFL, the team everybody says is 
going to the Super Bowl, and Jackie's doing something like that? An old-timer, 
doing that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who could believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 Who could believe any of it -- the 16 points scored by the Rams, the zero 
points scored by the Chiefs, the Rams at .500 this late in the season, the 
ever-stoic Slater putting it back in the face of the ever-excitable All-Pro 
Smith? 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a little out of character, wasn't it?" Slater said, laughing in 
front of his locker stall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just excited. I was very proud of my teammates and the way I battled 
certainly one of the best young defensive ends in the league. That play sealed 
the victory for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just feeling real good, proving that I can still play the game at my 
age, having fun out there and coming out on the winning side in a big game." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and one other thing: 
</P>
<P>
 On the previous play, Smith "kind of accidentally got his hand in my face mask 
and fingernails in my eyeballs," Slater noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation cried out for vengeance, so there was Slater at midfield, taking 
Smith deep, so to speak, for all the world to see. 
</P>
<P>
 And how did Smith respond to such public humiliation? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he said he liked it," Slater deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like Smith, all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that thunder clapping or Smith's tongue flapping in the Chiefs' locker 
room after the game? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'll have my days too," Smith declared. "I kicked his (behind) the whole 
game. He needs to face up to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have no day on me. I was on his quarterback more than he was on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a crazy man, that's all I have to say. He must be doing something right, 
to be playing this long." 
</P>
<P>
 At 40, appearing in his Ram-record 250th NFL game, Slater simply got caught up 
in the trash-talking, finger-pointing mood generated this afternoon by 
teammates young enough to be his sons. 
</P>
<P>
 After four wretched losing seasons, the four worst of his long career, Slater 
must have fought back a tear or two as he watched the Rams swagger around the 
field the way real winning teams do. What sights, what sounds. Anthony Newman 
hitting a man and knocking him when he's down. Bailey jawing with Chief wide 
receiver Willie Davis all day and backing up the talk with unusually 
hyperactive play. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely the point, claimed Bailey, who was still seething over the Chiefs' 
decision to eschew the field goal and gamble on fourth down not once but twice 
-- once on fourth and 13 from the Ram 34. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was disrespectful," Bailey said, "and it pumped me up. Just because 
we're the Rams, you're going to go for it on fourth and 12? Hey, we get paid 
just like they do. To me, that was the ultimate disrespect." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey voiced his views to Davis whenever he was within earshot, which was 
every time Bailey stepped onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept yelling at him, 'Who do you think you're playing? A high school team? 
Well, this is no high-school team. And as long as I'm on you, I'm shutting you 
down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davis got an earful, and a face full. He caught only three passes for 50 
yards, only one while Bailey was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do unorthodox stuff like that," Bailey said, "it's going to come 
back and get you. You go around, ask any of the other 28 teams in the league if 
you go for it on fourth and 12. No team is going to say 'Yes, go for it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They broke that rule, and you saw what happened to them. They got goose eggs. 
They broke the golden rule. When you break the golden rule, you get no 
sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
 That went for every Ram on Sunday, including, incredibly, Slater, usually the 
epitome of gentlemanly reserve and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is very out of character for him," Bailey said, "but this is Jackie's 
last year on our team. Everybody figured it before this season and he's already 
kind of announced it informally to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want to go out on a bad note, like last year. He wants to go out 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Slater is doing just that, holding his own against an All-Pro defensive 
end and wishing "I could have played him in my prime." Practicing his baseball 
swing out there on the wet grass. Acting like a kid again.

USC'S RAVELING SUFFERS NINE BROKEN RIBS IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling was hospitalized Sunday after being 
injured in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, was listed in fair but stable condition at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center with nine broken ribs and fractures of his collarbone 
and pelvis, a spokeswoman for County-USC Medical Center said.Later in the 
evening, Raveling was moved to USC University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's alert and he's been communicating with family and friends," the 
spokeswoman said. "He's under observation and will be so for at least 24 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling's Jeep Cherokee collided with a BMW at the intersection of 39th 
Street and Arlington Avenue at about 8 a.m. Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Robert Ziehm, the driver of the BMW, also was injured. Ziehm could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges had been filed as of Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who in July turned down a coaching offer at Seton Hall to remain at 
USC, is entering his ninth season with the Trojans and has a 336-292 record in 
his 22-year college coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who is 115-118 at USC, has led the Trojans to four consecutive 
post-season berths, with his best season in 1992 when he directed USC to a 
school record for victories with a 24-6 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm receiving excellent care and I'm confident the doctors will give me the 
necessary treatment for a speedy recovery," Raveling said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is scheduled to open practice on Oct. 15.

PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS 16, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 0; CHIEFS' MONTANA HAS GAME TO 
FORGET; FOOTBALL: RAM DEFENSE GIVES HIM PROBLEMS AS KANSAS CITY IS SHUT OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They were statistics you expected from a Ram quarterback on a typical Sunday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Three interceptions, 18 completions in 37 attempts, no touchdowns and no 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So who was responsible for this mess Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the Rams' Chris Miller, who was on the sideline nursing rib and 
shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was it Miller's replacement, Chris Chandler, who got a victory in his 
first Ram start. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the responsible party was none other than Kansas City quarterback Joe 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Robert Young and Sean Gilbert, the Ram pass rush shut out Montana for 
the first time in his 16-year NFL career as the Rams beat the Chiefs, 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no big deal," Montana said of the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was to the Rams, who were 7-12 lifetime against the San Francisco 49ers 
with Montana was their quarterback, including an 0-9 record against him at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Montana's first loss in eight games in Arrowhead Stadium since he was 
traded from the 49ers to the Chiefs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the first time more than two Montana passes were intercepted in a 
game since a 28-17 49er loss to the Rams on Nov. 25, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offensively, we did nothing all day," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's loss capped a miserable week for Montana and the Chiefs, who had 
beaten three NFC West teams to start the season -- New Orleans, San Francisco 
and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 Kansas City players were struck by a virus during the week, 
including Montana, who received intravenous fluids Sunday before the game to 
battle the flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," said Montana, who had a four-inch bandage on his right cheek to 
cover a gash he suffered during the game. "Friday I had the chills, but nothing 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Montana got off to a rough start against a Rams' defensive line that 
was persistent in its pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting hit three times early, Montana, under a heavy rush from Young, 
tossed a wobbling pass toward the sideline that was nowhere near a receiver, 
but was right in the hands of Ram linebacker Roman Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover set up a 23-yard field goal by Tony Zendejas that pushed the 
Rams' lead to 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was stupid," Montana said of the pass. "I should have thrown that ball 
into the ground, but I was trying to throw it over him, out of bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was a play indicative of how Montana's afternoon would shape up. This 
time, there was no Montana magic, no last-second, game-winning drives that 
still haunt Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Chiefs trailing, 13-0, in the third quarter, he killed a drive at the 
Chiefs' 34 when he recovered his own fumble on third and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana had only 81 yards passing entering the fourth quarter, but put 
together two drives in the fourth quarter that ended in turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw a line drive over the middle that strong safety Marquez Pope 
intercepted at the Rams' goal line with five minutes 41 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie safety Keith Lyle ended the final drive when he intercepted Montana in 
the end zone with 3:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of times I was trying to work the other side of the field and the 
guy on the other side was open," Montana said. "It was one of those days where 
the other guy was always open." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana didn't get much help from his receivers, who dropped at least four 
balls and will never be confused with Jerry Rice or John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sure Joe didn't find the right guy today?" wide receiver Willie Davis 
said. "Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure it wasn't because he didn't 
have time to throw? That someone was in his face all day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert recorded his first sack of the season when he leveled Montana for a 
nine-yard loss in the first half. Young tipped two Montana passes and was an 
arm's length away from sacking him all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have a very, very good front four and we knew that coming in," 
Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. "They're big and they created a 
lot of problems for Joe in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played a zone defense in the secondary, two and three deep. And with 
their good pass rush, we couldn't get anything going."

PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS 16, KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 0; RAM NOTEBOOK; BETTIS GETS HIS GAME 
BACK ON RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram tailback Jerome Bettis rarely got the ball in the second half the past two 
weeks, when the Rams were throwing to catch up with Atlanta and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed Sunday in the Rams' 16-0 victory over Kansas City on Sunday 
at Arrowhead Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in pouring rain in the second half, the Rams turned to Bettis to 
protect a 13-0 halftime lead. He carried the ball 21 times in the second half 
for 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Quarterback) Chris Chandler showed some great poise," Kansas City defensive 
end Neil Smith said. "But the game wasn't in his hands. It was in Bettis' 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis rushed for 132 yards in 35 carries, his third consecutive game of more 
than 100 yards and the 10th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 His 35 carries were second only to his team-record 39, against Chicago last 
season. The Rams are 3-7 in games that Bettis has rushed for 100 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis left the game in the second quarter with a right thigh bruise sustained 
when he was hit by Chief safety David Whitmore. Bettis returned on the Rams' 
next possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "He caught me on the hip," Bettis said. "I had to go out for a while and work 
the pain out." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing against Bettis, Smith compared him to former Houston back Mike 
Rozier, who played at Nebraska just before Smith played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bettis reminds me a lot of Rozier, the way he takes care of the ball in 
traffic," Smith said. "He's an All-Pro and he's going to be around for a long, 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Smith paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know how long if they keep giving him the ball like that," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith appeared to be winded in the second half after twice blowing by Ram 
rookie Wayne Gandy, who had replaced veteran Jackie Slater for a while at right 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Smith's impression of Gandy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the Rams got control of the game," Smith said, "they could have had 
anyone in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, 40, a 19-year veteran, played in his 250th game Sunday, tying him with 
Pat Leahy for fifth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: Chuck Belin, playing his first regular-season NFL game, 
replaced left guard Leo Goeas, who hurt his left ankle. X-rays of Goeas' ankle 
were negative but he left the locker room on crutches. . . . X-rays also were 
negative on linebacker Roman Phifer's dislocated elbow.

PRO FOOTBALL; COURAGE PROVES CHARGERS' STRONG SUIT; PRO FOOTBALL: HUMPHRIES' 
DECISION TO STAY IN THE GAME, ROSS' FOURTH-AND-ONE CALL MADE ALL OF THE 
DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter Sunday, the San Diego 
Chargers looked like a beaten team. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 20-point second-half lead, the Chargers suddenly found 
themselves trailing the Raiders, 24-23, while their quarterback, Stan 
Humphries, lay on the Coliseum turf grabbing his left knee in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next five minutes, things got worse for San Diego as team doctors told 
Humphries that he was done for the day and that it was best for him not to take 
any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the Chargers' style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan is that type of quarterback who finishes what he starts," San Diego 
running back Ronnie Harmon said. "I would have been surprised if he didn't go 
back out there. Only if he couldn't walk would he not have been on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Chargers huddled for their final drive of the game at their 
20-yard line, Humphries hobbled past backup quarterback Gale Gilbert on the 
sideline to join his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just went," San Diego Coach Bobby Ross said of Humphries. "He was told not 
to go back in, but he just went." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Humphries figured it, he had no choice. That's because his last pass 
had been intercepted by the Raiders' Lionel Washington and returned 31 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't anything that was going to keep me out of the game," said 
Humphries, who completed 18 of 26 passes for 191 yards with two interceptions. 
"No one really said anything once I got to the sideline because I tried to be 
off by myself. I just tried to think about what I had to do and then I went out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries' toughness is something that has helped make him the offensive 
leader the Chargers have needed. Instead of panicking under the Raiders' 
fourth-quarter rally, San Diego calmly went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you noticed, everyone on the sideline and on the field was relaxed," San 
Diego running back Eric Bieniemy said. "Regardless of what happens, the team 
responds to pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 After driving to the Raiders' 41-yard line with two minutes remaining, 
Humphries was sacked for a six-yard loss by linebacker Winston Moss. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Humphries and the Chargers' go-to man, Harmon, took over. On third 
and 14, Harmon caught a sideline pass for 13 yards that Humphries thought was 
enough to set up John Carney for a winning 49-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the Chargers' style, either. So with 1:52 remaining, Ross 
called for a pass to Harmon on fourth and one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought that we were going to kick it then," Humphries said. "But 
our coaching staff has a lot of guts. I was surprised to see us go for it but 
excited at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon, who caught six passes for 74 yards, lined up in the left slot and ran 
a curl route in between the Raiders' Mike Jones and Derrick Hoskins. Humphries 
found him for eight yards and a first down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to give them the ball back with so much time," Ross said. 
"It was not a case of believing that John Carney couldn't make it from 49 
yards. I just wanted to get closer and run down the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Chargers only had to protect the ball and move into position 
for Carney, who kicked a 33-yard field goal with two seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one of those things no matter what call you make," Ross said of 
the pass to Harmon. "If you make it, you're great. If you miss, you're not. All 
I can say is that this was as gutsy a win as I've ever been associated with."

NO GAME? NO PROBLEM; 50,000 SHOW UP IN ST. LOUIS FOR CARDINALS' 'FAN 
APPRECIATION DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging from the scene at Busch Stadium on Sunday, the St. Louis Cardinals 
should have no trouble luring their fans back after the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 No ballgame? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd estimated at more than 50,000, most wearing Cardinal red, turned out 
for a free "fan appreciation day." The event was one of the first moves by new 
team president Mark Lamping, who has said the fans probably have suffered the 
most in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermittent rain didn't deter the fans, who waited in line as long as an hour 
to get in the park on what would have been the season finale against the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans were allowed on the field, and they lined up 20 deep to run the bases. 
Tours were conducted of the clubhouse, the press box and admission was free to 
the Hall of Fame Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamping and Manager Joe Torre worked the crowd on the field, 14 former 
Cardinals gave playing tips and manned autograph booths, and Hall of Famers 
Stan Musial and Red Schoendienst made appearances at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also gave out free tickets good for a game next season and offered 
all concession stand food items for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 It apparently was too much to resist, even for fans disgruntled by the eighth 
and most serious work stoppage baseball has experienced in the last 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball ought to give the fans some sort of World Series, some sort of 
finale, even if it's just one game," said Ray Shell, 13, of Godfrey, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered how much I love baseball," said Bob Axley, 26, of St. Charles, 
who took his 4-year-old son Brandon to the event. "The strike is pretty 
disheartening, but I'm sure I'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals certainly won't take such positive statements for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, it looks like they'll be back," Cardinal spokesman Brian Bartow said. 
"Only time will tell. Management, owners and players -- everyone's going to 
have to do a big image cleanup after this is all over. We felt it was important 
to start this now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wait until the strike is over?"

EXON STANDS OUT IN CROWD BECAUSE OF HER PLAY; TENNIS: SHE DOESN'T SAY MUCH, BUT 
AT NO. 1 SINGLES FOR WOODBRIDGE, SHE SPEAKS VOLUMES ON THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't Natalie Exon's style to speak up. She has played No. 1 singles for 
the Woodbridge girls' tennis team two seasons, but she wants no part of being 
the team leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a huge group of juniors," Exon says. "I'm still just a sophomore. 
It's not really my place to say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But if she likes it or not, Exon is the Warriors' best and most popular 
player. As a freshman, she had a 55-8 singles record and advanced to the Sea 
View League semifinals, one victory short of qualifying for the Southern 
Section individual tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, Exon was named the team's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls absolutely love her," Woodbridge Coach Joan Willett said. "That 
award isn't given just for winning matches. The girls always choose someone 
they admire as the team's MVP." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Exon entered Woodbridge as a highly-ranked junior player, Willett said 
Exon has never put herself above the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't want to stick out as an individual," Willett said. "In fact, 
everywhere she goes, there is a crowd around. In the yearbook, there is a 
picture called 'Natalie and friends.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when she's in the middle of a close match, she is always asking how so 
and so is doing in her match. A lot of tournament players come in and don't 
want to play high school tennis, but Natalie has been excited about being part 
of this team from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Exon said she was proud of what her team accomplished last season, even if 
some of it wasn't documented. Woodbridge went 16-5, qualified for the section 
playoffs and handed Sea View League champion Newport Harbor its only league 
defeat. Somehow, Exon said the victory over Newport Harbor never made it into 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our win over Newport Harbor was never recorded," Exon said. "It always said 
in all the papers that Newport Harbor was 14-0 league. That really bothers us." 
</P>
<P>
 Exon also was bothered that her team was ignored in all the preseason top-10 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been ranked, but we don't seem to get much respect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge gained some respect early this season when they lost to top-ranked 
Laguna Beach by only two games. The Warriors (6-1) have moved into the top 10 
and are ranked sixth by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really annoying to think of that Laguna match," she said. "A lot of 
girls could have won more games, including me. I had some game points in my 
sets that I could have won and didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Exon has won 18 of 21 sets this season, losing only to El Modena's Brandi 
Freudenberg, 6-1, and Laguna Beach's Michelle Bray and Amanda 
Hastings-Phillips, 6-4. Exon realizes there probably will be more frustrating 
losses to come as she moves her game from the baseline to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The first steps of that transition have not been kind to Exon's Southern 
California ranking. While working with her father, who is also her coach, over 
the summer, Exon played in only a couple junior tournaments and saw her girls' 
16 singles ranking fall from 25 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 "My summer wasn't too good," she said. "I'm constantly learning and still 
going through the process. I'm trying to come to the net more and develop more 
of a serve and more variety in my shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is getting the aggressiveness. I'm more of a passive type 
player. That really fits my personality." 
</P>
<P>
 But Exon is beginning to understand that being aggressive will save her some 
aggravation and pain in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shortens the matches and ends the points quicker when you get to the net," 
Exon said. "It prevents me from having leg cramps during long points." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Exon's cramps came during the third set of her Sea View League 
semifinal match with Irvine's Sarah Denson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the cramps come, I slow down," she said. "I can't run and that's one of 
my strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Exon acknowledges her cramping could probably be avoided if she took more 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times at school, I'll have a Coke and some junk food for lunch, then 
go out and play a match," she said. "I don't have good habits, but I'm trying 
to change."

BURNED-OUT CAPRIATI HAD CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE; TENNIS: FIRST-ROUND DEFEAT AT 
1993 U.S. OPEN WAS DEVASTATING. NOW HER RETURN IS DELAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burned out by tennis and despairing over her appearance and relationships, 
Jennifer Capriati says she once thought about killing herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview published Monday in the New York Times, Capriati spoke of a 
tennis career that began spectacularly at age 13 but left her in anguish four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Her problems came to a head after losing to Leila Meskhi in the first round of 
the 1993 U.S. Open. She had nightmares after losing in the Open in 1991 and 
began crying incessantly after this latest loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out OK, but at the end of the match I couldn't wait to get off the 
court," she told the newspaper. "Totally, mentally, I just lost it, and 
obviously it goes deeper than that one match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really was not happy with myself, my tennis, my life, my parents, my 
coaches, my friends. . . . When I looked in my mirror, I actually saw this 
distorted image: I was so ugly and fat, I just wanted to kill myself, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, 18, last played professionally in the 1993 Open. She was planning to 
make her comeback next week in Zurich, Switzerland, and the following week in 
Filderstadt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Times said, she has delayed her return because of a groin injury. 
It was not clear when she intends to play next. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati told the Times she feels many of her problems stem from turning 
professional too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always expected to be at the top, and if I didn't win, to me that meant 
I was a loser," she said. "I felt like my parents and everybody else thought 
that tennis was the way to make it in life, they thought it was good, but I 
thought no one knew or wanted to know the person who was behind my tennis 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, "it's just a game to me now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about being No. 1, but I'm ready and willing to give it a 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 16, she was arrested in a Coral Gables, Fla., motel and was arrested on 
a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession. She went into a 28-day treatment 
program in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, after having not touched a racket for months, said she realized she 
wanted to play tennis again last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like I wanted to go back to it yet," she said. "But when I thought 
about the slams, I always thought, 'I'll be there again.' "

Q & A: AFTER A LAYOFF: NOW WHAT TO DO?; TON BUI, HEAD OF A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL IN 
ORANGE, TALKS ABOUT RETRAINING. HE SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE -- HE'S BEEN THROUGH 
IT. IT CAN BE THE PATH TO RE-EMPLOYMENT IN A DIFFICULT ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a two-story brick building here, dozens of laid-off workers squint at 
computers or stoop over drafting desks. Others can be seen outside in the 
building's parking lot, taking deep drags on their cigarettes and staring into 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the faces that Ton Bui sees every day as president of MTI College, a 
vocational school. Like other training centers, Bui's business has grown 
because of an influx of Orange County workers who have lost their jobs. But as 
people increasingly look to such schools as a path to re-employment, many are 
asking questions about the training programs and what's best for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui, 46, has owned and operated MTI College since 1984. A philosophy teacher 
in his native Vietnam, Bui himself went through a vocational training program 
after working at a variety of jobs, including mopping floors for minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Bui spoke about the basics of job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How do I know whether I need training? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: If you are not sure, the results of your effort to find employment 
should give signals whether or not you need additional training. Usually after 
10 interviews you should know what you don't have. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers these days are looking for someone with not just the tools to 
do the job but additional tools. Later on, the employer may want them to do 
something different. It is your job to ask the employer, "Please tell me, what 
do I need to apply later on for a job with your company?" Be very frank with 
the employer. Usually they will tell you. You need to come away from your 
interview with that answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I go about picking the area for training? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you were laid off, you already had at least one career. That is an asset 
you have now. So when you try to find out what different area of study to go 
into, you should first look at whether that study will enhance your current 
skills. You don't want to throw away your past skill. 
</P>
<P>
 The second thing is, now you may have a chance to do something you really 
like. Search deep inside yourself and find out what you really like to do and 
what you feel comfortable doing. And talk to your family. They will have to 
listen to you later about your decision, whether you like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 And try to look at something that will last you until you retire. A common 
mistake is that people pick something that looks at the current market demand. 
You should not plan your future, your career or training on a six-month or 
one-year job market. It's very hard to predict, but you have to do your best. 
Talk to people, go to EDD (Employment Development Department). About 10 years 
ago, when computers were still very expensive, we had one student who spent 
about six or seven grand to buy an XT personal computer. He knew that computers 
would be the wave of the future, and now he's excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do I do if I can't find work in the field for which I have completed 
training? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Usually you learn a skill that can be applied to different areas of 
employment. Someone who learns paralegal studies, for example, can work for not 
just law firms. They can work for an insurance company, a corporation, city or 
counties, anything to do with legal issues -- legal secretary, legal clerk, 
assistant to paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
 You are learning something that can be applied, and not just 100% for what you 
want to become. There are students who go out of training, and they want to 
work specifically in that area. But in many cases it won't work that way. When 
a job opportunity comes up that's related to what you learned, go ahead and do 
it. Take the job, get a paycheck, bring bread and butter to your family. Then 
sharpen your skills, and then look again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I pick the right school for training? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, you need to see list of available schools -- in the phone directory, 
Economic Development Department, ads in newspapers. Then select the school that 
provides what you need or want to learn, and contact them for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is the most important: Ask for the placement statistics. The 
school with about 65% placement or above is a stable school. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, talk to the job placement office, tour the school. You need to be 
exposed to the classroom environment, you need to observe. The key thing is, 
you have to ask the school how the program is to be delivered. Most of the 
schools have the same idea of what they teach. But how is it being taught? 
Who's teaching the curriculum? Does the teacher have industry-related 
experience? The curriculum, is it industry related? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can the student do to get the most out of training? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Training is one of the products where the buyer has to perform the majority 
of the work. The more the buyer studies, the better the product becomes, and 
the less the buyer depends on the seller or the teachers, the better the 
product may be. 
</P>
<P>
 The curriculum is designed for an average student, but if you think you can do 
better, then let the teachers know so they can help you excel. Besides making 
sure the school teaches according to the curriculum, you have to try to excel 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After completing training, how long can I expect to be out in the job 
market before I land a job? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's no simple answer to that. I would talk to the job placement 
department at the school. I would ask for a list or example of students who 
have the same background as I do and went through the same program. Find out 
the student who got a job almost right away and the student who got a job two, 
three months later and students who never got jobs. Try to contact them. If you 
can't, ask the placement officer, and try to learn from that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What pay expectations can I have in my new job? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It depends. I may be able to get what I got before if I land a job doing 
what I did before, though it may be in another state or another country. If I 
present myself only with my new skill, I know I will not get paid a lot. But if 
I can combine my old skill and new skill, I have a chance to make even more 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But how do I pursue that? It takes a lot of planning, a lot of determination. 
People who almost give up on themselves and say, "I'll never get paid that 
much," . . . it's hard for them to get the money they want. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What advice do you have for aerospace workers who are laid off? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One perception about aerospace workers is that they are highly specialized 
technicians. How can I overcome that? If you look at the resume of the same 
guy, one resume might say, "I worked on the B-1 bomber control console." But 
that same resume could be changed instead to "remote control device."

to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or

 Question: Can a company continually move you from shift to shift anytime it 
likes? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.P. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Unless otherwise provided in an employment agreement or a manual or by 
company policy, an employer is pretty much free to set working conditions, 
including a requirement that the employee work different shifts. I assume, 
however, that you are being paid extra for any overtime for all hours worked 
over eight hours in a day and over 40 hours in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas M. Apke, attorney, professor of business law, Cal State Fullerton 
</P>

 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Our office has recently instituted a new policy in which non-exempt 
employees must sign in and out for the day and in and out at lunchtime.  
</P>
<P>
 We were told that it was a state law. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.P., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Employers are required to keep accurate time records that show 
when non-exempt employees begin and end each work period. Because the records 
must reflect the "actual hours worked" of such workers, employers may not rely 
on work schedules that have been posted in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no legal mandate that the employee keep the record, but some 
employers require them to do so and they require the employee's signature as 
proof of hours worked. Meal periods, split-shift intervals and total daily 
hours worked must be recorded. There is no requirement, however, to record 
authorized rest periods, since such periods are paid for. Neither do you need 
to record meal periods when the total business operations cease.

 Question: With all the stories in the news about sexual harassment lawsuits, 
should a company consider creating an "anti-fraternization" policy to 
discourage dating among co-workers, which could later result in legal action? 
If no policy is recommended, how can management work to ensure no illegal 
behavior occurs? -- L.H., Costa Mesa 
</P>

 Answer: An anti-fraternization policy seems a bit extreme, particularly if 
there have been no problems resulting from dating between workers at your 
company. What does make sense, however, is to develop a policy concerning 
sexual harassment and to foster a company culture effective in discouraging it. 
In many instances, sexual harassment occurs out of ignorance. Therefore, a 
number of companies have begun information workshops and other training 
programs to educate workers and managers about sexual harassment issues.

 Question: I took a full-time job two years ago as a secretary- bookkeeper for 
a real estate broker. I answered phones, wrote checks, made calls to arrange 
repairs and ran personal errands for the broker. I worked in her office and 
received paid holidays, sick days and vacation. Eventually, my duties were 
expanded to include holding open houses on rental units. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem is that I was never paid for the overtime I worked in 1992, because 
the broker maintains that I was an independent contractor working for the 
various owners of the real estate being managed. Am I entitled to overtime pay? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.F. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The law generally provides that an employee who works more than 40 
hours a week is entitled to overtime pay. You have correctly identified the 
extent of the employer's control over the work as the most important factor in 
determining whether or not you might be considered an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 You can obtain a ruling on your right to overtime pay from the California 
labor commissioner. For further information, call the commissioner's Division 
of Labor Standards Enforcement at (714) 558-4111.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: MARKETS CAST WORRIED LOOK AS FED MULLS 6TH RATE HIKE 
</P>

<P>
 As a strategy for avoiding financial heartache, this one has been unbeatable 
in 1994: Sell out of your stocks and bonds 15 days before the quarter ends. Go 
lie on the beach for a few weeks or so. 
</P>
<P>
 With the third quarter drawing to a close, the markets find themselves in the 
same painful situation that marked the end of the first and second quarters. 
Stocks are falling, bond yields are rising and the dollar is sinking. 
</P>
<P>
 And once again, investors are seemingly at the mercy of the Federal Reserve 
Board, which meets Tuesday to decide whether to raise short-term interest rates 
for a sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they or won't they? The betting among economists, for what it's worth, is 
that the central bank will leave rates alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters news service polled 30 economists on Friday and found only five who 
expect a rate increase. While there is concern that the economy is still 
expanding at too fast a pace for the Fed's liking, many Fed watchers believe 
that Chairman Alan Greenspan & Co. risk damage to their credibility if they act 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last half-point rate increase, on Aug. 16, the Fed officially said 
it was finished boosting rates, "at least for a time." One can argue about what 
exactly that meant, but many economists contend that there was an implied 
promise by the Fed to sit and digest a couple of months' worth of data on the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were inclined to wait," says Gary Schlossberg, economist at 
Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the inflation hawks at the Fed could respond that the 0.6% rise in 
August wholesale prices reported on Sept. 9 -- the biggest gain in four years 
-- was enough of a shock to warrant new action to brake the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, reports last week on the July trade deficit and August housing 
starts also painted a picture of robust demand for goods and services in the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen Sinai, economist at Lehman Bros. in Boston, figures that Fed board 
members must be acutely aware that their five previous rate hikes this year may 
simply need more time to sink in. The Fed's credit-tightening moves have raised 
the bank prime lending rate by nearly one-third since February, from 6% to 
7.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is slowing -- but how much (the Fed) isn't sure," Sinai says. 
"Though inflation has ticked up, the question is whether the economy's slowdown 
will take inflation back down in six months to acceptable levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Schlossberg, Sinai figures the Fed will pass Tuesday. "I'd say its 60-40 
that they don't (raise)." 
</P>
<P>
 But what do investors really want to see -- an inflation-vigilant Fed, or a 
more patient central bank that gives the economy the benefit of the doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market, at least, appears to be begging for another Fed rate boost. 
The 30-year Treasury bond yield has zoomed this month from 7.45% to 7.78%, a 
27-month high. In theory, anyway, long-term bond yields are the best barometer 
of inflation expectations. If yields are up, bond investors are expecting the 
Fed to take a stronger stand against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market, which along with the bond market had rallied in 
mid-August and thus blessed the Fed's Aug. 16 rate hike, may take a dimmer view 
of another rate increase so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Manufacturers said Sunday that a poll of its members 
showed the majority opposing a Fed rate hike this week. Their fear is that the 
Fed could crush the economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a plunge in auto-related stocks helped take the Dow industrial 
average down 101 points for the week, to 3,831.75 by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto stocks' slump may be a warning that further Fed rate increases would 
be greeted negatively by investors, not positively. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Sullivan, editor of the Chartist newsletter in Seal Beach, contends that 
the bull market is dying a slow death at the Fed's hands. The signs are 
unmistakable that investors are increasingly losing interest in stocks, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 During the powerful late-August rally in the Dow industrials, for example, 
rising stocks on the Big Board failed to decisively outnumber declining issues 
by the kind of ratio you'd expect to see if the market were readying a big move 
up, Sullivan argues. "Market momentum is invariably very weak at the end of 
bull markets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Wall Streeters, however, see little difference between the latest stock 
selloff and the ones that struck at the end of the first and second quarters. 
These bulls view stocks' losses as mild and temporary -- a good time for 
bargain-hunters to be shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Once healthy third-quarter corporate profit reports begin rolling in by early 
October, interest-rate concerns will recede again, says James Solloway, 
research chief at Argus Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising corporate earnings "have been a major offset to the negative influence 
of higher interest rates," Solloway says, and he doesn't see that offset losing 
its power yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as short- and long-term interest rates climb, the stock market is 
increasingly threatened by simple competition: At some point, money managers 
will find bond yields so enticing that they may sell stocks to buy bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we there yet? Mary Jane Matts, director of equity research at $20-billion 
Society Asset Management in Cleveland, thinks so. The bond market has been in a 
horrendous bear cycle for nearly 12 months, she notes, while stocks have held 
up remarkably well. If you're looking for value, she says, you're more likely 
to find it in a 10-year Treasury note yielding 7.56% than in the typical stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stocks don't look terribly overvalued until you compare them to bonds," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how attractive bonds have become relative to stocks may become evident 
this week, as the Treasury auctions new two-year and five-year notes. Notes of 
those maturities currently yield 6.49% and 7.19%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 If the public rushes into those securities -- with or without a Fed rate hike 
-- it could be a sign that investors are sensing at least a temporary top in 
rates. That could be better for the bond market than for the stock market in 
the near term, but it's also not a stretch to suggest that, short of outright 
recession, what's good for bonds will eventually be good for stocks.

THE PACIFIC: SPOTLIGHT ON HIGH-GROWTH COMPANIES; ASIA LOOKS WITHIN TO PROSPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite recent headlines concerning Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown's trade 
mission to China and impending U.S. economic sanctions against Japan, even a 
casual perusal of recent news out of the Asia-Pacific region shows that a lot 
of business there has little or nothing to do with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analysts say, Asian nations are looking more to themselves -- and one 
another -- for new trade ties, economic development and new wealth. And that 
has propelled the fortunes of Asia-Pacific-based companies at a velocity 
unheard of in the United States, as a survey for The Times of public companies 
in the region showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this month: 
</P>
<P>
 * Malaysia's Seng Hup Electric Co. said it would manufacture and sell lighting 
equipment in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Japan's Furukawa Electric Co. said it would establish a joint venture to 
manufacture and market auto air bag parts in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors from Australia, New Zealand and South Korea said they would spend 
$871 million to buy 82% of the industrial land available at the 
Singapore-Suzhou Township in China, 50 miles west of Shanghai. The development 
itself is a $200-million venture among a group of 19 Singaporean companies, led 
by Keppel Corp., and a group of Chinese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asia has the fastest-growing intraregional trade in the world," said Tom 
Robinson, chief international equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
"What has developed is a takeoff into sustained growth, where they are trading 
increasingly with each other rather than outside the region and are able to 
carry on their own business development." 
</P>
<P>
 Such transactions are the logical next step for businesses in the world's most 
rapidly growing region, where national economies are expanding at a pace that 
the United States and other Western nations can only envy. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of national economic growth rates in 1993, according to the 
East-West Center in Honolulu: Singapore (9.8%), Malaysia (8.5%), Thailand 
(7.9%), Indonesia (6.7%), Taiwan (6%). That compares with between 2% and 3% for 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of the rapid economic surge and huge potential of China, 
whose economy grew faster than 13% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Asia-Pacific region is multifaceted, encompassing the mature economies 
of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; the rapidly developing manufacturing 
economies of Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, and the financial and service 
centers of Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the region is diverse, analysts say there are several trends 
converging in the 1990s: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rapid development is creating an explosive need for infrastructure, 
particularly electric power and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Malaysian and Indonesian companies are signing an agreement to 
build a $7.5-billion 500-megawatt coal-fired power plant in southern Sumatra, 
the Business Times reported this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is a burgeoning consumer class hungry for TVs and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ayer, a portfolio manager of global fund at Oppenheimer Management Corp. 
in New York, observes that there is also a growing body of residents, 
particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, who can afford to own their homes. * 
Asian nations are moving away from being a source of cheap labor and low-cost 
assembly work, increasingly becoming centers of high technology and engineering 
expertise -- in part because of a new class of professionals educated abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1990s . . . in places like Singapore and Malaysia and Thailand, where 
what they were selling ten years ago was cheap labor, what they're selling now 
is moving up the technological scale," said Daniel J. Duane, managing director 
and chief investment officer for global equities at Prudential Investment 
Advisors in Newark, N.J. Assembly will be subcontracted to Vietnam, India, 
Pakistan, China, Cambodia, even Myanmar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at firms in Asian nations provides examples of these trends. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the nation's largest producer of 
steel, and Korea Electricity Power Corp. recently sought listings on the New 
York Stock Exchange, a first for companies from that nation. 
</P>
<P>
 CITIC Pacific Ltd., meanwhile, is typical of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, 
with investments in a wide range of businesses and subsidiaries that are 
involved in trade, aviation, warehousing and distribution, real estate and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our company's strategy has always been to focus on three areas," said 
Chairman Larry Yung Chi-Kin last month in an interview with the South China 
Morning Post. "The first is infrastructure, which provides a fixed income. 
Trading is another because it generates a strong cash flow. And, apart from 
these two, we think property investment in Hong Kong is a major area that 
guarantees steady revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The economy of the Philippines accounted for a 65% rise in profits in the 
first six months of 1994 for Ayala Corp., one of that nation's top industrial 
conglomerates, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala holds interests in food manufacturing, agriculture, banking and finance, 
telecommunications, office buildings, property management and other businesses. 
Last month, the company announced that it would lead a consortium of private 
companies and government agencies in the Philippines and Singapore to bid to 
redevelop a Manila army base. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is a downside to Asia's growth. "The biggest risk to these 
countries is I think twofold," said Bill Wilby, director of global equities at 
Oppenheimer Management Corp. in New York. "The first is inflationary risk. The 
second is political, in that many of these countries have not yet made full 
transition to representative democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts point to the support of governments as a key factor in the 
region's economic growth: the use of military or other public funds to finance 
infrastructure spending and other economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have enormous social spending programs," Oppenheimer's Ayer said. 
"The other key point is: In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japan spent a great 
deal of money investing in the smaller Asian countries. They moved 
manufacturing and assembly plants to Malaysia and Thailand. We are now seeing 
the benefits of that very large investment in manufacturing capacity . . . 
through rapidly rising exports." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, analysts argue that a growing middle class will put pressure on more 
authoritarian governments to moderate their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dropping of political barriers allowed a lot of international economic 
transactions . . . in areas where they either simply didn't happen or were 
discouraged," said Charles Morrison, director of the program on international 
economics and politics at the East-West Center. "And you have had a fair amount 
of deregulation and privatization at the domestic level, occurring in countries 
where a lot of efficiency was bottled up by overplanning and excessive 
government controls." 
</P>
<P>
 And for all its increasing interdependence, the region still needs a 
continuing United States presence, said Ayala Corp.'s chairman, Jaime Zobel de 
Ayala. "The U.S. is the only country that can play a security role," he 
reportedly said last spring before a meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic 
Council in Kuala Lumpur. "If the U.S. goes into isolation, it will throw this 
region into a tailspin." How the Listings Were Compiled 
</P>
<P>
 The survey includes companies in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New 
Zealand, Malaysia and Thailand. Companies in South Korea and Taiwan were not 
included in the growth surveys because information was not available on enough 
companies. To be included in the growth survey, a company must have been 
publicly traded, had data available for the past three consecutive years and 
had a positive net income for each of the years. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the companies report on an annual basis, and companies under a certain 
size were excluded from some of the listings. 
</P>
<P>
 All growth percentages were calculated based on each company's native currency 
to avoid exchange rate fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income figures for Japanese companies are based on unadjusted net income. 
Net income figures for the Asia-Pacific companies are based on adjusted net 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Data Inc. compiled the data for most of the listings, using information 
provided by Data Stream Intl. Bloomberg Business News and Investext also 
supplied data for listings. Asia Pacific Growth 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary growth of companies based in the Asia-Pacific region 
reflects the fast economic growth in the area. Most of the region's economies 
grew at a far faster rate in 1993 than did the United States which had a growth 
rate of between 2% and 3%. The 1993 gross domestic product growth: 
</P>
<P>

</P>

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; ADJUSTABLE HEEL PUMPS SHOE SALES; INNOVATION: 
ROSE-LEE PARTNERS FIND THEMSELVES BUSY FILLING ORDERS FOR THEIR AEROSPACE 
ENGINEER-DESIGNED FOOTWEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Talk about an idea with legs -- or maybe feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills orthopedic surgeon Fred Swerdloff and his nurse-practitioner, 
Rose Lewis, saw an endless parade of limping patients whose back, knee and 
ankle pain could be blamed on a single source: high-heeled shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 So Swerdloff and Lewis performed surgery on the standard fashion pump and came 
up with an unusual idea. They designed a shoe with a heel that can change 
height. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose-Lee Beverly Hills Shoes, which debuted at a New York shoe show in June, 
are only a tiny kick in the pants for the tightly laced shoe industry. But the 
quick-stepping response from retailers who think Rose-Lee has nailed a 
shoe-wearer's dream has sent the small company racing to fill orders for the 
holiday season and is keeping its owners on their -- well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very exciting," said Lewis, who tested every prototype on her own 
Size 7 1/2 feet. "I knew women would want these. . . . I always see these women 
walking down the street wearing beautiful suits with tennis shoes, and it looks 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at this from a fashion standpoint; I consider it a medical 
device," said Swerdloff, whose day job ministering to orthopedic problems has 
helped pay the bills for Rose-Lee during the nearly eight years it took to 
bring the shoe to market. "It was important for me to find a way to offer a 
lower heel for part of the day, because lowering the heel takes strain off the 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe changes height by changing heels. 
</P>
<P>
 The wearer unfastens the heel with the help of a special brass key -- or, in a 
pinch, a coin -- that fits into a patented screwing device inside the shoe. The 
new heel is centered on the half-inch screw with the help of a short locating 
pin on the shoe's base and is tightened on. The Velcro-secured insole is 
replaced so the wearer doesn't feel the screw top. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole procedure takes about 20 seconds and can change the height of the 
shoe by as much as one inch, depending on the style of shoe and heel. 
</P>
<P>
 Each leather shoe comes with two sets of plain heels in different heights; 
extra-fancy heels covered with rhinestones or filigree or other ornamentation 
can be ordered. Rose-Lee shoes are expected to retail for about $90 when they 
begin appearing in stores this December. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a stylish shoe with an interchangeable heel originally came from 
Swerdloff's mother, Beulah, who is a semi-retired shoe designer and artist. But 
it took the persistence of Swerdloff and Lewis to make the concept a reality 
despite skepticism from every shoe designer and manufacturer they approached 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoe manufacturers weren't too open-minded about making changes," said 
Lewis, who is president and chief executive of Rose-Lee Beverly Hills. Shoe 
designers told Lewis and Swerdloff, who is chairman and chief financial 
officer, that altering the heel height would throw the entire shoe out of 
whack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the entrepreneurs turned to unemployed aerospace engineers to make 
their sketches a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 This odd spin on defense conversion produced a variety of prototypes, 
including a shoe with a tracking system on the underside that allowed the heel 
to slip on and off. "Unfortunately, whatever is easy to put on is easy to come 
out," Lewis said. Some of their ideas were more expensive than the shoe itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The heel they developed is actually more secure than a conventional heel, 
which generally is attached with glue and three or four short tacks, Swerdloff 
said. Swerdloff also specified more room inside the shoe and extra padding in 
the insole. The shoes' shanks are unusually flexible to accommodate the 
changing heel height, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and Swerdloff went to Rose-Lee's June debut at the Footwear Fashion 
Assn. of New York's two-day shoe industry shoe with few expectations and a 
showroom tucked way in the back of the Plaza Hotel with the rest of the 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the industry warned me . . . 'Don't be disappointed. It's a very 
competitive business. Don't be expecting orders. Just take your shoe and show 
it and learn,' " Lewis recalled. "The first day we opened our door, we were 
jammed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose-Lee came home with thousands of dollars worth of orders. The experience 
was repeated at another shoe industry show in Las Vegas last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is now producing 15 different styles of shoes and 10 different 
types of heels ranging from 1/2 inch to 3 1/2 inches in height at a factory in 
Spain. Lewis, a Latina born in Los Angeles, said her ability to speak Spanish 
came in handy in setting up the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Swerdloff and Lewis have run Rose-Lee Beverly Hills on a shoestring since they 
founded it in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 They operate the 10-employee firm out of the billing office for Swerdloff's 
orthopedic practice, sharing space with medical records and gauze pads. 
Patients wander through from time to time. An X-ray viewing box comes in handy 
for looking at film negatives of the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "it's been a very expensive process," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've invested several hundred thousand dollars in this business," Swerdloff 
said. "Nobody really thinks about the hidden costs in setting up a business." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the partners have their hands full lining up new stores and filling 
orders while still keeping Swerdloff's practice going. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose-Lee has yet to crack the big Southern California department store chains, 
but has received orders from several boutiques and from Mercantile Stores, 
which operates 100 department stores under various names in the South and 
Midwest. The U.S. Navy and some airlines also have expressed interest, Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very encouraging," Swerdloff said. "They ask us, 'Can you handle 
high-volume orders?' We feel we can."

CONFIDENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY ECONOMY HITS 1990S PEAK; POLL: ANNUAL SURVEY PUTS 
CONSUMER INDEX AT 89, JUST BELOW NATIONAL AVERAGE AND 16 POINTS AHEAD OF LAST 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orange County consumers are regaining their faith in the economy and now boast 
of the highest confidence levels of the 1990s, according to a UC Irvine report 
released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Orange County Annual Survey pegged the local Consumer Confidence 
Index at 89, a level just below the national average and a whopping 16 points 
higher than last year. The Orange County index is now at its highest in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one important indication that Orange County has come out of 
recession," said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 survey, conducted by Prof. Mark Baldassare at the UC Irvine School of 
Social Ecology, found a sharp increase in the number of adults saying they are 
better off now than a year ago. Consumers also generally believe that the 
nation has a prosperous year ahead and that now is a good time to buy 
big-ticket items such as cars and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those results are significant, Adibi and other analysts said, because they 
suggest that consumers will start making big purchases that they had put off 
during the recession. Such a buying spree, in turn, would create jobs in 
manufacturing and retailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer spending looks like it's ready to take off," said UCI research 
associate Cheryl Katz, who conducted the survey with Baldassare. "We will see 
more spending across the board -- more home buying, perhaps." In addition, she 
said, people will be "generally more at ease with their finances." 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers say they are already seeing signs of freer spending. Auto 
dealers, for example, report that business has picked up, with some having sold 
out their entire inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a single '94 Jeep on the lot," said Gary Gray, owner of Orange 
Coast Jeep Eagle in Coast Mesa. "Last year at this time, I had 150 '93 Jeeps 
that I couldn't sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer confidence report also bodes well for the holidays, retailers' 
busiest season and thus a crucial part of their fiscal year. Yet it does not 
mean that the local economy, hampered by continued layoffs in the aerospace 
industry, has shaken off all its lingering ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County consumers "are not as confident in the local scene as the 
national scene," pollster Katz said. The local confidence rating of 89 
contrasts with a national rating of 92, a reverse of the scene in late 1980s, 
when Orange County consistently scored higher than the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest poll found that Orange County median annual household income was 
unchanged from last year at $47,000. That is a sharp contrast with the 1980s, 
when the median income rose 25% during the decade, contrasted with 6% 
nationally, said Baldassare, who is chairman of urban and regional planning at 
the UC Irvine School of Social Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why our consumer confidence ratings were so high during that period," 
he said last week. "Until we start to see income grow again, we'll probably lag 
behind or stay on par with the national average." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the report showed that 40% of the Orange County residents surveyed said 
they are better off now than a year earlier. That compared to just 30% in the 
1993 poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollsters, who interviewed 1,000 adults between Aug. 19 and 29, say the 
results have an error margin of plus or minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent economic indicators also encourage optimism. In August, for instance, 
the county's jobless rate fell a full percentage point to 5.9% under July's. 
And TRW Redi Property Data recently reported that sales of new and existing 
homes were up 26.2% for the first eight months of 1994 over the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know hard economic numbers have been moving up for a few months now, 
and non-agricultural employment has been going up," said Cal State Fullerton 
economist Anil Puri, "but a big factor in any recovery has to be consumer 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that the optimism is spread across all age groups and through 
every sector of Orange County. It found that 49% of Orange County consumers 
believe good times are ahead for the country over the next 12 months, compared 
to 29% in last year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 They also believe the good times will be long-lasting, with 43% saying that 
the economy will remain healthy over five years. Last year, only 31% were so 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Hope Hamashige contributed to this report. Optimism 
Returns to O.C. Consumers 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents are more upbeat about the economy than they have been 
in five years. The Confidence Index is calculated by computing scores from a 
national and local survey and adjusting from the base year, 1966, when the 
national index was 100. Here's how the United States and Orange County compare: 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumer Confidence Index 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Ticket Buys 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for consumer spending has also improved, with the percentage 
saying this is a good time to make a major purchase it highest since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 About the big things that people buy for their homes, such as furniture, a 
refrigerator, a stove, television and things like that -- generally speaking, 
do you think now is a good time or a bad time for people to buy major household 
items? 
</P>

<P>
 Bad Time: 25% 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Know: 15% 
</P>
<P>
 * More Confident, But Cautious 
</P>
<P>
 County consumers are decidedly more confident about their financial situation 
than they were a year ago. And while they remain basically optimistic about the 
future, their views of the next 12 months is unchanged.

 NASD Proposes New Trading Rule: The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, 
regulator of the Nasdaq stock market, has proposed a rule that would prevent 
securities firms from trading ahead of public customers on retail transactions. 
The move is designed to help ensure that retail investors' orders to buy or 
sell stock are executed when the shares hit the investors' targeted price.The 
proposed rule applies to customer orders sent by one securities firm to another 
firm for execution. It builds on an action that the NASD took last June to 
prohibit member firms from trading ahead of their own customers' limit orders. 
A limit order is an order to buy a security for a stated maximum price or to 
sell one for a stated minimum price.

 USAir, Union Officials Meet for Talks: Chairman Seth E. Schofield and 
President Frank Salizzoni of the Arlington, Va.-based carrier, along with top 
executives from British Airways -- which owns 24% of USAir -- and union leaders 
gathered in New York over the weekend for meetings, USAir spokesman David 
Shipley said.They were working on details of a plan to cut $500 million in 
labor costs, but Shipley declined to comment on the status of the talks. USAir 
has lost more than $2.6 billion in the last four years, and Schofield said in 
June that the company must cut $1 billion from its budget each year to survive 
competition from low-cost carriers. The talks had moved slowly until the crash 
Sept. 8 of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, Pa. According to the Washington 
Post, the crash jolted the unions to start working out internal differences in 
their approach to the talks. Federal investigators are still trying to 
determine the cause of the crash, which killed all 132 on board. A little more 
than two months before, a USAir jet crashed near Charlotte, N.C., killing 37 of 
57 people on board.

 Health Products Survey Finds Worrisome Symptoms: Signs of slight financial 
ills emerged in an industry group's survey of leading health products makers, 
including giants Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson. The 1993 survey of 16 major 
companies in New Jersey, which has the nation's heaviest concentration of 
health care businesses, found modest declines in domestic sales, more companies 
cutting research expenditures, and layoffs after years of job growth. The 
industry in its report blamed managed health care and its pressure on drug 
prices, higher taxes, bigger rebates to government agencies and a recently 
imposed $100,000 fee for federal review of new drugs.

 CBS Buys Two Stations: Seeking to replace affiliates lost to the Fox network, 
CBS Inc. said it will buy two television stations for a total $46 million in 
cash.The company said it will buy WGPR-TV in Detroit from WGPR Inc. for $24 
million, and WVEU-TV in Atlanta from Broadcast Corp. of Georgia for $22 
million. The sales are subject to regulatory approvals and customary 
conditions, CBS said. As previously reported, WJBK-TV in Detroit and WAGA-TV in 
Atlanta were among the eight affiliates CBS lost in May when New World

THE PACIFIC: SPOTLIGHT ON HIGH-GROWTH COMPANIES; HOUSING REBOUND MAY HELP 
JAPANESE RECOVERY; REAL ESTATE: HOME BUILDERS ARE ENJOYING A PROFIT AFTER 
DISMAL 'POST-BUBBLE' YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mitsuo Kon and his wife have talked of buying a new home for the past few 
years. This month, they decided the time had come to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
 They found a "bargain" -- a 1,000-square-foot, $567,000 condominium under 
construction 45 minutes by train from downtown Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are cheaper than two or three years ago. It looks like it's affordable 
for us," Kon, 56, said after filing an application to buy the unit. The couple 
were especially pleased by the overall design of the three-bedroom place, which 
will have bigger windows, higher ceilings and larger rooms than the typical 
tiny Japanese apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of condominiums is getting better," Kon said. "Before in Tokyo, 
even if you paid one 100 million yen ($1.01 million), you couldn't get 
something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsuo and Seiko Kon are participants in -- and beneficiaries of -- a 
resurgence in Japan's housing industry. Fueled by a reduction in land and 
construction costs, lower interest rates and tax law changes, the housing 
rebound is one reason for hopes of a consumer-led expansion out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's construction industry still faces hard times overall, but companies 
active in the housing market are enjoying a profit rebound after the dismal 
"post-bubble" years of 1991 to 1993. Housing construction-related firms were 
prominent in a survey completed for The Times of Japan's fastest-growing public 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of profit on each unit has dropped some" compared to a few years 
ago, said Noboru Wada, manager of the real estate information division of 
Jutaku-Joho magazine, a publication for prospective home buyers and renters. 
"But since there's more condominium construction, overall profits are up for 
the companies building them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, a typical 700-square-foot three-bedroom condominium located 
an hour by train from downtown Tokyo sold for about $303,000 at today's 
exchange rates, Wada said. The price soared to $606,000 by 1991, and has now 
fallen back to the range of $404,000 to $450,000, he said. Total sales have 
picked up dramatically, but competition between developers remains fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit easier to sell now than it was a few years ago, but it's still not 
really easy," said Hitoshi Hirose, a manager in the real estate development 
department of Tobu Railway Co. Ltd., builder of the complex where Kon is 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kon, a government employee, and his wife, a nurse, can afford a new 
condominium partly because they already own an 807-square-foot place they 
bought 10 years ago, before the late-1980s surge in real estate prices and 
subsequent collapse. "I think we can sell it for a bit more than we paid for 
it," Kon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But people who bought at the peak of the overheated bubble years have seen 
their equity disappear, leaving them trapped in their current homes and 
generally unable to take advantage of lower prices to move into bigger places. 
The fall in housing values, which began three years ago, was also a shock to 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Japan entered recession, condominium sales ground to a halt, Hirose 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But in July, new condominiums put onto the market in the Tokyo area surpassed 
the 10,000-unit mark for the first time ever, according to the Real Estate 
Economy Institute. The private research firm projects the total for the year 
will be about 80,000 units, far exceeding the previous Tokyo-area annual record 
of 54,700 units set in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 90% of the new condominiums coming onto the market are selling within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Total housing starts nationwide, including rental apartments, condominiums and 
single-family homes, are now running at an annualized rate of 1.6 million. This 
compares with total starts of 1.51 million last year, itself a sharp 
improvement over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As Japan slowly emerges from its worst post-World War II recession, analysts 
say that the housing market's strength is a factor contributing to hope for 
steady consumer-led expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Housing construction promotes the purchase of consumer durables," Wada noted. 
"And it's said that there's a broad foundation that supports real estate 
development. Lumber, steel and concrete are needed. Then there's the effect on 
purchases of furniture, curtains and little things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 An important factor contributing to the condominium boom is a 1991 tax law 
revision that boosted property taxes by 50 times on urban-area agricultural 
land rezoned for housing development. The effect of the changes was to increase 
the value of the land, but also to raise taxes so much that owners were almost 
forced to develop it rather than keep it in rice fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners have chosen to retain their land by building rental units rather 
than condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Daito Trust Construction Co. Ltd. is one firm that has enjoyed dramatic growth 
from building rental units on land put into development as a result of the 1991 
tax law. But the company has recently seen the number of these special projects 
fade sharply.  
</P>
<P>
 While many prospective buyers still hope for a further drop in prices, 
developers are afraid that oversupply may soon wipe out the profitability of 
condominium construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichiei Construction has seen profits go up sharply in the past two years, but 
still views the overall environment as rather difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the bubble burst, land prices came down, so those who couldn't afford 
condominiums are now capable of buying them," said Nichiei spokesman Masataka 
Sato. "But on the other hand, there now is an oversupply of condominiums, and 
many customers are waiting for a further decline in prices." 
</P>

THE PACIFIC: SPOTLIGHT ON HIGH-GROWTH COMPANIES; DOWN UNDER EMERGES OUT FROM 
UNDER RECESSION WOES; ECONOMY: CONSUMER SPENDING, MORE THAN TRADE OR 
INVESTMENT, IS DRIVING AUSTRALIA'S RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Australia is recovering from its worst recession since World War II and though 
it's not out of the woods yet, the pickup in economic activity has meant good 
news for several Australian companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey for The Times of public companies in the Asia-Pacific, several 
Australia-based companies ranked high among companies with the fastest average 
growth in profits and revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia production has quickened, unemployment lines have contracted and 
inflation and interest rates are still low. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's this one big problem nobody can do much about: the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 This vast island continent of only 17 million people is in the grip of a 
drought that threatens a vital industry -- farming, which brings in about a 
quarter of Australia's income from exports. Australia is the world's leading 
producer of wool and the largest beef exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising world food prices are expected to offset some of the lost income. But 
there's an ominous forecast from the national Bureau of Meteorology: no rain 
for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 In much of central and eastern Australia, where there's been little or no rain 
in the past four years, the drought is the worst on record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already lost close to $1 billion (Australian) in exports this season," 
says Rob Morton of the Australian Wheat Board. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of agriculture -- a key sector hurt by a persistent drought 
-- the economy seems to be chugging along quite nicely. For the year through 
June, the economy grew a tidy 4.3%, faster than the United States, Japan and 
Germany. And so far, all that growth hasn't revved up inflation too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers in this country feel better about the economy than they have since 
the late 1980s, before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days when a handful of Australian companies roared up from Down 
Under to become players on the international stage, buying companies in bold 
strokes in Europe and the United States. Too bold, it now turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of these companies have since gone belly up, rendering Australian 
stocks poisonous to foreign investors for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Bond Corp., which got overextended by purchasing a slew of 
companies around the world in the booming 1980s. Alan Bond turned a one-man 
painting company into an international media, brewing and real estate 
conglomerate and achieved hero status in Australia in 1983 after wresting 
yachting's biggest price, the America's Cup, from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But his reputation got a going over recently when the former tycoon told a 
bankruptcy trustee he couldn't remember where many of his assets went. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking a dive was Qintex, a splashy Australian TV network and resort 
operator that tried its hand at making TV movies in Hollywood and building an 
exotic seaside resort in Southern California. It filed for bankruptcy in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, though, consumer confidence is hitting record highs, according to 
Westpac Bank's influential surveys. And with good reason: Wages are increasing 
about 3% a year, faster than inflation, which is running about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's pay packets are increasing," says Nigel Stapledon, an economist at 
Westpac, "and that's fairly positive for consumption." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Australian recovery -- much like Japan's -- is driven more by 
consumer spending these days than by the exports or business investment that 
the Labor government had predicted. Australia's population has doubled in the 
past 40 years and is still the fastest-growing of any industrialized nation's. 
That's a lot of new consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly a lot more optimism," says Keith Sullivan, a manager at 
Boral Ltd., which sells building supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Boral should know. Australians are borrowing so much money to buy or build 
houses that the nation's central bank -- the Australian version of the U.S. 
Federal Reserve -- recently asked commercial banks to cool mortgage lending. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia is concerned the rush to buy real estate will 
lead to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank says it wants to avert a repeat of the 1980s, when soaring real 
estate prices propelled inflation and interest rates to double digits. The boom 
turned into a spectacular bust in 1990 that Australia emerged from just last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate Australia, indeed, is looking more robust these days. Earnings are 
way up, although one reason is because they're being compared to results in the 
economic downturn that just ended. 
</P>
<P>
 And these profits weren't achieved without pain. A lot of these companies have 
laid off people over the last few years, lowering their costs and boosting 
profits. Right now 800,000 Australians are out of work. Still, the 9.5% 
unemployment rate in August is a lot better than the 11.3% peak in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A cut in the corporate tax rate to 33% from 39% also helped swell last year's 
profits, said Nestor Hinzack, a director at investment bank Bain & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fiscal 1994 was a recovery year," he says. (Most Australian companies follow 
a financial year that ends on June 30.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's helped Australian exports that the U.S. economy has already come out of 
its downturn and is busily buying Australian goods again. The United States is 
Australia's second-largest trade partner. 
</P>
<P>
 And Japan, Australia's largest trading partner, is just now emerging from its 
worst recession since the war. Demand in Japan for Australian beef, wool, coal 
and iron ore is expected to keep Australia's economy whistling along. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one reason Australia's economy has grown so quickly is the rise of 
Asian nations such as South Korea and Taiwan as economic powers hungry for the 
food, metals and finished products Australia can supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian schools, in fact, are concentrating on teaching Korean, Mandarin, 
Japanese and Bahasa Indonesian to schoolchildren as the most likely languages 
they'll need for doing business in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, though, higher interest rates will crimp profits, says Hinzack, the 
bank economist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reserve Bank of Australia has already raised the benchmark interest rate 
to 5.5% from 4.75%, the first increase in five years, as a preemptive move to 
hold inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 And rates are thought to be going even higher in the next year. But this time 
economists aren't expecting them to put the economy on a roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Hinzack: "One doesn't see the huge distortion on the horizon."

AUSTRALIAN WINEMAKING TRADITION BEARS FRUIT; VITICULTURE: EXPERTS SAY WINE 
EXPORTS WILL REACH THE SAME LEVELS AS WOOL, COAL AND WHEAT BEFORE DECADE'S END.

<P>
 Not so long ago, Australia's wine industry seemed a bit of a joke. Isn't this 
the country, after all, that invented the one-gallon cardboard "wine cask"? 
</P>
<P>
 Demand drooped with reputation. As recently as 1989, grape growers were 
pulling out vines for more profitable crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Australia's vintners are headed for a select club. Their products score 
well at such blind tastings as the annual International Wine Challenge 
organized by Britain's Wine magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 And by the turn of the century -- some analysts say sooner -- Australia's wine 
exports are expected to top $740 million. That would put wine in the same 
league as the country's traditional export mainstays of coal, wheat and wool. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe remains Australia's biggest overseas market, with exports last year 
rising by 3 million gallons, or 20.8%. Australia's best customer is Britain, 
followed by the United States, Canada and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian wines haven't yet penetrated Asian markets to any large extent. In 
Japan, Australia's lack of cachet has meant that its share of the market has 
actually declined -- from between 3% and 4% a decade ago to about 2% now. But 
several wine companies are planning to make up for that by targeting the 
Chinese market. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Australia has a long way to go before it catches up with France, 
even on a quantitative basis. French vintages account for 35% of world wine 
sales and Australian a mere 2.5%, according to the Winemakers' Federation of 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is wine ever likely to displace beer in the hearts, or stomachs, of 
Australians. They still drink between five and six times as much of the more 
macho beverage despite a 150-year-old winemaking tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sunny climate and ample water -- not to mention aggressive marketing, 
which stresses the absence of chemical contamination -- have made the country a 
presence in medium-priced table wines. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Australia exported a record 32.8 million gallons of wine, valued at 
$254.4 million, according to government figures. If this 32% jump in value over 
1992 can be maintained, the $740 million mark will be passed by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian Wine Export Council predicts an increase of at least 30% in 
value for this year's exports. "The world wine community is becoming aware and 
confident that Australian wine is, in fact, a world-class, quality product," 
said Ian Sutton, the council's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 And investors have reached similar conclusions. A wine index maintained by 
brokerage William Noall, tracking nine of the 10 specialist wine companies 
listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, climbed 61% from June 1 to Sept. 16, 
compared with a rise of just 17% in the benchmark All Ordinaries index. 
</P>
<P>
 A longer-term comparison is equally dramatic. From July, 1993, to last July, 
the wine index rose 49.7%, while the All Ordinaries managed 13.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen an incredible surge in the wine sector," said George Polites, 
author of Noall's wine report. "I wouldn't expect that rate of growth to 
continue, but I certainly expect the sector will outperform the All Ordinaries 
for some years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Polites nominated Mildara Blass Ltd. as Australia's premier wine company. 
Mildara earlier this month reported a 38% leap in after-tax profit. The 
company, which concentrates on premium wines in the $5.92 to $8.88 price range, 
posted profit of $13.2 million for the year to June 30 after sales revenue 
increased 11% to $93.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray King, Mildara's chief executive, said export sales have continued their 
steady growth of the past three years and now account for 30% of Mildara's 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he expects the company's traditional markets in Britain and the 
United States will be enhanced by new ones in continental Europe. "I'm 
absolutely delighted with the progress of our developing markets in 
Switzerland, Germany and Holland," he told investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report earlier this year, Hambros Equities said Mildara has a distinct 
advantage over some other wine companies in that it has secured a future grape 
supply, allowing the company to increase supply 60% by 2000.

 Profits at the small Filipino company grew dramatically in 1992 and 1993. 
Then, last year, sea water seeped into its most profitable offshore wells. As a 
result, Basic, which reported $5 million in revenue for 1993, has lost money so 
far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Basic, which jumped into oil exploration from the exotic business of 
farming prawns, is branching out further into less risky undertakings. It's in 
chemicals, electric power generation -- and making crystalware. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of Waterford Crystal from Ireland -- gleaming hand-crafted 
goblets, tumblers and bowls -- scattered about Basic's otherwise quite ordinary 
executive offices in the Makati financial district serves as a reminder of the 
crystalware competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1968, Basic switched to oil exploration in 1972. It seemed a good 
move: The Philippines imports nearly 99% of its oil; it was desperate to find a 
domestic supply. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, this poverty-ridden country lacked the capital to explore for 
oil, most of which is believed to be in fields thousands of feet below the 
ocean. Finding it is an expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, reliance on imports makes Filipinos anxious about their fragile 
economy and its vulnerability to big swings in oil prices. The 1991 Persian 
Gulf War, for example, drove oil prices so high that it pushed inflation to 
28%. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Philippines encourages exploration by allowing oil companies what 
analysts say are the most generous profit margins in Asia for pumping its oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic was founded by Jose de Venecia, now speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the chief legislative ally of President Fidel Ramos. De 
Venecia's brother, Oscar, runs the company as chairman and president. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where politics is a blood sport and deregulation of the oil 
industry a work in progress, those political connections count, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters in any country," says Joven Baban, senior investment analyst with 
Baring Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters even more here." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1976, Basic had discovered the first commercial oil field in the 
Philippines. The company really struck it rich six years later, when it found 
the West Linapacan field, then the largest oil discovery in the country's 
history and Basic's main source of income for the past two years. The 
Philippine government took only a 7% bite of the revenues, leaving the rest for 
Basic and its partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linapacan has fallen on hard times. Sea water began pouring into the wells 
last year, forcing the company to shut them down and drill new ones.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Linapacan dries up, we will be hurt very badly," says Raul Ramos, Basic's 
vice president and treasurer, who is not related to the Philippine president. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the reason for the diversification and the constant search for new 
fields," says Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 In this business, after all, there's always the chance you'll strike it rich 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it's the West Culion oil field, southwest of Manila in the South 
China Sea, which analysts say could be a bonanza, because it's so close to the 
fabulous Malampaya find. Malampaya -- a Shell and Occidental Oil project -- is 
projected to produce 150,000 barrels of oil per day within the next decade, 
enough to fill half the Philippines' daily consumption. If West Culion is 
anywhere near that big, it'll make Basic and its partners rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that could drive the market wild if it's a hit," says Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it could be a costly failure -- not unknown in the oil exploration 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The $311,000 loss reported by the company for the first half of 1994 sent its 
the stock plunging on the Philippine Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The class A shares -- which can't be bought by foreigners, have fallen 69.5% 
this year to 0.016 pesos (a small fraction of a penny) in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 The class B shares, the ones foreigners can trade, tumbled 70.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic's most promising new business is the country's first petrochemical 
plant, scheduled to open in late 1995. Basic spent $2.7 million on a 5% stake 
in the project, a partnership with Germany's BASF, Thai Petrochemicals and 
several other local companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant will produce polypropylene resin, the primary raw material for 
plastic products like food packaging, intravenous blood bags, rope, grain bags 
and athletic wear. Now all the Philippines' polypropylene is imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new venture: generating electric power, a business that's booming now 
that the government is going all out to solve the country's electricity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Philippines was plunged into darkness up to 10 hours a day by 
an electricity shortage. Concerned that this would undercut economic growth, 
the government made power generation its top priority and wiped out the 
blackouts by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Power is still a big concern. Basic has invested $295,000 in Island Power 
Corp., which is putting up a seven-megawatt plant to provide electricity to a 
cooperative on the island of Mindoro. Basic also has a joint venture with 
U.S.-based Consolidated Hydro Inc. to develop small hydroelectric power 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The most intriguing project, though, is the plan to manufacture fine hand-cut 
crystal for export to the United States. Basic has hired some former employees 
of Ireland's Waterford Crystal to train a cheap Philippines labor force in 
making crystal.

 Backing Sought to Lease Airports: In a major turnaround, the government will 
seek endorsement at a party conference this week to lease all of its 22 
airports rather than sell them.The federal Cabinet last week approved a plan to 
lease all the airports currently owned and operated by the Federal Airports 
Corp. -- everything from Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport and Sydney's Mascot 
Airport to smaller regional sites. However, the proposal must be ratified by 
delegates to the Labor Party's national conference this week in Hobart. In May, 
the government announced it would to put the airports on the block as part of 
its asset sales program. But since then, criticism has intensified within Labor 
Party ranks over the proposal.

 Unemployment Crisis Looms: China admitted the problem last week, and that 268 
million new job seekers -- more than the population of most countries -- are 
expected to join the hunt by 1999. The Labor Ministry has set a two-year 
program to expand the domestic labor market to try to keep the official 
unemployment rate below 3%, the China Daily newspaper said. By the turn of the 
century, China expects to see 200 million more rural job seekers and 68 million 
more in the cities, the newspaper quoted Zhang Xiaojian, director of the 
department of labor and employment, as saying.

 Jobless Figures Rise: Unemployment in the Philippines rose to 9.71% of the 
work force in July, the government said, as the expanding economy failed to 
create enough jobs to keep pace with population increases.A year ago, the 
unemployment rate was 8.58%. The estimated labor population rose by more than 1 
million from 41.152 million in July, 1993, to 42.366 million. The labor force, 
or the number of people of working age looking for jobs, rose 2% to 27.340 
million. Gross domestic product grew 5.1% in the first half of 1994, more than 
double the 2.3% rate a year before, the National Statistics Office said.

 Foreign Airline Operation Rules Liberalized: Vietnam's Civil Aviation 
Authority said it will license foreign airlines to conduct business directly in 
the country, the Lao Dong newspaper reported.Airlines will be allowed to sell 
tickets and conduct marketing, commercial development and advertising without 
undertaking a joint venture with the national air carrier, Vietnam Airlines. 
The paper said 14 foreign airlines are also asking to be allowed to recruit 
their own staff people. Foreign airlines operating in Vietnam have been 
required to join forces with Vietnam Airlines, which supplied staff members, 
office space and carried out any commercial business.

 Car Purchases to Be Subsidized: The government, keen to build a world-class 
auto industry, said last week that it would subsidize private car buyers and 
"support" four major plants that make Volkswagens, Peugeots and Daihatsus. The 
new industrial policy, unveiled in Beijing by Minister of Machinery He 
Guangyuan, buries the socialist-era doctrine that until recent years restricted 
auto ownership to officials and state enterprises. He trumpeted Beijing's dream 
of building a huge world-class auto industry driven by demand from domestic and 
foreign consumers and not by the Chinese state.

MANUFACTURERS EXPRESS CONCERN OVER PROSPECT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES; ECONOMY: 
AS FED MEMBERS CONSIDER A FURTHER INCREASE, THEY LOOK AT DATA ON PLANT USE, 
WHICH HIT A 5-YEAR HIGH IN AUGUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Manufacturers says its members are concerned about the 
prospects of higher interest rates as Federal Reserve officials prepare to meet 
Tuesday to chart their battle plan against rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of economic indicators that point to the threat of accelerating 
inflation, some economists -- including Bear, Stearns & Co. chief economist 
Wayne Angell, a former Fed governor -- expect another Fed increase in the 
overnight bank lending rate in an attempt to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those economists say the Fed's rate-setting Open Market Committee will raise 
by 50 basis points the federal funds rate on inter-bank loans and the discount 
rate charged on borrowing from the Federal Reserve by its member banks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not welcome news for manufacturers' association members, who are 
enjoying increased demand and improved earnings. As they wound up a meeting in 
the nation's capital, NAM members participating in a poll urged the Fed not to 
raise rates a sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming majority believe that the Fed should hold interest rates at 
current levels or delay any further action until late this year or next year," 
association President Jerry Jasinowski told the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, other businesses believe the economy could withstand another rate 
increase without dramatically slowing demand for goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Orville Harrold, for example, president of the Providence & Worcester Railroad 
in Worcester, Mass., said in a recent interview that as long as the prime rate 
remains below 10%, business conditions will be favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 16, the Fed raised the discount rate to 4% from 3.5% and the federal 
funds rate to 4.75% from 4.25%. Within minutes, major banks followed suit by 
raising their lending rates to their most credit-worthy corporate customers a 
half percentage point to 7.75% -- the highest in almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As they consider whether to increase rates further, Fed members pay attention 
to plant-use rates, which in August showed factories, mines and utilities 
operated at 84.7% of capacity -- a five-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a high level suggests higher labor and production costs for companies -- 
costs that are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, said Kevin 
Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when the Fed raised rates in August, it cited the rising plant-use 
rate as the main reason for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, though, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen urged against reading too 
much into the plant-use figure. "You are seeing substantial growth" in factory 
use, Bentsen said, but he pointed out that manufacturing accounts for only a 
portion of the economy. "We're always concerned about inflation, but I don't 
see any deepening concern at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some analysts believe the Fed won't raise rates until October -- or 
even November -- after it gets more figures on the economy: namely employment, 
producer prices, consumer prices and the plant-use rate.

FEDEX POISES TO REACH GOAL OF 8 MILLION PARCELS DAILY; DELIVERY: FIERCE PRICE 
COMPETITION IS WEIGHING ON AIR CARGO COMPANY'S DOMESTIC EARNINGS.

 Each night at Memphis airport, about 750,000 packages arrive at Federal 
Express Corp.'s hub operation within minutes of each other around midnight and 
hundreds of employees start sorting. 
</P>
<P>
 The packages are offloaded, dumped into a 171-mile network of conveyor belts 
for sorting and redistribution and then reloaded, all within about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies are taking shortcuts with storage and are instead using FedEx 
as an "airborne warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the parts of many personal computers may come together for the 
first time in a Federal Express truck. 
</P>
<P>
 And auto makers, health care producers and clothing catalogue merchants keep 
products in warehouses near FedEx's hub to handle late orders. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.9 million packages handled by FedEx each day are sent to its second 
hub in Indianapolis, or to regional hubs in Newark, N.J.; Oakland; Anchorage, 
Alaska or to sorting operations in Chicago, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo, Taipei 
and Stansted, England. 
</P>
<P>
 While Federal Express employs thousands of college students as well as 
aspiring professionals to help in the sorting process, it is not unusual to see 
Frederick Smith, the company's founder, chairman, president and chief 
executive, sorting packages on heavy nights during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The company started in 1973 with a fleet of 14 business jets and now has a 
total of 464 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1983, its revenues hit $1 billion, making it the first U.S. company 
to reach that hallmark within 10 years of start-up. 
</P>
<P>
 It also boasts of a computerized information service that processes more than 
20 million transactions a day. About 80,000 customers are plugged in and the 
locations of each of the 2 million packages moved daily are recorded six times 
during shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FedEx is poised for continued growth and is already positioning 
itself to move 8 million packages daily, price competition has grown fierce in 
its domestic operations, weighing on its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a drop in first quarter domestic operating profits, but the air 
cargo company plans to reverse that trend, said Alan Graf, chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to raise domestic earnings by 10% a year. I'm not sure if we 
can do that in fiscal 1995 because of our start," Graf said in an interview, 
"but we have several programs underway so that we expect to reverse the trend 
of declining earnings. As to when, I can't say exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Federal Express reported net income of $61.1 million for the first 
quarter ended Aug. 31, up sharply from $32.9 million a year ago. But the 
company's U.S. operating profits fell to $120.3 million from $135.1 million a 
year ago due to growing price competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to match the yield decline with cost decline and we have a lot 
better capacity of controlling the cost of transactions than the revenue," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf said the firm is seeking to cut its cost per package by 50% by the end of 
the decade from under $12 currently. Federal Express handles a daily average of 
2 million packages worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf noted that he did not think it likely that FedEx would see 12% or 13% 
margins again in its domestic operations, but added it was possible overseas. 
The first quarter's margins in domestic were about 7.1%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the dynamics of the market are such that the market's going to 
continue to grow very rapidly," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
 "FedEx has always been very lean and mean, and we have been reducing our costs 
on a unit basis for a long number of years," he said. "We're just in the 
process of continuing to do that and have a lot of programs that are in the 
planning stages or are just beginning to help us lower our unit costs." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited new technology and information related projects that should make a 
big impact, saving the company tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, starting this fiscal year, FedEx is adding 43 wide-bodied aircraft 
that are lighter but can carry more packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express stock closed 37.5 cents lower at $61.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Friday.

A PRETTY TAME EVENT; DOWNSIZED CIRCUS VARGAS DOES WITHOUT LIONS, TIGERS, 
ELEPHANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came in search of lions, tigers and elephants, but found a pack of 
soccer-playing dogs in their place. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans were disappointed to discover Sunday that the exotic beasts were no 
longer a part of Circus Vargas -- the first time the animals have been excluded 
in the show's 25-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the only beasts to dazzle the audience were the athletic dogs from 
Denmark, decked out in shirts and boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other shows have lions and tigers," said one circus employee. "We have dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 While some workers attributed the decision to exclude exotic animals this year 
to pressure from animal-rights activists, circus officials contended that the 
change was made in favor of emphasizing international acts, such as Bulgarian 
acrobats and jugglers from the Philippines who use their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a decision to do something different," said Mikyla Garrett, a Circus 
Vargas marketing director. "The animal activists had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The change in programming did not escape the notice of fans, who were informed 
about the switch by signs at the entrance to the show at the Antelope Valley 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out after we paid for our tickets," said Candace Siderides of 
Lancaster. "Had we known, we would not have come." 
</P>
<P>
 Others rolled with the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite disappointing," said Kurt Carlson. "But I have to say what was 
there was very good." 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion of the wild beasts this year came after animal-rights activists 
had taken to handing out anti-animal cruelty literature and demonstrating 
outside shows, circus employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to see the animals," said Manny Valdo, the show's lone clown 
and a 50-year veteran of the circus business.  
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody defended the circus from animal-rights activists when they 
demonstrated." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the decision to exclude the animals triggered letters 
of approval from activists, circus marketing director Garrett stressed that 
they had nothing to do with the owners' decision. Exotic animals have become 
difficult to obtain and keep, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett said the show remains entertaining because of its new international 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still a live performance with people doing death-defying acts," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus Vargas was founded in Hollywood in 1969 by the late Clifford E. Vargas, 
the son of a Portuguese immigrant, who sold his home to buy his first circus 
tent after Ringling Bros. decided that year to begin performing exclusively in 
indoor arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday, the circus featured three rings and exotic animals, and 
traveled as far east as Chicago. But over the last two years the show, which 
now occupies only one ring, has been limited to California and a few 
surrounding cities in neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to reduce the scale of the show was made partly because of the 
poor economy, Garrett said. "We just hope we can weather this dip in the 
economy and start expanding again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the last day the circus will perform at the Antelope Valley 
Fairgrounds before moving to a new location in Lancaster at Avenue K and 10th 
Street West, where performances will be held from Tuesday to Sunday, Garrett 
said.

<P>
 A roofer has been arrested in connection with six recent bank robberies whose 
thief was dubbed the "Cowboy Bandit" after he twice wore a Stetson and 
generally sported a casual, Western style, police announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Matthew Sims, 37, was taken into custody Saturday after a tipster told 
authorities that Sims resembled a widely broadcast description of the wanted 
bank robber. The caller said Sims had been working on a construction site near 
Los Angeles' Chevy Chase Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale investigators set up a surveillance of the area in Atwater Village 
and arrested Sims after he drove by. He surrendered without incident and is 
being held in the Glendale City Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail, said Glendale 
Police Lt. Raymond Edey. 
</P>
<P>
 Through witnesses and bank surveillance cameras, Sims has so far been 
identified in three of the six holdups that began in August, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt during the robberies, in which the thief pointed a handgun at 
a teller and demanded: "I want to make a withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
 Only several thousand dollars were obtained in the string of bank robberies, 
which occurred in northeast Los Angeles as well as Glendale. But police have 
been anxious to arrest the thief, who was considered dangerous because he was 
armed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get the guy because you figure he has a propensity for violence 
due to the fact that he carries a gun," said Glendale Police Investigator 
Dennis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Sims' resemblance to the thief's description -- a slender white 
male, blond, 30 to 40 years old -- was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see him, there'd be no question about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said police found evidence that Sims uses cocaine, but added that he did 
not know whether it was a drug habit that allegedly prompted Sims, a father of 
two whose wife is pregnant, to commit the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that accomplices were involved in at least some of the 
robberies, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime spree included two holdups at the Bank of America on Colorado 
Boulevard in Glendale, and one at the Great Western Bank on North Glendale 
Avenue in Glendale, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police expect to meet with Los Angeles detectives and FBI agents in 
the next day or two to discuss the case further, he said.

3 ACCUSED IN OFFICER'S SLAYING MAY FACE DEATH; COURTS: TRIAL BEGINS THIS WEEK 
FOR SUSPECTS IN ROBBERY SPREE. TWO ALSO HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE KILLING OF A 
SHOP OWNER. 
</P>

<P>
 More than two years have passed since Officer John Hoglund's love affair with 
law enforcement ended violently outside a Maywood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunned down as he arrived at the scene of a silent burglar alarm, Hoglund 
didn't have a chance to draw his gun. He died inside his patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the slaying was the work of at least three men responsible for 
an armed robbery spree throughout Los Angeles that included the fatal shooting 
of Lee Chul Kim, a Van Nuys market owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will re-create the killings of Hoglund and Kim for a Los Angeles 
jury this week when the murder trial is scheduled to begin for Jose Contreras, 
Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the images of Hoglund's assailants clearly captured on a security 
videotape from inside the store, the jurors "will be able to identify the 
defendants," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard, one of two prosecutors 
assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, all three men, each in his early 20s and from Central America, 
could face the death penalty in the Hoglund shooting. Fuentes and Contreras 
could also face death if convicted of killing Kim at his Woodley Market on May 
4, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Kim, 49, had gone to the bank to make a large withdrawal of 
cash, which was routine because he operated a check-cashing booth in his store. 
Prosecutors allege that Fuentes, Contreras and two other robbers were in the 
store when Kim returned and shot and killed him during a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hit about a dozen times," Grosbard said. "It all happened in the 
freezer of the store, so they were within feet of him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The case began to unfold following the Hoglund shooting less than a month 
later when San Fernando Valley police noticed similarities between the two 
killings, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Speer, the other prosecutor. Detectives 
used the videotape from the Maywood market to get still photos of the suspects, 
which were used to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund, 46, was the first police officer in the history of the Maywood Police 
Department to be killed in the line of duty. He was shot in the head and chest 
as he stepped from his patrol car May 29, 1992, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they shot the cop they turned the gun on an eyewitness who was five 
feet away, but the gun was out of bullets," Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the defense attorneys said they do not plan to call their clients to 
testify during the trial and some said they will try to minimize their clients' 
involvement in the murders in hopes of averting a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 With the prosecution in possession of the store's security videotape, "the big 
question is going to be life or death," said James Coady, a deputy public 
defender representing Fuentes, Hoglund's alleged assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the prosecution can't prove that Fuentes is the actual shooter, it could 
be tough for a jury to come back with the death penalty," Coady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro's attorney, Eric K. Davis, described his client as the "lookout" 
during the Maywood robbery, who could not have been involved in the shooting 
because he fled the scene after he spotted Hoglund. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never even saw the police officer get shot," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 James P. Leonard, an attorney representing Contreras, said he will acknowledge 
that his client is "a robber, but not a murderer" during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that he did not kill anyone," Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to murder, the men also face as many as 31 charges stemming from 
seven robberies of markets and restaurants from Van Nuys to Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosbard said that during the robberies, which started New Year's Eve, 1991, 
some of the defendants would strike employees over the head with their guns and 
use stun guns to persuade other employees to hand over money. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth suspect, Oscar Paredes, who was arrested in March in connection with 
the Hoglund shooting, is awaiting trial, Grosbard said. Two other suspects 
remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected to last two months with opening statements scheduled to 
begin today. Defense attorneys said they plan to introduce testimony relating 
to their clients, which they hope the jury will consider when deciding their 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro was abandoned by his parents as a young child, grew up amid war in El 
Salvador and came to the United States in the late 1970s, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite obvious cultural differences, "he is willing to pay for his 
responsibility," Davis said. "But he's in a position where they are trying to 
exact a price that is too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leonard of Contreras: "I think when the jury hears all the evidence about 
his life and history, they will see him not in the light of just a robber, but 
also as a person with redeeming features." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, who like Contreras is from Honduras, was forced to drop out of school 
in the third grade to peddle newspapers to help support his family, Coady said.

HOUSE OF HOPE; WOMEN'S SHELTER HELPS FAMILIES GET A NEW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tijuana Ware, a 27-year-old single mother, now lives in a modest, low-cost 
apartment. But for her and her two children -- Deon 7, and Semiya, 3 -- it's an 
almost fairy-tale ending to a story that could have concluded with all of them 
living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she suffered a back injury while working as a nurse's aide, and that 
put her on disability. When the disability payments ended, she was unable to 
find good day care. Her roommates reneged on the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through my savings to make rent," she said. "I used it all trying to 
save my apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 She lost it and planned to move into a friend's apartment, but the apartment 
manager would not allow children. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation she looked in the Yellow Pages and found Women's Care Cottage 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God that I was put in this place," said Ware, who was accepted 
into the facility that was founded in 1990 to help women and children without 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Los Angeles County, there are from 20,000 to 100,000 homeless at any given 
time," said Cynthia Caughey, executive director of the nonprofit facility. "Of 
these, 30% to 40% are women and children." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 6,000 women and children are homeless in the San Fernando Valley, 
Caughey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Care Cottage doesn't fit the stereotype of a homeless shelter. The 
two-story home with a large leafy shade tree in front looks like any other 
well-kept residence. In the living room there is pastel upholstered furniture, 
an oak coffee table and fireplace. A carpeted staircase leads upstairs to four 
bedrooms with 15 beds and two bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first day I cried a lot," Ware said. "I never thought I'd get to the point 
of staying in a shelter. But I was glad I wasn't going to be at a place with 
all beds and cots and stuff like that. I'm going to make sure I don't ever do 
anything like this again. Makes me appreciate everything more." 
</P>
<P>
 The cottage strives to meet the immediate needs of homeless women and 
children, providing basic necessities along with the resources to overcome 
their present situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is being homeless again and letting my kids down." said Ware. 
" I don't want to be bouncing from shelter to shelter. Here they show you how 
to be independent and help you stay upbeat and positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the staff helped her find an apartment and get back into school to 
finish her LVN training. They helped with moving and basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other organizations supplied two beds, a sofa and a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new beginning and a chance to make a new life for my children and 
myself," Ware said.

MAN, 47, DIES IN SCUBA ACCIDENT; SAN MIGUEL ISLAND: DIVER IS PRONOUNCED DEAD 
FROM INTERNAL INJURIES CAUSED BY SURFACING TOO QUICKLY, AUTHORITIES SAY.

<P>
 A 47-year-old Glendale man died Sunday morning following a scuba diving 
accident off San Miguel Island, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young was declared dead about 10 a.m. at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center in Thousand Oaks, two hours after the accident, Ventura County Deputy 
Coroner Mitch Breese said.Young died of internal injuries caused by surfacing 
too quickly from a depth of 70 to 80 feet, Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was taken by helicopter from the Ventura Harbor-based boat Spectre about 
9 a.m. to the hospital's emergency room, according to U.S. Coast Guard Petty 
Officer James Bride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arrived, people on the vessel were performing CPR on him," Bride 
said. "He was showing no vital (signs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Young was diving off the northern tip of San Miguel Island 
and had plenty of air left in his tanks when he surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ted Cumming, the captain of the Spectre, Young surfaced about 20 
minutes into the day's first dive and was swimming toward the dive boat when he 
began to complain about shortness of breath. He collapsed shortly thereafter.

MAN, 82, KILLED CROSSING BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 82-year-old man was killed as he crossed Ventura Boulevard mid-block and 
was struck by an oncoming truck, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, identified as Richard Allen of Tarzana, died instantly Saturday 
night of massive, multiple injuries, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen apparently stepped into the street between parked cars and was not seen 
in time by Dennis Reese, 18, of Encino, who was driving a 1988 Nissan 
Pathfinder, said Los Angeles Police Officer Robert Kalstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese was not charged, although an investigation into the accident is 
continuing, Kalstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 10 p.m., just east of Yolanda Street, in front of 
a Mann's movie theater.

8 VALLEY RESIDENTS ARRESTED IN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime: Two men are assaulted leaving a West Hollywood cafe in what police say 
was an apparent case of 'gay bashing.' 
</P>
<P>
 Eight San Fernando Valley residents were arrested Sunday after they allegedly 
used baseball bats and a golf club to assault two men as they walked out of a 
West Hollywood cafe, a sheriff's sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses called authorities shortly after midnight to report the attack, an 
apparent "gay bashing," in front of a cafe in the 8900 block of Santa Monica 
Boulevard, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. John Baylis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe is located in an area frequented by many gay residents, Baylis said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, three men and five juveniles piled into two cars and fled, 
a witness told sheriff's deputies. The suspects were arrested a few minutes 
later after deputies spotted their vehicles. Baylis said two baseball bats and 
a golf club were found in the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the three men as Juan Huiza, 19, of North Hills; Marvin 
Henriquez, 20, of Van Nuys, and Guillermo Henriquez, 20, of Panorama City. They 
were booked on suspicion of civil rights violations and assault with a deadly 
weapon, Baylis said.  
</P>
<P>
 The five juveniles -- whose ages ranged from 15 to 17 -- were released to 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims have not been located, Baylis said.

SCHOOL BOUNDARY CHANGES OPPOSED; EDUCATION: PARENTS OF CHILDREN IN THE NEWHALL 
SCHOOL DISTRICT VOICE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT PLANS AS OFFICIALS CONSIDER HOW TO 
REDRAW THE DISTRICT'S LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's a simple concept: Students living within a mile of a school should go 
there because it's within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall School District Supt. J. Michael McGrath got plenty of applause when 
he explained this to a group of parents who don't want planned school boundary 
changes to affect their children. After all, the parents say, many of them 
bought their houses because they were near a specific, award-winning school. 
</P>
<P>
 But a stunned silence greeted McGrath's next statement. Five of the district's 
six elementary schools are within a mile of each other, he said. Therefore, 
when a seventh school opens next fall west of the city limits, some students 
will be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theoretically, you can attend any of these schools and it is a neighborhood 
school," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents confronted McGrath with a number of issues during three public 
meetings last week -- being forced to pay for busing, the distance their 
children have to walk and how redistricting might affect junior and senior high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But most concerns revolved around a central issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my children sent somewhere else. We're happy here," said Linda 
Davis, one of about 20 Newhall Elementary School parents attending a Wednesday 
night meeting. She has two children enrolled at the school, which is one of two 
in Santa Clarita -- and four in Los Angeles County -- to win the National Blue 
Ribbon Award. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the voiced opposition to boundary changes comes from parents of the 
other Blue Ribbon school, Meadows Elementary School in Valencia, where 150 
parents met with McGrath last Monday. Kenneth Tratner, one of the founders of 
Parents for Neighborhood Schools, said he moved five years ago to a house 
within half a mile of Meadows because of its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought my house in that neighborhood because of the school," he said in a 
telephone interview. "I could have bought my house a little less expensively 
(somewhere else), but I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Three more meetings are scheduled between Wednesday and Oct. 11, with four to 
six proposed boundary plans expected by November or December. The final 
boundaries are expected to be established by January or February, following 
more meetings with parents and school officials, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 275 children of elementary school age live in Stevenson Ranch, a large 
housing development on the west side of the Golden State Freeway, which 
separates it from Santa Clarita. McGrath estimates 225 additional students will 
be transferred from existing schools to Stevenson Ranch Elementary when it 
opens next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first of several anticipated schools that will be outside the 
tightly grouped cluster of existing facilities. Existing schools were built 
when growth within Santa Clarita was heavy, but development is increasingly 
shifting to vast unincorporated areas within the district's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Solving the problem isn't as simple as building new schools within those 
areas, McGrath explained. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, state law requires districts to try to achieve ethnic balance in 
schools, he said. Most of the district's Latino students live in a concentrated 
area on the east side of the district, while most future development will occur 
on the west side. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most of the existing schools are full or have taken measures to 
prevent overcrowding, such as holding classes on a year-round schedule. The 
year-round enrollment has been as controversial among parents as the 
boundaries, and the district could eliminate the program by shifting students 
to the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many parents who would rather slit their throats than go 
multitrack," Tratner said, adding that he isn't one of them. Meadows is 
apparently in no danger of losing its traditional schedule, but he said 
multitrack is preferable to sending his sons to an unfamiliar school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District officials will use a list of 11 priorities when drawing the new 
boundaries, including reducing transportation costs by busing as few children 
as possible, distributing bilingual and other special education programs evenly 
between schools, and anticipating future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest changes will probably occur at Wiley Canyon and Old Orchard 
elementary schools, the schools closest to Stevenson Ranch. In addition, 
students being bused now will be the first sent to other schools further away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sue Higgins, a parent at the Meadows meeting, said the district's most 
important priority should be something that isn't on its criteria list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the categories that needs to be on there is how this is going 
to affect our kids," she said.

KENEALLY TO LEAVE UCI FOR HOME; TRANSITION: THE AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR, KEY IN THE 
GRADUATE PROGRAM IN WRITING, WILL STOP TEACHING AT THE END OF THE ACADEMIC 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Keneally, the award-winning Australian author of "Schindler's List," is 
leaving his teaching position at UC Irvine, where his international reputation 
has brought added luster to the university's highly acclaimed graduate Program 
in Writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally, who served as senior writer in the fiction portion of the program, 
will leave at the end of the academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It largely has to do with the difficulty of extricating the self from 
Australia," says Keneally, 58. "I find myself being a bit torn in two between 
the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally, who is founding chairman of the Australian Republican Movement that 
seeks to end Australia's constitutional ties with Great Britain, found himself 
having to return frequently to Sydney for professional and personal reasons 
over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since stepped down as the movement's chairman and says "the frequent 
returns are not as intense as they were. But I just find that in the long term 
it's going to be hard to do one's duty by the writing program and the 
university and have that commute." 
</P>
<P>
 With a characteristic chuckle, he added, "It's all the curse of my 
grandparents catching the long boat to Australia instead of America. Otherwise, 
I wouldn't have this problem. If I came from Iowa, I could fly back every week 
and not have jet lag." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally's pending departure is not based on any conflict with the university, 
he said. "It's not a slamming of the door or anything. In fact, it's been 
proposed that I continue to come back on a regular basis. I'm still looking 
into the details of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly sorry to be losing him," said Michael Clark, chairman of 
UCI's Department of English and comparative literature. "He combined his 
stature as a novelist with a dedication to teaching and the program, and that 
combination is very rare. He'll be very difficult to replace." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who was instrumental in luring Keneally to UCI, said Keneally had never 
held a permanent academic appointment before, "so it was understood he was 
trying us out -- the whole notion of being affiliated with a university on a 
full-time basis." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that, "we had certainly hoped it would be a permanent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said a search has been started to find Keneally's replacement. "We hope 
to have somebody by the beginning of the school year next year," he said. "We 
have a very long list of people we're contacting to see if they're interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally, author of more than 20 novels, five plays and number of film and 
television scripts, had been a visiting professor at UCI, where he taught the 
graduate fiction workshop for one quarter in 1985.  
</P>
<P>
 Landing a writer with the stature of Keneally for a full-time position was 
considered a coup at the university. But he was not an easy catch. 
</P>
<P>
 To entice Keneally, who turned down the offer three times, the university 
offered him the title of distinguished professor of English and comparative 
literature, a $110,000-year-appointment that includes a part-time secretary to 
help tend to the administrative details of the fiction program and a light 
teaching load: He teaches only three undergraduate and graduate courses a year, 
which allows ample time for his own writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at UCI in the fall of 1991, he has turned out several books, 
including his 1993 novel "Woman of the Inner Sea." His next book, due out in 
March, is a novel set in Australia at the turn of the century and is titled "A 
River Town."  
</P>
<P>
 Keneally received an unexpected flurry of publicity earlier this year with the 
release of Steven Spielberg's much-acclaimed movie version of "Schindler's 
List." A reissue of the 1982, fact-based novel shot to the No. 1 spot on the 
New York Times paperback best-seller list and remained on the list for 22 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Keneally, who begins teaching the fall fiction workshop today and will teach a 
graduate seminar on the connections between Irish and African literature in the 
winter quarter, said the caliber of the students in the writing program is 
"very high." 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd who are in second year at the moment are particularly talented," he 
said. "This doesn't necessarily mean that they'll (get published). That's up to 
them, but it's a very high caliber crowd now. My God, I think I could say, hand 
on heart, that they're more talented than me, that they have things that I 
could envy."

THE HUMAN CONDITION; THOSE RANDOM ACTS OF CHEAPNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ BRODY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I often ponder the phenomenology of spending habits when I'm stuck in the 
vehicular spin cycle known as the airport shuttle. There I am, squeegeed like a 
soggy piece of laundry between a window that won't open and the 500 pounds of 
fellow passenger, circling the airport for hours. But hey, I'm heroically 
saving $6 over taking a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 This nod to the piggy bank would no doubt make more sense if I weren't equally 
capable of confusing $6 with $600 at the mere sight of something spellbindingly 
essential . . . say, a sequined pair of high-heeled sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most folks, I'm selectively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Misers, tightwads and accountants aside, we pinch pennies on certain items the 
way one might pick the anchovies off the top of a pizza. When you factor in all 
the other fancies we freely dish out the dough for, these random acts of 
scrimpage can seem certifiably crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night, after I took a friend to eat at the Westside Pavilion, we 
went to the Gap where I was appalled at the price of a shirt I wanted," says 
actor Steven Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend said, 'Steve, you just dropped $65 for a half-hour dinner and won't 
spend $38 on a shirt you'll wear for a long time?" 
</P>
<P>
 You have to wonder where this actor, who by the way makes a generous living, 
shops. "Well, I don't," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the material girls of the moment have their little potholes of 
stinginess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pay whatever it costs for a facial," says alleged Hollywood madam Heidi 
Fleiss pleasantly (when reached through her facialist, Nance Mitchell).  
</P>
<P>
 "I spend for everything -- especially clothes because they end up on your 
body," Fleiss says. ( Everything includes expensive theater seats, great food, 
first-class airline seats -- "I just can't go anywhere now" -- and, of course, 
facials. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a few little no-can-dos in the Fleiss book of dough-re-me. 
Fast-food delivery is one. The TV Home Shopping Network -- anything off the 
tube -- is another. And parking tickets. "Usually I get so aggravated I just 
rip them to tiny shreds and throw them out, then I end up paying triple the 
amount," says Fleiss, who last week was ordered to enter a drug treatment 
center after she was arrested for testing positive for drugs. (Her mother 
attributed the test results to asthma medicine.) 
</P>
<P>
 So what lies behind this game of Selective Scrimpage? 
</P>
<P>
 For sure they'll eventually boil it all down to some brain chemical or other, 
treatable with the anti-spending Tightwad Patch or Mo-zac -- a drug to ease the 
pain of money madness. But in the meantime, let's turn to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often this kind of thing comes from the way your parents spend money," says 
psychotherapist Olivia Mellan, author of "Money Harmony" (Walker and Co., 
1994). "Basically, you're either imitating them or rebelling against them in 
very specific ways." 
</P>
<P>
 True, my cab chintziness comes from having grown up in Brooklyn, where taxis 
just aren't done. My dad was a fanatic subway rider who bagged taxis in with 
potato chips: Take one and you'll get addicted.  
</P>
<P>
 My mom, on the other hand, could rationalize just about any purchase. "Think 
of all the money you've saved in perms," she'd say as I'd demur over a pair of 
$250 jungle-print leggings. (Considering my hair looks like a cross between 
Richard Simmons and Cousin Itt, she had a point.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone buys this Mom and Pop Theory, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toilet paper has nothing to do with my parents," swears Lissa Golden, a 
34-year-old real estate listings coordinator who, it should be noted, thinks 
nothing of parting with $400 for any new motorcycle part to customize her 
Harley. 
</P>
<P>
 Toilet paper? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm in a grocery store I think, why should I buy it when I could steal 
it from a restaurant?" says Golden, who recently left Los Angeles for 
Minneapolis. "Maybe it's just a little way of reminding myself that I don't 
have to follow all the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Barbanel, a New York City psychotherapist who specializes in money 
issues, suggests that such quirky cheapness offers a touch of security, real or 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often people are cheap in general because they are insecure," says Barbanel, 
who just wrote "Piggy Bank to Credit Card: Teach Your Child the Financial Facts 
of Life" (Crown). "And saving a few bucks here and there makes them feel like 
they have some control -- that they are putting one over on the shopkeeper, or 
not being taken. They feel like a survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, the actor, can relate. While he fudges about his aversion to spending 
money on clothes, he will tell you that he simply doesn't believe in paying for 
valet parking: It's a matter of principle. In fact, more than once he's sneaked 
his car into the lot of a certain Hollywood restaurant just before the valet 
shows up for duty. When the guy does come on and asks for the money, Porter 
refuses since he parked himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get into this big fight that ruins my whole meal," he says. "But I do save 
the $3." (At least he comes out ahead. I'm the type who parks 10 blocks away, 
arrives late, and gets a $38 ticket.) 
</P>
<P>
 We can try to analyze till the cash cows come home, but some cases of 
selective cheapness ultimately defy explanation. Perhaps it's because these 
pecuniary quirks -- along with little white lies, pet peeves and "knock woods" 
-- are part of the idiosyncratic nature of being human, so integral that some 
people don't even realize they have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to my neighbor, Nancy Gottesman, 37, who always buys the next 
round and, in fact, pretty much buys everything, especially when it can be 
purchased through a catalogue at double the store price plus shipping and 
handling. Originally asked what she's cheap about, Gottesman was hard-pressed 
to come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until the other night when I bumped into her practically running to 
the video store clutching a copy of "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Did she like the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't finish it," she said, looking past me nervously, "but it's 
almost 11:30 and I've got to return it. I don't want to spend $2.50 for an 
extra day." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she rent it again to see the end? 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably."

A SHADOW ON THE WAVES; HE REVOLUTIONIZED THE SURFBOARD, MAKING THE SPORT 
ACCESSIBLE TO THE MASSES. BUT NO ONE REALLY KNEW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT BOB 
SIMMONS. NOW AN AVID SURFER AND SCHOOLTEACHER IS REVIVING HIS LEGEND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As San Diego surfing veteran John Elwell tells it, someone spied a speck on 
the rough, rarely ridden outside break. 
</P>
<P>
 It was December, 1949, and the boys had just paddled out into the frigid water 
of the Tijuana Slough, a surfing spot just north of the border. A second take 
revealed that there was indeed a mysterious figure speeding across the face of 
a towering swell. Unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody had seen him before, so they dubbed him the Phantom Surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, local Chuck Quinn had the nerve to paddle up to the unknown. Quinn 
promptly took measure of the fiberglass-covered balsa-wood board. It had a 
turned-up nose, flow slots on the side, and -- come again? -- twin fins. Quinn 
knew about an L.A. surfer who made boards like this. "Say," Quinn said in an 
accusatory tone, "that looks like a Simmons board." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am Simmons . . . , " the stranger said, then paddled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout surfing history, Bob Simmons has been just as elusive. He died 40 
years ago today surfing the La Jolla spot now reverently called Simmons Reef. 
Averse to photographs, autographs and nosy people, he took much of his 
pioneering past with him when he died that hazy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, he has been cast as a shadowy footnote in the sport -- outdone 
in history by surf pioneer Duke Kahanamoku, early board designer Tom Blake and 
mass-production mogul Hobie Alter. (In "The Pump House Gang," Tom Wolfe called 
Simmons "very mysterioso.") Yet, surf scholars agree, he helped transform the 
pastime from the high-skill hobby of a few thousand to a sport that boasts 1.5 
million participants today. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a horse-betting, crazy-driving, boomerang-throwing eccentric who 
happened to invent the modern surfboard, making the sport accessible to the 
masses. "Simmons had a profound effect on everything that came after him in 
surfing," says Steve Pezman, publisher of the Surfer's Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those boys who used to surf with Simmons have either died, dropped out 
or moved on. If it weren't for the 20-year obsession of Elwell, the Phantom 
Surfer might still be faceless. 
</P>
<P>
 Elwell, a 62-year-old part-time schoolteacher who still hits the waves of his 
native Coronado every sunup, has revived the legend of Simmons. He has 
uncovered memorabilia, conducted exhaustive research and written a series of 
surf-magazine articles that he one day hopes to turn into a book or film. 
"Elwell salvaged all this information that might have been lost for surf 
culture," Pezman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Using balsa and, later, foam, Simmons cut the weight of surfboards by more 
than half. (They were so easy to ride, some called them "girlfriend boards.") 
Taking surfing from the wagon wheel to the tire, he transformed boards from 
what were basically sealed-up canoes that went slow and straight to a thin, 
wide plank that sliced through the face of a wave. He opened the way for the 
fast, rocking maneuvers performed to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 How he did it was half bad luck, half genius. 
</P>
<P>
 His legacy includes hot-dogging, Hawaiian big-wave surfing and some of the 
hottest collectibles in surfing today. Simmons boards, which mainly ranged 
between eight and 12 feet, can fetch $1,800 to $20,000, experts say. Asked if 
he's ever ridden his Simmons, Lee Williams, former curator of Huntington 
Beach's International Surfing Museum, said with a laugh: "Ridden? Nah! It's too 
valuable." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robert Wilson Simmons was born in 1919 and raised on Los Angeles' Bunker Hill 
and in Pasadena with an older brother and two older sisters. He was exceptional 
at athletics and academics, family members say, but a tumor in his left ankle 
kept him away from a diploma at Belmont High. After the tumor went away, 
Simmons attended community college and then Caltech, his brother's alma mater, 
where he got straight A's, says sister Ruth Hilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was an avid cyclist, traveling Olympic distances. In 1936, he got into 
one of many accidents that seem to haunt southpaws like him. According to 
Elwell's research, Simmons smacked into a car that turned in his path at 
Beverly Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. He landed in the hospital with a 
fractured skull, a broken left leg and a shattered elbow. Worst was the elbow, 
which required a stainless steel loop that forever locked his left arm in an 
extended position. 
</P>
<P>
 A surfer being treated at the hospital told Simmons to give his sport a try, 
Elwell says. It would be years before Simmons hit the beach, but he would never 
forget the surfer's story of the "green room." It was described as the mystical 
place reached when surfers get covered by a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 It would later be the setting of Simmons' death. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this time, Simmons' older brother, Dewey, invented a strain-measuring 
device at Caltech called the SR-4 strain gauge. The device helped the aerospace 
and construction industries by allowing stress to be measured for such things 
as airplane wings and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1986 article in Caltech's Engineering & Science magazine, Dewey 
Simmons sued the university for royalties. In 1949, the California Supreme 
Court awarded him the right to what amounted to $1 million in royalties over 
the 17-year life of the patent. Even before the decision, the school changed 
its rules so that all patents developed on campus become Caltech property. 
Dewey Simmons moved on to oil prospecting, skin-diving and 3-D photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The family last heard from him more than six years ago, says nephew Rick 
Hilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Elwell says the brothers had an argument during the war years and never talked 
to each other again. They were a lot alike: stubborn, reclusive and brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' arm kept him out of the war. But he dropped out of Caltech anyway to 
become a much-needed machinist. It was around this time that he began 
developing his first surfboards. His first board was a 140-pound disaster, 
Elwell recalls him saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was a strong, tall man at 6 feet, 2 inches. But his left arm never got 
back to full strength. Traditional surfboards -- weighing 100 pounds and more 
-- were hard for him to handle both on his bike and in the water. So he 
combined his Caltech math background with newfound knowledge of hydrodynamics 
-- aquatic aerodynamics -- to lighten his load. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was seen at the beach, Elwell recalls, with a copy of "Naval 
Architecture of Planing Hulls" by Lindsay Lord -- a prewar study of 
hydrodynamics. One shape that did well looks like the modern bodyboard and 
undoubtedly influenced Simmons' flat, wide planks. He spent time at a Caltech 
test tank, where he checked out the resistance of his boards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Simmons board was built on the sands of Malibu, in his family's garage, 
and in a factory-cum-apartment in Santa Monica. He placed plywood and balsa on 
two wooden horses and carved ugly, utilitarian planks. He never signed his 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on he developed "flow slots" that channeled water over the top of the 
board to prevent lift. Some also had concave bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
 He later dropped those ideas and went with straight-ahead, flat-bottom boards 
that had turned-up noses and one or two fins. He was one of the first to use 
multiple fins (three fins are now standard). The sides, called "rails," were 
all important. They were thin and rounded. They cut into the wave, proving, as 
he told Elwell, that "we're really surfing on the rail." 
</P>
<P>
 His materials were revolutionary. First, he cut weight by sandwiching balsa 
between plywood. Then it was foam. Then he became the first to jacket the whole 
thing in fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was light-years away from the monstrous, round-bottom paddleboards 
that were the standard of the day. Simmons-style boards, later called the 
Malibu board, "made the present style of modern surfing possible," states 
1965's "The Complete Book of Surfing." Alter mass-produced the Malibu board and 
became a millionaire. "When I made my first board," he says in a phone 
interview, "I copied a Simmons." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons began to develop mathematical formulas for production. A guy would ask 
for a board, and Simmons would ask how much he weighed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a pioneer surfer. "Before Simmons boards, the ideal wave was a 
slow-breaking wave like Waikiki," Elwell says. "After Simmons, nearly every 
place that had waves opened up for surfers." And Simmons wanted to try every 
place he could, telling friends about his desire to surf Tierra del Fuego. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, Simmons became the first to surf Point Loma in San Diego, a beach 
with restricted access because of the U.S. Navy's presence. "We were just 
astounded that he got by the guards," says Elwell, who found out later that 
Simmons had talked his way past the lighthouse keeper. In 1953, he adds, 
Simmons was the first mainlander to surf Banzai Pipeline, a monster break in 
Hawaii that is possibly the world's most famous -- and feared -- surf spot. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he logged miles up and down the Southern California coast, 
cruising in his '37 Ford Tudor rust bucket, eating soybeans from the can and 
dozing off in a sleeping bag that lined his hollowed-out car. In a letter to 
Elwell, buddy Bev Morgan recalled a trip to La Jolla in Simmons' Ford: 
</P>
<P>
 "A rock wall curves gracefully down with the road (to La Jolla's Windansea 
beach). . . . As we entered the top of the drop-off, Simmons let go with a high 
pitched cackling laugh. . . . We were accelerating down the curve at 60 or 70. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure enough, he lost it. . . . It scraped into the rock wall with a loud 
grinding noise. . . . A shower of sparks was flying aft, lighting the eerie 
scene while Simmons cackled at his cleverness in scaring the crap out of me. . 
. . Simmons had practiced this before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he sidestepped fame and fortune, Elwell insists. He would dress 
in resin-covered khakis and a jacket covered with fiberglass dust. He avoided 
sun rays when he could and had pale skin to show for it. He didn't go far 
without his checkered flannel shirt and his distinctive red board. He had 
small, piercing eyes and a laugh that was triggered when he spied the 
competition's boards. He could be abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I saw him, it wasn't too long before he died," Alter says. "He 
said, 'Take me to Windansea.' Simmons would hitchhike with his surfboard 
sometimes. I said I got to go to work. He said I was no surfboard maker, and 
what kind of surfer was I, working when the surf was up." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Malibu, Simmons enlisted the help of Joe Quigg and Matt Kivlin. They 
put the finishing touches -- sanding and glassing -- on his boards. They made 
an estimated 100 boards before Simmons and Quigg split up in 1949. (Simmons 
used to charge from $15 to $55 for his boards, depending on whom he sold them 
to and how many of the finishing touches he had to do himself.) 
</P>
<P>
 Quigg, a surfing legend in his own right, says from his Hawaii home that the 
split happened after he decided to build boards on his own. He says he liked 
Simmons. But Quigg, 69, thinks Simmons isn't worthy of the attention he's been 
getting lately: "He really didn't invent anything that's in use today." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup, Simmons starting surfing in San Diego County almost 
full-time. That's when Elwell met him. Simmons liked him and built him a board. 
When Elwell pulled out his wallet, Simmons said, "Keep it, you're a lifeguard," 
Elwell recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 During his San Diego days, Simmons lived off horse betting at Del Mar and a 
board sale here and there, Elwell says. He had a betting system but would 
reveal it to no one. He also hung out at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 
learning how to chart the ocean's currents for use in wave prediction (he was 
already revered for his wave-size assessments). He took classes at San Diego 
State, too, with the goal of becoming a teacher, says sister Hilts. But his 
time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, 1954, a strong Southwest swell hit the Southern California coast. 
Windansea was pumping. Simmons, with Hawaii still on his mind, was in a 
big-wave mood. When the conditions are right, it is said, Windansea breaks like 
the prized North Shore of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 He paddled out with Elwell and a few others, but the swells were too large and 
proved impossible to surf. Elwell saw Simmons stand up late on an ominous, 
overhead wave. It was low tide, and inches separated the water's surface from 
the sandstone reef below. Simmons got pitched off his board and went down. The 
plank climbed up the wave and tumbled over the white water that crashed onto 
Simmons. Then it bounced into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Simmons' body washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 After his death, his concepts were mass-produced, surf culture exploded and 
masses landed on Southern California beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 For the boys, Elwell says, "It was the end of an era."

 Fridays signify more than the end of the work week for Dennis, 27, of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees them as a chance to "get together" via phone with the man in 
Washington, D.C., with whom he has had a long-distance relationship for the 
past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life comes together for us on Fridays. It's our special day. It keeps us 
together," he said. "Our conversations are about what we did during the week, 
but more importantly they're about how we feel about each other." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an expensive and often frustrating way to carry on a romance, experts and 
those involved in such relationships agree, but one whose obstacles can be 
surmounted and might even prove beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and his lover met in Atlanta, exchanged phone numbers and for the first 
four months of their relationship, talked on the phone two to three times a 
day, every day. That became too costly. To cut their phone expenses, the couple 
decided to talk only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. They both contribute to 
a savings account for traveling expenses to see each other every three months. 
Dennis said they have good jobs that keep them in separate cities for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always avoided (long-distance relationships) because of the phone bills, 
the lonely nights, the insecurity and the temptations," Dennis said, adding 
that this has forced him to give more to keep the relationship alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am constantly giving reassurance about our relationship," he said. "I think 
I have an insight into what's needed to keep it secure despite the distance. 
You have to keep abreast of each other's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 That "forced" communication is a benefit of a long-distance relationship, said 
Howard Wallman, a West L.A. psychotherapist, who said romance far apart can 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it can work. The key is, what works for you? Are you getting what you 
want?" Wallman said. "There are some real good things about a long-distance 
relationship. You can have your own life and you're not so dependent on another 
person. You're forced to communicate more. When you get together in person, it 
can be exciting -- it's different than the average live-in situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis agreed that communication has been accentuated in his long-distance 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communication is the basis of any relationship. That's all you have in a 
long-distance relationship," Dennis said. "You really find out the true person. 
That person can be more truthful with you. You don't feel as vulnerable over 
the phone as you do in person." 
</P>

 The key to success in a long-distance relationship, as well as a nearby 
relationship, is asking for what you want and listening to the other person's 
needs, too, Wallman added. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be able to say, 'I'm unhappy. I miss you. I want to see you.' 
Then you can reach a workable situation," Wallman said. "It's a mistake to 
second-guess or analyze the other person. Just say what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rich, author of "Get Married Now" (Bob Adams Inc., 1993) and a 
frequent lecturer at seminars on finding a marriage partner, is less idealistic 
about long-distance romance and believes saying what you want means "getting 
off the fence" about where the relationship is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she knew a man and a woman who had been using a fax to communicate 
between New York and Kenya for about five months. They recently met in Africa 
to decide if the woman could find a job there and join him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually jobs that keep married people living apart. An emphasis on career 
turned Therese Baker's more than 30-year marriage into a long-distance 
relationship. The professor of sociology at Cal State San Marcos decided the 
opportunity to help develop the infant university in 1989 was too promising for 
her to pass up, even though she and her husband lived on the campus of Stanford 
University, where he is a history professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is now a part of a growing group of people in "commuter marriages." She 
makes a round trip weekly by plane from San Francisco to San Diego. She said 
career options may make this type of relationship more common. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for people to pursue careers and end up in the same place," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I would have done this when I was younger. I don't know if I 
would recommend it for other people," she added. "For a couple with a good 
relationship, it doesn't have an adverse effect. For problematic couples, it 
probably wouldn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Distance can even add some spark to a relationship, Baker added. "It can 
enhance a marriage. You're not in this humdrum routine anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Secure marriages may be able to withstand long distances, but for singles who 
want to get in close proximity, Rich described some steps to take: 
</P>
<P>
 * Come up with a time frame, say six months, that both of you agree on as a 
deadline to "get off the fence." You will break up by this date or one of you 
will move. "If it scares the other person into leaving you, then they weren't 
ready for it, and that's good for you to know," Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sit down with your long-distance love and discuss each other's visions of 
the future. "You may have incompatible lifestyles," Rich said. "If one of you 
lives in San Francisco and has a house and likes to have barbecues while the 
other lives in L.A. and travels and spends little time at home, there could be 
a big problem when you start living together." 
</P>
<P>
 * Know what each person would be willing to sacrifice -- be it job, home, 
friends -- to be together. Rich recalled a couple she knew who met in Japan, 
where the man was living, and spent two months there together until the woman 
returned home to Boston. They spent several months writing to each other until 
the woman decided to find work in Japan and move there. They are now married. 
</P>
<P>
 While many people consider long-distance love circumstance rather than choice, 
there are those who do seek it out. If it becomes a recurring experience, 
people may want to take a look at themselves and why they continue to make this 
choice, Rich said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was involved in a casual long-distance relationship for five years with a 
man whom she used as a crutch until she made a vow to get married and decided 
to rid herself of all dangling relationships to pursue a long-term commitment 
with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I broke up with somebody, I would call this particular guy. We both 
dated other people and we thought if worse came to worst, we could marry each 
other," Rich said. "But I knew I didn't want to marry this guy. I called him up 
and let him go. In order to find the man of my dreams, I needed to close off my 
back doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are afraid to commit. They're afraid of the ongoing 
responsibility of a relationship of close proximity," she said. "Other people 
are living out some pattern -- they feel more comfortable with familiarity than 
happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who attended Rich's seminar told Rich that she had been in one 
long-distance affair after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that when she was 10, her parents divorced and her father moved 
across the country from her," Rich said. "I discovered a relationship pattern. 
She learned to love men long distance, re-creating the same pining she'd gone 
through as a 10-year-old girl. She would even rock herself to sleep crying over 
these men, just as she'd done with her father." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman recognized her pattern and committed to alter it, Rich said, by 
resolving to not date anyone from out of town.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; LOVE ACROSS THE MILES; NO HANG UPS ABOUT A 
FRIENDSHIP HELD TOGETHER BY TELEPHONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA HOWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm standing up for my best friend when she marries this November. She calls 
me her "witness" because, after three reluctant taffeta trips down the aisle, I 
have vowed never again to be known as a "bridesmaid." 
</P>
<P>
 When she tells other friends I'm in her wedding party, their eyebrows probably 
go up, because each has spent more time in person with her than I have. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven years we have been friends have been spent long distance, our 
cheeks indented with the phone keys we have pressed against them in marathon 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although my friend and I met in college and bonded to a certain extent, the 
real closeness came after graduation, after I moved away. As we both struggled 
into young adulthood, the phone became our crisis hot line manned voluntarily 
by and for each other. We prefer this type of counseling, although we could 
have paid for professional therapy with the money we spent on phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend -- I'll call her Beth (not only for anonymity, but because she's 
always wanted that name) -- has lived in Kansas, Montana and now Texas since 
I've lived in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rare friendship that survives such a separation. I've tried to keep 
other friendships and romances alive via AT&T, but they usually wither over 
time. Most relationships require proximity and the mall, movies, eating out and 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 All Beth and I have had is talk, and we've done plenty of it. I've noted some 
$10 to $20 conversations on my phone bills. We have opened each other's 
Christmas and birthday presents over the phone. We have analyzed romance and 
criticized our jobs. But I think quality phone time is the key to the success 
of this long-distance friendship. I hesitate to call other friends in other 
states because we have to play catch-up on life. 
</P>
<P>
 I have told Beth that she is about the only person I know with whom I can talk 
completely and comfortably. This admission may be a mistake. Beth knows 
everything about me and has threatened to reveal all to the tabloids if I ever 
become famous. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the beauties of our friendship is that we have nothing on which to base 
our opinions of each other's lives except what we convey. "I can't stand her," 
she'll say about some enemy of mine she's never met. "Do we love him or hate 
him?" she has asked about my volatile emotions toward some man. 
</P>
<P>
 Through our discussions, we became aware of the parallels of our childhoods. 
It was in one late-night conversation that we learned we both came from 
families with alcohol problems. It's been solid ground to stand on, to talk 
freely about such experiences and know we are not alone. We've also been 
fortunate to share talks about relatives coming to terms with their problems 
and recovering from addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth has been a patient ear, during both my obsessive ramblings and the dead 
silences of my depressions. She has always tried to help me overcome whatever 
trial I was dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth called me when she was found to have multiple sclerosis. It was hard for 
both of us to understand. But Beth is doing well, physically and emotionally. 
She's the kind of person who doesn't dwell on negatives and has a far greater 
spirit than I. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We've had a lot of lighter moments too. Just the other day, Beth laughed so 
hard she cried as I recalled playground accidents of my childhood, like being 
dragged by a whirling merry-go-round and injuring my groin by slipping on the 
monkey-bars ladder. We wondered together: Why were little girls always dressed 
impractically for play in those too-short dresses, knee-high socks and slick 
dress shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 We've laughed in person, too, managing to meet over the years. Beth visited me 
in Venice. She was in the rental car screaming along with me as I took my first 
stab at freeway driving. I went to her place in Montana, christening her new 
apartment's bathroom by throwing up in it after we overdosed on cheap wine. The 
next day, we toured Yellowstone and watched hundreds of people watching (and 
torturing) nature. One spring, we met up north when she was there on business 
and decided to plan out the rest of our lives in her hotel room. As I was 
formulating my destiny, I looked over to find her snoring in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, there have been the regular trips home, where we drive across 
the Plains, playing connect-the-dots from one greasy spoon to another, talking 
much as we do over the phone, memorizing each other's expressions and gestures 
for visuals in later phone chats. 
</P>
<P>
 I have given Beth a hesitant thumbs up on her upcoming marriage. She has made 
her husband-to-be aware that our phone calls will be a part of their lifestyle. 
I do approve of her man, but I hope the marriage does not squelch our chats, 
although they will probably diminish to a certain extent. 
</P>
<P>
 I know a Mrs. Beth will have a lot more going on in her life. But for 
friendship's sake, I hope it doesn't mean a busy signal.

MUSIC REVIEW; BRIGHT NEW HALL IN ESCONDIDO; SOUTHLAND CONCERT VENUE OFFERS THE 
SOUNDS OF VIBRANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city in northern San Diego County put itself on the cultural map Saturday 
with a preview opening of the resonant concert hall that is part of the 
$74-million California Center for the Arts scheduled to open Oct. 1. The sound 
within the new 1,524-seat hall is splendid but may take some getting used to. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the hall opens Oct. 2 with a (sold-out) recital by Cecilia 
Bartoli. But the San Diego Symphony, which probably will become a frequent 
visitor, was invited in early to give a gala preview program. Guest conductor 
JoAnn Falletta led works by Brahms, Rachmaninoff and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. 
Colleague Karen Keltner led choruses by Wagner and Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound at the gala was paradoxically vibrantly "present" and indeterminate, 
at least as heard from a central seat about midway back on the orchestra level. 
The sound was widely dispersed and arrived already well-blended, possibly too 
well-blended, with the top and bottom of the spectrum most favored except in 
lightly scored passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, however, although the sound was typically larger and fresher than 
life, the location of an instrument could be hard to pinpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 It was exciting, involving, disconcerting. Call it, for lack of a better term, 
a "fishbowl" sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it changed in the higher-lying seats. There are a small mezzanine and 
three shallow balconies above the orchestra section. Seating on the floor is 
mostly continental-style, but there are two aisles in the area behind Row P. 
The seats are burnt orange and the hall is an attractive lemony white. 
</P>
<P>
 The late architect Charles Moore of Moore Ruble Yudell in Santa Monica 
designed the facility so that no seat is farther than 100 feet from the stage. 
He created a bright, airy, friendly space for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it is a somewhat elliptical space, and to conform to it, the stage is 
wide and shallow. This causes the musicians to play toward each other and 
across a wider expanse than is commonly encountered, which creates new sonic 
displacements as well as the characteristics already noted. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of polished, dark, wooden half-cleaved pillars, vaguely suggesting 
Pharaonic design, stands at the back and sides of the stage. Presumably they 
were sanctioned by acoustician Rick Talaske of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta was taking over for San Diego Symphony music director Yoav Talmi, who 
was on assignment in Carnegie Hall, according to an orchestra spokeswoman. 
Falletta, music director of the Long Beach Symphony, opened the program with an 
affectionate, authoritative account of Brahms' "Academic Festival" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
 She then turned to the premiere of Zwilich's "American Concerto," composed for 
and performed by trumpeter and television personality Doc Severinsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasting about 15 minutes, the concerto unfolds in one tightly constructed 
movement, built out of possibly no more than three or four ideas, which recur 
in various guises in the episodic, thoroughly serious work. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows Severinsen abundant power notes but also opportunities for subtle 
and sustained playing. The piece was commissioned by the California Center, the 
San Diego Symphony, the Virginia Symphony, the Buffalo Philharmonic and 
Severinsen. Zwilich was on hand to accept a bouquet at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta then turned over the baton to Keltner, who led the orchestra and the 
San Diego Master Chorale in brisk performances of choruses from Wagner's 
"Tannhauser" and Verdi's "Nabucco" and "Aida." Alas, she pushed Verdi's 
heart-rending "Va, pensiero" through the hurdy-gurdy sausage grinder. 
</P>
<P>
 At intermission time, there was lots of predictable bustle as people scurried 
about the new facility to locate restrooms and water fountains. Those who just 
wanted to sip coffee or other beverages could find attractive nooks and 
crannies to hang out in, offering ample and comfortable seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert hall shares with the whole complex a visual style that combines De 
Chirico-like unadorned arches with rail-station open efficiency, all softened 
by light, bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the program, Garrick Ohlsson appeared as soloist in Rachmaninoff's 
Piano Concerto No. 2, replacing Alexis Weissenberg, who is ill and has canceled 
all his remaining 1994 concerts. The hall gave great forward prominence to 
Ohlsson's playing, which could be heard in detail at its poetic and powerful 
best. The collaboration with Falletta was not always ideal, however, and here 
the orchestra sometimes sounded like a huge amorphous rumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Escondido has asked for more than striking visual design for its 
concert facility. It has built a hall that advances a particular kind of sound, 
one that impresses with vibrant presence at the cost of some clarity and even 
of credibility. Well, there are always trade-offs. Still, it is an impressive 
achievement and a grand beginning.

FOR PBS AT LEAST, 'BASEBALL' IS A HIT -- BUT IT'S NO 'CIVIL WAR'; TELEVISION: 
KEN BURNS' EPIC IS ATTRACTING A LARGE AUDIENCE BY THE NETWORK'S STANDARDS, BUT 
NOT AS LARGE AS HIS PREVIOUS MINISERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is "Baseball," Ken Burns' epic PBS miniseries following his landmark work "The 
Civil War," a ratings hit or a miss? It's a question akin to the classic 
inquiry about whether the glass is half empty or half full. 
</P>
<P>
 By PBS standards, the first week of "Baseball" was outstanding, attracting an 
audience 2 1/2 times larger than the average public-television program. But by 
commercial network standards, its ratings so far would probably be dubbed a 
disaster -- especially because $2 million was spent by General Motors alone on 
advertising, promotion and educational projects. And that doesn't begin to 
encompass the mounds of free publicity "Baseball" acquired through splashy 
magazine and newspaper articles and countless TV appearances by Burns -- a 
clear media home run. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first five nights last week, the nine-part "Baseball" averaged a 5.1 
rating in 32 major markets (national ratings for PBS are not yet available), 
attracting about 7% of the available viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the national rating is about the same, that would make "Baseball" one 
of the least-watched programs on television last week when compared with the 
fare on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. The 5.1 rating that the first episode got on 
Sept. 18 would have ranked 84th out of 85 prime-time programs on the A.C. 
Nielsen weekly ratings list. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "Baseball" didn't perform nearly as well as "The Civil War" did in 
September, 1990. Matching the 24 markets that were measured then, the five 
nights of "Civil War" had an average 8.9 rating and 13% share of the audience 
vs. "Baseball's" 5.5 rating and 8% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Civil War" was 11 hours; altogether when its "game" is over, "Baseball" will 
have aired 18 1/2 hours. It cost $8 million to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Baseball's" win column, however, is the fact that the 5.1 rating in 32 
markets is 155% better than public television normally does in prime time. PBS 
averages a 2 rating and a 3% share of audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled with that," said John Fuller, director of PBS research. 
</P>
<P>
 Did "Baseball" do as well as it was supposed to, or did the stunning 
performance of "Civil War" unreasonably enhance expectations? And what role did 
the Major League Baseball strike play -- enlarging audiences who missed seeing 
men run around the bases, or turning fans off in anger? 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller insisted that he didn't think "anybody in their right mind expected 
'Baseball' to do what 'Civil War' did. It's different subject matter -- it's 
about a sport. 'The Civil War' was one of those shows like ABC's (1977 
miniseries) 'Roots' that touched a national nerve. While 'Baseball' certainly 
has plenty of emotional elements (but they didn't) drive the series, like 
slavery did." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why, then, "Baseball" got 7 1/2 hours more than "Civil War," Fuller 
replied: "That's Ken Burns. We weren't the ones who decided how long to make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the ratings changed each night of "Baseball" -- "one a little 
lower, one a little higher, and all in all it's holding up." Its best night 
last week was Wednesday -- a 5.6 rating and 9% share when it concentrated on 
Babe Ruth. The other four nights drew a 7% share. The worst ratings were on 
Tuesday, at 4.6, which dealt with baseball's first decade of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial network executives tended to dodge the question of whether they 
would be disappointed with "Baseball's" ratings based on what was spent to 
promote it. Some opted not to discuss the matter at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hyams, ABC's vice president of audience analysis, also used the "Roots" 
analogy, saying that "Civil War" was in a class by itself. So, if he were at 
PBS, he said, "I'd be quite happy" that "Baseball" is "doubling and tripling 
its audience levels." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hyams also noted that "18 1/2 hours is an awful lot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody is a baseball fan," he said. "The Civil War was a turning point 
in the country's history. Maybe not that many people care about what happened 
in the 1860s with baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "the topic (of baseball) is somewhat narrow" -- skewed to an 
older, male audience. "It doesn't have that much female appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, "the strike hurt," creating "a backlash against watching 
anything like 'Baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>
 George Schweitzer, CBS' executive vice president for marketing and 
communications, agreed. "I guess the real issue is, is there an appetite for 
baseball? It doesn't knock the quality of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has "a narrower appeal" than did "The Civil War," Schweitzer noted. 
"A documentary on baseball is not as good as a baseball game. . . . There is no 
baseball and no interest in baseball, and people are finding other things to do 
without baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS' Fuller said he was waiting for the ratings for the final installments, 
which began Sunday and conclude Wednesday night: "We must wait and see how many 
people come back." 
</P>
<P>
 John Maciarz, a public relations and marketing executive for General Motors, 
the major corporate backer of "Baseball," said last Friday that he was happy 
with the results thus far. "We still have the week to go, and we still have 
some powerful episodes. Bottom line -- we're not disappointed."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; WHEN A MOUNTIE'S AS THICK AS A BRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HOWARD ROSENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for accused murderer O.J. Simpson are relentlessly attacking the 
credibility of the Los Angeles Police Department, using the courtroom to lobby 
the presiding judge and using television to take their case to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's a much more renowned police force whose reputation is being 
impugned via television, a world-famous agency that can trace its 
law-enforcement roots to 1873, an organization whose heroic fight against crime 
in the Northwest Territories is legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of movies have been made that romanticize and glamorize the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police in the interest of box office. Now, as the fall season 
unfolds, comes a different perspective: the doofus approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Can a Mountie really be this, uh, thick? 
</P>
<P>
 Being produced by a Canadian company doesn't assure authenticity for the new 
CBS drama series "Due South" and its Mountie hero, any more than being 
U.S.-bred guarantees accuracy for, say, the CBS series "Walker, Texas Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
 Called a "comedy adventure" by CBS, "Due South" fills its 8 p.m. Thursday hour 
with the triumphs and follies of stiff-jawed, ultra-square, deadpan Constable 
Benton Fraser, who joins a local cop in battling lawlessness in the Midwest 
Territories. That would be present-day Chicago, where he is assigned to stand 
outside and guard the Canadian consulate, remaining rigid and refusing to 
speak, as if under a command of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Played by Canadian Paul Gross, this brick of a palooka conforms to the 
Mounties' "Dudley Do-right" caricature, minus a couple dozen IQ points. He is 
so polite that he keeps giving up his place in a taxi queue after arriving at 
O'Hare Airport, ultimately choosing to walk to downtown Chicago, luggage in 
hand, rather than take up cab space. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it gritty realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it is, "it's definitely embarrassing," a real Mountie said by phone 
from Vancouver. The Mountie, requesting anonymity, said that he and a local 
police officer "howled" with laughter while watching "Due South." 
</P>
<P>
 How dumb does he think Fraser is? "Very dumb," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Due South" constable has been roaming the city in his red jacket and 
campaign hat, something his real-life counterparts would never do, especially 
in another country, according to the Vancouver Mountie. "He'd wear plainclothes 
in Chicago. We only wear the red coats for ceremonial occasions or for 
funerals." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance Communications Corp., the same company that produces "Due South," now 
has another Mountie series running in Canada that, by some accounts, is 
reasonably accurate. But the Vancouver constable recalls an earlier Canadian 
television series that had a prominent Mountie character more reminiscent of 
Fraser. "He was pretty dumb too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More circumspect about "Due South" is Gilles Moreau, a corporal with Mountie 
media relations in Ottawa, who said by phone that he became a technical adviser 
for the series after some of his colleagues criticized the two-hour pilot when 
it aired in Canada last spring. The Mounties were not consulted about that 
pilot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although calling the series a "fairy tale," he credits it at least with 
incorporating such Mountie "values" as "respect for human rights and the fact 
that we serve the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreau acknowledged that "Due South" does not accurately depict today's 
Mounties, however, and that the show's running bit about Constable Fraser 
standing mute outside the consulate is, well, "more like the guards outside 
Buckingham Palace." But he added: "We have to remember, this is television." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Southern California, "Due South" has an avid viewer in Charles 
Skinner, who was executive producer of "Sergeant Preston of the Yukon," the old 
CBS series (1955-58) and radio spinoff about a stalwart Mountie who battled 
scoundrels in the snowy Yukon Territory of the gold-rushing 1880s. Just as 
Constable Fraser hangs out in Chicago with his wolf (which looks like a dog), 
Preston's constant companions were his dog, Yukon King, and his black horse, 
Rex. There the similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston, played by an actor named Richard Simmons, "went out in the name of 
the queen and did things to bad guys," Skinner said. Preston's most famous 
words -- "On, King! On, you huskies!" -- resonate across the decades. "But this 
guy (Fraser) looked like Superman or something the way he was running across 
rooftops the other night," Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that Superman knew when to take off his costume.

NEW ANAHEIM ICE CENTER DESIGN WILL GO WITH THE FLOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an undulating profile and gleaming surface that makes it resemble two icy 
hillocks, Frank O. Gehry's design for an 85,000-square-foot community ice 
center is in keeping with his view of buildings as "sculptural objects." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the interior will be made of curved, laminated wood beams, except 
for a concrete central area, which will house locker rooms, exercise rooms, a 
restaurant and community meeting places. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens next August or September, the corrugated aluminum building by 
the controversial Los Angeles architect will be the practice home base for the 
Mighty Ducks as well as a site for public skating and community programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With both a National Hockey League-size rink and a slightly larger 
Olympic-size rink, the center will provide 13,000 hours of ice time annually. 
Because the Mighty Ducks require only 150 to 200 hours per year, there will be 
ample opportunity for public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Berg, the Disney Co.'s director of development, said the company is 
trying to come up with a name for the building. And, no, it won't be "DUCKS." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the city is donating the site -- at the southwestern corner of Lincoln 
Avenue and Clementine Street -- the Disney Co. is bankrolling the project. 
According to Berg, it is company policy not to reveal project costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gehry's design for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, funded in part 
by a $50-million donation from Walt Disney's widow, Lillian, has been 
criticized for complexities that have boosted the cost to $260 million -- $50 
million more than the original estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That turn of events is ironic in view of Gehry's fame for what he once dubbed 
"cheapskate architecture." His buildings typically incorporate such inelegant 
materials as corrugated metal and chain link. 
</P>
<P>
 Gehry's other projects in Orange County include University Park Apartments in 
Irvine and, on the UC Irvine campus, Rockwell Engineering Center and the 
neighboring Information and Computer Sciences/Engineering Research facility.

DEES GOES TO COURT TO TWEAK SIMPSON 'MEDIA CIRCUS'; RADIO: THE KIIS DEEJAY WILL 
BROADCAST HIS SHOW FROM THE STEPS OF THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING TO POKE FUN 
AT COVERAGE FOCUSED ON TITILLATING DETAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to demonstrate that media coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder 
trial has turned loonier than a three-ring circus, Rick Dees, accompanied by 
the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile and performers from Circus Vargas, will broadcast 
his KIIS-FM (102.7) morning show from the steps of the Criminal Courts Building 
in downtown Los Angeles today. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Joseph, Dees' producer, said that the live five-hour show, beginning at 5 
a.m., is a one-time event designed to poke fun at all the media from around the 
country and the world that will be on hand today as jury selection for the 
celebrated trial commences.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is to point out how crazy the whole thing has become," Joseph said. 
"We'll be commenting not on the trial, but on the media, all the reporters from 
every two-bit station in the country who are here, to see how they really feel. 
To see if they are just as sick of it and yet sucked into it as we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph said that the decision to broadcast from the courthouse comes in 
response to the incessant interest of the show's listeners to every development 
in the story -- a case of giving the people what they want. But he denied that 
the program was having it both ways: making fun of the hoopla while piling on 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we were down there every day, you could say that then we were a 
part of the circus. But this is just once," he said. "Believe me, I wish it 
were all over with. I wish our listeners were interested in some other kinds of 
comedy. I wish (today) was the last day of this thing, not the first." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dees is likely to be the only host of a local radio show on hand live today. 
Local talk-radio stations said they will cover the story with news reports for 
now, rather than originating entire programs from the site.  
</P>
<P>
 But Dees will have radio company. KROQ-FM (106.7) probably won't send its 
morning team of Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter to the court, but it will 
have some of the program's regular cast of characters -- including 
loud-mouthed, megaphone-wielding prankster "Michael the Maintenance Man" -- on 
hand to stir things up, possibly to mock Dees, one of their favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never make fun of the murders or the judicial process," said Kevin 
Weatherly, KROQ's programming director, in response to questions about whether 
turning a tragedy into throwaway radio jokes is in bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're there to mock the spectacle," he said. "To make fun of ourselves and 
what this has become. Like the T-shirt vendors and every news channel and 'Hard 
Copy' and the tabloids all scrambling to get the dirt: That's what is humorous. 
The news part of it is not what we are there to mock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case as sport or spoof continues in prime-time tonight as both 
"Murphy Brown" and "Love & War" air tied-together episodes of a story obviously 
inspired by recent events. 
</P>
<P>
 In CBS' "Murphy Brown" at 9 p.m., a famous astronaut is charged with murdering 
his brother and flees with police in pursuit on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
Meanwhile, Murphy and her news colleagues begin to investigate every angle 
during a live broadcast in which they find nothing much to report. 
</P>
<P>
 Following at 9:30 p.m., the "Love & War" gang sits around the bar watching 
television and wisecracking as the astronaut leads police in a car chase down 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, a freeway pursuit again becomes comic fodder on NBC's 
"Seinfeld" as the character Kramer helps a former baseball star flee from 
police in the wake of a brutal crime.

A NEW CENTER OF HOPE FOR REGION'S HOMELESS; SIMI VALLEY: THE FACILITY, 
PROVIDING THE ONLY SERVICE OF ITS KIND IN THE EAST COUNTY, IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN 
TODAY AFTER MONTHS OF FALSE STARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The cold autumn fog that clings to Simi Valley each morning sends chills down 
Judy Hall's spine. 
</P>
<P>
 As summer heat turns to fall wind and drizzle, the homeless advocate shudders 
with the growing urgency of her much-delayed mission -- to provide warm 
clothing, hot showers and a safe, steady place for people without homes to call 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of false starts -- bad plumbing, faulty wires and cash shortages 
among them -- the Samaritan Center for the homeless in Simi Valley is scheduled 
to open today. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will operate Mondays through Fridays from 9 a.m. to noon, 
will be the only service of its kind in eastern Ventura County. In addition to 
providing clean clothing and showers, the center will offer free local 
telephone calls, mail service and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on the street, you're always on your guard," said Hall, director 
of the center. "The Samaritan Center will give people a place to relax for a 
little while. I think that could make all the difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hall plans to open the site today, there are plenty of things that 
could still go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working with donated goods, donated time and some very old buildings," 
Hall cautioned. "We don't want to get our hopes up too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hall cannot hide her enthusiasm. While showing a visitor a just-laid 
sidewalk, she clapped her hands with glee and danced a quick jig around the wet 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful," she sang. "I can't tell you what we 
went through to get this sidewalk put in." 
</P>
<P>
 For some supporters of the center, the opening is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Brentnall, chairman of the board of directors for the center, began 
working five years ago to find a property owner willing to rent to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be making some progress with a property owner and then the nearby 
businesses would complain and that would be the end of that," Brentnall said. 
"We had complaints from auto rebuilding shops and some other pretty rough 
outfits. Nobody wanted homeless people around." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation finally came when St. Francis of Assisi Church on Royal Avenue 
decided to build new facilities and offered to rent the old ones to the 
Samaritan Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a godsend, really," Brentnall said. "For a while there, it looked like 
we were not going to be able to find a site." 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings, however, were dilapidated and required a nearly $100,000 face 
lift. Brentnall went to work securing funding for the renovation and slowly the 
money came in. 
</P>
<P>
 The city pitched in more than $80,000 in earthquake relief funds. The Times 
gave $8,000. Rockwell, where Brentnall works as a manager, donated chairs, 
sofas, file cabinets and other furniture. Other corporations and private donors 
contributed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, where churchgoers once sought peace of mind in the parish sanctuary, 
heaps of soiled clothing wait a turn in rumbling washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 And the large, one-room parish hall where the congregation once gathered for 
bake sales and bingo has been subdivided into a reception area, lounge and 
storage space stocked with donated supplies from Band-Aids and body cream to 
toothbrushes and toilet tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The floors are swept, the curtains hung, and the supplies alphabetized and 
neatly stacked, the work of dozens of volunteers who have donated hundreds of 
hours to the center even before its opening. All of the volunteers have 
undergone a training program that requires them to role-play as homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 For volunteer Ron Kunkel, it is not difficult to imagine being homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunkel, a Vietnam veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, 
said he knows many people who have lost their incomes and become homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are good people," Kunkel said. "They are you and I. When life was bad 
to them, they just weren't as fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Isabelle Landis, whose home is next door to the center, said she jumped at the 
chance to volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lived in Simi Valley for 30 years, and I really see the homeless 
problem getting worse," Landis said. "Whatever we can do to help, we should 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The services provided at the Samaritan Center are designed to supplement two 
other programs in Simi Valley for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Action to Deliver Shelter, or PADS, provides overnight shelter six 
months a year, and a dinner program operated by volunteers from several area 
churches runs throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Samaritan Center comes seven years after the city's first 
drop-in center shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 The first center, operated by the Simi Valley Presbyterian and United 
Methodist churches from 1984 to 1987, offered similar services for homeless 
people, said Phil Kochman, who served on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate developer allowed the center to stay rent-free in an office 
building on the east end of Los Angeles Avenue. When the property was sold, the 
new owner kicked Kochman's group out and razed the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still haven't done anything with it (the property)," Kochman said. 
"Think of all the people we could have been helping, and it's just an empty 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall hopes that the Samaritan Center will pick up where Kochman's group left 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cup of coffee and a shower might not seem like a lot to you and me," Hall 
said. "But I think it can bring people a little bit of hope to get them on the 
right track." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Samaritan Center for the homeless in Simi Valley needs volunteers and 
donations of disposable razors, toilet paper, coffee and men's underwear and 
socks. For more information, call the center at 579-9166.

AIR SHOW WILL GO ON WITHOUT THE BIG TEAMS; POINT MUGU: PRECISION GROUPS BOW OUT 
DUE TO SCHEDULING CONFLICTS. NAVY'S ANNUAL EVENT THIS WEEKEND WILL SHIFT FOCUS 
TO SOLO AEROBATIC ACTS AND FLIGHT DEMONSTRATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scheduling problems will keep such big-name aerial acts as the Navy's Blue 
Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds out of this year's Point Mugu Air Show, 
but Navy officials say they have enough warplanes and other acts to keep the 
crowds happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the precision wingtip-to-wingtip flying of such acts as the Blue 
Angels, the weekend's decidedly downsized show will feature a host of 
individual aerobatic acts and flight demonstrations by military and civilian 
pilots, base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every couple of years, it works out where the big teams can't make it," Navy 
spokesman Alan Alpers said. "So, this year we get the chance to show off our 
fleet workhorses -- the Tomcat and the Hornet. We're confident that people who 
come out will have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said scheduling problems this year stood in the way of booking one of 
the major flight demonstration teams such as the Blue Angels, the Thunderbirds 
or the Canadian Air Force's Snowbirds into the 32nd annual show. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearly show, which costs the Navy an estimated $100,000 to stage, is Point 
Mugu's major community outreach and public relations event. Last year's show 
featured both the Navy's Blue Angels and the Canadian Snowbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 With Navy meteorologists forecasting good weather for the weekend, officials 
estimate that more than 100,000 people will turn out for the two-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of the razzle-dazzle flash of the demonstration teams does not 
concern Capt. Selwyn Laughter, commander of the Naval Air Weapons Station, a 
veteran F-14 Tomcat fighter pilot and the host of this year's air show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the F-14 is built allows for the pilot to do slower maneuvers at 
lower altitudes," Laughter said. "I think this is going to be definitely more 
of an operational air show than what people may have seen in years past. It's a 
different change of pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu Navy pilots flying Tomcats and Hornets will demonstrate classic 
pursuit, bombing and strafing runs, Laughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another demonstration will feature the unique firefighting abilities of the 
Air National Guard's hulking C-130 Hercules -- aircraft normally reserved by 
the military to move troops and equipment, but which have been modified to 
fight forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 During the show, Air National Guard officials will set ablaze a strip of grass 
in the infield adjacent to Point Mugu's main runway, then call for one of their 
146th Airlift Group Hercules to fly in and snuff it out. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, Air National Guard crews from the Channel Islands base flew 
nearly 600 firefighting missions over California, Arizona and Idaho, dropping 
an estimated 1.6-million gallons of fire retardant, said Staff Sgt. Michael 
Drake, an Air National Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy to make ourselves available," Drake said. "There's been so much 
news about the fires this summer, we thought this show would be an opportunity 
for the public to see exactly how we do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other military aviation demonstrations include a solo performance by an Air 
Force F-16 Fighting Falcon, a lightweight single-seat fighter plane. The show 
will also feature a rare appearance by a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier, a fighter 
jet capable of vertical take-offs and landings that was prominently featured in 
the recent Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian acts include a variety of aerobatic demonstrations by both jet and 
propeller-driven aircraft. Such acts include a rare World War II-era Grumman 
F8-F Bearcat and Russian-built Sukhoi-29 and MiG-17 jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the airborne acts, show-goers will have a chance to closely inspect 
dozens of military and civilian aircraft on display. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, events will be kicked off by "missing man" flyovers by 
the Southern California Wing of the Confederate Air Force, an organization that 
restores and flies World War II-era aircraft. Air Show Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the 32nd Point Mugu Air Show will open the gates to the Naval Air 
Weapons Station starting at 8 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. Admission and parking

LOAN PROGRAM AIDS FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS; FILLMORE: UNDER NEW PROGRAM, RENTERS 
ARE BECOMING OWNERS SOONER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY OFFERS 
UP TO $25,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paul Mithra of Fillmore has been paying rent for as long as he can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes a good living producing computer software at a West Los Angeles 
company, but he could never scrape up the down payment for a house of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed early this summer when Mithra read a newspaper ad announcing 
Fillmore's new down-payment assistance program for first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, instead of writing a rent check, he pays a monthly mortgage on a 
century-old frame house just blocks from where his two daughters attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't anticipating buying a home any time soon," said Mithra, 40, who was 
loaned almost $21,000 under the program. "I expected it would have had to be 
another 10 years away." 
</P>
<P>
 Mithra is one of five home buyers who so far have qualified for Fillmore's 
down payment program, a Redevelopment Agency-funded effort that pays up to 
$25,000 of the purchase price of a first home. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials call the program an innovative way to keep Fillmore's young 
people in town and get families into their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high percentage of renters and it's hard to get the down payment," 
said Doug Kubik, Fillmore's housing officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten percent (down payment) is typically what banks are looking at, and that's 
13 grand, plus all your fees," Kubik said. "That's a hard swing for many 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the assistance program, qualified buyers receive 15% or $25,000, 
whichever is lower, to help with their down payment. But they still must come 
up with another 5% of the selling price and find their own lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 If the buyers live in the house for 30 years or longer, the money need never 
be paid back, Kubik said. But if they sell the home within that time, the city 
gets its money back plus 15% of the net equity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really trying to make money," Kubik said. "Every time we get money 
back, it will return to the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Roy Payne said the agency has about $400,000 to lend to qualified 
buyers this year -- enough for 16 or more first-time home buyers. More than 40 
families have already applied to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who are buying a first house, who have the monthly income to 
make the payments, but they're not able to save up the down payment that's 
required," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, families must purchase a house in Fillmore, earn a household 
income defined by the federal government as low or moderate, and maintain the 
home as their primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a program geared to moderate-income families, officials said. For 
example, a family of four can earn up to $66,250 a year and still qualify, 
Kubik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance is offered on a first-come, first-served basis to ensure that 
everyone has a fair chance at qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have it prioritized so that people who have lived here for a year or 
longer get first priority," Kubik said. "The second priority is working in 
Fillmore, the third is living within the school district's boundaries and the 
fourth is everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore City Council launched the assistance program earlier this year, 
in part to abide by a state law requiring that 20% of all Redevelopment Agency 
money be spent on low- or moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's giving the people in Fillmore a chance to remain here, so as they grow 
up, they don't have to move out of town," said Councilman Scott Lee, who sits 
on the loan review committee. "It's also helping the city in the sense that . . 
. we're able to create a market for houses and that helps our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Gunderson said the program complements other city efforts to 
meet the housing needs of low- and middle-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of about three thrusts that are going on in Fillmore," Gunderson 
said. "The others are the rehabilitation of existing units and building 
affordable apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said Fillmore budgeted about $80,000 this year to repair substandard 
housing and has more than $300,000 set aside to help finance a low-income 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore is Ventura County's poorest city, with a per-capita income of 
$10,674, according to the 1990 U. S. census. 
</P>
<P>
 And 38% of the homes in Fillmore are rented, compared with the county average 
of 34.5%. It is those people that the first-time home buyers program seeks to 
attract. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people in Fillmore that wouldn't otherwise be in a position 
to buy a house without that program," said Steve McKinnon, the owner of 
Fillmore Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is economically better for them, the sellers and the local real estate 
industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Payne said, the Redevelopment Agency funds will drop from $400,000 
to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may end after next year, or it may be reduced," Payne said of the 
home-buying program. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that, however, matters to Mithra, who for the first time in his life 
relishes the idea of paying property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that they focus this program on more middle-income families was 
hugely important for me," he said. "Fillmore seems to involve itself in a 
number of positive programs to build up the community."

SLIP-SLIDING AWAY; BIKE PATH ALONG COAST ERODES AS OFFICIALS DEBATE ITS 
PRESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Bit by crumbled bit, the ocean is eating away again at Ventura's seaside bike 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, near the mouth of the Ventura River, a span the length of two 
10-speeds had to be cordoned off because seeping water slid underneath the 
asphalt and carried the loosened pavement out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a stretch midway between Figueroa Street and the shoreline dunes is 
cracking and corroding, sending jagged slabs of pavement tumbling down onto the 
shore below. Another portion closer to Figueroa Street threatens, too, to break 
away soon, also the victim of oceanic erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 If something is not done quickly, city and state parks officials say, the 
charging salt water will swallow up whole sections of the asphalt path by 
Christmas. Even parts of the adjoining parking lots will be submerged by the 
advancing waves, they predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials hope to preserve the scenic bike path, which one city 
employee describes as nothing less than a "community treasure." But state parks 
and Coastal Commission officials worry that any artificial repairs to the bike 
path area will only temporarily solve the problem, while further disturbing the 
delicate environmental balance of the area's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of the bike path -- actually, only a small portion of a statewide 
coastal path that stops and starts its way down the length of California -- 
also has some people concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's in kind of a bad spot," said Terri Willison of Ventura, out for 
her morning walk last week with her friend Janine Williams. "But then, I like 
walking here and I don't know if I'd walk it if it was" farther inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams pointed out, though, that local officials can only fight the ocean so 
long. "That's the natural way of the water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, state and city officials say, the ocean's natural path ran 
directly over the bike path, across the parking lots, atop Shoreline Drive and 
even onto the Ventura County Fairgrounds, just north of what is now the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the late 1940s and lasting until the early 1960s, workers grading 
oil fields around Ventura Avenue loaded all their excess material into trucks 
and deposited some into a nearby canyon, and some onto the beach, said Steve 
Chase, Ventura's environmental affairs coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Gravel, sand, various types of rubble -- they all piled up along the shore 
between the mouth of the Ventura River and the beach promenade, in the process 
pushing the coastline outward artificially by a few hundred feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the water, shoved backward by the artificial beach, laps aggressively 
at the shore as it attempts to return to where it once flowed freely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ocean is working on it and it's going to take (the sand away) to find a 
natural level," warned Steve Treanor, district superintendent of the Channel 
Coast state parks. "That's physics." 
</P>
<P>
 The bike path, however, is suffering from more than just its location on a 
manufactured shore. Locally as well as internationally, years of human assault 
on waterways and coastlines are taking their toll on beaches, depriving them of 
essential sand and altering wave patterns. Because people dammed rivers and 
mined the sand from their banks, less silt now flows to the ocean. That 
translates into less sand for beaches and more opportunity for waves to reclaim 
what is now dry land. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in an attempt to control deltas and protect coastal settlements, seaside 
residents from California to England have constructed such barriers as jetties 
and fortified their soft shores with structures such as rock revetments. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say that although such attempts may solve the local problem, they 
often ultimately worsen matters by altering wave patterns and thus hastening 
erosion farther down the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's bike path itself suffers from an jetty up the shore, which Chase 
said makes the coastal sand sweep away even faster than it normally would. The 
shore underneath the path also receives less sand than it naturally would have 
because of mining operations on the Ventura River, which during the 1960s, '70s 
and '80s captured tons of sand otherwise destined for the ocean, Chase said. In 
addition, he said, the dam at Lake Casitas continues to prevent silt from 
reaching Ventura's coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the beach north of the promenade is so fragile that the first path 
constructed in 1981 washed away six months after workers painted the last 
median stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike path that now runs along the edge of the mound was built about 30 
feet inland from its predecessor and fortified with deeper curbs to stabilize 
it against the tides, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current path and its adjoining parking lots were built with a permit 
issued by the California Coastal Commission in the late 1980s. Mindful of the 
fate of the earlier path and concerned by the delicate condition of the river 
mouth, commissioners designated the path and the parking lots "temporary 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 They could stay as long as the ocean allowed, commissioners decided, but if 
the waves reclaimed their turf, local and state agencies were not to devise 
artificial solutions to preserve the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 With an engineer's assurance that the construction work would last 30 to 50 
years, local officials began building. But the engineer was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've expended a lot of money and a lot of energy over the years, but the 
ocean keeps on winning," Treanor said. "Just from our track record, we're not 
doing too good." 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor, somewhat to his dismay, knows quite a bit about the asphalt path. As 
local director of the state park service, he is also the reluctant custodian of 
the bike trail. The fairgrounds owns the land on either side of the path, but 
the state parks retain an easement on the trail itself. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean, however, that Treanor can manage the path as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Management of the fairgrounds, which is north of the bike path, takes a keen 
interest in all the activities on its property. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents constantly prod Ventura to take a stand on the bike path's future, 
and even though the city has no jurisdiction in the area, it has become a major 
player in the trail's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Coastal Commission, which oversees the state's entire shoreline, holds 
its own, firm opinions on how to manage the land between the mouth of the 
Ventura River and the beach promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 The various interests clashed for the first time in the early 1990s, when 
patches of the path near the river mouth were washed away by pounding waves. 
The Coastal Commission ruled that the permit did not allow local officials to 
make any repairs, and state parks supervisors agreed. But under pressure from 
residents, the city and the fairgrounds spent $30,000 to stack rocks up against 
the side of the shore to stall future erosion in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission challenged the action, but the Army Corps of Engineers 
and the State Lands Commission both decided in favor of the city and the 
fairgrounds. The rocks remain today. 
</P>
<P>
 The revetment slowed erosion considerably at the stretch near the delta, but 
now two other sections farther down the shore are quickly deteriorating. 
Treanor estimates the erosion at a rate of three to four inches per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he plans no repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's foolish for us to go in there when nature and the permitting authority 
say you can't put it in there," he said. "It's the ultimate dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
 Treanor said that if it were left up to his agency, he would let the path and 
parking lots slowly deteriorate and wash away with the ocean waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public does not badger Treanor. Instead, Chase said, irritated 
residents phone City Hall when they want to know the future of their bike path. 
That is why Ventura got involved nearly three years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said, 'You've got to be kidding. This is all bureaucratic 
gobbledygook. You've got to do something, City Council,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, council members are leading the fray to rescue the 
deteriorating path, even though legally it is none of their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should save it," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "Whatever it takes. We 
should do something and do it quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle and Councilman Steve Bennett, both members of the council's 
environmental committee, say they plan to discuss the path's future at a 
meeting scheduled next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Chase and the fairgrounds' general manager, Michael Paluszak, have 
hatched their own long-term plan for the area, which the Coastal Commission 
will consider when it meets in San Diego on Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said they would like three years to study the matter. During that time, 
city and fairgrounds officials would conduct an environmental review of the 
area, soliciting scientific opinions on the best way to save the bike path 
without damaging the coastline. They would investigate the wisdom of relocating 
the bike path farther from the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, they would try to get the public involved in the process and 
find out what residents think should be done about the troubled ocean-side 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has won support from unlikely sources, including members of the 
Surfrider Foundation, an environmentally conscious surfer's group that opposed 
Ventura's intervention in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's great that the city's willing to study the problem," said 
Larry Manson, a Surfrider member and history teacher at Ventura College. 
"Everybody loves the bike path."

STREET SMART: NEW SIGN ALREADY ORDERED FOR BUSY OXNARD INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Statham Boulevard near Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard has two glaring problems. 
</P>
<P>
 First, traffic turning left from westbound Statham onto Oxnard Boulevard has 
the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 This is contrary to most traffic laws that I am aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the only way the opposing traffic knows of this aberration is if they 
happen to spot a small, hard-to-see sign that says turning traffic doesn't 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The city should either eliminate this left-turn priority or make the sign a 
lot bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is a yield sign where traffic turns right from southbound 
Pacific Avenue onto Statham. 
</P>
<P>
 This sign is useless and confusing. Nobody pays attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
 A stop sign would be much more effective. Any chance of these problems being 
corrected? 
</P>
<P>
 Karen M. Murphy, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem stems from a simple case of a missing sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese checked the intersection of Statham and 
Oxnard and discovered that the sign warning motorists that "oncoming traffic 
does not stop" had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese has ordered a new sign, which will be installed as soon as it 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding your second question, Genovese says replacing the yield sign at 
Pacific and Statham with a stop sign would not work because it would interfere 
with the flow of traffic on neighboring streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The main purpose of the yield sign, Genovese says, is not to control traffic 
but to remind turning vehicles to watch out for pedestrians. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There's a visibility problem at a Ventura Freeway off-ramp in Ventura that I 
think could be hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem exists at the Victoria Avenue exit from the eastbound Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists turning right on red onto Victoria at the bottom of the off-ramp 
can't see traffic coming down Victoria because a guardrail between the street 
and sidewalk blocks the view. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen cars turn and then almost get hit by traffic that they couldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
 The city should either remove the guardrail or make this a no-turn-on-red 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Johnson, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the solutions you suggest would create an even greater safety hazard 
than now exists, says Nazir Lalani, Ventura traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with removing the safety rail is that pedestrians and bicyclists 
often use this narrow sidewalk. Eliminating the rail would make it much more 
dangerous for them, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibiting right turns on red would also be a problem because of the high 
volume of traffic at this intersection, Lalani says. If cars were forced to 
wait for a green signal to turn right, traffic would be backed up all the way 
to the freeway, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The real solution, he says, is to overhaul the entire freeway interchange, a 
$7-million project that the city and Caltrans are hoping to find funding for 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about Caltrans' lack of attention to a very dangerous problem on 
the transition road between the eastbound Ventura Freeway and the northbound 
Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans recently eliminated one of two lanes linking the eastbound Ventura 
Freeway to the Moorpark Freeway. You published a letter from a reader 
complaining that the change is causing traffic to back up at a blind curve on 
the transition road. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans replied that it merely shifted a lane from the eastbound side to the 
westbound side to accommodate the heavier traffic flow coming from the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the change, traffic does seem to move more quickly most of the time. But 
a problem arises when traffic backs up during evening rush hour each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars come dashing around the blind curve at high rates of speed, then have to 
slam on the brakes because traffic is stopped dead at the other end of the 
curve. I have had three close calls since the change. 
</P>
<P>
 I would implore Caltrans to install some kind of warning sign, flashing light 
or reduced speed requirement to caution drivers who are not aware of this daily 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If something is not done, there is eventually going to be a bloody, horrible 
pileup of rear-ended vehicles on the transition road. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert P. Phipps, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 In response to your letter, the state Department of Transportation took 
another look at that stretch of road and decided that there is, indeed, a 
safety problem during evening rush hour, Caltrans engineer Luu Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 A blind curve hides stalled traffic from approaching cars, which must then 
stop quickly, a fact illustrated by eyewitness accounts and an alarming number 
of skid marks on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is now studying ways to address the problem, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Flashing lights or some other sort of posted warning should be installed 
within the next few months.

CITY MAY STEP UP PUSH TO BUY RECYCLED GOODS; THOUSAND OAKS: IT NOW REQUIRES 
CONTRACTORS TO PURCHASE ITEMS MADE FROM REUSED MATERIALS. A PROPOSAL BEFORE THE 
COUNCIL WOULD HOLD THE GOVERNMENT TO THE SAME STANDARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Every time he tried to buy a cup made from recycled plastic, caterer Manuel 
Urrego felt like he was killing romance. 
</P>
<P>
 He just couldn't picture filling the flimsy, chintzy-looking cups with 
champagne. He envisioned one cracking, spilling red wine on a white evening 
gown. And yet, as maitre d' for Thousand Oaks' new Civic Arts Plaza, he had 
agreed to use recycled plastic cups. 
</P>
<P>
 After working the phones for nearly 40 hours, Urrego found an acceptable cup: 
a bit more upscale, a lot more solid and indisputably made from recycled 
plastic. Now, grudgingly, Urrego concedes that the city's unwavering stance 
paid off. He even wishes that other cities would impose similar requirements on 
their concessionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand for these products isn't great and, because of that, the cost is 
high and, because the cost is high, the demand isn't great," he said. "It's 
like a Catch-22, and it will be until someone starts passing rules and 
regulations" mandating the use of recycled products. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members will consider such action Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They will vote on proposed new guidelines that emphasize the need for the city 
to buy goods made out of recycled products. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members are already enforcing recycling requirements in some 
contracts, including the concessionaire's contract for the Civic Arts Plaza. 
The proposed procurement guidelines would reinforce that policy and hold the 
city to the same standards as its contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government is asking residents and businesses to do something, we 
should be able to do it better," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowksi said. "This will 
really get the ball rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing the need to build a market for recycled products, the city's 
environmental programs analyst, Grahame Watts, added: "If we don't buy recycled 
products, we're not really recycling." 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines urge city department heads to order office supplies made mainly 
from recycled goods -- everything from index cards to toilet paper, trash-can 
liners to scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, about 60% of the city's office supplies contain some recycled 
material. To raise that figure, a dozen staffers now meet monthly to identify 
products that could be bought in recycled form. 
</P>
<P>
 They've studied carpets made from recycled plastic milk jugs, insulation 
stuffed with recycled paper and pencils carved from scraps of recycled wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The best products land on a list distributed to every city employee in charge 
of purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are flexible: City staffers can order non-recycled supplies if 
they're much cheaper, much more effective or would arrive much more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Watts said, "no other city has taken as aggressive a step" 
to boost the market for recycled goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard staffers hope to develop their own procurement guidelines early next 
year, and the Ventura council has passed a resolution urging the use of 
recycled products wherever possible. But Thousand Oaks' proposed policy is 
stronger still. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching beyond the confines of City Hall, the guidelines urge contractors and 
consultants to use recycled paper for all documents sent to Thousand Oaks. And 
they encourage vendors bidding on municipal contracts to outline their plans 
for using recycled products on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As the project manager for the Civic Arts Plaza, Ed Johnduff can understand 
the need to recycle paper -- he has collected enough documents to cram 30 file 
cabinets. But he has reservations about the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to have it come down to rejecting a low bid because they haven't 
used recycled paper," said Johnduff, the city's administrative services 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines "might encourage some more use of recycled paper," he said. 
"But when it comes to a big company doing a big bid, they're probably not going 
to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Watts said he figures that it's worth a try. "We don't want to 
require anything unnecessarily overburdensome," he said. "We just want them to 
know that we're looking, encouraging, hoping, saying, 'Please, please, please 
use recycled paper.' "

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CHAPEL BACK IN SERVICE AFTER RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Services were held Sunday for the first time in three months inside the 
65-year-old chapel at Community Presbyterian Church in Ventura, where work 
crews spent the summer renovating the historic structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration included hand-cleaning hundreds of ceiling tiles, restoring 
the aging stained-glass windows along the south side of the church, installing 
a new electrical system and refinishing dozens of beams stretching above the 
pews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finished five minutes before the wedding (Saturday), so if that isn't a 
miracle, I don't know what is," said Ted Temple, a Ventura home remodeler who 
supervised the $500,000 restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 200 people -- many of them volunteers from the parish -- worked all 
summer, cleaning and polishing 60-year-old tiles that decorate the ceiling of 
the Poli Street chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painstaking and delicate task that required a variety of materials 
and techniques because each tile had aged differently over the years.

 "It's kind of trial-and-error work," said Temple, who was married inside the 
church 26 years ago. "We used soft bristle brushes with 20 people at a time 
working 12 hours a day for six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Worshipers spent the last dozen Sundays inside the Fellowship Hall, a smaller 
building near the main chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a thrill to be back in the chapel," said Pastor Kirt Anderson, who 
ministered Sunday in front of a fully restored mural behind the altar. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done is take this sanctuary back to the original architectural 
intent," Anderson said. "We're trying to recapture the vision this church had 
when it was built in 1929." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the church spent a sizable portion of its savings on the newly 
completed renovations, officials plan a series of other improvements for the 
chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 A north entryway with a garden and reception area has already been designed, 
but Anderson said it would be next year before the church can afford further 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Beckman and his family have been attending Sunday services at Community 
Presbyterian Church for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to be in there," he said of the refurbished chapel. "It kind of 
revitalizes it by brightening it up." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; COUNTY EXPECTED TO ACT ON ROAD CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors Tuesday are expected to declare a state of 
emergency on South Mountain Road near Santa Paula, allowing the county to apply 
for federal funds to remove debris from a recent landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by the Board of Supervisors comes three weeks after tons of earth 
and rock tumbled across South Mountain Road east of Santa Paula, closing down 
part of the road.The Sept. 8 landslide was caused by a 3.1 magnitude earthquake 
centered 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reopening the road, the county's Transportation Department must remove 
the debris at an estimated cost of $200,000 to $300,000, said W. Butch Britt, 
the department's deputy director of public works, in a letter to the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is of the essence in removal of the slide. We are close to the time when 
heavy rainfall is often experienced," the letter said. "If work on the slide 
cannot be substantially completed prior to the onset of heavy rainfall, work 
would have to be suspended or delayed until the slope could dry and stabilize."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SAN MIGUEL ISLAND; MAN, 47, DIES AFTER DIVING 
ACCIDENT

<P>
 A 47-year-old Glendale man died Sunday morning following a scuba diving 
accident off San Miguel Island, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young was declared dead about 10 a.m. at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center in Thousand Oaks two hours after the accident, county Deputy Coroner 
Mitch Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young died of internal injuries caused by surfacing too quickly from 70 to 80 
feet, Breese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was taken by helicopter from the Ventura Harbor-based boat Spectre about 
9 a.m. to the hospital's emergency room, according to U. S. Coast Guard Petty 
Officer James Bride. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arrived, people on the vessel were performing CPR on him," Bride 
said. "He was showing no vital (signs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Young was diving off the northern tip of the island and had 
plenty of air left in his tanks when he surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ted Cumming, captain of the Spectre, Young surfaced about 20 
minutes into the day's first dive and was swimming toward the dive boat when he 
began to complain about shortness of breath. He collapsed shortly thereafter.

 Promoters of a commercial aquarium in Ventura County will ask the county's 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to chip in $6,000 to finance a $16,000 study on 
the aquarium's possible exhibits and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the board, Supervisor John K. Flynn urged his colleagues to 
help finance the study, which would also look into the design and operation of 
an aquarium in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for construction of the facility on county-owned land. 
Promoters say they expect the aquarium to become the largest tourist attraction 
in Ventura County and to be named Channel Islands Harbor Aquarium. CHRISTINA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD, CAMARILLO; SUPERVISORS TO SEEK AIRPORT 
REPAIR FUNDS 
</P>

<P>
 With portions of the Oxnard and Camarillo airports in disrepair, the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors will be asked to request more than $2.1 million in 
federal grants this week to pay for renovations at the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 County Airports Administrator Rodney L. Murphy said in a report to the 
supervisors that the Federal Aviation Administration can issue the grant, 
provided the county agrees to pay an estimated additional $243,000 for the 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Murphy said both facilities require repairs to ramps and 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Geer, a longtime member of the county's Aviation Advisory Commission, 
praised the move to get the federal dollars. "It's generally not a good idea to 
run an aircraft over a pothole; it can do some serious damage," Geer said. "The 
ramp areas at both facilities are in pretty bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will also go toward the purchase and installation of security 
lighting and a federally required storm drain study at Oxnard Airport. A 
smaller portion of the funds will go toward updating the master planning guide 
for Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will consider the staff request at their meeting Tuesday at 
the County Government Center in Ventura. J. E. MITCHELL

EAST ENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; PROGRAM OFFERS FREE SAFETY SEATS FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They've used graphic films, stern lectures and friendly persuasion to get 
Spanish-speaking immigrants to use car seats for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Adelante, a program run by the Moorpark division of the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department, will try giving the seats away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department bought 20 child safety seats at a discount from K 
mart; the seats will be given to needy Latino families with children at a 
meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of social and cultural differences, a higher percentage of Latino 
families do not use child safety seats, said Senior Deputy Jerry Hernandez, one 
of two officers with Moorpark's Adelante program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies by the (California Highway Patrol) have shown that in areas where 
programs like this are started, those percentages drop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelante, nearly a year old, uses bilingual officers to address law 
enforcement concerns of the Spanish-speaking community in Moorpark. Often, 
Hernandez said, new immigrants have a distrust of law enforcement officers, 
based on uneasy or contentious relations with authorities in their native 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural differences and language barriers also account for the lack of 
understanding about some of the laws in California, said Hernandez's partner, 
Deputy Albert Miramontes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these migrants are recently from Mexico and they're unaware of the 
law," he said. "They're working Monday through Monday just to get by, and 
getting a child seat isn't the top priority they have for using their money." 
</P>
<P>
 California law requires that children age 4 and under, or children who weigh 
less than 40 pounds, must ride in a child safety seat, Miramontes said. Car 
seat prices range from about $50 to $80. Fines for violating the law go up to 
nearly $300, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's money that they can't typically spare," Miramontes said. "We're hoping 
to help some of the families out by giving the seats away and make the other 
families aware that they need to make this a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 According to CHP statistics, 60 children died in accidents on the state's 
highways in 1992, about half of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelante will give out the car seats at a 7 p.m. meeting at Holy Cross Chapel 
at Everett and Magnolia streets in Moorpark. For information about Adelante, 
call Miramontes at 494-8258. SCOTT HADLY

EAST ENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CEMETERY PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to build 700 dwellings, a cemetery and a public park on the Douglas 
Ranch in Simi Valley is set for debate before the City Council this evening, 
but most council members said they already support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Mt.Sinai Memorial Park would fill one of the last two vacancies 
reserved for cemeteries in Simi Valley. The cemetery would cover 162 acres of 
the 381-acre site north of the Simi Valley Freeway between Yosemite Avenue and 
Kuehner Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas of the parcel would be divided between park and open space areas, 
houses and moderate- to high-density apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said they would like to tinker with the number of 
units being proposed near Kuehner, but said they would otherwise support the 
project. Councilwoman Sandi Webb said she would like to see a cluster of 
apartments there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think by clustering buildings in that area, we would save more space for 
oak trees in other areas," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that needs to be discussed is whether the city has set aside 
enough cemetery space for the future, Councilwoman Barbara Williamson said. A 
parcel of land near Madera Road is the only other undeveloped area in the city 
set aside for a cemetery, city officials said. MATTHEW MOSK

ROLE OF JURY CONSULTANTS CONTROVERSIAL AND EXTENSIVE; COURTS: THEIR ABILITY TO 
MOLD A PANEL IS LIMITED. THEY TEND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ADVISING ON SEATED 
JURORS.

<P>
 Are women good or bad for O.J. Simpson's defense? Would victims of domestic 
violence be more likely to convict him? Would it help or hurt to have jurors 
knowledgeable about science? 
</P>
<P>
 Jury consultants say that those are among the critical questions facing 
Simpson's defense team as members today begin screening hundreds of prospective 
jurors for the most infamous murder trial in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 Each armed with consultants, both prosecution and defense will spend much of 
the next several weeks trying to pick jurors who will be most sympathetic to 
their side. Many lawyers swear by the insights the jury gurus bring to the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But so-called scientific jury selection is not all it is hyped up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Who sits on the jury can make a small difference because each member may bring 
his or her own perceptions to the evidence, or rely on instinct when faced with 
ambiguity. Careful screening is no guarantee of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their reputations, jury consultants are not clairvoyants; they can't 
be certain that any one juror will react as predicted. Once 12 strangers are 
thrown together in deliberations, their interactions and personalities can 
combine to upset the efforts to create the optimal mix. Consultants' best 
hunches also may be for naught because the opposing side can remove their 
favorite picks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who accuse us of stacking the deck give us too much credit," admitted 
San Francisco jury consultant Ronald Beaton, director of jury consultation for 
Forensic Technologies Inc. "You can't stack a jury. You can only unstack one." 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts are controversial. During jury selection, lawyers and 
consultants may attempt to exclude smart people, particularly those with 
leadership ability or special knowledge that might help them understand the 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see a lawyer trying to pick a smart jury," defense attorney F. Lee 
Bailey once said, "you know he's got a strong case. (Defense attorney) Percy 
Foreman and I once had an argument as to which of us had picked the most stupid 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to pick a favorable panel may also threaten juror privacy. 
Prosecutors have been known to check tax records of potential jurors, and 
defense consultants sometimes comb through voter registration and property 
rolls searching for clues. Some even drive by potential jurors' homes to look 
for lawn signs or bumper stickers, or interview friends and neighbors of the 
jury prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the ability to mold a jury is limited, consultants tend to be most 
effective in advising lawyers how to influence jurors after they have been 
seated. Researchers have found that evidence and opening and closing statements 
usually are more important than jury composition, and consultants advise 
lawyers how to make the most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained in psychology or sociology, these courtroom versions of market 
researchers test various arguments and evidence before mock juries or focus 
groups. They then help lawyers package a case, telling them what evidence to 
stress, how to make a point most effectively, even how big an award to ask for 
in a civil case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them worry about the little things jurors might notice, including the 
kind of car the defendant drives to court. After much deliberation the defense 
team for John DeLorean decided he should drive a Mercedes station wagon to the 
trial, said jury researcher Elizabeth Loftus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed a little touch of elegance," said the University of Washington 
psychology professor, "but it was also solid," not the kind of car a cocaine 
dealer would drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Their advice and trial rehearsals don't come cheaply: Consultants charge about 
$1,000 to $4,000 a day, or $10,000 to $50,000 for a three-month trial. Even if 
the difference they make in jury selection is small, the side that can afford 
the research to shape strategy has an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does raise questions about whether or not it has become necessary to do it 
(hire a consultant) to win an important case," said Saul Kassin, a 
Massachusetts jury researcher and occasional trial consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Many trace the use of consultants to the 1972 conspiracy trial of the Berrigan 
brothers and five others in Pennsylvania for anti-war activities. Social 
scientists sympathetic to the defendants volunteered to do surveys and 
interviews to help the lawyers pick the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal juror, the surveys and interviews determined, would be a female 
Democrat with no religious preference and a white-collar or skilled blue-collar 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 days of deliberations, the first jury picked by scientific selection 
found two of the defendants guilty of smuggling letters but deadlocked 10 to 2 
for acquittal on the key conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case was considered a victory for scientific jury selection, the 
process had been imperfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the jurors the social scientists had predicted would favor the defense 
hung the jury by voting for conviction. One of those jurors was the mother of 
four conscientious-objector sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting how any one juror will vote is risky. If a consultant's poll found 
that 70% of women tended to view a case from a defense perspective, the 
consultant could still err by picking a female juror who was among the 30% who 
favored the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the prospective jurors' views would be more helpful, but some may lie 
about them or may not even be aware of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection can take anywhere from a few hours to a month or more. Men and 
women summoned for duty are sent in groups to be queried by a judge or the 
lawyers about whether they can serve for the duration of the trial or if they 
have any conflicts that could preclude them from being fair. They might be 
asked to fill out a questionnaire designed to expose their attitudes about 
issues that will arise at trial. Both sides can remove a certain number of 
jurors they deem unfit. 
</P>
<P>
 This adversarial process usually limits the power of either side to stack a 
jury. Those limitations were evident in a child molestation case that Beaton 
worked on. 
</P>
<P>
 A boy had accused a middle-aged teacher of molesting him. But there was no 
physical evidence to implicate the defendant, and a forensic test had failed to 
detect incriminating fibers on the teacher's clothing even though the alleged 
molestation had occurred on a rug likely to have shed fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaton, hired by the defense, wanted jurors who believed in science but had no 
scientific training or knowledge. These sorts of jurors, he concluded after 
doing a public opinion survey, would be more inclined to accept the test's 
failure to find any fibers. A more sophisticated jury, Beaton feared, would 
"know the limits of science" and realize the test was fallible. 
</P>
<P>
 He identified three or four prospects who would be good for the defense, but 
the prosecution struck all but one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 After "fast and furious" strikes, "the jury was made up mostly of people who 
were in the grand middle ground," Beaton said. "We got one person we were happy 
with, and an engineer we did not want. I have done close to 200 jury picks and 
seldom, if ever, do I come out happy. Most of your good people get struck." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury hung 11 to 1 for acquittal. But even Beaton admitted that the 
evidence and arguments -- shaped in part during a dry run before a mock jury -- 
had been more important than who was on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the same set of facts," he said, "seven out of 10 juries would have 
been hung. It's an edge, but it is not a sure thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury researcher Saul Kassin became interested in juries because of his 
curiosity about the effects of attitude and personality differences. But he 
discovered in experiments with simulated juries that the differences only 
mattered when neither side had stronger evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get the evidence so evenly matched for those individual differences 
to matter, that in most cases I couldn't do it," said Kassin, a psychology 
professor at Williams College in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassin consulted in a product liability case a few years ago. The defendant, a 
corporation, had hired a jury consultant to help with selection, and the 
plaintiff's lawyer, afraid of being outmatched, hired Kassin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kassin concentrated on testing the evidence rather than the makeup of the 
jury. He tried various arguments and kinds of evidence on 20 simulated juries, 
giving each different information and weighing their responses. 
</P>
<P>
 When the suing party asked for a huge amount of money, Kassin discovered, the 
mock jurors tended to be suspicious and doubt the whole case against the 
corporation. So he recommended a ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle of dueling consultants, Kassin's side won. 
</P>
<P>
 "When clients retain us," said Philip K. Anthony, chief executive officer of 
DecisionQuest Inc., a Torrance trial consulting firm hired by the prosecution 
in the Simpson case, "we tell them that jury selection is 5% of the balance we 
bring to the equation." 
</P>
<P>
 When a group of residents in a southeastern state sued a factory in their 
neighborhood for allegedly polluting ground water, the company came to Anthony 
for help. The residents blamed the contamination for a variety of ailments in 
their families, but the epidemiological evidence was murky and the company 
denied any responsibility for the plaintiffs' health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony found in trial rehearsals that mock jurors were confused by the 
evidence. They were not convinced the company was at fault, but to be on the 
safe side, awarded the plaintiffs a small amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 After more research, the consultant discovered one key piece of evidence that 
could sway them: The fact that the residents had not abandoned their homes or 
taken extra precautions after discovering the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the trial strategy was to emphasize this through the evidence," Anthony 
said. The real jury decided for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Manipulating witnesses' testimony also could be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant might advise a prosecutor, for instance, to draw out "in slow 
motion" a witness' description of a killing "because you don't want that moment 
to pass by the jury too quickly," said Michael Saks, professor of law and 
psychology at the University of Iowa College of Law. "You want it to sink in, 
to have more dramatic impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are especially influenced by the lawyer's ability to create and tell a 
compelling story. If a lawyer can present a good narrative, Beaton said, jurors 
will ignore or give less weight to inconsistent facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although evidence and arguments usually play a larger role, the lawyers in the 
Simpson murder case are not leaving jury makeup to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some experts who are skeptical of polls used in scientific jury selection 
agree that the Simpson trial could prove them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the typical case these surveys are a waste of time and money," said 
Richard Lempert, a University of Michigan professor of law and sociology. "The 
exception is a case that is so well-known that you can ask people, 'Do you 
believe O.J. is guilty?' . . . If I were O.J., I would do it, but in the 
typical case I would not." 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts believe women will be more pro-prosecution because the history of 
violence in Simpson's marriage has been so widely publicized. "The 911 tapes 
sink him with women," said one jury consultant, referring to Nicole Brown 
Simpson's taped calls to police reporting an apparent altercation with her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Women may be "a little bit more inclined" to convict in violent crimes because 
they "are less prepared to accept or romanticize violence," said Gary Moran, a 
professor of psychology at Florida International University. He believes 
feminists would be particularly bad for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe that (Robert) Shapiro is going to let any feminist sit on 
this jury of Simpson's," Moran said. From a defense perspective, "The one good 
thing about feminists is they are dying to tell you their point of view" and 
thus are easily identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Female jurors, a Canadian jury researcher also has found, are more likely than 
males to understand and sympathize with victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though consultants outside the case think gender and experience with 
domestic violence could make a difference on the Simpson jury, today's Times 
Poll found no strong correlations between those variables and belief of his 
guilt or innocence. Women, in fact, were more sympathetic to the former 
football great. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, the trial consultant for Simpson, suggested that women may 
be more empathetic because of tabloid reports critical of Nicole Simpson's 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Times poll did find a relationship between confidence in DNA testing 
and belief in Simpson's guilt or innocence -- an issue that consultants believe 
could be important in jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents who had faith in such tests were more likely to believe Simpson 
was guilty and were less sympathetic than those who discounted their value. 
African Americans were more suspicious of the genetic tests than other racial 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If the DNA evidence is strongly incriminating and the laboratories withstand 
defense scrutiny, Simpson's lawyers probably will want people "who were 
terrified or traumatized by high school algebra" and will ignore scientific 
evidence they do not understand, Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the evidence is questionable, "then the defense wants people who are 
sophisticated and critical in their thinking about science," said William C. 
Thompson, a DNA expert hired by Simpson who teaches criminology, law and 
society at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys show that African Americans are more likely than whites to believe 
Simpson is innocent. Both jury experts and the Times Poll linked the difference 
to a greater distrust by blacks of the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of their race or attitudes, the jurors may ultimately be most 
swayed by the force of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say that the evidence at trial starts to point to guilt," Saks said. 
"Black jurors would start to shift their views and wind up saying, 'I think he 
did it.' If the evidence turned out to be quite dubious . . . then the white 
folks would shift over." 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes also might change because of the dynamics of deliberating, the 
back-and-forth among jurors as they examine the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think jurors in general will feel the burden of holding the prosecution to 
its proof," said Lois Heaney, a trial consultant for the National Jury 
Project/West in Oakland. "If during deliberations someone says, 'I think he did 
it,' someone else will push them to say, 'Are you sure?' and they will be 
mindful that this is a person who has had a stellar reputation and who is a 
father of young children."

reforms. A Brief History 
</P>
<P>
 Some key dates in the history of jury trials in this country: 
</P>
<P>
 1606: The right to a jury trial is given to American colonists in Virginia by 
King James I of England. 
</P>
<P>
 1776: The Constitution establishes the right to "speedy and public" trial by a 
jury in criminal prosecutions and civil cases. Framers of the Constitution make 
it clear that the jury can decide law as well as fact. The framers also support 
the right of defendants to challenge jurors during jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 1850-60: Restrictions are placed on some jury powers. The Massachusetts 
Supreme Court in 1860 establishes the directed verdict, whereby a judge can 
tell a jury to reach a not guilty verdict if he determines there is 
insufficient evidence. Many states adopt the special verdict, which allows a 
judge to order a new trial if he believes the jury's verdict was inconsistent 
with the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 1870: The territory of Wyoming gives women the right to sit on juries, but 
revokes the right a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 1879: The U.S. Supreme Court holds that a state can constitutionally bar women 
from juries. 
</P>
<P>
 1880: The Supreme Court rules that states can no longer bar blacks from juries 
because the 14th Amendment guarantees "equal protection of the laws" to all 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 1895: The Supreme Court holds that jurors in federal court do not have the 
right to decide questions of law and must follow instructions from the judge 
instead. Most states eventually follow the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 1896: Utah becomes the first state to allow women to sit on juries. 
</P>
<P>
 1920: Federal courts begin to limit the rights of defendants to question 
prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 1928: A federal rule is adopted requiring the presiding judge to conduct voir 
dire, the questioning of prospective jurors during jury selection. This 
prevents the defense from directly questioning and influencing potential 
jurors, leaving the screening to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 1967: Alabama becomes the last state in the nation to allow women on juries. 
</P>
<P>
 1970: The Supreme Court rules that juries need not be made up of 12 members, 
the traditional number since the early English legal system, and upholds the 
use of six-person juries in non-capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 1972: The Supreme Court holds that a jury of 12 does not have to be unanimous 
in reaching a verdict. Oregon later allows 10-2 verdicts in all criminal trials 
except capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 1975: The Supreme Court rules that it is unconstitutional to deny women the 
right to be put on lists for jury service. 
</P>
<P>
 1994: The Supreme Court rules that attorneys cannot remove prospective jurors 
from a case simply because of their sex.

HAITIANS STORM POLICE POSTS, GIVE SEIZED ARMS TO AMERICANS; CARIBBEAN: CEDRAS 
ACCUSES U.S. OF ATROCITIES IN ALTERCATION THAT KILLED 10 OFFICERS. CAP HAITIEN 
SECURITY FORCE GOES INTO HIDING, AND SOME CITIZENS SLIP AWAY WITH GUNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of screaming Haitians, encouraged by a U.S. Marine gun battle that 
killed 10 policemen, stormed the three main police facilities here Sunday, 
looted the buildings and turned armfuls of weapons over to the American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic turn of events in Haiti's second-largest city, coming after 
almost a week of relative calm in this Caribbean nation, marked the first time 
in the U.S. intervention that American troops sent to keep the peace have used 
their guns to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
 It sent the rest of the Cap Haitien police force and its leaders into hiding, 
broke civilian police control in the city and signaled to Haitian officials in 
the capital, Port-au-Prince, that U.S. troops will not tolerate armed 
provocations by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Tom Jones, head of the Marine force in northern Haiti, praised the 
lieutenant of a 30-man platoon who gave the order to fire at the police 
headquarters when he saw a policeman waving an Uzi submachine gun at a large 
crowd Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "My lieutenant fired first," Jones said, "and I know what he did was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also described a searing meeting Sunday morning with Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, the Haitian military leader who flew here from Port-au-Prince to 
discuss the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedras accused us of atrocities and then personally asked for my removal and 
court-martial," Jones said. "I'm happy to report that he didn't get either." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Jones spoke, unusually large crowds were continuing to march and sing 
in the streets of Cap Haitien. They thanked American troops and vowed to see 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide restored as president. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said the outbreak of shooting 
and civil disorder were the kind of trouble they had anticipated, and urged 
that more time be allowed for U.S. forces to establish order. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said a resolution will be introduced in the Senate 
this week to set a date, probably several months from now, for an end to the 
current, unilateral U.S. phase of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 And Aristide, in exile in Washington, called a special session of Haiti's 
Parliament for Wednesday to study a draft law to grant amnesty to military 
leaders who ousted him three years ago. Last weekend's Haiti agreement, which 
allowed a peaceful entry by U.S. troops, provided for the junta leaders to give 
up power by Oct. 15 or when an amnesty is adopted, whichever comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 To many watching the events unfold, the daylong public demonstrations were 
less in support of Aristide than they were a rebuke of the three-year reign of 
Cedras and the feared Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 With the blood of the 10 slain Haitians -- all identified by the Marines as 
policemen -- still running down 20th Street in front of the yellow-and-white 
police headquarters, the jubilant crowds carried aloft the police firearms and 
proclaimed that police violence and torture of citizens was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "That blood on the ground is nothing to what the people have already spilled," 
one man yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, carrying a pistol out of the police headquarters, shouted: "This 
is what the (police) had inside to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 And Harold Jean, a young man helping to stack a pile of police rifles, 
shotguns, handguns, ammunition, cartridge belts and uniforms in the middle of 
the street, screamed: "These are for the Marines to take! We don't want them!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines earlier Sunday removed a five-ton truck loaded with automatic 
weapons from the police building, and, despite the good intentions of most 
people in Cap Haitien to give the guns to the Marines, some citizens were seen 
running down side streets with guns and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that kind of situation, where citizens are beginning to take up arms, 
that worried many people here Sunday. Some, particularly upper-class Haitians 
who have opposed the Marine intervention, believe more bloodshed will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Ernest, a U.S.-educated economist who works in the export-import business, 
spent most of the day with his colleagues in the hills above the city, fearful 
of coming down lest they become the target of the angry protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest said that while he once donated money to Aristide's presidential 
campaign, he now believes the priest does not deserve to return to power 
because he allowed the U.S. military to intervene in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning," he said of the violence in the city below. "I 
think it's going to become more difficult to live here now that more of the 
people are armed. I foresee the people eventually turning against the Marines 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember," he added, "this is Haiti, and most everyone is against another 
long U.S. occupation." He was referring to the U.S. occupation of Haiti from 
1915 to 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Jones, in a briefing Sunday afternoon, described in detail the 
five-minute gunfight between 30 Marines and a dozen members of the Haitian 
security forces at the police headquarters in the center of the city. But his 
version differed from the accounts given by several witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the trouble began when a Haitian-born American, identified as 
Michel Perat, shot a young boy when a crowd of people converged on his store 
Saturday afternoon. Perat, who has been outspoken in his opposition to 
Aristide, was quickly arrested by the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble escalated about 7 p.m. when a crowd estimated at 1,000 people 
formed in front of the police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the officers were inside playing cards and dominoes, an attache 
, or police auxiliary, out front began to feel threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jones, the attache pulled out an Uzi and began to point it at the 
people. The Marine lieutenant, Virgil Palumbo, 24, of Windber, Pa., opened fire 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lieutenant saw that gesture with the Uzi," Jones said. "He took that 
individual out, and then the firefight broke out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine platoon, on a routine street patrol next to the headquarters, began 
firing their M-16 rifles and 9-millimeter automatic weapons, and the police 
returned fire. Jones said that some in the crowd were also firing at the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting stopped, the bodies of 10 policemen were lying on the street 
in front of the headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11th police officer was found upstairs, badly wounded, Jones said. 
Suffering three gunshot wounds and numerous broken bones, he was taken to the 
helicopter assault ship Wasp anchored offshore, where he underwent eight hours 
of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12th policeman, who was not injured, was taken into custody but later 
released, Jones said, so that "he could go tell the police leadership what had 
happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a U.S. Navy interpreter was treated for a bullet wound to his 
leg. None of the Marines was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, what happened was absolutely required," Jones said in defending 
his Marines. "I back them all the way. The lieutenant did what was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that 10 people are dead. But the lieutenant acted prudently, 
rapidly and deliberately." 
</P>
<P>
 Some citizens told different stories. Some said the Marines lined up in front 
of the police headquarters earlier in the afternoon, almost in expectation of 
the violence to come. Others said the police attache actually fired first. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started to shoot a couple of times up in the air," said David St. Hilaire, 
an unemployed tourist guide. "He was trying to make the people calm down. But 
the Haitians didn't care. They were ready to start a war." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonie Mathieu, a notary public who lives across from the police building, said 
that as soon as the battle was over, the Marines evacuated the immediate area 
and ordered everyone to spend the night at a religious facility two blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she said, the Marines told anyone still alive inside the building 
to come out in groups of two. "Nobody came out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines shot orange flares into the sky to disperse the crowd after the 
gun battle. Around 1 a.m. Sunday, they entered the prison several blocks away 
and emptied that facility of weapons. Jones said about five prisoners were 
freed by the Marines and ran off in their yellow and green uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Karl Jacques, who lives nearby, "I saw more like a dozen prisoners 
coming out and I don't know where they went." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, as the crowds began to reappear on the streets, tensions again 
grew. First, the crowds surged into the police barracks, looted the grounds and 
marched out with the weapons that had been kept inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Next they went to the police headquarters. Slipping on the blood still out 
front, they swarmed into the building, overturned furniture, broke windows and 
tossed equipment and papers from a second-story balcony. Again, police weapons 
were piled up outside for the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds next moved on the prison. There, furniture was destroyed, and 
papers were strewn about. The people spoke angrily about the tortures and 
executions they said had occurred over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians pointed to small cinder-block cells used to confine up to 20 
prisoners. They pointed to a small cubbyhole where they said prisoners were 
forced to kneel and then were beaten on the buttocks with iron rods. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel LaGuerre, who said he was in prison three times, said the police often 
executed people inside the compound. "They would take them at night," he said. 
"They would tie their hands and put a black hood on them and after they shot 
them, they would take them out in a truck and throw them away." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Marine camp, Jones deplored the human rights abuses by the police. He 
estimated that 3,000 people had been killed by the Cap Haitien police and that 
"10 times that many were beaten and tortured." But some people said Jones' 
estimates were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police here are like a vacuum now," he said. "And they are obviously 
scared for a very good reason."

SPREADING LABOR SHORTAGES SEEN AS SIGNAL OF INFLATION; ECONOMY: BUSTLING 
INDIANA COUNTY IS TYPICAL OF MANY AREAS. FED MAY REACT AS MATERIAL COSTS, WAGES 
HEAD UPWARD.

<P>
 If you want to know why the nation's central bank is worried about inflation, 
just take a short jaunt around this bustling manufacturing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a peek in the unemployment office. The lobby, where jobless applicants 
come to collect unemployment checks, is quiet as a morgue. A bulletin board 
lists scores of job openings in local factories, shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop by Coachmen Industries and watch a steady stream of hulking recreational 
vehicles roll off the assembly line. The company is straining to fill RV and 
trailer orders from dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive further down Highway 13 past corn fields in the rolling Amish 
countryside, where scores of small manufacturing plants are adorned with "Help 
Wanted" or "Now Hiring" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Elkhart County, 20 miles east of South Bend and abutting the 
Michigan border, there is a severe labor shortage. The unemployment rate is 
3.6%, considered full employment by many economists. The nation's jobless rate 
is 6.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this area, anybody who wants to work is working," said Dennis Richey, 
general manager of Patriot Homes, a builder of mobile and modular homes. "We 
simply can't get enough good help." 
</P>
<P>
 Such labor shortages are beginning to appear throughout the Midwest and South. 
The Federal Reserve's latest regional report on the nation's economy found spot 
job shortages in the Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's moving beyond just spot shortages," said David Allardice, economist for 
the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. "It's pretty widespread." 
</P>
<P>
 What worries some economists is that labor shortages can be a precursor of 
inflation. With many factories running near capacity, pressures are building to 
increase wages even as productivity is dropping. Prices of key materials such 
as steel and rubber are up. This means higher production costs, which 
ultimately could push up prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what the Fed is worried about," said Diane Swonk, regional 
economist for First Chicago Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that the Fed might raise interest rates for the sixth time this year 
has spooked the stock and bond markets. Many traders expect the Fed to raise 
short-term interest rates again soon, perhaps as early as Tuesday when its 
policy-making board meets. 
</P>
<P>
 As Californians and others are painfully aware, labor shortages are hardly 
universal. The East and West coasts are still just recovering from the last 
recession. California continues to take severe blows from the shrinkage of 
defense and aerospace, and major layoffs continue nationwide as corporations 
downsize to become more efficient. Even the Midwest, which is abuzz with 
manufacturing activity, has urban centers with stubbornly high unemployment 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, much of the job demand is for low-wage, low-skilled workers, not for 
laid-off aerospace engineers. There is little incentive for unemployed people 
to move hundreds of miles for such jobs, which are likely to be wiped out in 
the next downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the labor shortage more critical than in Elkhart County, home to 
about 156,000 people and a center of the recreational vehicle, manufactured 
housing and van conversion industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's economy -- sensitive to swings in interest rates and consumer 
confidence -- is considered a bellwether of the national economy. And local 
economists say Elkhart's growth will continue into 1995, with a 3% increase in 
jobs expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But where those workers will come from is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of labor is so severe that last month, the Greater Elkhart Chamber of 
Commerce went looking for workers, placing help-wanted ads in newspapers in 12 
cities nationwide with double-digit unemployment. The ads invited those 
interested to call a toll-free telephone number for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our telephone lines lit up like a Christmas tree," chamber President David 
Germain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business group sent about 1,500 packets of information and said a handful 
of workers have already been hired. Germain said the goal is to place about 500 
workers in area companies this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coachmen's recreational vehicle division, located in the Amish village of 
Middlebury, could use another 100 employees to help turn out more motor homes, 
trailers and campers. That would increase its 1,300-member work force by 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people would give us the flexibility to work split shifts or add more 
shifts," said Michael Terlep, executive vice president. "We could expand 
production or add new facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with the company's plants operating at full capacity and employees 
putting in 10- to 12-hour days and working Saturdays, Coachmen officials fear 
that they will begin losing orders to its competitors, such as Fleetwood 
Enterprises in California or Winnebago Industries in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Elkhart firms have already lost business. Indiana Wood Products, which 
makes wooden pallets and boxes, recently had to return order deposits to 
several customers because the company lacked the labor to do the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in our history, we had to turn away business," General 
Manager Lamar Lantz said. "It cost us about $250,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses like Indiana Wood are particularly vulnerable because they use 
unskilled workers and pay them just above minimum wage. With labor in short 
supply, higher-paying manufacturing companies are luring away the best of these 
workers, hoping to train them for semi-skilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortage has prompted companies to be creative in their hiring. Some are 
offering signing bonuses; some pay finder's fees to employees who bring in 
recruits who are hired. A few companies have quietly dropped standards, such as 
requiring pre-employment drug screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others are reviewing their pay scales, increasing wages or providing 
incentive bonuses tied to productivity and quality. Some companies are 
providing transportation to workers without cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Middlebury Hardwood Products, which makes cabinets for RVs and mobile homes, 
is raising its starting wage and bought a bus to transport workers from nearby 
towns. It added a second shift and needs 20 more workers to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been panic time," said Lee Martin, the company's chief financial 
officer. "The customers are going nuts. If they have a unit done without doors, 
it's no good to them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just the manufacturing sector that is hurting. Hardee's, a fast-food 
restaurant, offers a $100 signing bonus for new employees who stay on the job 
for 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Das Dutchman Essenhaus, an Amish-style tourist stop near Middlebury, has sent 
9,000 circulars through a six-county area seeking workers. It has developed an 
incentive bonus plan for longtime workers and signing bonuses for short-term 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which employs 350 at its gift shop, hotel and a restaurant that 
can serve 6,000 meals a day, has seen its labor costs rise 3% in the last 
quarter alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our labor costs are up not only because we are paying more, but our training 
costs are up because the turnover is higher," Essenhaus owner Bob Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wage pressures have been greatest for manufacturers, particularly in 
the RV and automotive supply businesses, where the average hourly pay is $14 an 
hour. Workplace raids and bidding over prized employees is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost some of our better employees to the competition," said Harry 
Tallman, vice president of human resources for Starcraft Automotive Co., a van 
conversion firm based in Goshen. "There have been wage wars." 
</P>
<P>
 The labor shortage prompted Starcraft to begin a review of its wage and 
benefit plans with an eye toward becoming more competitive. But instead of 
raising hourly wages, the company is likely to offer bonuses tied to 
productivity and quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to bid up our wages," Tallman said. "It's dangerous to do so in 
a cyclical industry." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the shortage has been the hiring of unskilled or unmotivated 
workers, said Richey of Patriot Homes: "We have some people I would replace in 
a heartbeat if I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Others complain of workers jumping from job to job. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an industry that tends to suffer peaks and valleys, it is not 
surprising that workers will jump at the best offer. The RV industry is known 
for periodic layoffs and for having poor long-term benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Marcus, economics professor at Indiana University in Bloomington, 
argues that the situation in Elkhart highlights the failure of U.S. companies 
to provide workers with the training and financial incentives to increase 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening in Elkhart takes on added importance because the community's 
economy tends to foreshadow where the national economy will be in three or four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 John Peck, economics professor at Indiana University in South Bend, said 
Elkhart tends to be ahead of the curve entering and leaving recessions because 
the RV industry -- accounting for 20% of Elkhart's jobs -- is very sensitive to 
swings in interest rates and consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The RV industry serves as a good leading economic indicator," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Elkhart's story says to some economists is that inflation is a real 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Herschede, economics professor at Indiana University in South Bend, said 
there are numerous signs of inflation, including labor shortages, falling 
productivity, higher unit labor costs and increasing demand. Without Fed 
intervention, he projects inflation hitting 4% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pressures are especially evident in the auto industry, which is running 
its factories at near capacity. Every one of Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. plants, for 
example, operated on overtime this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The strained capacity is leading to lower productivity because the efficiency 
gains of recent years are now being offset by higher labor costs, training 
costs and lower quality caused by long work days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though wage gains may be modest, if you couple that with the drop in 
productivity, you will get an increase in unit labor costs that will build 
price pressures," Herschede said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, export demand is likely to grow as the European and Japanese 
economies recover. And raw material prices, notably steel, have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Elkhart, companies continue to scramble to fill orders and hire 
workers. They worry about what the Fed may do, concerned that too strong a move 
will slow growth too much and ultimately bring on recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things are good in Elkhart, they are very very good," said Tallman of 
Starcraft. "When they are bad, they are very, very bad."

COLUMN ONE; CAUTIONARY TALES FROM PANAMA; FIVE YEARS AFTER THE U.S. INVASION, 
THE NATION'S BUMPY RECOVERY OFFERS LESSONS FOR AMERICANS MOVING INTO HAITI. THE 
FAILURE TO METE OUT JUSTICE IS SEEN AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his last year in power, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega repeatedly appeared to 
accept a hard-fought deal, brokered with U.S. officials and Panamanian 
politicians. He would step down, civilians would be allowed to return to 
government, this nation's long military regime would end. 
</P>
<P>
 But each time his adversaries thought a deal had been struck, Noriega found a 
way to renege. Three months after the last talks broke down, as Noriega 
continued to cling to power, U.S. armed forces invaded this tiny country to 
depose Noriega and restore democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, the record in Panama is decidedly mixed and replete with 
lessons for U.S. military commanders and policy-makers as they move into Haiti. 
Although an outright invasion has been avoided, the stated goals are much the 
same as they were in Panama -- and far more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Panama, substantial growth has revived an economy that was left a 
shambles after the invasion and by earlier U.S.-imposed sanctions. Panamanians 
enjoy personal and democratic liberties, such as freedom of expression, 
unthinkable during the Noriega years. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the scourges that then-President George Bush said he was invading 
Panama to fight -- drug trafficking, money laundering and rampant corruption -- 
continue to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 The government that U.S. occupation troops installed left office in disarray 
this month, with a single-digit approval rating in public polls. It was 
replaced -- via Panama's most democratic elections ever -- by the same 
political party the invasion had ousted, the party that had backed Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Panamanian and U.S. analysts say the shortcomings in Panama can be traced, in 
part, to a failure to adequately change laws, political and judicial systems, 
and institutions, such as national security forces. Many Panamanians also 
lament the failure to mete out justice to the most abusive of Noriega's 
cronies. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti faces similar, if not greater, tasks. Thus far, the United States 
appears to be backtracking on its earlier resolve to disarm Haiti's brutal army 
and to punish human rights violators. Where Panama ultimately was rid of 
dictator Noriega, the fate of Haiti's military strongman, Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, is unclear, although he appears to be planning to step down from power 
but stay in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In another cautionary note for Haiti, Panama's lack of democratic tradition 
meant its post-invasion rulers had scant political training and were largely 
ineffective. President Guillermo Endara, whose term ended Sept. 1, never 
overcame the stigma of having been installed on a U.S. military base by 
occupation forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Endara, Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- whom the 
Clinton Administration has pledged to restore to office -- has a large base of 
popular support, which will help him build credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Haiti's road to a functional government is a much longer one than 
Panama's, its army and human rights history much more chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Removing Noriega did not change the type of society you had in Panama. You 
can't expect that, and you can't expect it in Haiti either," said a senior U.S. 
military officer who participated in the Panama invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panamanians," the officer added, "expected a lot more than could have been 
delivered. They expected Panama would become like the (U.S.-managed) Canal Zone 
-- a city of gold. Trash would be picked up, there would be jobs, enough to 
eat. Invasions don't solve things like that. What will the Haitians expect? Who 
will they blame when it doesn't happen? How do you define improvement there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere; Panama has traditionally been 
one of the most prosperous in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Haiti intervention, the U.S. invasion of Panama in 
December, 1989, ushered into power the Panamanian elite, and foreign investors 
immediately felt comfortable. It was private commerce, manufacturing and 
banking -- more than foreign aid -- that bolstered Panama's economic recovery, 
an impressive 9.3% growth in 1991 and about 6% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of improving the administration of justice was a key element to 
restoring faith and trust in Panama, and it will be in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Panamanians complain that, despite U.S. funding targeted for the 
judiciary, the post-invasion government did not change laws written under 
military dictatorship and allowed an unwieldy court system to remain in place. 
Failure to prosecute human rights abusers and the possibility of government 
amnesties -- both real prospects in Haiti too -- thwarted justice for many 
Panamanians. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Noriega supporters were jailed after the invasion. Many languished 
in prison for three years or more without trials, and the major atrocities of 
the previous two decades of military rule went unpunished. A trial was finally 
held last year in the 1985 beheading of Noriega critic Hugo Spadafora, for 
example, and the nine soldiers accused of the crime were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Panama were thirsty for justice," said Marco Gandasegui, who 
heads Panama's Latin American Studies Center. "There were many (arbitrary 
conditions) that characterized the military regime. But (the Endara government) 
did not give the pursuit of justice much importance. In the romantic sense, 
maybe, but not in the institutional sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Noriega's former party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, 
proposed a general amnesty in 1993. The proposal caused such uproar that the 
matter was dropped. But back in power, the party has revived the proposal, and 
new President Ernesto Perez Balladares last week announced pardons for more 
than 200 former Noriega officials, including the head of Noriega's secret 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, one of the most arduous tasks that will face the occupation forces 
-- or the Aristide government, presuming it takes office -- is the building of 
a police force. Some cues can be taken from the Panama experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after the invasion, Noriega's army, the 16,000-member 
Panama Defense Forces, or PDF, was dismantled; the more notorious military 
units, such as Noriega's elite, U.S.-trained, combat-ready Battalion 2000, were 
abolished, and a new civilian police force was formed. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than have to contend with thousands of out-of-work soldiers, the 
Endara government recruited many of the same PDF rank-and-file, as well as some 
officers, to staff and run the police force. They had to swear allegiance to 
Endara and undergo months-long scrutiny that eventually purged nearly 150 
captains and majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Panamanians at the time were mortified that the same soldiers who once 
obeyed Noriega were going to be street cops. But Endara and his U.S. military 
advisers argued that there was no other source for the new police. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruits were given U.S. training, new uniforms and side-arms to replace 
their heavy weaponry. Still, the new force has been criticized for incompetence 
and what some critics call an authoritarian swagger. There have been morale 
problems because of low pay, and many former PDF officers resented their loss 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
 The police force went through six chiefs in the first 2 1/2 years after the 
invasion. The first was dismissed after revelations that he had a 
multimillion-dollar bank account that could not be explained. The second, Col. 
Eduardo Herrera Hassan, tried to overthrow the Endara government in a 1990 coup 
that had to be put down by American troops. Awaiting formal charges, Herrera 
was among those pardoned last week by Perez Balladares. 
</P>
<P>
 The current police chief, Oswaldo Fernandez, is a civilian who has held the 
job for more than a year. But U.S. and Panamanian officials say the police are 
still plagued by corrupt elements, and in a sign of the public's continued 
mistrust, 125 private security firms have sprung up in the last couple of 
years, their total manpower greater than the police force's. And they are 
well-armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts caution that recruiting police from an existing army has different 
implications in Haiti than in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PDF had protected itself, had defended Noriega and had engaged in 
criminal activity, but it hadn't lived off the suffering of the general 
population and didn't have the history of slaughtering and terrorizing the 
people the way the Haitian military does," said Richard Millett, a senior 
adviser at the University of Miami North-South Center who has written 
extensively on Panama. "The PDF lived off international corruption; the Haitian 
military thugs live off domestic corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Millett and others also noted that the PDF was a defeated army, which made it 
easier to rein in. 
</P>
<P>
 The police here have also seemed ill-equipped to fight a raging crime wave, 
and Perez Balladares in his inaugural speech Sept. 1 declared a public security 
"state of emergency" and vowed to beef up the force. Government opponents hope 
such tough talk will not be used as a pretext for police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 To oust Noriega, the United States launched what then was its largest combat 
operation since the Vietnam War, deploying 26,000 troops before dawn on Dec. 
20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega, a onetime CIA operative, escaped and hid for days until his surrender 
on Jan. 3, 1990. In the invasion, 23 Americans and hundreds of Panamanians were 
killed. After a long federal trial in Miami, Noriega is in prison, serving 40 
years for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Endara, whose apparent electoral victory the previous May had been canceled by 
Noriega, was sworn in to office in a ceremony at a U.S. military base. Perez 
Balladares, like many PRD militants, was arrested by U.S. troops and 
interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
 When Perez Balladares took over from Endara this month, Endara actually seemed 
relieved his presidency was ending. His administration had been dogged by 
reports of widespread corruption and scandals involving drug trafficking, 
illegal arms smuggling and other sins that supposedly characterized the Noriega 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama's secretive banking system and its booming free-trade zone -- one of 
the largest in the world -- continue to make the isthmus country a thriving 
center for the laundering of cocaine profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government took nominal steps to guard against money laundering, 
U.S. officials say there is no evidence the business has declined since 
Noriega's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite economic growth, 40% of Panama lives in poverty, and as many as one in 
four Panamanians is out of work, according to church and private-sector 
estimates. Drug abuse has soared, along with street crime, murder and suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lesson to policy-makers dealing with Haiti, analysts and diplomats 
assessing post-invasion Panama say that widespread dissatisfaction poses a 
danger to democratic stability by creating a nostalgia for the "old days" of 
military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In Panama, it has created a yearning for the paternalistic patronage system 
that benefited many in the working class and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the time of dictatorships, there were more jobs for the poor than under 
democracy," complained an elderly man playing cards recently in the slum of El 
Chorrillo, which was burned to the ground during the invasion. He sat on the 
corner of a concrete slab where Noriega's headquarters stood before it was 
bombed by the invading Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 That nostalgia may have been the motive for some voters in May 8 presidential 
elections that gave a narrow but decisive victory to Perez Balladares and the 
PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 "The matrix of the Noriega regime has returned to power, only this time they 
must govern without force," said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a political scientist 
who opposes the government. "The question is, can they govern without force, 
especially as social and economic conditions deteriorate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bernal, who has fought military strongmen for most of his adult life, is among 
the harshest critics of the PRD, and many people do not share his alarm. Perez 
Balladares and other PRD leaders join in denouncing Noriega and insist the 
party has reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president especially has taken great pains to cooperate with 
Washington, offering to take Cuban refugees and give political asylum to 
Haitian leader Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares, a banker and millionaire businessman, has also placed 
prominent independents in his government, such as Gabriel Lewis Galindo, who 
helped negotiate the 1977 Panama Canal treaties.

 "The (PRD's) policy of the '70s is not the same as the '90s," Lewis said. "The 
time of confrontation is over."

<P>
 Still, several members of Perez Balladares' Cabinet, notably Labor Minister 
Mitchell Doens and Housing Minister Francisco Sanchez Cardenas, had prominent 
roles in the Noriega regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Doens' record is so questionable that he might have trouble obtaining a U.S. 
visa if he were not a government official, sources say.

 While it may not prove true in Haiti, Panamanian and American analysts caution 
that, at least in Panama, one legacy of military intervention is that it 
promotes a dependence on the United States for the resolution of problems.

CONFRONTATIONS POINT UP DANGER OF U.S. ROLE; MILITARY: DIPLOMATS FEAR 
AMERICANS' ACTIONS AGAINST POLICE WILL BRING MOB VIOLENCE, NEED FOR MORE FORCE. 
</P>

 A growing series of confrontations between U.S. troops and the Haitian 
military, including Saturday night's bloody engagement in which 10 Haitians 
were killed, are exposing the dangers and confusions of U.S. policy here, 
diplomats and military officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we were afraid of, Americans having to use more and more deadly 
force," one diplomat said, speaking of the Saturday incident in Cap Haitien. 
"It's going to be a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cap Haitien gunfight, which came about when U.S. Marines tried to prevent 
local police from breaking up an anti-government demonstration, was just the 
worst of several weekend incidents in which American troops interfered with 
police efforts to control popular demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gonaives, about 10,000 Haitians demonstrated Saturday against the military 
just after U.S. troops arrived there. When two men, presumably police or 
civilian auxiliaries, pulled out ancient M-1 semiautomatic rifles, the American 
soldiers disarmed them. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd went after the two men, who had to be rescued by the U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans in Gonaives also had to save a well-known army supporter, Jean 
Tatoune, and three Haitian policemen after Tatoune began shooting in the air 
when demonstrators attacked his house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Haitian military and its civilian allies appear to be 
defying the American presence by increasing the oppression in slum areas where 
there is strong support for exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose 
overthrow three years ago ignited the crisis that resulted in the U.S. 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Cite Soleil, Carrefour and Mirebalais, three large Port-au-Prince 
slums, say attaches, as the police auxiliaries are called, prowled the streets 
Saturday night, firing into the air. In at least one case, they reportedly 
killed a man who had taken part in a pro-Aristide demonstration earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cap Haitien, the Marines used deadly fire when Haitian police in civilian 
clothes pulled weapons and reportedly fired on a large anti-government crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In some of the other confrontations, the American troops had to intervene to 
save the lives of police when the demonstrators turned on the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a major danger sign, according to diplomats, a warning that they fear 
is being misunderstood if not ignored by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have bought into something they don't understand," one official said. 
"Every time the (U.S. forces) disarm or shoot a Haitian soldier or policeman, 
it emboldens the crowds to act on their own. They think they have the right to 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sunday rampage in Cap Haitien, in which a crowd stormed three police 
facilities, was an example, said another diplomat who agreed with that 
interpretation. "When they saw the Marines shoot the police, the people saw 
that as a go-ahead to taking over, so they went after the police posts and army 
base," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By one diplomat's analysis, this ultimately will end up with American troops 
using at least the threat of force, if not actual violence, against large 
segments of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be difficult to explain to the (American) public why we are shooting 
the people we supposedly are here to defend, or why we are defending the people 
we are here to get rid of," an American military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 While these incidents have been building, the real test of American policy 
will come when Aristide returns from exile. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see half a million people, maybe even more, show up at the airport 
to greet Aristide," another diplomat said. "If they decide to get even with the 
army and its friends, the only way to stop it will be by massive force." 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing challenge by the poorly armed and smaller Haitian forces to the 
authority of the American force of more than 10,000 now here also shows signs 
of being part of a calculated effort by the Haitian military, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Haitian expert said that "there is no other explanation. (Haitian military 
commander Raoul) Cedras and (Police Chief Michel-Joseph) Francois aren't crazy 
enough to think they can drive out the Americans. But they think they can get 
Congress to." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his interpretation, the Haitians are provoking the U.S. troops into 
overreacting in hopes that an already dubious American public and wary Congress 
will demand a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 "They read the papers and their friends (in the United States) tell them that 
Clinton's policy here is unpopular. They think this is their only hope of 
preventing Aristide's return," the expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is likely," another official said, "that this kind of harassment is 
designed to spark an American resistance to U.S. policy, just like in Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to an American public outcry and congressional demand for 
U.S. withdrawal from the African country after 18 Americans were killed in an 
ambush there.

PROP. 187 FOES' HAS A TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the tide of public opinion running vehemently against illegal 
immigration, opponents of Proposition 187 are playing out a long-shot strategy 
that boils down to the old maxim: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, illegal immigration is a major problem, they concede. Of course, 
reform is needed, they acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Proposition 187 -- which would deny most government services to 
illegal immigrants and require public health, education and police officials to 
turn in suspects' names to federal authorities -- would only make a bad 
situation worse, they insist. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smoked-glass building overlooking San Francisco Bay, veteran political 
consultants Richard Woodward and Jack McDowell are hard at work overseeing this 
delicate but pragmatic opposition effort on behalf of a broad coalition, 
Taxpayers Against 187, whose members range from the state PTA to the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodward & McDowell firm is among the state's leading experts on ballot 
measures, having won the 1984 campaign bringing California its lottery and 
having defeated the 1990 "Big Green" environmental initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the firm faces a particularly formidable challenge, with far 
less time and money, while having to speak in a unified voice for a coalition 
of odd political bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
 As voters begin focusing on the details of the November ballot, Woodward's 
forces intend to hit them time and again with the following mantra: Proposition 
187 could result in increased street crime and disease while costing the state 
up to $15 billion a year in lost federal revenue. Moreover, they say, it would 
result in an inevitable Supreme Court challenge while failing to address in any 
way the most graphic component of the immigration battle -- the nightly dance 
in the dusty hills between Tijuana and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're trying to solve illegal immigration, where do you do it? At the 
border," said Woodward, who began his career as a Republican Party operative. 
"With this 187, there will not be one more Border Patrol person and not one 
more dollar spent" on beefed-up enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward, while declining to provide specific details, said a recent random 
public opinion survey by his firm showed that support for Proposition 187 dips 
below the 50% mark once voters are informed of the key arguments for and 
against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience shows that once you get something under 50%, you've got a very 
good shot at defeating it," asserted Woodward, who has not lost a "no" campaign 
in more than 20 years of consulting. "What we have to do, we have to be hitting 
on all cylinders in every form of communication." 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the ballot measure boasting a lead of 30-plus points in the 
polls and the Nov. 8 election looming on the horizon, this task is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, illegal immigration is an emotional issue and the "no" 
coalition must persuade voters who are intent on making a statement to also 
consider the more nebulous long-term implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me this is a message initiative, and those people who support 
it will do so no matter what and aren't susceptible to reasoned economic or 
social debate," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for 
Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 The hired guns must also help keep the "no" coalition focused on its central 
theme. That won't be a problem for more conservative members such as Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who time and again has expressed a 
visceral distaste for illegal immigration. But it's not so simple a case for 
immigration rights groups, considering that the "no" campaign's basic message 
essentially demonizes the very people they fight to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have differences," said Robert Almanzan, MALDEF's community affairs 
assistant. "But we all have realized that (the effort to defeat) 187 needs a 
strong coalition of all Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important to their success, Proposition 187 opponents must come up with 
the cash to communicate their message -- primarily through TV and radio ads -- 
in the dwindling weeks of a campaign that also includes races for governor and 
U.S. Senate, all of which could be drowned out of the public consciousness, and 
airwaves, by the O.J. Simpson murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the hands of a skillful consultant, there's a lot of visual images and hot 
button fears that could be pushed," said Prof. Bruce Cain of the Institute of 
Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. "But to do that, you need the big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when Woodward & McDowell came from behind to defeat "Big 
Green," the firm launched its efforts nearly a year in advance, boasted $12 
million from big business in its campaign kitty and had an instantly 
recognizable target to kick around: then-Assemblyman and now-state Sen. Tom 
Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the consulting firm didn't come on board until July, has no 
conservative counterpart to Hayden to hammer away at and appears likely to have 
only a fraction of the campaign finances at its disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Big businesses, which have frequently funded campaigns run by Woodward & 
McDowell, "are neutral -- they're staying out of it," Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the California Farm Bureau Federation, which represents many of the 
state's largest employers of Mexican immigrants. "We felt it was so 
controversial on both sides we'd make enemies no matter what position we took," 
said Roy Gabriel, legislative director of labor affairs for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Woodward said, "we're going to get money from labor, the health care 
community, education. We've already got money from small business, from 
Latinos, from Hollywood and the entertainment community." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Taxpayers Against 187 campaign finance report is not due to be filed 
until Oct. 5. But when asked how much the "no" forces plan to spend, Woodward 
said they would need at least $3 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that amount, he indicated, is not yet in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the California Teachers Assn., which has raised the specter 
of its members being turned into snitches if required to report suspected 
illegal immigrants, said the organization is contributing $350,000 to Taxpayers 
Against 187. That stands in marked contrast to the $12 million the CTA spent to 
fight the school voucher initiative last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just isn't the same kind of a proposition," said spokeswoman Tommye Hutto. 
"School vouchers was a special kind of deal where members had a special 
assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the contrast "is extremely revealing," said Cain. "That tells you 
their money isn't where their mouth is and it's basically a token expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Assn., another of the more deep-pocketed groups in the 
coalition, has not yet determined how much money to contribute to the fight 
against the ballot measure, spokeswoman Danielle Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Prince, co-chair of the Pro-187 California Coalition for Immigration 
Reform, says proponents, due to limited funds, do not expect to undertake a 
television ad campaign of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the group's message is receiving widespread exposure through the 
anti-illegal immigrant TV ads of Gov. Pete Wilson, who has endorsed Proposition 
187 as part of his reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince said he is wary about the possible impact of a major Taxpayers Against 
187 television campaign. "I am concerned because they are trying to make it an 
emotional issue instead of just an issue of law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prince added that he believes his side will nonetheless prevail because 
"we are the real taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 With limited funds, the "no" coalition intends to take a multi-pronged 
approach to win support, said Woodward and Karen Kapler, the firm's day-to-day 
manager of the Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is understanding the initiative," Kapler said. "It's the only 
solution on the blocks right now and we (must) communicate that it's not going 
to solve the problem, it's going to make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the firm has begun efforts to educate an estimated 1 million 
members of state and local organizations, including church groups, that are 
opposed to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of organizations and community leaders against the measure has 
mushroomed recently to four typewritten pages and includes the state School 
Boards Assn., PTA and teachers association, the California Medical Assn., the 
California Nurses Assn., the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, the 
League of Women Voters of California, the Congress of California Seniors, 
Cardinal Roger Mahony, the American Jewish Congress, the Los Angeles City 
Council, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the California Labor 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward & McDowell operatives are also coordinating their efforts with 
another, less publicized anti-187 umbrella group, Californians United Against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter organization, made up of civil rights agencies including the 
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, is undertaking a 
get-out-the-vote campaign among occasional and newly naturalized registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapler said she has no problem working with anti-187 groups that may have 
varying viewpoints on immigration. "The more people out there actively 
involved, the better off we all are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waning weeks of the campaign, the consulting firm, which will not 
disclose its fee, hopes to win placement on influential slate mailers. It also 
plans to hit the airwaves with ads likely to appeal to the pocketbooks and 
fears of swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
 With its limited resources, the coalition will not be able to mount a 
saturation advertising campaign, concedes spokesman Scott Macdonald. But 
Woodward is confident that his firm's ads can still make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the four major markets (San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento and Los 
Angeles) you need $800,000 to $1 million (in total) to have any kind of an 
impact in a week's time," he said. "If we can get adequate funds, and I think 
we're going to . . . we can win." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, not everyone, including one of the key spokesmen for the "no" 
campaign, is convinced of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy when you can't inoculate children and when you put schoolchildren 
on the street," Block said. "(But) I believe without question it's going to 
pass overwhelmingly."

ADMINISTRATION REJECTS CALLS TO SHORTEN MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials on Sunday appealed for time for U.S. troops 
to establish order in impoverished Haiti and rejected suggestions that the 
United States must alter or shorten its military mission in the Caribbean 
nation in the wake of the weekend violence and chaos that broke out in Haiti's 
second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that, from the outset of the Haiti mission, they 
had anticipated the very kind of incident that occurred in Cap Haitien, where 
U.S. Marines killed 10 Haitian police officers Saturday night and an emboldened 
mob ransacked the local police facilities Sunday, seizing arms and turning them 
over to American forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the Saturday night firefight, Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili said in separate 
interviews that such incidents should not prompt Congress to immediately set a 
firm date for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Haiti, as some members are 
beginning to favor doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, speaking on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" news show, called the Cap Haitien 
firefight "typical of what we expected to see" and warned that troops will 
continue to encounter sporadic resistance from Haitian soldiers, police or 
paramilitary supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili asserted that setting a date for American troops to depart Haiti 
"creates a dynamic on the ground" that complicates the U.S. mission, helps 
America's adversaries and puts American forces at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, the White House said, "We regret any loss of life in 
connection with our mission in Haiti," but added: "We will continue to work 
with Haitian military authorities for a peaceful transition." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
said a Senate resolution will be introduced this week directing the 
Administration to end the initial, unilateral phase of the U.S. mission in 
Haiti by a date to be specified, probably several months away. He said he 
believes the resolution will pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn -- part of former President Jimmy Carter's delegation that negotiated an 
agreement last week with the Haitian junta, allowing the peaceful landing of 
U.S. troops -- said he hopes the Senate measure will provide "some flexibility 
for the President." But Nunn added: "Hopefully, we'll be able to turn this 
mission over to the U.N. at an early date." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the U.S. military must not allow itself to be pulled into rebuilding 
and democratizing Haiti. That, he said, is a job for the Haitians and the 
United Nations after the Americans establish order and security. 
</P>
<P>
 But Madeleine Albright -- the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who was 
briefed on the matter -- sought to downplay the happenings in Cap Haitien, 
saying: "That was one incident in what has been, I think, an amazingly 
successful operation. I think Congress is afraid that we are into something 
open-ended, when we know very clearly that we are not. . . . Every day, I 
think, has brought progress. That is not to say there have not been bumps in 
the road and will not be bumps in the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress, though, expressed growing doubts about the U.S. 
involvement in Haiti after the weekend incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich, a leading Republican lawmaker from Georgia, said the House 
will take up a resolution calling for a rapid withdrawal of American forces 
from Haiti, perhaps by a firm date. He predicted "substantial support" for the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just had a firefight last night. None of those 10 Haitian families who 
just lost somebody are going to love Americans more," Gingrich said on CBS-TV's 
"Face the Nation" news show. "None of their friends are going to love Americans 
more. . . . I don't think they (U.S. soldiers) want to wait around for ambushes 
and for booby traps and for all the things that can go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In a development that may help buy the Administration some breathing room, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president, declared Sunday that he will 
convene an extraordinary session of Haiti's Parliament on Wednesday to consider 
granting amnesty for the military rulers who ousted him. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement accepted last week by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian 
strongman, and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff, provided 
for them to relinquish power when an amnesty was granted, or by Oct. 15, 
whichever came first. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide supporters have expressed severe reservations about any action that 
would exempt members of the Haitian military and police from all punishment for 
their abuses and repression since the September, 1991, coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the security situation will be such that the Parliament can 
convene and that the parliamentarians currently in exile in the United States 
can return to Haiti," said Gwen McKinney, an Aristide spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in remarks at a church in New York, observed about Haiti: 
"I think more and more Americans are seeing that what we are doing there is 
good and supports democracy throughout our hemisphere, which is nothing more 
than saying our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said they intend to phase out the initial U.S. 
mission as early as possible. The 13,000 U.S. troops now in Haiti will increase 
to 14,000 or 15,000 soon, but that force will be reduced in a few months "as 
the security situation gets established," Perry said Sunday.

CLINTON'S TRUST IN CARTER RESTS ON LONG RELATIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was almost midnight when George Bush went to bed, but fellow guest Jimmy 
Carter decided to stay up with their young host and press his case for a more 
active role in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The host was President Clinton, and the two former Presidents were spending 
the night at the White House a year ago this month to speak the next morning in 
support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and Clinton talked until 2 in the morning. Political allies for two 
decades, their relations had chilled since Clinton took office. The former 
President complained that the Administration had rebuffed his efforts to play a 
more prominent foreign policy role, even though he had dealt extensively with 
foreign leaders since leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
 In his young ally, the elder statesman found a sympathetic ear. He was able to 
carve out for himself an expansive role as a special presidential envoy in 
major foreign policy crises, an assignment that would take him to North Korea 
and, most recently, Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In that capacity, Carter has scored some extraordinary achievements. 
Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, agreement to stop the 
flood of raft people from Cuba to Florida, the accord averting a U.S. invasion 
of Haiti -- all these can be traced in whole or in part to the efforts of the 
former President. 
</P>
<P>
 But each time Carter ventured to -- and sometimes apparently beyond -- the 
limits of his authority. He blasted Clinton's foreign policy, as when he 
declared himself "ashamed" of U.S. economic sanctions against Haiti. He made 
foreign policy on his own, as when he said the United States was prepared to 
suspend its pursuit of economic sanctions against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The public could hardly be blamed for wondering whether Carter was an unguided 
missile or the Clinton Administration had abdicated its responsibility to 
conduct foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton himself retains his confidence in the sometimes prickly elder 
statesman. The President, according to aides, is grateful for the role Carter 
has played in easing crises in Haiti and North Korea and expects him to 
continue to be active in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They continue to have a good, substantive relationship," a senior Clinton 
aide said. "While they differ on some things, and both have strongly held 
opinions, an awful lot binds them -- they're Democrats, Southerners who have 
been governors and want to bring changes in foreign policy. A lot of foreign 
countries do a better job than we do of using former presidents. Clinton 
believes this is the right way" to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's confidence rests on a long, solid, if somewhat up-and-down, 
relationship that dates to 1974, when Carter was Georgia's 50-year-old governor 
beginning to plot his presidential campaign and Clinton was an eager 
28-year-old congressional candidate from Arkansas who was already dreaming of 
being President. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his race for Congress, Clinton supported Carter's presidential 
bid in 1976 and was himself elected Arkansas attorney general that year. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Bill and Hillary Clinton hit it off with Jimmy and Rosalyn 
Carter. "Jimmy Carter has always thought of Bill Clinton as one of his earliest 
and strongest and most visible supporters, and feels he knows him well," a 
longtime Carter adviser said. "All through the presidency, the Clintons were 
considered part of the Carter political family." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hillary Rodham Clinton was only 30 at the time, Carter appointed her 
as a board member of Legal Services Corp., which provides legal advice to the 
poor. The corporation's budget had been slashed by one-third, and the 
appointment of the aggressive young lawyer signaled Carter's intention to 
revive the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination 
in 1992, the former President, breaking his own rule against supporting one 
Democrat against another in a primary, endorsed Clinton and helped him carry 
the Georgia primary. It was a crucial win at a time when the Arkansas 
governor's campaign was reeling over charges of draft avoidance and an 
extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter remained a strong supporter and lavished praise on Clinton in a speech 
at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. But after Clinton's election, 
Carter felt slighted when the President-elect consulted with former Presidents 
Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford but not with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Clinton's aides began spreading the word they did not want to see the 
new Administration become "Carterized." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see this Administration called 'Jimmy Carter II,' " one 
Clinton adviser said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the remarks were attributed to Clinton or even to his top 
advisers, they caused a rift. "Clinton was busy, and I'm sure he had nothing to 
do with it, but the carping by some of his aides was hurtful," one of Carter's 
advisers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter felt humiliated at Clinton's inaugural gala. The only former President 
in attendance, he was assigned a seat near the back. Celebrities read quotes 
from previous Presidents, including Reagan, but none from Carter. When Clinton 
spoke, he did not recognize Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President was steaming when he returned to the Carter Center in 
Atlanta and resumed his busy life of conducting foreign policy discussions and 
traveling around the world, meeting heads of state, monitoring elections in 
emerging democracies and seeking remedies to problems in developing nations 
such as river blindness, the devastating Guinea worm and the vestiges of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter believed that he could at least count on his old friend, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, to help him in his ventures into foreign affairs. 
Carter had advised Clinton to nominate Christopher, who had served as his 
deputy secretary of state, calling him "the greatest public servant I've ever 
known." 
</P>
<P>
 But their relationship cooled as Christopher's State Department resisted 
Carter's efforts to get more involved in foreign policy. Carter's role as a 
special envoy is widely viewed, particularly at the State Department, as 
usurping Christopher's powers and overshadowing Clinton's official foreign 
policy team. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Carter's success in easing the Haitian and North Korean crises is 
broadly acclaimed, some Administration officials say his role has greatly 
complicated Administration implementation of foreign policy. They especially 
resent his frequent public criticism of Administration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until last September, when Carter went to the White House to 
support the trade agreement and be an honored guest at a ceremony marking the 
historic Israeli-Palestinian accord, that he re-established a close 
relationship with Clinton. "That was a real breakthrough," a Carter associate 
said. "They both came away from it saying it was very constructive, they felt 
very good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Carter's first trip to the White House since Reagan was inaugurated to 
succeed him in January, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that morning, Clinton, Bush and Carter spoke out forcefully in the East 
Room of the White House at a ceremony arranged to drum up public support for 
NAFTA, a crucial measure that was in danger of dying in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But only Carter took on Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who was financing an 
anti-NAFTA campaign and had been a thorn in Clinton's side since running third 
as an independent in the 1992 presidential election. In an attack that brought 
the audience to its feet, Carter branded Perot "a demagogue who has unlimited 
financial resources and who is extremely careless with the truth, who is 
preying on the fears and uncertainties of the American public." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's help on the trade agreement -- a Republican initiative opposed by 
many Democrats -- further cemented his relationship with Clinton. "The 
President deeply appreciated his help and the fact he didn't hesitate to take 
on Ross Perot," a senior Clinton aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton felt that Carter's performance set up Perot for the televised debate 
with Vice President Al Gore, which Gore won handily and was widely considered 
crucial to Congress' passage of the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his September meeting with Clinton, Carter had told friends he felt a 
"sense of betrayal" because the White House had shown little interest in 
contacting him, and he had been rebuffed by the State Department. He made no 
secret that he believed his old friend Christopher had personally frozen him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter told friends that he had had better contact with the Bush White House 
and had an especially cordial relationship with then-Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher "snubbed" him, he declared, while Baker cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, just after returning from his Haiti mission, Carter lavished 
praise on Baker in a videotaped statement for use at groundbreaking ceremonies 
at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Christopher, though upset at some of Carter's excursions into 
foreign policy, has been a strong proponent of Presidents utilizing the 
services of their predecessors. In a speech at the opening of the Carter Center 
on Sept. 30, 1986, he deplored the fact that Presidents seldom seek their 
predecessors' help. Turning to another guest, then-President Reagan, 
Christopher reminded him that former Presidents are a national resource who 
leave the White House with the ability to do great things. 
</P>
<P>
 "One comes away from a cursory review of the lives of the ex-Presidents with a 
chilling sense of a wasted resource," Christopher said. "On the whole, their 
experience was undervalued and their advice too little sought." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Christopher has tried to make light of the rift with Carter 
and declared that he still views former Presidents as an "underutilized 
resource." He also visited Carter at his home in Plains, Ga., on Saturday on a 
mission a State Department aide said was "to bury the hatchet." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials described the 2 1/2-hour session, which included lunch served by the 
Carters, as cordial and constructive. It ended with a promise of better 
communication between the former President and the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of any effort at reconciliation, aides to both men say the 
relationship is likely to remain difficult -- and a complication for the 
Carter-Clinton relationship -- as long as Christopher is secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carter always considered Christopher to be a very capable deputy secretary of 
state," a State Department aide said. "Their roles have changed now, and 
Christopher is secretary of state, but Carter still remembers him as a capable 
deputy and relates to him that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Carter's bond with Clinton likely to proceed without more bumps. Carter 
walks a difficult line. By serving as a mediator rather than purely a 
presidential envoy, he represents not only the United States' position, but the 
position of its adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed, a mediator cannot be supportive of only one side. Thus, when 
Carter went to Haiti, he appealed to the "honor" of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the 
Haitian dictator Clinton had accused of leading a reign of terror. And the 
agreement forged by Carter providing for the military dictators to leave office 
did not include a provision important to Clinton: that they also leave the 
country. Cedras had balked at that. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's personality has also rankled some Clinton advisers, if not the 
President himself. Carter is known for stubbornness, moral righteousness and 
being unyielding to the point of exasperating his own aides. He does not take 
slights lightly, as his feud with Christopher demonstrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever problems might develop between them, however, Carter admires Clinton, 
as he told an Atlanta audience, as "a brilliant young man" who survived a 
savage political campaign and upon becoming President has grappled effectively 
with some "very difficult foreign policy questions" inherited from the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 As President, Carter endured two independent counsel investigations -- one 
into whether he got campaign funds illegally from his peanut warehouse and one 
into his brother Billy's foreign-agent relationship with Libya. No wrongdoing 
was found in either case. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the experiences, Carter empathizes with Clinton's ordeal as the 
subject of the independent counsel investigation into the Whitewater real 
estate venture and related matters. In fact, unbeknown to Clinton, Carter and 
his wife, Rosalyn, each has sent $1,000 checks, the maximum allowed, to the 
defense fund the President established to pay his legal fees and other expenses 
incurred during the investigation.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL; HUFFINGTON RIDING HIGH; ATTACKS HAVE FEINSTEIN ANGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The audience gathered in the Fairmont Hotel's Grand Ballroom was more than 
just another crowd of supporters for Sen. Dianne Feinstein. This was the 
senator's political base, including many who have stood at the former mayor's 
side since her early days in San Francisco politics over 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So they shared a hearty cheer when Catherine Feinstein, the senator's 
daughter, stood in front of nearly 600 supporters Saturday evening and said 
what she really thinks about her mother's Republican opponent, Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be one thing for my mom to face an opponent with some smarts, or 
with a decent record, or, for that matter, with any record at all, or with 
proposals for the future that make some kind of sense," she said. "But to wake 
up every day to watch someone for whom you care very deeply being pummeled by a 
complete nothing of an opponent is frustrating beyond words." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Democrats were sick and tired of their candidate suffering months 
of one of the heaviest barrages of attack television commercials ever leveled 
at a political candidate. And they were angry because the Republican's plan was 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 Since early last spring, Feinstein's support in the polls has been dropping 
and Huffington's rising until, last week, the two lines crossed for the first 
time when an independent public poll said the race is tied. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the two Senate campaigns has been like that of an unexpected 
late-season race between two ballclubs. The favorites are forced to fathom the 
once unthinkable possibility of an upset. And the underdog challengers get the 
first real glimpse of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The different moods were clear this weekend as the two candidates searched for 
votes in Northern California, barely 100 miles apart. In contrast to 
Feinstein's frustration, Huffington was getting stars in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in the end, we're going to surprise a lot of people with a victory 
-- not just a victory, but maybe in the margin too," Huffington said Saturday. 
"Something has shifted. I'm telling you, it has shifted. Something that's 
wonderful. I feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's day of campaigning Saturday did not demonstrate his feeling that 
there is a momentum so great it might topple a political giant. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his staff drove through some of the small towns in California's Gold 
Country. There was a back yard barbecue for a few dozen people in Auburn. Then 
a radio station interview in Grass Valley. And finally a town meeting in Yuba 
City, where 11 people showed up at the Yuba County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But the candidate, wearing casual clothes and sneakers, was clearly enjoying 
himself. Between campaign stops he rode alone in a car with a reporter, 
volunteering to address some of the controversies raised about his business 
background and explaining his confidence in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was walking through the airport and some guy passing me with his wife says, 
'Hey, good luck,' " Huffington said. "No one has ever done that in the entire 
campaign. That was number one. Then I got off the plane in Washington, D.C. and 
got on one of those things you take to the terminal and a person says, 'Hey, 
Mike Huffington, you're doing a great job. I'd like to support you.' And then a 
guy on my left says, 'Hey, let me give you my card, I'd like to support you, 
too.' . . . I've never had that happen. And when you start feeling that, you 
know something is happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only me," he continued. "We may even take the House. I've never said 
that. But it's possible. This is feeling like a landslide year." 
</P>
<P>
 The moods of any political campaign are always mercurial. Some days are good, 
some are bad. And as any campaign veteran will say, moods are not a predictor 
of the next week, let alone the outcome of an election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, there are six weeks left until Election Day. Despite the 
closing polls, Feinstein is still considered the favorite by many insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she has been substantially outgunned on television because 
Huffington's personal wealth has financed a campaign more expensive than any in 
U.S. history. Feinstein officials are optimistic about their chances because 
they have saved much of their money until the end, when Huffington's financial 
edge should not be as great. 
</P>
<P>
 But the waiting has been hard for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say, I never thought that this would be the race of my life," 
Feinstein told her supporters at the Fairmont Hotel on Saturday. "If Michael 
Huffington (did not) . . . have $20 or $30 million cash (for a campaign), and 
we went toe-to-toe and record-to-record, this would not be a contest. But it is 
a huge contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched month after month as the (Huffington) television blitz and the 
newspaper full-page ads and the radio commercials go on and our poll numbers 
drop," she continued. "And I see the . . . character assassination, distortion 
and just plain outright lies. And to not have the ability to respond, because 
responding in California costs $2 million for enough (television rating) points 
to really break through. . . . It has been an incredibly frustrating race."

WAVING GOODBY TO A WASHOUT SEASON AT WEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a party for the summer that never was. The Wedge just didn't fire. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three months, Mel Thoman and other members of the Wedge crew 
dreamed of seeing Newport Beach lifeguards hoisting yellow or red warning flags 
at the famed body-surfing spot, signifying macho-sized waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the summer of '94 is best remembered for its many green flags and calm 
ocean. So with Wedge regulars looking on and hooting -- some having arrived 
from San Diego and New Mexico for the occasion -- the 37-year-old body surfer 
ceremoniously said goodby to summer and hello to autumn as he propped a 
flagpole at the Wedge. Hanging on the end was one of his wash towels. Green, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an amazingly bad summer for body surfers," Thoman said. "The 
weather's been great, water temps have been great, but the whole Wedge crew is 
down in the dumps about the summer of '94. That's why we're drinking champagne 
. . . to toast autumn and drown our sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's illegal to drink alcoholic beverages on a public beach, they 
acknowledged. But kissing off a bad summer is part of a ritual as Southern 
Californian as palm trees and strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, when there was a bad year for the Wedge," Thoman said, "we had a 
'Death to Summer' party and we all wore black. But our motto this year is to 
wear green. Everybody has to have something green because we've had the green 
flag flying for most of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wedge, at the end of the Balboa Peninsula, usually produces some of 
California's premier waves, known for their steep drop and high speed. During a 
good summer, powerful south swells bounce off a rock jetty, creating waves 20 
feet high or larger. It's a Southern California attraction that draws hundreds 
of spectators who "ooh" and "aah" while fearless body surfers -- clad only in 
trunks and swim fins -- attack "Big Wedge," as it's called during big swells. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach surf photographer Ron Romanowsky, who records only big days at 
the Wedge, said, "The first swell that made it over 10 feet at the Wedge was 
Aug. 14. And, by 5 o'clock, the swell had virtually died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," he added, "because we had so many swells last year. (We had) 22 
days in July, 1993, with waves over 6 or 8 feet at the Wedge. But this year in 
July? Zilch. There might have been something there, but nothing big to record 
on my calendar. It got so bad I stopped logging waves!" 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Marine Safety Lt. Jim Turner disagreed with Thoman's belief that 
the lifeguard tower at the Wedge hoisted only one red flag this summer -- 
though he did concede that there have been better seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a very quiet summer in regards to the Wedge," Turner said. "But we 
had the red flag up at the Wedge five days. I think they have that old feeling 
that as experts at the Wedge, they feel there's no need to put the red flag in. 
But the flag system is not only for the locals, but for the public. And it's 
the public's safety we're concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Collins, a wave forecaster at Surfline/Wavetrak in Huntington Beach, said 
it's been one of the poorest summers in terms of hurricanes and big swells. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the overall swell, it was one of the worst years we've had with 
regard to major Southern Hemisphere swells," Collins said. "The kicker is that 
we had a great summer for consistent waves for board surfers, but nothing over 
the 7- or 8-foot threshold. A lot of us surfers were pretty stoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Daily "Wedge watching" may seem obsessive to inlanders. But after all, this is 
a spot whose reputation extends to a Wedge Preservation Society, a local surf 
wear company (Wedge Wear) and a drink, "The Wedge," a concoction that includes 
white and gold tequila and is poured nightly at Newport's Studio Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wedge is such a magnet that Ian (Eli) Johnston, a 24-year-old UC San Diego 
student living in La Jolla, doesn't think twice about body surfing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Venice Beach," Johnston said. "I remember that after I got a car 
I would come here as often as I could. On that big day on Aug. 14, I called 
Mel's message machine because he gives the surf report. But his machine was 
broken. Well, I called him later and he told me there was a big swell in and 
that was at 5 p.m. I left immediately. Two hours later I was in Newport."

SPIRITUAL FEUD OVER HOMELESS DIVIDES CITY; SOCIAL SERVICES: MONSIGNOR AND A 
COUNCILMAN BOTH CITE RELIGION IN ARGUING WHETHER DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO SHELTER 
SHOULD EXPAND OR SHRINK ITS SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On paper the issue is a fight over what to do with an industrial section of 
downtown San Diego called Centre City East, a jumble of warehouses, vacant 
lots, bus and trolley yards, and aging businesses with fences topped by barbed 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fight could just as well be called a struggle for the soul of 
California's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side is Roman Catholic Msgr. Joseph Carroll, the cherubic "Father Joe" 
who has cajoled and politicked his way to local fame and national acclaim as 
the head of the St. Vincent de Paul Village for the Homeless, which has 270 
employees and an annual budget of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From a complex of buildings in Centre City East, St. Vincent's dispenses food, 
shelter, clothing, child care, medical care and rehabilitation services to the 
homeless, the addicted and the desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the Centre City East dispute is Councilman Juan Vargas, 
who studied to be a priest before leaving the Jesuits to get married and attend 
Harvard Law School. As a Jesuit novice, he had worked with the homeless on Skid 
Row in Los Angeles and at a soup kitchen in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk in political circles is that the engaging, media-friendly Vargas, a 
moderate Democrat elected to the City Council two years ago, may be on the fast 
track to higher office. Right now, though, the track has led to an angry 
collision with Father Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll wants St. Vincent's to grow in scope and size, to serve more meals and 
more people. He sees only good: that St. Vincent's serves not only the homeless 
but also the low-income residents of the heavily Latino neighborhoods just east 
of Centre City East. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas wants St. Vincent's to shrink, to stop feeding street denizens who are 
high on booze or drugs. Attracting the homeless and shiftless with free food is 
only enabling them to wallow in their addiction, he argues, as well as hurting 
the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas believes that St. Vincent's is a roadblock to San Diego realizing its 
dream of building a downtown sports arena and attracting a professional 
basketball or hockey team. The council's preferred site for an arena is a block 
from St. Vincent's, which Carroll says is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute includes clashes of politics, social welfare and theology. Each 
combatant believes he is acting as Christ would if he were trying to solve the 
problem of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone was on drugs or alcohol and killing themselves or others, I don't 
think Christ would say, 'That's interesting, now here's some free food,' " 
Vargas said. "He would say, 'Wait a minute, you have a sin, and your sin is 
addiction, and I'm not going to let you continue in your addiction.' God was 
tough like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those being fed free at St. Vincent's get $291 a month from the 
General Relief welfare program and use it to buy drugs or alcohol, Vargas 
asserts. Take away the free food, he reasons, and they will "hit rock bottom" 
and be forced into changing their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, who has been lauded by the United Nations and the Bush and Clinton 
administrations, calls Vargas' notion flawed social theory and flawed 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Carroll said mockingly, "I remember there were 5,000 people with 
nothing to eat and Christ fed them, and he didn't require drug testing. Was he 
being an enabler? Christ offered opportunities and so do I. He even chose 12 
guys and one failed him, but he still gave them a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 That Vargas studied to be a Jesuit does not impress Carroll. "A lot of people 
spend time in the seminary," he said. "It doesn't mean they get anything out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fight between the priest and the ex-novice has been topic No. 1 on the 
local political agenda for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the anger aimed at Carroll has come from neighborhood and Latino 
activists, who have long complained about the impact of St. Vincent's and other 
social service agencies in Centre City East, including the Salvation Army, the 
San Diego Rescue Mission, a detoxification center, and a day center for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll's donors have also been targeted for criticism. Among the financial 
angels of St. Vincent's have been McDonald's owner and former Padres baseball 
team owner Joan Kroc, the late shopping center magnate Ernie Hahn, BMW-Honda 
dealer Bill Hoehn and developer Douglas Manchester, as well as IBM, Bank of 
America, Chevron, Cox Cable and San Diego Gas & Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 "These well-heeled folks come down here and give to Father Joe and feel real 
good about it," said activist Al Ducheny, who is married to Assemblywoman 
Denise Ducheny (D-San Diego). "They don't care if our neighborhoods are 
destroyed by what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even novelist Joseph Wambaugh, who lives in San Diego, offered a pro-Vargas 
view to a newspaper columnist: "Father Joe is a world-class enabler." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll protests that the real magnet drawing the homeless to neighborhoods 
adjoining Centre City East is a welfare office in the middle of Barrio Logan, a 
half-mile from St. Vincent's. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vincent's had asked to have the office put at St. Vincent's but the idea 
was rejected by the county government, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Municipal Judge Robert C. Coates, author of the book "A Street Is 
Not a Home -- Solving America's Homeless Dilemma," said San Diego should "give 
prayerful thanks" that it has Father Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Vargas mentions Jesus Christ, I would remind him of the tale of the 
good Samaritan," Coates said. "The good Samaritan diagnosed the evil and 
provided an interim solution. I ask rhetorically, where is Mr. Vargas' solution 
and where has he taken us?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Golding, who has been a longtime supporter of St. Vincent's but 
recently has sided with Vargas in his concern about problems in adjoining 
neighborhoods, plans to bring Carroll and Vargas together and urge them to drop 
their feud and start talking again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we ought to do is make this a theological discussion," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who, at 33, retains a boyish exuberance and loves to drive around his 
blue-collar district in his souped-up 1965 Mustang, admits to a certain 
ambivalence in picking a political fight with a revered figure like Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels strange for a devout Catholic like me to oppose Father Joe," he 
said. "Even my mother is upset with me. Some of my friends ask me what I'm 
going to do next -- criticize Mother Teresa?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, 53, who came to St. Vincent's in 1982, was particularly annoyed when 
Vargas was quoted as saying he opposed public funding for St. Vincent's because 
Carroll can always get all the money he needs from Kroc. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy hit the boiling point in August when the council adopted a 
plan for Centre City East that would, if enforced, prohibit St. Vincent's or 
any other social service agency from providing meals to anyone except people 
who are housed on their premises. Carroll vows he will defy any such 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vincent's has beds for 850 people, but serves meals to another 600 to 800 
"non-guests" a day. Many of those sleep on downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of homeless people -- often scruffy and dirty -- are seen daily 
in the blocks around St. Vincent's. The nub of the argument is whether they 
would be there if St. Vincent's was restricted to feeding only full-time 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep doing what we're doing, we're only going to create a homeless 
ghetto," Vargas said. "Father Joe believes the more the merrier, but he doesn't 
seem to realize that real neighborhoods, with real children and real people who 
worry about their safety, live right next to his homeless village." 
</P>
<P>
 The free food, Carroll says, is the way to entice the homeless or the addicted 
to volunteer for rehabilitation classes, job training or substance-abuse 
counseling. "I can't drag you in for rehabilitation, I have to invite you," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of Carroll leading a recall drive against Vargas has cooled. Not so the 
distress Carroll feels over what he says is a neglect of the homeless by Vargas 
and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not solving city problems," Carroll said. "They're all running for 
election, and I think that's dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas sees it differently: "I like Father Joe personally. But on this matter, 
he's wrong."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A SLOW DANCE WHERE STRATEGY CALLS THE TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's as predictable as autumn brush fires and falling leaves. If it's late 
September and it's an election year, there are candidates doing the debate 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an underdog desperately pursuing a front-runner, who's playing it coy. 
Let's debate , pleads the underdog. I'm not ready , says the front-runner. The 
news media provide the music, and the host gets nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 For most people watching, this isn't at all interesting. But the dancers and 
the host become agitated. And this fall they seem unusually agitated; also 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to let him squirrel out of this one," vows a spokesman for 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. "(We'll) ferret out the governor. . . . Flush 
him out of his hole." Another spokesman puts on a chicken suit and pickets the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic gubernatorial candidate -- who still hasn't defined herself to 
millions of voters -- buys TV time for an ad showing a live weasel. "Pop Goes 
the Weasel" plays in the background. It's supposed to symbolize Gov. Pete 
Wilson weaseling out of debates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is straight out of Political Strategy 1A and every voter is very familiar 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has overtaken Brown in the polls and the new underdog is eager for 
debates to reverse the front-runner's momentum. Wilson would accept one or two 
debates -- on his terms -- but why risk any more than that when everything is 
going so smoothly? 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was just the opposite during the Democratic primary. Then it was 
front-runner Brown trying to minimize her exposure to TV debates. She 
ultimately did two local debates in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is she pure in a negotiating sense? No," concedes a Brown strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 From a reporter's perspective, the most sensible comment I ever heard on this 
subject came two decades ago from Richard Bergholz, a longtime political writer 
for The Times, now retired. Bergholz sat stoically listening to a campaign aide 
passionately explain how his boss was being victimized by a debate-dodging, 
cowardly opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a debate, we'll cover it," Bergholz finally told the aide. "We 
don't cover debates over debates." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, we do get sucked into it, because the news media thrive on 
confrontation. That doesn't mean the public stays up late waiting to hear 
whether any candidates have set a debate date. 
</P>
<P>
 "One man in California cares about having a debate and that's Vic Biondi," 
says a political consultant who doesn't work for either gubernatorial 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi represents a nervous would-be host, the California Broadcasters Assn., 
which has been trying to organize a Wilson-Brown debate for a statewide TV 
network. Biondi, the CBA director, has been producing debates for years. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a unique debate over a debate because most negotiations have not 
been between the two candidates. They've been between the CBA and the governor. 
And they've been bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown bowed out three weeks ago, announcing she'd accept any debate format. 
Since then, she's relegated herself to ridiculing the governor's demands, 
trying to persuade voters -- with squirrels, ferrets, chickens and weasels -- 
that he's arrogantly ducking her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, Biondi -- a former TV reporter -- decided it was time to force 
radical changes in political debates. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional "Meet the Press" format with a panel of political reporters 
asking questions "only served to slow down" the action, he wrote the 
candidates. Brown agreed and, according to a Wilson staff memo, her negotiators 
"argued that reporters tend to hog the spotlight . . . big egos drive (them) to 
ask hardball questions designed to gain personal attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi proposed a variety of formats, mostly in the Phil Donahue mode. He 
suggested having a moderator and/or live audience ask all questions. Later, he 
unilaterally announced the show would be one-third reporters' questions, 
one-third call-ins and one-third candidates querying each other. Finally, he 
offered to let reporters ask all the questions with the aid of viewer call-ins, 
faxes and e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no time to experiment, Wilson thought. Do it the safe, old-fashioned 
way: reporters -- mutually agreed to by each candidate -- asking questions on 
any subject. Biondi said the time had passed when candidates could dictate 
debate terms. The governor said bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
 So a network of PBS-TV stations is offering a prime-time debate using Wilson's 
format. But now Brown is balking, saying few people watch PBS. Asserts an 
adviser: "If it's a debate in a closet, the answer's no." The underdog will 
debate on PBS only if there's a second debate on commercial TV. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not dancing in sync, and it's ugly.

RABIN, ARAFAT DISCUSS MORE ARAB SELF-RULE IN W. BANK; MIDEAST: GAZA MEETING IS 
CALLED PAIR'S FRIENDLIEST. BUT THEY MAKE NO HEADWAY ON SCHEDULING PALESTINIAN 
ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Sunday discussed extending Palestinian self-rule 
throughout the West Bank, but they set no date for Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are for elections," Rabin told reporters after two hours of talks with 
Arafat and other senior Palestinian officials. "But we have to know what will 
be elected, what will be the spheres of the elected body as well as the 
question of redeployment." 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders held what both sides described as their friendliest meeting 
just three hours after a knife-wielding Palestinian stabbed and seriously 
injured a 17-year-old Jewish settler at the entrance to Neve Dekalim, a Jewish 
settlement 20 miles south of Erez. The Erez checkpoint separates Gaza from 
pre-1967 Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The settler, Yaacov Fisher, was reported in stable condition at a Beersheba 
hospital later in the day. He had moved to the settlement six weeks ago with 
his parents, who wanted to show solidarity with Jewish settlers in Gaza, Israel 
Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker, identified as Mustafa Mohammed Hila, 18, from Khan Yunis, a 
Palestinian village in Gaza, was shot dead by Israeli soldiers guarding the 
settlement. He reportedly had a leaflet of the Islamic movement Hamas in his 
pocket. Hamas later denied that it was involved in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not only a challenge against us or against the Israeli side, this is 
a challenge against the peace process," Arafat told reporters when asked about 
Palestinian attacks on Israelis. "These elements are trying to touch, or harm, 
the peace process. We are completely against it, and we have, we promised his 
excellency (Rabin), to do all our best to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and Arafat agreed to start negotiating in Cairo next Monday the terms 
for West Bank and Gaza Strip elections. Arafat has publicly set Nov. 1 as the 
deadline for holding elections, but both Israeli and Palestinian officials say 
privately that it is unlikely elections will be held this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides remain far apart on their concept of the powers a Palestinian 
body will have in the territories during the interim period of limited 
self-rule before Israel and the Palestinians negotiate the final status of 
territories Israel has occupied since the June, 1967, Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians want to elect a legislative body of more than 100 
parliamentarians with broad responsibilities for making laws in what they hope 
will be the future Palestinian state. The Israelis favor a small executive 
council with limited lawmaking authority. The two sides also differ over how 
Palestinians living in East Jerusalem will participate in elections. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Declaration of Principles signed by the two sides in 
Washington a year ago, Israel must redeploy its troops out of Palestinian 
population centers before elections are held. The question of redeployment is 
considered politically sensitive for Rabin, because he must be able to 
guarantee the security of more than 100,000 Jewish settlers, some of whom live 
inside the Palestinian town of Hebron in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin is known to differ sharply with his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, over 
how quickly to move toward redeployment and elections. Peres favors speeding up 
negotiations with the Palestinians, while Rabin favors a more cautious 
approach, tied to Palestinian success in controlling attacks against Jews by 
Palestinians in Gaza and to the Palestinian Authority's competence in running 
Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, which Israel handed over to the PLO in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not discuss dates," Rabin said in response to reporters' questions 
about when elections will be held. "The date will be decided by the results of 
the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat said he still hopes to hold elections in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem, Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said 
Israel should begin preparing now to withdraw its troops from Palestinian towns 
and villages in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians have accused Rabin of deliberately dragging his feet on 
elections because he is reluctant to pull Israeli troops out of large parts of 
the West Bank. But although Israeli officials say it is unrealistic to hold 
elections in November, they insist that Israel is not interested in delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no interest in putting off the elections," said Environment Minister 
Yossi Sarid, who accompanied Rabin to Sunday's meeting with Arafat. "On the 
contrary, we have an interest in having the elections take place as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarid told Israel Radio that the meeting was the most successful meeting 
between Rabin and Arafat to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat presented Rabin with an antique Torah scroll from Yemen, for which 
Rabin publicly thanked the former guerrilla leader. Rabin told reporters that 
the two agreed to meet again within a month to ensure that progress is being 
made toward elections.

NEWS ANALYSIS; YELTSIN CAN NOW SELL RUSSIA WITH A STRAIGHT FACE; SUMMIT: THE 
KREMLIN LEADER'S MEETING WITH CLINTON WILL BE THEIR FIFTH. BUT THIS TIME, HE 
ARRIVES KNOWING HE HAS RESTORED SOME STABILITY AT HOME. 
</P>

<P>
 Watch Boris Yeltsin's barrel chest as the Russian leader meets President 
Clinton for their fifth summit Tuesday. If it is thrust especially proudly, if 
his labored imitation of an American smile is especially wide, if his 
performance in the now-familiar Bill-and-Boris Show looks more relaxed than 
ever, there will be reason. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in his three years as president of Russia, Yeltsin can face 
his American counterpart buoyed by the best kind of success at home: not just 
his slaying of the Communist dragon, not the bitter victory that came of 
turning tanks on his own Parliament last October, but the most Herculean 
achievement of all -- taking Russia from turmoil to stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see now that Yeltsin is in full control," Sergei Chugayev, political 
commentator for the Izvestia newspaper, wrote last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Full control" is going a bit far. After all, Russia is still being bled by 
gangsters and corrupt bureaucrats, and the best that can be said of its economy 
is that the long slump appears to have bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as this summit rolls around, Yeltsin comes to Washington able to sell 
American investors on Russia with a straight face. Russian officials have even 
begun to boast of an imminent investment boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The era of aid is over," said Alexander Livshitz, Yeltsin's top economic 
adviser. Russia no longer needs handouts, he said, now that it can offer "what 
it couldn't in past years -- I mean political stability and a half-year of 
moderate inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton-Yeltsin summit agenda includes talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and global peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin will warm up to those themes in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly 
today, spelling out Russia's evolving post-Cold War foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But his prime objective this trip is to court American capitalists. He will 
meet this morning with business leaders in New York, and for the first time, 
four captains of American industry have been invited to join part of a summit 
in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Yeltsin are dozens of hopeful suitors for American capital, from 
the head of the beleaguered ZIL auto maker to the creators of the world's 
largest cargo plane. 
</P>
<P>
 After he meets with Clinton on Tuesday and Wednesday, Yeltsin will spend his 
summit "free day" in Seattle, where he will bestow his presence on Boeing Co., 
which has been actively developing ventures in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's pitch to American business includes: inflation chopped from double 
digits to 5% or so per month; a crop of privatized factories willing to sell 
large chunks of themselves to foreign owners, and new or planned decrees 
offering tax breaks and investment guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case stability doesn't work as a sales pitch, Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev reverted last week to an old scare tactic. He reminded 
readers of the Kommersant Daily newspaper that if Russia's economic development 
is stymied, the government could be taken over by extremists -- and "after 
that, we could simply forget any discussion about partnership with the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Economics aside, the long-touted Russian-American partnership in politics is 
likely to be tested gently this week as the two countries work out their 
post-Cold War strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, for example, hope to air their deep concerns about Russia's 
control of its nuclear arsenal -- from its highly publicized leaks of 
black-market plutonium to its inability to meet treaty schedules for destroying 
its missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat and chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that Russian control over 
nuclear weapons remains "the most important challenge we have in national 
security for the next 10 or 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The two presidents are expected to sign a technical agreement that will 
include unprecedented U.S.-Russian exchanges of information on the nuclear 
materials they have in their stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they will also push plans for a $75-million nuclear 
warehouse and a $30-million computerized system to track Russian nuclear 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear smuggling, however, is a ticklish issue for the Russians; many in 
Moscow suspect that the United States is blowing the danger out of proportion 
to gain access to Moscow's nuclear secrets and direct control of its arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 But there appears to be little controversy over the proposed agreement, and 
Clinton's reported plan to offer more American money for Russian 
missile-dismantling is sure to go over well with the needy Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 No new arms control initiatives are expected. Both countries say they are 
content for now to coordinate unilateral moves without nailing them down with 
treaties, as they did in January when they stopped aiming their missiles at 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 If any discussion is likely to grow heated, it could be the talks on Bosnia. 
Yeltsin, like his French and British counterparts, opposes Clinton's plan to 
seek a lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims if Bosnian Serbs 
do not accept an international peace plan by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The two presidents could also find the going rocky as they discuss their 
countries' overall missions in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow is seeking recognition that it retains a "sphere of influence" in most 
of the former Soviet empire, where it wants to be the policeman-of-record and 
enjoy some latitude in protecting the 25 million Russians who ended up living 
"abroad" when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they do not recognize such a Russian "sphere of influence." 
In turn, they assert that Moscow must accept an inevitable eastward expansion 
of NATO to embrace Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as full members. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, with a wave of born-again ultranationalists at his back, cannot give 
in easily to the spread of the Kremlin's old adversary. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the trust and friendship that have grown between the new Russia 
and the United States are looking solid enough that even such clashes come with 
a clink and not a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin have become such comfortable buddies that Yeltsin will 
even stay in Blair House, the official U.S. guest house, rather than at the 
Russian Embassy -- a first for a Kremlin leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Kortunov, a top Russian foreign policy analyst who helped prepare 
Yeltsin's U.N. address, may have summed up the feel-good, easygoing atmosphere 
of this summit best when he allowed his description of foreign policy 
differences to drift off into open boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin wants to show, he said, that "Russia will have its own foreign and 
defense policy independent of the West and . . . but at the same time that does 
not necessarily mean that Russia is turning its back on the West and, you know, 
blah, blah, blah. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian media have written almost nothing on this upcoming summit -- in 
contrast to the pre-Yeltsin era, when the meeting would have dominated every 
front page and broadcast for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a giant positive change behind this indifference," a commentary in 
Izvestia said recently. "The summits no longer decide matters of peace and war, 
life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg reported from Washington and Boudreaux from Moscow. Times staff 
writer Doyle McManus also contributed to this report.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; THREATS OF VENGEANCE SIMMER BENEATH THIN VENEER OF

 As hundreds of Haitians gathered to grin, cheer and wave the leafy branches 
that are a symbol here of rebirth, Army Staff Sgt. Richard Hahn knelt Sunday in 
a soccer field just outside the center of the capital and breathed a sigh of 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The first street patrol of his 10th Mountain Division's Bravo Company -- part 
of a show of U.S. force in the air and on the streets in the aftermath of 
Saturday night's shootout in the northern port town of Cap Haitien -- had come 
off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got the word last night about what happened up in Cap Haitien, I 
thought: 'Whoo, here we go again. This could get bad,' " Hahn said, referring 
to the Saturday night incident in which 10 Haitians identified by U.S. 
officials as police were killed by Marines in a town where Haitian security 
forces then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, who served in the U.S. intervention in Somalia, said he and his company 
had learned a critical lesson in their 4 1/2-month tour in the anarchy and 
destruction of Mogadishu, the urban nightmare where America's last military 
adventure abroad turned against it almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad all these people are friendly," he said. "But we're always conscious 
of the crowd around us now. And we always expect it could change any moment." 
</P>
<P>
 All around him, this city was showing the seeds of change. And the scenes that 
played out in several neighborhoods Sunday underscored just how fragile the 
U.S. military toehold is here and how thin is the veneer of order in a capital 
where chaos could be just another firefight away: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the city's worst slum, Cite Soleil, there was another slaying overnight. 
A 40-year-old stove maker and father of 20 was found dead in the mud with 
gunshot wounds. As dozens of relatives grieved, no police showed up to 
investigate. A local radio station reported that the dead man had taken part in 
Saturday's pro-Aristide demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the markets, the price of weapons jumped Sunday. Fueled by increased 
demand and shrinking supply, an Israeli-made Galil was $2,500, an Uzi 
submachine gun, $1,500, and grenades were $100. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just two miles from where Bravo Company patrolled, thousands of residents of 
the Carrefour slum were celebrating their attack on Thelus Jean Erby, a Haitian 
police officer, the night before. Their only regret: He was still alive. The 
mob had surrounded his small neighborhood police post and chased him through 
the mud, straw and cinder-block huts of their slum until he threw himself into 
a cesspool to escape their wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three hours for several dozen police and firefighters to rescue Erby, 
who was taken to the Military Hospital, where doctors said he was recovering 
from trauma Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with several residents, it was clear that Erby is lucky to be 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we would have killed him, if we caught him," said the shirtless 
proprietor of a tiny grocery shack. "He's a bad man. He has killed people here 
and extorted money from us for a long time. It is time now that he gets what he 
is due." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carrefour residents said their fury bubbled over after three years of 
repression. They also were clearly emboldened by the U.S. military presence 
here. The U.S. troops now have permission to use force, if necessary, to check 
brutality by Haiti's police and army in the weeks before the junta steps down, 
by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "This policeman tried to set fire to my house, even as he fled," asserted Fifi 
Roche, explaining that Erby broke down the wall of her shack when he tried to 
hide there from the mob at one point. "I would have chased him too, but I was 
afraid for my seven children. He had a machete and threatened us." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame he got away," added one of her neighbors. "He should be dead, 
along with the other so-called 'policemen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hill from that slum, in Haiti's colonial-style military headquarters 
downtown, there was a different spin on the day's events. The lieutenants, 
sergeants and corporals there reacted with outrage and fear to the increasingly 
real prospect that they may be subjected to popular revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tide of power turns so quickly against them with the arrival of U.S. 
troops -- whose principal mission is to reinstate the exiled president whom 
many of those officers helped overthrow in 1991 -- the Haitian military 
personnel stressed that the threat of anarchy is inseparable now from that of 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Destroy us, and you destroy the last institution still standing here," one 
low-ranking officer said in perfect English. "What you saw with this one 
policeman who was chased into the open sewers is just the beginning. I just 
don't think the Americans know what they're dealing with here right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Romuald Jean, deputy news editor of what is left of Haiti's 
national state-run television station. He sat drinking a beer Sunday morning in 
an otherwise abandoned newsroom and said that he too believes that the mob 
chase was a foreshadowing of bloodletting to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, yes, yes, there will be a lot of revenge now," he said with a knowing 
stoicism. "People are afraid, yes -- the people who have reason to fear and 
even some who don't. When the Haitian police are gone, when the army is gone, 
only the American troops will be left. And what will happen then? I don't know, 
and maybe they don't either." 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that viewers will get their news from Jean's Haitian Television 
Network, something of a symbol of the nation's many faded institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many military regimes, the Haitian junta has stationed no guards around 
this country's only television station, which rarely is on the air. It usually 
broadcasts only soccer matches, and Jean said he is unsure just when his next 
newscast will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter," another station employee said. "Nobody watches it 
anyway anymore."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; WEALTHY HAITIANS SEE CHANCE FOR PROFIT IN U.S. 
OCCUPATION; TRADE: RISING NUMBER TRAVELING TO DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ON WAY TO 
AMERICAN SHOPPING SPREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the border crossing out of isolated, sanctions-bound Haiti opened to 
Richard Elie this weekend for the first time in months, the well-off Haitian 
American decided to go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Big time. 
</P>
<P>
 His list included dozens of high-priced items -- from spare parts to high-tech 
goods -- that have been banned from Haiti during its three years under economic 
sanctions. And the shopping trip that would begin at the international airport 
in the Dominican Republic, just a few hours beyond this remote border town, 
ultimately will take him through New York, Miami and other cities that became 
his second homes during his 20 years in the United States, Elie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back in 20 days," he said, referring to the day after deposed Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is due back from exile with thousands of U.S. 
troops as his bodyguards. "And I'll make some profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Elie dislikes Aristide. Never mind that he distrusts the 
Americans now occupying his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, what matters most is profit -- a lot of profit, it would seem, 
judging by the dozens of Haitians with ties to the United States who have been 
streaming out of the country bound for similar shopping sprees since the U.S. 
military landed here a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they crossed from the squalid immigration post on the frontier of 
impoverished Haiti into the relative modernity of the Dominican Republic, Elie 
and other Haitians with the means to do so took note of one of the stark, 
enduring symbols of their nation's isolation and its ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Across a narrow neck of the lake that straddles the Haitian-Dominican border 
here, a small armada of ancient rowboats shuttled gasoline from one side to the 
other -- continuing to break the international embargo with plastic jugs, 
fueling a black market that has helped enrich the tiny Haitian upper class. 
</P>
<P>
 And Elie was evidence that, under a U.S. occupation intended to help Haiti's 
poor, the rich are likely to grow even richer. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the scene at the rugged Haitian border town of Malpasse, which means 
"the bad passage," was rife with other bitter ironies, contradictions and ill 
omens of an American military intervention with an increasingly vague mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Few personified them as clearly as Elie, a jet mechanic for American Airlines 
who left the United States for a job in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, 
shortly before the United Nations tightened the embargo and shut down the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Elie, who acknowledged that his comparative wealth will probably mushroom, 
stressed that the expected lifting of the embargo after Aristide returns is the 
only benefit he sees in the U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love them," Elie, 35, said of the Haitian military rulers the U.S. 
government is forcing from power. "Look, I was getting ready to fight against 
the Americans. If the Americans invaded Haiti, and our (military-installed) 
president asked us to, I would go out and kill Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived 20 years in America. But I was born in Haiti. I will remain Haitian. 
And I think the U.S. government is all screwed up here. What are they doing 
here? Restoring democracy? Where? There's never been democracy in Haiti, from 
the first president until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Elie had equally firm opinions of the man the Clinton Administration has vowed 
to restore to power, a Roman Catholic priest and champion of the Haitian poor 
who was overthrown by the ruling military junta three years ago, just seven 
months after becoming president after a free election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide is not a democrat," Elie said as he waited at the border post while 
a rickety rowboat brought a tankful of gasoline for his motorcycle. "He's never 
even been for the United States. You should hear his speeches from before (his 
ouster in the 1991 coup). I'm a much better friend of the United States than he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 But like most of Haiti's rich minority, Elie conceded that Aristide is 
enormously popular among the country's poor majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you talk to the masses of people right now, they still love Aristide, and 
they love the Americans for now," he said. "They have the right to believe in 
that. They've been stepped on hard for three years by the military. But they 
shouldn't take revenge. And that's our biggest fear right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice is not judgment, and judgment is what I fear the people have in mind. 
I'm afraid Aristide is coming back for the judgment day, and that, my friend, 
is how civil wars begin." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet Elie and several other businessmen interviewed at the Haitian border 
checkpoint agreed that their fears of future vengeance are offset by their 
forays for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't care if I make money off the American intervention," Elie said. 
"I don't see hypocrisy in that. If the American presence brings us good money, 
fine. We can use the money to kick the Americans out later. This massive force, 
this massive domination -- I feel totally dominated now. Sooner or later, I 
believe the people are going to revolt against it with a fire of rage." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's killing of 10 Haitians by U.S. Marines responding to shooting 
in the northern city of Cap Haitien was just the sort of fuel Elie said will 
feed that fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, though, Elie was surrounded by symbols of the enduring Haitian 
military repression, corruption and, in his words, "the ways everybody is 
filling their pocket at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian entry visas, free until very recently, were going for $55, much of it 
destined for the pockets of the Haitian officers who still control the border 
crossings. Without entry authorization forms from the military government, 
others have paid as much as $1,500 to the border guards to look the other way 
as they crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers appeared above the corruption, although resigned to an imminent 
civilian future. One Haitian sergeant insisted on doing everything by the book, 
carefully recording the passport numbers of everyone entering and leaving 
Haiti. He did his work slowly but without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 He has long since grown accustomed to the contradictions, he said. During his 
decade in the Haitian army, he said, he was trained in U.S. military camps, 
perhaps by some of the same American officers now occupying his country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all just politics," he said. "I don't care much for politics. Today 
I'm a soldier. Tomorrow, who knows? Maybe I'll be free. Maybe I'll be poor. 
Maybe I won't be here at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Fastened to the wall of the immigration bunker nearby was an appropriate 
epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 The marble dedication stone was dated March, 1977. It acknowledged Philippe 
Biamby -- one of the three leaders the Americans are forcing from power -- as 
minister of defense and interior. Above his name, though, were only the 
faintest traces of the man who had dedicated the building as "president of the 
republic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bashed out with chisels was the name Jean-Claude Duvalier, forced into exile 
in France in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Elie laughed when he saw the dedication stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, Biamby's name is still there," he said. "He's still in power today. But 
they'll just chisel him out too in a few weeks when he's gone. That's just the 
way it's done down here."

ESPY TO BE HELD TO HIGHER STANDARD; PROBE: INDEPENDENT COUNSEL BELIEVES MEAT 
ACT'S POSITION ON GRATUITIES 'REACHES THE SECRETARY.' BUT HE SAYS HE'LL WEIGH 
ALL FACTORS, AND THAT A 'FAIR SHAKE' IS DESERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the outset of an investigation of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, 
independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz has decided that the law requires him to 
hold Espy to a higher standard of conduct than normally applies to Cabinet 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, a Los Angeles attorney who was appointed by the federal courts on 
Sept. 9 to investigate Espy's acceptance of sports tickets, travel and hotel 
accommodations from several companies, said in an interview with The Times that 
he does not accept Espy's contention that he is not subject to the unusually 
strict law that prohibits the acceptance of any gratuities by Agriculture 
Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy and his lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten of Washington, have argued that the 
standards imposed on Agriculture Department employees under the 1907 Meat 
Inspection Act should not apply to the secretary because Congress intended the 
law strictly to deal with bribery of meat inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted in the wake of Upton Sinclair's book exposing the meatpacking 
industry, "The Jungle," the Meat Inspection Act states that Agriculture 
Department employees with jurisdiction over meat inspections must not accept 
any favor or benefit from regulated companies. It imposes a higher standard 
than the general gratuity statute that applies to all executive branch 
officials, which requires proof that the gift was given as a bribe in exchange 
for official acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, who was interviewed in his downtown Los Angeles office after he spent 
last week in Washington making preparations to launch his investigation of 
Espy, said he recognizes that the Meat Act's standards of conduct for public 
officials are "the broadest criminal statute that I've ever come across." But 
he added that there is no doubt in his mind that the law's prohibition against 
gratuities "reaches the secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Smaltz's interpretation of the law is clearly a setback for Espy's 
defense, the independent counsel cautioned that it does not necessarily mean 
that Espy's acceptance of favors from agribusiness firms will result in an 
indictment. He said he will also weigh other factors, including the size of the 
gratuities and whether they occurred as a result of "ignorance or a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary deserves a fair shake in this investigation," Smaltz 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether the Meat Act applies to Espy's behavior has already been 
hotly debated within the Administration itself. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials who conducted a preliminary review of the case concluded that 
Espy's conduct potentially violated the Meat Inspection Act, but some Justice 
Department officials resisted appointing an independent counsel on grounds that 
Espy was subject only to the less stringent gratuity restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In her request to the courts for the appointment of an independent counsel, 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno indicated that she disagreed with those in her department 
who would exempt Espy from the strict provisions of the Meat Inspection Act. 
She said the law clearly prohibits "any Department of Agriculture employee . . 
. from accepting any gift from any person engaged in commerce, without regard 
to the intent of the donor or the donee." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno noted that according to a memorandum of understanding negotiated between 
the Justice and Agriculture departments in 1976, the Meat Inspection Act 
provisions do not apply to gifts of a trivial nature or those motivated by 
personal or family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "However," she said, "the acceptance of non-trivial gifts of entertainment, 
transportation, lodging and meals by a Department of Agriculture official who 
has responsibilities under the Meat Inspection Act from an entity that is 
subject to regulation by the Department of Agriculture falls within the purview 
of the statute." 
</P>
<P>
 Weingarten, Espy's lawyer, acknowledged in a recent interview that even though 
the stricter provisions appear to apply to Espy "at first blush," no previous 
secretary of agriculture has ever been prosecuted under this part of the Meat 
Inspection Act. In fact, he said, the law has never been used to prosecute 
anyone in the Agriculture Department higher than the rank of meat inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, even if the Meat Inspection Act is eventually deemed to apply to 
the actions of the secretary, Weingarten said, it should only apply to his 
dealings with companies regulated by the act -- not to every company that comes 
under the purview of the Agriculture Department, as Reno's statement implies. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy has been accused of accepting sports tickets, transportation, meals and 
hotel accommodations from agribusiness companies, including some regulated by 
the Meat Act, such as Tyson Foods Inc. of Arkansas, and some that do not 
involve meat products, such as Quaker Oats of Missouri and Sun Diamond of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said his charter requires him to conduct a sweeping investigation into 
these and any other potentially criminal matters that may arise during his 
probe. Noting that most of the allegations against Espy were uncovered 
initially by the news media, he indicated that he intends to look into every 
matter raised in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Smaltz intend to limit his investigation to Espy's activities alone. 
He indicated that the probe will include the activities of other Agriculture 
Department employees, such as former Chief of Staff Ronald Blackley and perhaps 
even Espy's close friends, including Richard Douglas, senior vice president of 
Sun Diamond, and Michael O'Bannon, a consultant with frequent business at the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, while Blackley was serving as Espy's chief of staff, he 
allegedly ordered the Agriculture Department to stop work on proposed tougher 
inspection standards for poultry producers, including Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, whose company is regulated by the Agriculture Department, was co-host 
of a lavish birthday party given in Espy's honor after he became agriculture 
secretary. O'Bannon's firm employs a girlfriend of Espy's, Patricia Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said he intends to explore the legal issue of whether favors accepted 
by Dempsey from agribusiness lobbyists could be construed as indirect gifts to 
Espy under the meaning of the Meat Inspection Act and the general gratuity 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Espy's recent decision to repay some companies and the government 
for benefits he has received, Smaltz replied: "If criminal conduct had 
occurred, repayment isn't a defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said he has hired the first of several attorneys to aid in the 
investigation, which he believes will last longer than six months.

REPORT ASSAILS NATION'S JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most juvenile offenders are being held in crowded, substandard facilities that 
lack anti-suicide policies and adequate health screening, says a Justice 
Department report released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings should be a wake-up call for anyone in this country who takes a 
serious interest in youth issues," said John J. Wilson, acting administrator of 
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey covered 984 detention centers, training schools, ranches, farms and 
camps holding 65,000 juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that only 20% to 26% had adequate bed space, health care, security or 
suicide control. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 juveniles committed 18,000 acts of attempted suicide, 
suicidal gestures or self-mutilation, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the facilities exceeded their design capacity, and only 24% of 
detained youths were in places that met all living space standards. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 24,000 attacks by juveniles on other inmates each year and nearly 
8,000 attacks on staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 On health issues, the report found one-third of detained juveniles are 
examined by staffers who have not been trained to perform health screenings.

CLINTON URGES U.N. TO HALT SERB MOVES ON MUSLIMS; BALKANS: HE MEETS WITH 
SECRETARY GENERAL TO PRESS FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROTECTED AREAS IN 
BOSNIA. EUROPEAN ALLIES NOT LIKELY TO GO ALONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton urged U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Sunday 
to step up protection of the exclusion zones in Bosnia that the United Nations 
has sought to shield with NATO warplanes from Bosnian Serb attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in one of a series of meetings before his address this morning to the 
U.N. General Assembly, made "a very strong statement" to Boutros-Ghali about 
the need to halt increasing encroachment, a senior Administration official 
said. "We want the exclusion zones enforced properly." 
</P>
<P>
 The zones were set up around Gorazde and Sarajevo to protect large Bosnian 
Muslim populations from advancing Serbian troops. But they have come under 
intermittent shelling from Serb positions, as well as sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Serb forces have cut off gas, electricity and water coming into 
Sarajevo, and are disrupting the flow of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with Boutros-Ghali came as Clinton wrapped up a four-day 
fund-raising tour through Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City and New York. The 
President shifted to diplomacy Sunday afternoon, meeting separately with 
Boutros-Ghali and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's U.N. appeal is likely to put him at odds with French and British 
allies, who have been far less eager to use allied warplanes to protect the 
Bosnian exclusion zones. That reluctance is due in large part to the presence 
of French and British peacekeeping troops, who might be casualties if the Serbs 
return fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also hinted that the U.S. and Bosnian officials might be rethinking 
proposals to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian government if the Bosnian 
Serbs do not agree to a plan for partition of Bosnia by an Oct. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said that in the Sunday afternoon meeting with Izetbegovic, the 
two men discussed the problems that could arise from an abrupt lifting of the 
embargo. The Bosnians worry that such quick action could trigger Serb assaults 
on more weakly protected Bosnian communities on the east side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also discussed a Bosnian proposal to set up a five-kilometer 
"demilitarized zone" around Sarajevo. Such a zone could allow a reopening of 
roads, and, by barring even small arms, could ease Sarajevo's threat of sniper 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, Clinton warned from a Harlem pulpit that his party's 
adversaries are poised to confuse the Democratic faithful into voting against 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at Bethel A.M.E. Church, Clinton said the opposition's efforts to 
deny his achievements mean that "the people may actually go out and vote for 
the very things they are against because they don't know what's happened in the 
last 20 months" of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearance at the African American church, Clinton offered the most 
complete version yet of his election-year speech, which he hopes will persuade 
voters not to chip away Democratic membership in Congress. He said he was being 
blamed for problems that took decades to accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an election in which there are 30 years of social problems, 20 years 
of economic problems and 12 years of politicians bad-mouthing the government," 
Clinton said. In an aside that seemed aimed at Republicans and the news media, 
he said voters "cannot know" of his accomplishments because there's no way for 
them to get the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding somewhat plaintive, he added: "I have been President for 20 months, 
not 30 years, not 20 years, not 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The service brought out some of New York's most prominent Democrats, including 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said in his sermon that Cuomo, who faces an uphill fight for his 
fourth gubernatorial term, is "the heart you must not lose." And Cuomo returned 
the compliment, calling the President "a great leader who is bringing us toward 
very great good, and who has realized some of it already. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke warmly of the U.S. occupation of Haiti, not mentioning a 
firefight Saturday evening that left 10 Haitians dead and the city of Cap 
Haitien with no apparent local police authorities. Clinton said he believes 
"more and more Americans are seeing what we are doing there is good." 
</P>
<P>
 He also took part in a fund-raising reception and luncheon for Democratic 
congressional candidates that raised $350,000 from 5,000 donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Sunday, Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said on ABC-TV's 
"This Week With David Brinkley" that his own polling indicated that GOP 
candidates also have reason to avoid stressing party identification in their 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Luntz said his polling suggests that "there's an awful lot of disappointment, 
that both political parties have got few strengths and an awful lot of 
weaknesses."

DEA DETAILS CALI CARTEL'S COCAINE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK; NARCOTICS: PROBE 
REVEALS THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE GROUP'S METHODS OF TRANSPORTING THE DRUG. 
OVER TWO YEARS, CHARGES ARE BROUGHT AGAINST 166.

 Drug Enforcement Administration officials partially lifted the veil Sunday 
from a two-year investigation into the ways the Cali cartel is moving large 
amounts of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico and Los Angeles to distribution 
points throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation culminated in narcotics charges being unsealed Friday in 
federal court in Los Angeles against two Colombians who allegedly served as 
transportation cell directors for the cartel, the organization based in Cali, 
Colombia, responsible for most of the cocaine distributed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Related charges are expected to be brought against others today in San 
Francisco, Houston and New Orleans. Over the two years, the investigation has 
resulted in the arrest of 166 alleged members of the distribution network and 
the seizure of more than six tons of cocaine and $13 million in U.S. currency, 
DEA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than these usual benchmarks of anti-narcotics operations, the DEA 
regards the probe as important because of what it reveals about the 
sophistication and flexibility of the Cali cartel's methods of distributing its 
illicit product. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unequivocally clear that the cartels control every aspect of the 
cocaine trade, from the amount of cocaine to be shipped on consignment, right 
down to the markings on each package," said DEA Administrator Thomas 
Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be the traffickers' sense of humor, some of the cocaine packages 
seized during the probe were stamped "Clinton," while others bore a scorpion 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Following instructions from Colombia, some cocaine packages were covered with 
grease and then coffee because of the mistaken belief, one DEA official noted 
with a smile, that this would prevent dogs from detecting the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the investigation, the traffickers used commercial and 
private planes, trucks, cars and boats to smuggle drugs to and across the 
United States. They operate in a highly "compartmentalized" way so that those 
arrested did not know the names of those higher up the chain of command and 
thus "couldn't give up the whole organization" in bargaining a deal for 
themselves, said William Mockler, chief of DEA's major investigation section. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Medellin Cartel was never as compartmentalized," Mockler said of Cali's 
more violent predecessor in the Colombian cocaine network. Instead of 
restricting cocaine shipments to those already consigned for, which is the 
practice of the Cali organization, Medellin often would send a 500-kilogram 
load of cocaine by air to New York and then look for customers on a 
cash-and-carry basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing the case, officials revealed some techniques they are using 
against the cartel, notably heavy reliance on electronic surveillance, 
particularly of cellular phones, and training state highway patrol officers to 
recognize the profiles of likely drug movers. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the probe did not always operate smoothly. In early 1993, for 
example, DEA agents were forced to arrest prematurely a major suspect in the 
distribution network, Harold Luis Gresci, because he realized the agents had 
him under surveillance. He led them down a dead-end New Jersey street and then 
confronted them, demanding to know why they were following him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'We're just out here in the neighborhood. We're not following 
you,' but he didn't buy it," a DEA supervisor recalled. "He was intercepted on 
a cellular phone he carried," allegedly instructing subordinates to "shut 
everything down." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take him, because we didn't want him out of the U.S., where he 
wouldn't answer to the justice system," the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these are a dead-end. You take down a cell or a couple of cells, and 
you're usually not going to find where it picks back up." But this time, the 
DEA managed to continue listening to Cali distributors as they turned from 
moving cocaine through Houston, after some major shipments were seized, to 
stockpiling it in Mexico and shipping it through Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmer Herrera-Buitrago, accused of being the Cali boss in charge of U.S. 
distribution, allegedly set up two parallel distribution networks in Los 
Angeles. DEA officials alleged that one was headed by Diego Fernando Salazar, 
known as Zorro, or the Fox, for whom the investigation was code-named, and the 
other by Ober Arturo Acuna. Both men were charged in the drug indictments 
unsealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the latest charges, authorities arrested Zorro on an immigration 
violation when they overheard him allegedly pleading with his Cali bosses to 
let him return to Colombia. "He was beefing up his war chest and had ordered a 
1995 BMW," a DEA supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA officials have no doubt that the Cali organization will replace the two 
damaged distribution systems, but they believe it will be a costly, 
time-consuming process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you really hurt these people is when you take down their experience," 
the DEA supervisor said. "It's hard to replace them."

FOES OF PROP. 187 TOEING A DIFFICULT LINE; STRATEGY: IN THEIR FIGHT TO MAINTAIN 
IMMIGRANT RIGHTS, SOME OPPONENTS OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE HAVE STEERED AWAY 
FROM THE HIGH-PROFILE USE OF LATINOS. 'WE'RE KEEPING THE BROWN FACES IN THE 
BACKGROUND,' ONE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Asked about the campaign to defeat Proposition 187, one leading Latino 
activist heavily involved in the effort responded, "We're keeping the brown 
faces in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 For many immigrant advocates, the anti-187 strategy has involved a wrenching 
-- and sometimes-controversial -- compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to appeal to the voting majority, anti-187 forces have 
de-emphasized the involvement of Latinos and immigrant-rights representatives 
in the mainstream campaign targeting the hearts and minds of white suburbia. 
Instead, spokesmen such as Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block have taken 
center stage to bolster the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The pragmatic strategy -- which acknowledges illegal immigration as a serious 
problem -- is indicative of how much the public debate has shifted in favor of 
those backing a more restrictionist immigration policy, especially in 
California. The dramatic swing has left immigrant advocates scrambling to 
devise appropriate responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the principal umbrella group spearheading the opposition, 
Taxpayers Against 187, paint near-apocalyptic pictures: youngsters, denied 
education, becoming more susceptible to committing crimes; illegal immigrants 
lacking health care spreading disease throughout the state. The human toll on 
hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants is being framed in relation to its 
impact on the voting public. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates remain active in planning, coordinating, fund-raising, 
voter registration, citizenship sign-up and get-out-the-vote efforts aimed at 
defeating the initiative. But many Latino activists and even lawmakers have 
limited their public responses and appearances to audiences of Latinos or 
liberals, the Spanish-language media and other groups presumably more amenable 
to their message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it can be difficult to hold your tongue," noted a leading Latino 
activist, who, like others, asked to remain anonymous. "But we'd be 
irresponsible not to do it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another: "The fact is, if you go up and you have brown skin on this 
issue, people aren't going to listen to you. . . . They don't look beyond the 
messenger to the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Others question the approach and are devising their own game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of the outcome of 187, we cannot hide," said Jose De Paz, who 
heads the California Immigrant Workers Assn., an activist group linked to 
organized labor. "We're going to have to fight our own battles." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is among those organizing a large anti-187 rally being planned for 
Los Angeles on Oct. 16, barely three weeks before election day. The 
demonstration is a follow-up to the May 28 rally that supporters say drew more 
than 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigrant advocates sought to postpone the march, underlining divisions 
within the advocate ranks. Their fear: A heavily publicized sea of Latino faces 
would only further alienate many undecided or wavering voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we need is a sense that L.A. is truly overrun by all these 
immigrants," complained one activist. "A lot of this is about image." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors plan to go ahead anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Juan Jose Gutierrez, executive director of One Stop Immigration, an 
Eastside social service organization backing the October march: "We don't all 
have to accept a strategy that basically tells us we should sit on the 
sidelines and watch the game from the bench."

1 DEAD, 1 WOUNDED IN CERRITOS SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were searching Sunday for whoever shot 
and killed one man and left a second man to perish in a burning truck in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 The second man, identified as Edward Burton Whitaker, 35, of Norwalk, was shot 
in the head and upper body but survived the attack, said sheriff's spokeswoman 
Deputy Benita Hinojos. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had been called to Norwalk Boulevard and 166th Street at about 
2:30 a.m. by a report of a pickup truck on fire, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 They found a man identified as Gene Kennedy, 35, of Norwalk, dead in the bed 
of the truck. Whitaker, in spite of his wounds, was found walking nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker was taken to a local hospital, where he was in critical condition 
Sunday. Deputies declined to release the name of the hospital for security 
reasons.

SUSPECT HELD IN 6 'COWBOY BANDIT' HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 37-year-old roofer has been arrested in connection with six recent bank 
robberies in which the robber was dubbed the "Cowboy Bandit" after he twice 
wore a cowboy hat and sported a casual, western style, Glendale police 
announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Matthew Sims was taken into custody Saturday after a tipster told 
authorities the suspect resembled the widely broadcast description of the bank 
robber as a slender, blond man in his 30s.The caller said Sims had been working 
on a construction site near Chevy Chase Park in the Atwater Village area of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale investigators set up a surveillance of the area and arrested Sims 
without incident. He was being held in the Glendale city jail in lieu of 
$500,000 bail, Lt. Raymond Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through witnesses and bank surveillance cameras, Sims has so far been 
identified in three of the six holdups that began in August, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt during the crimes, in which the robber pointed a handgun at a 
teller and said, "I want to make a withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a relatively small total was taken in the string of robberies, 
which occurred in northeast Los Angeles as well as Glendale. But "you want to 
get the guy because you figure he has a propensity for violence due to the fact 
that he carries a gun," said Glendale Police Investigator Dennis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said police found evidence that Sims uses cocaine, but did not know 
whether the construction worker -- a father of two whose wife is pregnant -- 
has a drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes began in late August and included two holdups at the Bank of 
America on Colorado Boulevard in Glendale and one at the Great Western Bank on 
North Glendale Avenue in Glendale, Edey said.

2 FROM O.C. HURT IN EMERGENCY PLANE LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A light plane made an emergency landing on a residential street, clipping 
utility wires and a few tall trees before it came to a halt with two injured 
Orange residents inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Reed, a spokesman for the San Mateo County Office of Emergency Services, 
told KCBS radio that it was "a miracle" no one on the ground was injured in 
Sunday's incident in which the plane's windshield and nose were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Mike Regli, 35, and passengers Katherine Cornellier, 30, both of Orange, 
were in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornellier, who suffered a fractured back, was in Mills Memorial Hospital. 
Regli, who also injured his back, was in San Mateo County General hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Burton told the radio station he saw the plane heading south and it was 
about 400 feet in the air. He notice that the engines were off when it passed 
his home about 1:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton said he saw a small fire, but that the fire dissipated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane had departed from the San Carlos airport, but its destination was 
unclear, said Tom Aina, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire department crews were trying to stop the fuel leaking from the plane from 
going into the storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident was under investigation.

DEPUTIES SAY 8 ARRESTED IN POSSIBLE GAY BASHING IN WEST HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight people were arrested Sunday after they allegedly used baseball bats and 
a golf club to assault two men as they walked out of a West Hollywood cafe, a 
sheriff's sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses called authorities shortly after midnight Saturday to report the 
attack, an apparent gay-bashing, in front of a cafe in the 8900 block of Santa 
Monica Boulevard, Sgt. John Baylis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men and five juveniles -- all from the San Fernando Valley -- piled into 
two cars and fled, a witness told sheriff's deputies. The suspects were 
arrested a few minutes later after deputies spotted their vehicles. Baylis said 
two baseball bats and a golf club were found in the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The five juveniles -- whose ages ranged from 15 to 17 -- were released to 
their parents, Baylis said. The adults, Juan Huiza, 19 of North Hills, Marvin 
Henriquez, 20, of Van Nuys, and Guillermo Henriquez, 20, of Panorama City, were 
booked on suspicion of civil rights violations and assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 While witnesses described the attack, the victims had not yet been found, 
Baylis said. "We believe the suspects' actions were a violation of civil 
rights, i.e. gay-bashing," he said.

BUDGET WOES FORCE CLINIC FOR ALCOHOLICS TO CLOSE; HEALTH CARE: THE CLOSURE OF 
THE COUNTY OUTPATIENT CENTER IN COSTA MESA WILL PUT INDIGENT CLIENTS ESPECIALLY 
AT RISK, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency will close its outpatient clinic for 
alcoholics Saturday, a move that could significantly weaken the county's 
ability to provide help to those suffering from alcohol-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure is the latest in a series of setbacks for the county's alcohol 
program due to shrinking budgets. Last year, the neighborhood recovery center 
in San Juan Capistrano shut down, and in July, a Laguna Beach outpatient clinic 
for alcoholics was also forced to close. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron LaPorte, a Health Care Agency division manager, said the loss of the 
Costa Mesa clinic, which serves 130 clients and has become a fixture in that 
community in the past decade, will be the greatest blow so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just tightening our belts at this point," LaPorte said. "This is a 
real cut. This is a real serious loss to our system." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, LaPorte said, the closures have become necessary even though the 
county's overall budget for alcohol programs has more than doubled in the past 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funding, which had increased from 1984 through 1992, was allotted for 
specific groups, such as Latinos, teen-agers and women with dependent children, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a lot of the new money have come requirements for specialized programs 
for specialized populations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, reserves that had helped maintain the basic programs have run 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now having to cut back on our basic service system," LaPorte said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa clinic opened in Newport Beach in the 1970s and relocated to 
its present Red Hill Avenue location in the early '80s, said Sharon 
Granados-Clark, who runs the Costa Mesa and Aliso Viejo clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, recovering alcoholics were able to get individual or group 
counseling two or three times a week along with other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Those clients will now be routed to one of the county's four remaining clinics 
in Aliso Viejo, Santa Ana, Westminster and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Granados-Clark said such transitions are not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In dealing with addictions, we understand how difficult it is to establish a 
rapport and get trust," she said. "Some of the clients are choosing to 
discontinue treatment altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some of the clinics already have waiting lists for specific 
programs, Granados-Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte said closure of the Costa Mesa clinic will be most keenly felt by the 
indigent, since the county charges clients based on their ability to pay. Some 
clients pay nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are private concerns out there" to help alcoholics, he said, "but we're 
the county. We can turn no one away for the lack of ability to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach community activist Marsha Bode, who used to hustle people to the 
outpatient center there whenever they expressed a desire to stop drinking, said 
she still misses having that clinic nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "With alcoholics, you need somebody right on the spot to catch them when 
things are tough," she said.

A RUN FOR LIFE; BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, LOVED ONES OF DISEASE'S VICTIMS UNITE 
IN 'RACE FOR THE CURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jeanne Rogers is the last of the Bosom Buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the 10-member support group after being diagnosed with breast 
cancer six years ago. Then she watched the disease pick off her friends one by 
one, the last two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only survivor," said Rogers, 43, a one-time Fullerton police officer 
who lives in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a pink paper signed with the names of her late friends -- "my 
little angels," Rogers calls them -- hung from her T-shirt before she was 
pushed in a wheelchair around Fashion Island surrounded by Lycra-wrapped 
runners and walkers in the third annual "Race for the Cure," a benefit for the 
nationwide Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to educate other women," said Rogers, who now relies on her 
15-year-old daughter and a church group for support. "I'm the only one left and 
I feel it must be for a purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was one of about 500 breast cancer survivors at the event, which grew 
this year to attract more than 10,500 participants and spectators and was 
expected to raise as much as $400,000 for cancer-detection programs and 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors, easy to spot in pink visors marked with the number of years 
each has lived with the disease, were guests of honor as well as symbols of the 
high-stakes hunt for a breast cancer cure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at, in this decade, 1 1/2 million Americans developing breast 
cancer," said Dava F. Gerard, a Santa Ana surgeon and founding president of the 
foundation's Orange County chapter. "And we're looking at losing half of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-growing yearly race, one of 46 that the foundation is holding 
nationwide this year, has become the group's biggest funding source for Orange 
County operations, which include testing programs for women who can't afford to 
pay for tests. Three-fourths of the proceeds are to be used for local programs 
and one-fourth for national research, foundation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event drew top-rated runners, weekend joggers and many others who made 
their way around the race course on foot, bicycle, stroller and little red 
wagon. Gayle Wilson, the wife of Gov. Pete Wilson, wore bib No. 10000 and 
walked a one-mile loop with officials from the Dallas-based foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does so much for people who are dealing with breast cancer or have family 
members or friends," said Elizabeth Hart, who chairs the foundation's board of 
directors. "Almost everyone is touched by it and it's a way they can get 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs pinned to runners' shirts memorialized those who died and saluted the 
many more who have outlived the disease, which afflicts about 1,700 Orange 
County women a year and kills more than 400. Breast cancer, the leading cause 
of cancer death among women ages 35 to 54, has afflicted more than 1.7 million 
women nationwide, according to the National Alliance of Breast Cancer 
Organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Anaheim elementary-school teachers wore "Debby's Dream Team" signs 
in memory of colleague Debby Myres, who they said died of cancer last June 
after thinking she had beaten the disease two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally emotional seeing those people because it reminds you of Debby," 
said one of the teachers, Julie Klinkenberg. She said Myres was too ill to join 
a school contingent last year but remained close to colleagues -- giving them 
as her farewell present a poster that lists 903 reasons to be happy. It hangs 
in the teacher's lounge, Klinkenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another teacher, Stephanie Tanaka, said the race "gives us a good feeling, 
too, to feel we're supporting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers wasn't the only participant who remembers her friends as angels. A 
group of two dozens friends and relatives accompanied Audrey Bierman on a 
5-kilometer walk. They wore white cardboard wings labeled "Audrey's Angels." 
Bierman, 58, had a breast removed and underwent chemotherapy after learning 
during a routine physical examination in 1993 that she had cancer. There had 
been no warning signs, such as lumps.

 "It was real shock," Bierman said. "I didn't have time to worry about it. I 
just got slugged by it." She credited her informal support group with easing 
the effects of the treatment and helping with her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help other people and tell them it's not the horror we were always 
told it was," she said. "It's not a death notice."

 Six years after having a cancerous mass removed from her right breast, Rogers 
is careful not to declare an end to her bout. She still undergoes chemotherapy 
and recently suffered a mild stroke that she attributes to clotting caused by 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rogers said her lungs have not been right -- a strange cough set in two 
months ago and the shortness of breath prevented her from walking the course on 
Sunday. Doctors are scheduled to test lung tissue this week for signs of new 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers considered the worst, then smiled tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's one more thing to get me to grow stronger," she said.

10 SET SIGHTS ON 4 NEWPORT COUNCIL SEATS; ELECTION: THE CANDIDATES ARE MOST 
CONCERNED ABOUT AIRPORT- AND BUDGET-RELATED ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Voters could change the face of city government in November with four of the 
seven seats on the City Council up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 10 candidates view as paramount tandem issues involving airports 
-- protecting the city's settlement agreement on John Wayne Airport noise and 
lobbying for a commercial airport at the site of El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates also agree the council needs to find new revenue sources, trim city 
costs without reducing services and renew the city's business climate over the 
next four years. But they have different opinions on the best way to accomplish 
those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must live in the districts they are to represent, but are elected 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
 District 1's John W. Hedges, the only incumbent still eligible to run for 
reelection because of the city's two-term limit, said he wants to bring in new 
businesses to the Balboa Peninsula that will serve residents, not just 
visitors. A Central Balboa Specific Plan has been approved for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Creativity and streamlining the permit process are the keys to bringing in new 
businesses, the 39-year-old airline pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponent Elaine Linhoff, 64, president of the Balboa Peninsula Point 
homeowners' association, said she decided to run because she and other members 
of her group thought they were shortchanged in the final draft of the Central 
Balboa plan. Linhoff, a former substitute elementary school teacher and 
investment account executive, served on the Newport Tomorrow panel that helped 
draft the city's General Plan in the 1960s. She has remained active on city 
committees handling community development, development standards and litter 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Pham, the other challenger in District 1, said his 20 years as an 
engineer will help him recognize essential capital improvements and cut the 
best deal on projects. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the city's $18-million reservoir project is not worth the money 
and is destined for failure because of an earthquake fault on the reservoir 
site that was not discovered until after the project was begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, 43, believes someone with construction experience could help guide the 
council in spending tax dollars more effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Gabbard, a general contractor facing two other political newcomers in 
Corona del Mar's District 6, echoed Pham's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabbard, 57, said belt-tightening, particularly among the city's 
management-level employees, is essential. He called for a freeze on employee 
salaries "until the economy gets better." 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on his list is fighting a plan to convert Newport Coast Drive into a 
tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate broker Patrick Bartolic said his goal is balancing the city's 
budget without sacrificing public safety or community comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartolic, 38, said the key to business revitalization is to capitalize on the 
charm of the older areas of the city, including Balboa Peninsula and Corona del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested hiring a consultant to examine ways to renovate those areas, much 
like Old Town Pasadena and other historic commercial districts that cater to 
high-end businesses and consumers without disrupting the character of 
residential areas. He also believes the city should look into helping business 
owners get low-interest loans to make improvements or to relocate into the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The other District 6 contender, Dennis O'Neil, 56, is an attorney whose 
practice focuses on helping cities and public agencies meet the state's 
environmental review requirements for projects. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his experience as Newport Beach's city attorney, a post he resigned in 
1979, and serving other cities gives him the know-how to help fight off efforts 
to open John Wayne Airport to cargo flights, which city officials fear could 
erode the noise settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil, the immediate past chairman of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of 
Commerce, said his other major goal is finding ways to support the businesses 
that bring tax revenue into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Top priority for Art De La Loza, a Huntington Beach deputy city attorney 
running in District 3, which encompasses Mariners Mile, is improving 
neighborhood safety by promoting volunteerism in police reserve and other 
support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants the city to buy from local businesses and hire year-to-year 
contract lawyers to defend smaller civil cases.  
</P>
<P>
 His opponent, Planning Commission Chairwoman Norma Glover, believes the key to 
boosting city revenue is tourism. She said the city needs to work more closely 
with its visitors bureau to promote the city's beauty and to lure big spenders 
into the city's hotels, restaurants and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover, 58, is a former labor negotiator and print shop owner. She said the 
council needs to keep a tighter hold on the purse strings but advocates such 
changes as linking the city's several computer systems to streamline paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The other planning commissioner looking for a promotion is attorney Thomas 
Edwards, a candidate in District 4, the district farthest inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, 48, said new businesses are the ticket to balancing the city's 
budget. Promoting the city's retail environment -- perhaps including additions 
to Newport Center -- will help draw and keep businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards has been the city's representative on the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority and served on the Committee for 21,000 Jobs and the city's airport 
working group and aviation committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a commercial airport at the El Toro base would be the single largest 
revenue generator that the city could promote, because it would create jobs and 
produce businesses that support the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Once city coffers are restored, he said, he would try to hire police officers 
to fill positions left vacant by layoffs or attrition, and assign more officers 
to the older, deteriorating areas of the city. He also would encourage crime 
prevention programs and promote owner occupancy of homes to build up residents' 
stake in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 His sole opponent is public relations consultant Ronald Winship, 52, who also 
has worked as a legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Winship lost to Mayor Clarence J. Turner in the 1986 election. He said he is 
running again because of concern over increasing crime, gang activity and the 
loss of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said declining revenues have forced the city to cut back services such as 
beach cleaning and bay pollution control, which deteriorate the overall 
ambience of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes public safety could be improved by providing financial incentives, 
including housing subsidies, for police officers to live in the city.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; CITY OPPOSES PROPOSAL FOR FREEWAY OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is opposing an Interstate 5 overpass at Ridge Route Drive, which 
opponents say could flood quiet neighborhoods with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council authorized the hiring of a traffic consultant to develop an 
alternative to the Ridge Route overpass, which is being funded by county 
Measure M transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridge Route now dead-ends at Interstate 5. City officials and residents fear 
the overpass would turn Ridge Route into a major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do something, 20,000 cars (a day) will be passing by seven 
schools," Councilman Tim Link said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said county plans show Ridge Route Drive would become a 
four-lane primary highway between Moulton Parkway and Rockfield Boulevard and 
carry 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles daily. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to change or cancel the overpass project, the city needs to work with 
the county to develop a cooperative study agreement. Council members authorized 
$35,000 to pay for traffic consultant services. 
</P>
<P>
 The overpass was strongly opposed by Joe Inzitari, president of the Lake 
Forest I Homeowners Assn., which represents 1,700 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever we have to do to get this off the docket," said Inzitari, 
who said he also represents the views of the 3,500-home Lake Forest II 
Homeowners Assn. "If we need to do something politically, we'll do that. If 
it's a class-action suit, we'll do that." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO CONSIDER QUALITY-OF-LIFE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will discuss a variety of issues related to the 
day-to-day quality of life in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Up for a first reading is an ordinance limiting operating hours for unattended 
businesses, such as coin-operated laundries, self-service car washes and 
arcades.The businesses have been operating without hour regulations. The new 
ordinance would require such businesses to close from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In its afternoon session, the council is scheduled to hear a report cable 
television regulation within the city. Federal Communications Commission 
regulations allow the city to regulate only one of the two cable franchises 
because the other's customer base is too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Ken Delino noted in a report to the council that 
several cities in the southern part of the county have hired a consultant who 
reports Dimension Cable customers are being overcharged, but intricate FCC 
rules prevent the city from effective protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's other cable provider, Comcast, offers Newport Beach subscribers the 
lowest basic service rates in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will also hear a report on what must be done to try to bring 
John Wayne Airport into the city's "sphere of influence," a designation given 
to unincorporated areas that receive services from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission would have to approve any 
effort to bring an area into a city's sphere of influence. The primary 
advantage of realignment are that the city would hold more sway over activities 
within a sphere of influence area. Also, a sphere of influence is often a 
precursor to annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also expected to set a plan to raise private alarm response 
fees and a proposed set of citywide noise regulations for a public hearing Oct. 
10. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 The Irvine Unified School District will look within its organization for 
candidates to replace Supt. David E. Brown before deciding whether to conduct a 
nationwide search, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board decision has raised the possibility that an Irvine school 
district administrator could be named to replace Brown without a search for 
candidates outside the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members also agreed that the selection of a new superintendent 
will not be made until after November school board elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who was hired in 1987, is leaving in November to become superintendent 
of the Napa Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's three top administrators under Brown, only Deputy Supt. Dean 
Waldfogel has said he will not be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Supts. Susan Long and Paul Reed say they have not ruled out the 
possibility. Long was hired in 1987 as deputy superintendent of personnel 
services. Reed, 47, first came to the school district in 1974 as a special 
education teacher. He became an administrator in 1986 under Irvine Unified's 
founding Supt. A. Stanley Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the school board authorized an initial search that includes hiring 
a consulting firm to survey community opinions on the 21,500-student district, 
develop a "job profile" and evaluate candidates from within the district. RUSS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY TO PROBE DROP IN SALES TAX 
REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about lagging sales tax revenue, the city has hired a firm to 
recapture funds that may have been inadvertently lost through retailers' 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Errors could arise from a merchant failing to report a change of address when 
moving a business to San Juan Capistrano, using a home address elsewhere when 
registering for a state Use Tax Permit or expanding a business but attributing 
all sales taxes to a location in another city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved spending $3,150 to hire the sales tax consulting 
firm last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will receive 15% of all the misreported sales tax revenue that it 
helps recapture. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a best-case scenario, the city could recover as much as $120,000 
annually in wrongly allocated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's sales tax revenue dropped about $300,000 in the latest fiscal year 
ending June 30, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993, the city had $3 million in sales tax 
revenue. In the most recent fiscal year, the amount fell to $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop is tied mainly to San Juan Capistrano residents shopping in nearby 
Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, where large stores have recently opened, said 
Douglas Dumhart, a city management assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumhart said those cities showed slight gains in sales tax revenue for the 
first quarter of 1994. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; BUDGET REVIEW MAY TURN UP EXTRA FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Proponents of city programs and projects put on hold for lack of money will be 
taking an anxious look at the year-end budget review at Tuesday night's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing the books on fiscal 1993-94, council members will be looking for 
that rarest of commodities: extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 "While other cities are still scraping around and trying to make ends meet, 
Irvine is able to take a look at some of the projects that have gone unfinished 
and try to get them finished," said Councilman Barry Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond wants to spend $60,000 to complete the landscaping of a roadway median 
at the intersection of Culver Drive and Trabuco Road near the Santa Ana 
Freeway. Hammond said Caltrans should have completed the project 10 years ago, 
but the city was left with responsibility for the median. 
</P>
<P>
 Several park projects are waiting for funding, including the Northwood Village 
"narrows" park planned for a strip of land on an abandoned railroad 
right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved plans for the $2-million park on Sept. 13. after a 
decade of discussion and debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge Community Park is only half completed. And a park planned near 
the Irvine Civic Center that already has a $1.8-million commitment from the 
city needs additional funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith said he would like to expand the city's transportation 
commission into a public works commission. He will also ask for more police 
officer training funds and an upgrading of the city's emergency communications 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of spending money haphazardly," Smith said. "We must protect 
the budget reserves." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; PARENTS OPPOSE CABLE TV SEX

<P>
 After Chuck Davis' children finished watching "Power Rangers" on television on 
a recent afternoon, Davis flipped through the channels and was shocked by what 
he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of sexual exploits and explicit sounds came from their cable service -- 
so Chuck and Kathi Davis quickly ushered their 10-year-old boy and 4-year-old 
girl out of the room and called the cable company to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they want the company, Cablevision of Orange, to stop the images from 
going to homes without permission. The Davises are also checking with other 
parents who are worried about the pictures on their sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible," Kathi Davis said. "It's 5 o'clock, prime hour for children to 
be watching television."  
</P>
<P>
 Joan Emge of Orange said she was concerned about her grandchildren when the 
same images and sounds were showing up on her television two months ago. She 
called the company and had the images scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once children see this, they would never forget what they saw," Emge said. 
"Children don't have a chance to be children anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Davises were so concerned about the transmissions that they contacted U.S. 
Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach) on Friday. Officials at Cox's office confirmed 
that they will contact the Federal Communications Commissions to try to stop 
such unwanted images. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision of Orange supervisors said they have had only a few, isolated 
complaints. A recent complaint was traced to a converter box problem, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there have been other problems, we need to have those customers call us so 
we can do something about it," office administrator Linda Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar problems have occurred in other Southern California cities. Earlier 
this month, about 50 angry residents in Ventura County successfully pressured a 
cable provider to block out a pay-per-view adult network that was appearing on 
televisions without being ordered. ALICIA DI RADO

 "I was mean because I didn't like myself and I thought no one else liked me," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a few classes with Javier A. Cortez, the creator of the acting 
program, her outlook brightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think we should like ourselves for who we are, because if you like 
yourself, you like the world and anything can happen if you just try," said the 
sixth-grader at Laguna Road Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandra and about a dozen other neighborhood children meet Cortez twice a 
week at a local park to rehearse skits written, directed and produced by 
Cortez, who also co-founded the Chicano Poet Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The young actors this week performed "Homeboys Are People Too" and "Super 
Chicana" at Cal State Fullerton. Those skits tell the stories of a gang member 
who tries to turn his life around and a wife who learns to stand up against 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Each play teaches valuable lessons on self-worth, dignity and pride, the 
actors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning not to take drugs, to defend myself and never let myself get 
beaten," said Jeanette Salgado, 12. "I'm learning to speak up for myself and 
not be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Anni Quintero, 10: "I feel good when I'm on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin Casares, 15, said being in the program has boosted his desire to 
excel in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I got Cs and Ds. Now I'm back in school and I'm getting straight 
Bs," the Fullerton High School sophomore said. "I was always afraid to ask for 
help but if I need it now, I just go and ask for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez said he is trying to instill self-determination and courage "to do the 
right thing" in the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're young, you need a lot of praise and encouragement," said Cortez, 
26, who is a park director for Anaheim's Kids in Action Program. "These kids 
get put down because they're Latino and poor and they need self-confidence to 
express themselves and be proud through positive avenues like the arts." MIMI

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CHRISTMAS TREES, PUMPKINS ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider an ordinance that would regulate the 
sale of Halloween pumpkins and Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is intended to help the Planning Department promptly review 
applications to operate such seasonal businesses and to apply consistent 
standards, said Community Development Director Elizabeth Binsack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing different than in the past," Binsack said. "We're putting 
this in the code so everybody understands what they can do to make (selling 
pumpkins and Christmas trees) safer and with no impact on surrounding uses." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a business license, a permit will be required for anyone 
planning to sell pumpkins or Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The $75 permit fee is the same amount currently being charged, Binsack said. 
The permit would allow the holder to sell both pumpkins and Christmas trees 
during the same year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, pumpkins may be sold from Oct. 1 to Oct. 31. Christmas 
trees may be sold the day after Thanksgiving until Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 All structures used for selling pumpkins and Christmas trees must be removed 
within seven days following the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors also must comply with fire-safety requirements and submit a plot plan 
of the location, indicating sheds and other temporary structures and parking 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Binsack said that each year, four vendors usually apply for permits to sell 
Christmas trees. Two of them also sell pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, following a public hearing in August, voted to 
recommend that the council approve the ordinance. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 2 UNUSED SCHOOLS SOLD FOR NEARLY $14 
MILLION

<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District has sold two surplus school properties 
that will net the district nearly $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited deal to sell James O. Harper and John B. Bushard elementary 
schools was announced at Thursday's meeting.Both sites have been closed for 
more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak said that trustees, in closed 
session, unanimously voted to sell the two properties to two development 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will bring in badly needed funds to the district," Sedlak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad-South Coast Inc. of Newport Beach was selected to buy the 
Bushard site in Huntington Beach for $5.7 million, Sedlak said. Demolition of 
buildings will start Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also entered into a final sales agreement to sell the Harper site in 
Fountain Valley to Costain Homes Inc. of Newport Beach for $8.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent for administration and business, said 
that not more than 59 single-family homes will be built on the 14-acre Harper 
site.  
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said city approvals have already been given to build 58 single-family 
homes on the 10-acre Bushard site.  
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said both deals pose no financial risk to the district, because the 
land is being sold outright and no joint-venture partnership will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had entered into a joint-venture agreement with another developer 
to build houses on the Harper and Bushard sites as well as Lighthouse Lane, 
formerly the school district's offices. But that deal fell through last year 
after the developer failed to secure financing for the projects.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; IMMIGRANT PROGRAM EARNS NATIONAL HONOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 A city program designed to help recent immigrants adapt to local neighborhood 
living has won national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Housing and Redevelopment praised Santa Ana's Tenant 
Awareness Program, which uses videos, coloring books and photographic novellas 
in several languages to reach new immigrants, said city housing manager Pat 
Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's was one of four city programs in the country to be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 In videos produced in English, Spanish and Cambodian, actors portray 
immigrants who are coached by relatives and friends on local customs. 
</P>
<P>
 The videos cover, among other things, dealing with landlords and rules 
governing the playing of loud music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents and staff wanted a more positive way of interacting with new 
residents, instead of saying 'You can't do this. You can't do that.' We thought 
it would be better to put (the information) in a soap opera fashion so they can 
see in real life what would happen," Whitaker said. JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Velin, deputy city clerk for the past three years, will be considered 
for appointment as city clerk at tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek is recommending that Velin officially assume the 
duties of the city clerk while remaining as his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the recommendation, Velin, who also has served as 
Dunek's secretary since 1991, will receive a 4% pay raise, boosting her salary 
from $3,389 to $3,525 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek has served as both city manager and city clerk since 1989. Now, he said, 
"it would be more efficient for the city to split the responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's official record-keeper, the city clerk keeps records and keeps 
the minutes of council meetings and is responsible for state-required filings, 
such as conflict-of-interest and election-related statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said that Velin has attended several seminars on the duties of city 
clerks and has gained experience with routine duties and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very capable of assuming the duties of the city clerk at this time," 
Dunek said in a report to the council. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Greg King, 45, a retired Falls Church, Va., police officer, is the new chief 
of safety at Golden West College. He replaces Harry Palmer, who in June took 
the police chief position at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 King served for more than 20 years in the Falls Church Police Department 
before his retirement this year as commander of field operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I retired from the police force, but I didn't want to retire from life," King 
said. "My goal was to remain in law enforcement in an academic environment." 
</P>
<P>
 A former U.S. Army staff sergeant, he served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1971. He 
holds a master's degree in management and is a graduate of law enforcement 
training at the FBI Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief King brings a wealth of professional experience to the safety and 
security function of Golden West College," President Philip Westin said. "I'm 
confident in his abilities to provide a secure environment for the 13,000 
students as well as faculty and staff at Golden West College." BILL BILLITER

SAN CLEMENTE'S IN CASA ROMANTICA MOOD; HISTORY: GOING BACK FOR A THIRD TRY, THE 
CITY COUNCIL HOPES THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL REVITALIZE THE MANSION BUILT BY THE 
CITY'S FOUNDER AND GENERATE SOME MUNICIPAL REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, city officials are trying to answer the increasingly stubborn 
question: How do you make money off the city's most venerable landmark? 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in four years, the City Council is hoping the private 
sector will revitalize the historic Casa Romantica and generate badly needed 
revenue from the mansion built by the city's founder, Ole Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Romantica is part of a proposed $15.6-million plan that also involves 
building a small shopping plaza and time-share condominiums on the oceanfront 
bluffs overlooking the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous plans have envisioned the Casa as a hotel with a small museum, or a 
wedding/reception hall with small time-share units built around it. Both ideas 
flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, the city thinks it has a winner with renovation plans for a 
restaurant and small museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has absolutely been done right this time," said Jim Pechous, assistant 
city planner. "We wanted to preserve the Casa and this plan will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other structure in town, "the Casa Romantica is the symbol of 
San Clemente and Ole Hanson's dream of creating a Spanish village by the sea," 
said Dorothy Fuller, president of the San Clemente Historical Society. "No 
other place tells the story of San Clemente better than that building." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials admit that converting the historic landmark into a commercial 
venture has been a delicate business. They should know. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the first proposal for rejuvenating the Casa Romantica and the Pier 
Bowl area brought hundreds of residents storming to public meetings, 
complaining about the grand scale of the plans. The pressure caused Los 
Angeles-based developer, the Ratkovich Co., to withdraw from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attempt to develop the Pier Bowl and leave the Casa as a wedding 
reception hall collapsed earlier this year when financing fell through for 
Mission Viejo businesswoman Maureen Capielo Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Few detractors were in the audience last week when the newest renovation 
project was introduced, "but once public hearings come up, people will show 
up," said community activist Karolyn Koester. "It'll be like Ratkovich. The 
Casa is very important to this city and I have problems with the restaurant" in 
the Casa. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the city sees is dollar signs, and I'm afraid of what they'll do" to the 
mansion, said Koester, a former mayor here. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the city would pay $800,000 to renovate the Casa and the 
developer team of Riverside Commercial Investors Inc. and the Continental 
Commercial Corp. would put up $500,000 to convert the grounds into a 
restaurant. A small museum would be included in renovation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, city planners say the proposal is less than half the size of the 
Ratkovich plan and they maintain that restoring the Casa Romantica is their No. 
1 priority. But the city does have financial pressures to build a money-making 
project in the Pier Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente has painfully earned the sobriquet "San Calamity" in recent 
years. The city budget was in the red even before a series of major landslides 
and floods in 1993 cost the city millions of dollars in cleanup costs and sewer 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the recession hit California in 1989, the three-acre Ole Hanson 
mansion was bought by San Clemente for $2.5 million. So far, the city has only 
been able to make interest payments on the financing used to make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Casa "is not the draw at the present time that it needs to be to fund the 
debt service," said Mayor Scott Diehl. "In these tough times, the council needs 
to take a hard look at what the Casa becomes."  
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said the historical society has "mixed feelings" about turning the Casa 
into a Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd prefer not to see it touched other than to be renovated, but we're aware 
of the fact that the city has to make money," she said. "There will be some 
hard choices to make in the future."

BLUES EVENT WILL GO ON AT DOHENY BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regardless of the confusion over two blues festivals bearing the same name, 
the show will go on for at least one blues event this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Orange County Blues Festival to be held at Doheny State 
Beach say recent news of the cancellation of a competing event in Heritage Park 
has caused hundreds of people to ask for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People read that the blues festival was canceled, and they thought ours was 
canceled," said Eric Jensen, event spokesman. "This year's festival is going to 
be bigger and better" than last year's Heritage Park show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Oakes, the organizer of the competing event, which also called itself the 
Orange County Blues Festival, recently confirmed the cancellation of his show 
in Heritage Park due to a scheduling conflict in use of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakes and the organizers of this weekend's Doheny State Beach show ran a 
well-attended blues festival in Heritage Park last year. However, the partners 
split acrimoniously afterward, accusing each other of financial 
misappropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups have filed lawsuits over the summer for the rights to the name 
"Orange County Blues Festival." The cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doheny State Beach festival will be held from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday 
and Sunday. Festival headliners will include former Stray Cat Brian Setzer, 
James Cotton and Maria Muldaur on Saturday. Topping the bill for Sunday's show 
are John Mayall, Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Charlie 
Musselwhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $10 in advance and $15 the day of the event. VIP weekend tickets, 
which include discounted drinks and preferred seating, cost $25. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be purchased at Ticketmaster or by calling (714) 645-1999. FRANK

IRVINE COLLISION HURTS 6 PEOPLE; DRIVER, 20, ARRESTED IN INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Irvine man was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving 
Saturday night after his car collided with another vehicle at an intersection, 
hit a light pole and overturned, injuring six people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrested man, Collin Eckert, was driving a 1990 Honda sedan north on Yale 
Avenue with four passengers at about 10:30 p.m. when he entered the Bryan 
Avenue intersection and collided with another car, a 1993 Mazda sedan.It was 
driven by Mina Maghami, 40, also of Irvine with a 14-year-old boy passenger, 
Irvine police Sgt. Tom Hume said. Eckert's car then left the roadway and hit a 
light pole and overturned, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the drivers apparently ran a red light, although the police report did 
not indicate which one. Eckert was arrested because he was intoxicated, police 
said, but was no longer being held Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the injured passengers were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana 
and two were taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the injured were Eckert, Maghami, Jeffrey Parrish, 18, and Cameron 
Armendariz, 19 and two juveniles who were not identified because of their age. 
Parrish and Armendariz were riding in Eckert's car, Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, Hume said. All were from 
Irvine.

YORBA LINDA MAN KILLED IN CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old Yorba Linda man was killed Saturday night when he apparently 
drove through a red light at a busy intersection and was hit by another car. 
The collision sent the victim's car careening into a signpost, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released pending notification of his family, 
was driving alone in a 1985 blue Dodge Colt westbound on Orangethorpe Avenue 
about 9 p.m. when he entered the intersection at Lakeview Avenue against the 
red light and was hit by a 1991 Honda driven by Trudy Elaine Wilson, 44, of 
Yorba Linda, police said. The man's vehicle then hit a speed limit sign, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man suffered massive head and internal injuries and was taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, where he was pronounced dead at 9:52 p.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wilson nor her passengers were injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No citations or arrests have been made and an investigation of the incident is 
underway, police said. Anyone who witnessed the traffic accident is being asked 
to call Investigator Chuck O'Connor at (714) 254-1835.

O.C. PARENTS FIGHT STREET'S LURE, OFTEN LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Irma Garcia checks her watch as her 13-year-old son, Jose, enters the house, a 
spotless refuge painted midnight blue and decorated with lace and artificial 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 2:25 p.m. -- the exact time, to the minute, that Jose should arrive home 
each afternoon from Willard Intermediate School, no stops allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "School, home. School, home. That's all he does. I am so proud," his mother 
says. "He never goes outside. If we go somewhere, we go together." 
</P>
<P>
 On this afternoon, like every afternoon in the two years since the Garcia 
family moved to this house a block from 3rd Street, Jose's activities involve 
playing inside with his 2-year-old brother, Carlito, a job he assumes with 
devotion as his mother prepares a giant vat of ceviche . 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids who get into trouble, they're not real smart," says Jose, a strikingly 
soft-spoken child. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3rd Street neighborhood, the lure of gangs has been so strong that 
near-seclusion may be a mother's best hope of protecting a son from joining up 
or getting shot. Despite their best efforts, some have buried their children or 
seen them sent to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a police sweep earlier this month has temporarily weakened gang 
members' hold on this stretch of turf, the temptations of street affiliations 
are still irresistible for many of 3rd Street's young. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street from Garcia's home, Imelda and Jesus are baffled by the series 
of events that led to the Sept. 7 arrest of two of their seven children, a 
13-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter, along with 117 other suspects in 
the highly publicized Sept. 7 sweep. The family's last name is not being used 
because the suspects are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried, because I saw them talking with the friends they had," Imelda 
said. "But I never had any ideas about (her son) selling drugs, or (her 
daughter) either." 
</P>
<P>
 But the gang was literally at the couple's doorstep. Sixth Street gang 
members, who claim the two blocks of 3rd Street between Flower and Baker 
streets as the core of their turf, would sell drugs outside Jesus and Imelda's 
home and paint gang graffiti on the front-yard fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus and Imelda said they could do little to stop them, and at least felt 
secure that their house would not be robbed or their children intentionally 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't respect me," Jesus said. "But they respected the integrity of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a home full of affection, where all the children know the words to 
their father's favorite ballad. But it is also a home where Imelda and Jesus 
seem overwhelmed by the lives of their children, and unable to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 13, just two days before their children's first court hearing, Imelda 
and Jesus waited at the well-worn picnic table in their front yard for another 
daughter, 16-year-old Susie, to return home with her newborn baby, Jesus and 
Imelda's 12th grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny girl who looks closer to 14 emerged from the cab, holding a pink 
hospital balloon and a five-pound bundle. Later, she held court in the bedroom 
she would have shared with two sisters if one hadn't been in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at my family," Imelda wailed, her eyes red from crying. "All these 
babies. But (her son) is missing. (He) is not here." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are not raising children on this street find it easy to point 
fingers at parents who seem to condone their children's affiliations with 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents of the cholos need to get involved, or if they can't control 
them, at least tell them to go do their damage in someone else's neighborhood," 
said Ignacio Barrientos, a 72-year-old retired boat builder who feels trapped 
by the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But gangsters and those who associate with them say the street can be 
preferable to the alternatives they have. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lucia, a tall and fiery 17-year-old, 3rd Street and the camaraderie of the 
Sixth Street gang members are a refuge from a home she said was torn by strife. 
Her parents' divorce sent Lucia to the streets at age 12, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This street is like a drug. You get addicted and then you can't stop coming," 
she said, eyeing every car that cruised the quiet corner, a booming 
clearinghouse for rock cocaine just six months ago. "It's so sad now. There's 
nothing to do at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother tried in vain to keep her home, Lucia said; her father ignores her. 
On Father's Day, she went to Los Angeles to see him, bringing a gift of white 
Levis, a denim shirt and shiny white shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed up late at night, drunk, she said, and in the two weeks that she 
lived next door with her grandmother, he never once came to see her, she said. 
From her grandmother's kitchen window, she could see the present unopened on 
his dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Lucia said she discovered that her father was begging his 
friends for money, telling them that she and her brother had been gunned down 
in drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I didn't go to school last week, I just told the teacher that my dad 
died," Lucia says defiantly. "He killed me and my brother already, so I killed 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents, however, believe they have done as much as they can to prevent 
their children's descent into crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to teach them when they are little, because as soon as they grow up, 
forget it. By the time they're 15, it's too late," Garcia said. "I think the 
problem with most of these gangsters are the parents, because many of them, 
they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her firm house rules, Garcia acknowledges that her daughter, Marta, 
joined a gang from another area at the age of 15 after a rapid series of events 
that Garcia felt helpless to control. There are no female members of the Sixth 
Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 For other families, the seduction of the street proved far more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Martinez lost a 16-year-old son, Gilbert, to a drive-by shooting last 
year. Police say another son is a member of the Sixth Street gang, and she 
raised a nephew who has been in and out of jail on drug-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep my kids inside, so they wouldn't be out there. But they had 
to go to school," said Martinez, who works for a Fullerton company that 
manufactures medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said she rarely allowed Gilbert to go out, and forced him instead to 
socialize with friends on the family's porch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the mothers who have suffered from the violence," Martinez laments. "I 
have lived through this and it is horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the tragedy, Martinez said she would not consider moving now. Like 
her children who have grown up with the street's gang members, the family feels 
a sense of belonging on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid here. People know me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Martinez adds, her children are so marked with the stamp of the Sixth 
Street gang that she fears they would be killed in any other neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have asked me, 'Why don't you move to a different neighborhood? But I 
say, 'Where can I go? I can't move, now that my kids are big,' " Martinez said. 
"A friend of mine moved to Perris, and her two kids were killed because they 
weren't from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I'll stay, where people know me, where we belong, where my children grew 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inevitable lure of the street, even the gang members here are 
fiercely protective of their younger brothers and nephews, hoping to spare them 
the violent life they have already experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 14-year-old nephew and I tell him, if he ever tries to be from the 
'hood, I'll smack him," said one gang member, who said he has tried to stay out 
of trouble since his girlfriend became pregnant four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His nephew's admiration, however, may resist any efforts at dissuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told him to write a story in school about his hero," the gang member 
said. "He wrote about me." 
</P>

RAIDERS LOSE TO CHARGERS BY DECISION; PRO FOOTBALL: SAN DIEGO'S ROSS CHOOSES 
CORRECTLY, SHELL WRONGLY AS AFC WEST LEADERS REMAIN UNDEFEATED, 26-24. 
</P>

<P>
 Wake-up call? Raider Coach Art Shell dialed the wrong number Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to shake his team out of its lethargy and get back in a game he 
trailed, 20-3, Shell passed up a near-certain field goal in the closing minute 
of the first half at the Coliseum and went for a first down on a 
fourth-and-three at the San Diego Charger six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of opting for the dependable arm of quarterback Jeff Hostetler, Shell 
went to his shaky running game, calling on Harvey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams came up a yard short and the Raiders wound up two points short, 
eventually losing, 26-24, before 55,385. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough call for Shell? No one can sympathize with him better than Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego coach also had to make a crucial fourth-down call. He also went 
for the first down, but his fourth-quarter gamble paid off eventually in the 
game-winning points. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a fourth and one at the Raider 32-yard line in the closing minutes, 
Ross turned his back on a possible 49-yard field goal attempt by John Carney. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ross rolled the dice and came up with an eight, quarterback Stan 
Humphries completing an eight-yard pass to running back Ronnie Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
 That enabled the Chargers to drive close enough for Carney to kick a 33-yard 
field goal with two seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 With one thrust of his right leg, Carney boosted San Diego into sole 
possession of first place in the AFC West at 4-0 and booted the Raiders out of 
early season contention, leaving them three games back at 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That kick also allowed the Chargers to hold off a Raider rally that enabled 
them to come back from a 17-0 second-quarter deficit, a 20-3 halftime 
disadvantage and a 23-3 third-quarter San Diego lead to gain a 24-23 edge on 
Lionel Washington's 31-yard return of an interception with 7:01 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole complexion of this game had changed at the end of the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a miserable half for the Raiders, as dismal as any they have had 
in stumbling out the starting gate this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outscored, 82-23, in the first two games, both losses, the Raiders 
had broken through a week ago by beating Denver, 48-16. 
</P>
<P>
 But those were the defensively inept Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 These were the re-charged Chargers, who came into town with an effective blend 
of old and new faces, the league's top-ranked passer in Stan Humphries and the 
AFC's leading sack unit with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 They showed a little bit of everything in that first half, starting with the 
instant they first got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 That was after the Raiders' opening drive stalled. Jeff Gossett kicked a 
53-yard punt to Darrien Gordon, who appeared as if he was going to be tackled 
by James Trapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gordon got away on the right side of the field, headed left, blew 
past Patrick Bates, who was blocked on the play, and found only Gossett between 
himself and the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to grab the back of his shoulder pads," Gossett said. "I ended 
up grabbing the side of his facemask, so I had to let go. I couldn't quite get 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon outraced the next closest defender, Rob Holmberg, to the end zone for a 
90-yard return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders seemed stunned. Once again, the game had started and nobody seemed 
to have told them. It's a trend that has become all too familiar to this club. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, seeking its fourth consecutive victory at the Coliseum, added a 
38-yard field goal by Carney and a one-yard run by Natrone Means. Means' 
touchdown was set up by a 50-yard pass interference call against Eddie 
Anderson, the second time in as many weeks the Raiders have been on the 
receiving end of such a call. Last week, Washington got the call against 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, when Humphries, on a third and 12 from his 49, headed for the line 
of scrimmage, safety Anderson bit on the move and came up. That left receiver 
Shawn Jefferson alone near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson tried to recover and race back. Attempting to make up for lost time, 
he hooked Jefferson's arm. The throw was short, but Anderson was cited for 
impeding Jefferson's path to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Means was in the end zone. An exchange of field goals, 43 
yards by Jeff Jaeger and 24 by Carney, made the score 20-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders turned to quarterback Jeff Hostetler and wide receiver Tim Brown. 
They responded by hooking up on a 24-yard completion on the first play of the 
Raiders' last drive of the half. The team drove 71 yards to the Charger six, 
where it was fourth and three with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something," Shell said, "to wake up the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went up the middle for two yards, ending the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a message that we wanted to win," Williams said. "We wanted 
seven points, not three." 
</P>
<P>
 Had they made the first down, the Raiders would have had only 48 seconds to 
get into the end zone, but Jaeger also had no problem with the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he (Shell) should be given credit for going for it," Jaeger said. 
"They don't ask my opinion. I'm just his weapon. If he sends me in, I go. If he 
doesn't, I just stand there and cheer. He's the head coach, but you've got to 
cut him some slack. He's just trying to do what's right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders did plenty that was right in the second half. After Carney's 
27-yard field goal gave the Chargers a 20-point lead, the Raiders finally came 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler scored from a yard out and then went to Rocket Ismail on a 24-yard 
touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 With San Diego trying to regain the momentum in the final quarter, Humphries 
sailed a short pass to Shannon Mitchell. Raider rookie linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson batted the ball into the air, where Washington was able to grab it 
and cruise untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Chargers got the ball, they needed only three points to win. Had 
the Raiders let Jaeger kick at the end of the half, San Diego would have had to 
get into the end zone to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell took a gamble. Now he must take the criticism. And unless his team can 
turn around a season that has turned sour before it is a month old, he'd better 
get used to it.
