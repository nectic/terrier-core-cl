O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; MIX MASTER; AUGUSTUS VINCENT TACK'S WORKS BLEND 
ORNAMENT, SPIRIT, THE ABSTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the enduring qualities of American art history is its roster of 
eccentric individualists, the ones with a penchant for concocting odd theories, 
pursuing unfashionable themes and using peculiar materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustus Vincent Tack, an obscure East Coast painter active in the early 20th 
Century, was part of this odd fellowship, and it is rewarding to make his 
acquaintance in a generous sampler of his work at the Laguna Art Museum 
(through May 8), circulated by the Phillips Collection in Washington 
</P>
<P>
 Although his art veers at times toward sentimentality or preciousness, Tack 
was as much an American original as William Rimmer, Louis Eilshemius or Albert 
Pinkham Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 The compelling aspect of Tack's paintings comes from their unusual combination 
of ornament, spiritual yearning, references to the natural world, and 
abstraction. Nurtured by the pre-World War I flowering of the decorative arts, 
Tack's art was also suffused with a lush, nostalgia-drenched aestheticism and a 
heightened sensitivity to the life of the spirit, the legacy of the European 
Symbolists. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1870 into a gracious, cultured New York family, Tack was educated in 
Jesuit schools and was attracted from childhood to art and music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 20, after studying at the Art Students League, he sojourned in France, 
where he absorbed the lessons of Impressionism as well as academic techniques 
that would serve him in mural-making. Through John LaFarge, a multifaceted 
painter who was his principal mentor, Tack became intrigued by the flat 
patterning of Asian art. 
</P>
<P>
 Although New York was the place to be to keep up one's contacts in the art 
world, Tack preferred to spend as much time as possible in the placid world of 
Deerfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the countryside -- and enraptured by a young painter named Violet 
Fuller, whom he married in 1900 -- Tack painted ethereal canvases indebted to 
Tonalism, the moody American style that favored misty hues and transitional 
times of day. 
</P>
<P>
 With delicate nuances of color barely distinguishable in an atmospheric haze, 
such paintings as "Winter Landscape" and "Deerfield, Spring Landscape," conjure 
the most sensitive imaginable response to nature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in "Windswept (Snow Picture, Leyden)," a painting of a snowcapped mountain 
from about 1900-1902, Tack introduced another key element that presaged his 
late work: an irregular pattern of random slivers of unpainted canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two decades, clouded by Violet's poor health, Tack turned to 
society portraiture to help pay the bills. Meanwhile, he tried to cultivate a 
more otherworldly, symbolic style in line with the work of such contemporaries 
as Arthur B. Davies and Maurice Predergast. 
</P>
<P>
 The results included Renaissance-influenced decorative allegorical landscapes 
and biblical scenes built from daubs of pure pigment, as well as various mural 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, Tack's approach became increasingly abstract, although always 
based on forms in landscape. As he wrote in a 1921 essay, his sources included 
"white foam lying on black water . . . the rhythmic serrations of sand, or 
snowdrifts blown by the wind, or wind-blown clouds, or the reflections of 
leaves in water . . . or rain-stained walls or the foliage of thick growing 
crops." 
</P>
<P>
 A key influence in Tack's new style was his first view of the Rocky Mountains, 
in the summer of 1920. Later that decade, he would photograph patterns of light 
and shadow in Death Valley. Enlarged and transferred to canvas, the shapes made 
by light became his abstract, visionary tools. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Gethsemane" and other biblical paintings of the early '20s, Tack created 
massed landscape and figure groupings splintered into restless patterns of 
texture and color. 
</P>
<P>
 Using rollers and cloths, he purposely "distressed" these works to achieve the 
abraded surfaces of old frescoes. Operating on several levels at once -- as 
"instant" antiques, religious icons and abstractions -- these works had little 
in common with either academic painting of the day or the work of the 
avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tack's chief booster was Duncan Phillips, the art patron whose collection 
became a public gallery bearing his name in 1921. He exhibited Tack in 1926 
alongside such modernists as Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe and Max Weber. A 
couple of years later, Phillips commissioned the artist to decorate a library, 
now known as the Music Room, in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 lunettes (arched canvases) decorated with gilded borders are filled 
with Tack's idiosyncratic synthesis of Catholic mysticism and ornamental 
devices. With gold, rich color and textural complexity, the artist translated 
the resplendent glory of the Renaissance cathedral altarpiece -- and the 
persuasive appeal of Counter-Reformation religious imagery -- into the domestic 
realm of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of these works are the most abstract. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Liberation," for example, small abstract patterns appear to be ceaselessly 
roiling through a lofty sky, giving the impression of cloud movement; in 
"Aspiration," a liquid surge of blue into a field of yellow suggests an almost 
palpable rising emotion. This is the ecstatic vision at the heart of Tack's 
belief in the non-material world, a stunning rush of pantheistic emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His last significant works, from the mid-'30s, are small abstractions ("Dawn," 
"Winter," "Hill and Sky") in which natural forms are reduced to a daring 
handful of irregular flattened elements. More than a decade later, Milton Avery 
would encode landscape views in a similar way, though with purely secular aims. 
</P>
<P>
 Tack's final mural, "Time and Timelessness," for George Washington University 
(it is represented by a painting sketch in the show) was completed by his 
assistant in 1944, five years before the artist's death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is tempting to claim Tack as a modernist because of the abstract basis of 
his best work. But he was a conciliator, not a rule breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 He attempted to heal the breach between conventional religiosity in art, with 
its sentimental excesses, and a more direct evocation of religious feeling. For 
him, the key lay in the mesmerizing power of patterning that he found in 
non-Western art. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattern is a powerful thing, at once decorative and abstract -- and therefore 
potentially open to metaphoric interpretation. Coupled with his ability to 
pluck out elements of art and design from different eras and cultures, Tack's 
investigation of pattern as both an attractive lure and a conveyor of meaning 
seems particularly apropos in today's postmodern climate. This was just the 
right moment to bring him back from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Laguna Art Museum, two smaller shows continue the 
investigation into what constitutes a spiritual art for the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vertigo Journey: The Early Assemblage of Seymour Locks, 1949-1965" presents 
11 oddball works by a Bay Area sculptor now in his 74th year. "Toward 
Stillness" focuses on paintings and drawings by four colleagues -- Tom Holste, 
Joachim Smith, Doug Smith and Bob Schmidt -- who were motivated by a love of 
the natural world and a kinship with non-Western philosophies. A future column 
will take a closer look at contexts, credibility and other issues associated 
with these bodies of work. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Augustus Vincent Tack: Landscape of the Spirit" remains through May 8 at 
the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $4 adults, $3 seniors and students, free for

ART REVIEW; MOCA'S CITY SOFAS: A SITE FOR SITTING; AUSTRIAN ARTIST FRANZ WEST 
LINES UP ROWS OF COMFY COUCHES FOR 'TEST' TO EXPLORE THE SENSE OF PLACE IN AN 
AUSTERE SCULPTURE PLAZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 28 sofas lined up in four diagonal rows of seven on the outdoor sculpture 
plaza of the Museum of Contemporary Art constitute a simple but vibrant 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Test," as the new, brightly colored installation by noted Austrian artist 
Franz West is appropriately titled, means to evaluate the prospects for an 
authentically public sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the very concept of a lively, open and disputatious public 
world has severely atrophied, the installation also wants to establish a 
benchmark or criterion for public-ness. With flying colors, "Test" passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those colors range from shocking pink, yellow and purple to lively polka dots 
and multicolored African prints. Sewn into slipcovers and bolsters, the fabrics 
were chosen by West's collaborator, Gilbert Bretterbauer, during forays into 
downtown L.A.'s booming garment district. They decorate sturdy, high-back sofas 
constructed from welded rebar and steel mesh. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Test" sofas are related to an earlier installation titled "Auditorium," 
which garnered considerable attention at the most recent installment of the 
international art extravaganza Documenta, mounted in the German city of Kassel 
in the summer of 1992. There, in a courtyard off the city's main plaza, a slew 
of West's steel sofas -- this time upholstered with rugs -- became an 
inevitable gathering spot for the show's throngs of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old artist is not yet well-known outside Europe. Last year, he 
showed sculptures of plaster, papier-mache and gauze in a group show at 
Rosamund Felsen Gallery, a solo show at Burnett Miller Gallery and in New York 
at David Zwirner Gallery. At MOCA, "Test" is West's first site-specific museum 
installation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of materials familiar from heavy-duty urban construction sites and 
domestic living rooms suggests the playfully disconcerting nature of the sofa 
installation. Conventions that divide industrial and domestic, outdoors and 
indoors, public and private slyly intermingle. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture plaza, which is surrounded by office and apartment towers, a 
hotel and two wings of the museum, is a formally austere urban space. The 
formality of the site is acknowledged in the sofas' structural design, whose 
durable simplicity recalls that of an ordinary park bench. West has arranged 
the sofas in a linear, side-by-side configuration of two double rows. They run 
diagonally across the plaza, quietly animating the passageway. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are cushy sofas after all, not park benches. Their upholstered pads 
are made of foam rubber, they're long enough to lounge around on and they even 
have pillows. Comfortable, the sofas endow this public place with a startlingly 
casual informality quite alien to the decorum of such locales. 
</P>
<P>
 People gather, hang around, loll, chat, eavesdrop. The sculpture plaza is 
transformed into a cozy urban back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza seating isn't exactly European in bearing, although a consideration 
for enhancing the sociality of public places is typical of cities based on a 
modern European model. (It definitely isn't American in tone.) West pointedly 
inserts a domestic motif into a public place, in the process giving an edge to 
what we mean by private . 
</P>
<P>
 Private suggests that something is personal, secret or withheld from public 
view. Often, it also means something is determined by commercial values. In the 
United States, where the town square has been definitively replaced by the 
shopping mall, the dream of a free and open public world has been constrained 
by relentless privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Slip-covered construction materials wittily imply an effort to humanize our 
shared urban environment. But West's installation goes deeper than simple 
surface conceits. He's purposefully fashioned sofas for a convivial public 
living room, in which any and all are recognized as members of a communal 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of "Test" on a museum sculpture court is not essential to its 
artistic success. It would be as physically comfy, conceptually invigorating 
and just plain sportive in any of the dreary malls or public plazas that are 
today routinely built. But the museum site is also unusually resonant. 
</P>
<P>
 A museum, after all, is a public institution that collects art, while West's 
is public art that collects people. His deft reversal illuminates an 
enlightened role for a cultural venue -- especially these days, when the 
concept of a functioning public world seems increasingly bereft.

THEATER REVIEW; 'THE ALMOND SELLER': A HARD NUT TO CRACK; IN TRYING TO SAY TOO 
MUCH IN THIS DRAMA BASED ON HER NATIVE ROMANIA, THE PLAYWRIGHT DOESN'T SAY 
ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1990, playwright Oana-Maria Hock returned to her native Romania to see for 
herself the immense changes taking place. Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu 
was gone, and the freedom promised by the country's new leader, Ion Iliescu, 
looked like the same old totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Almond Seller," the play that resulted from Hock's odyssey, doesn't make 
a political statement. And that's all to its good. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Coast premiere production at UC Irvine's Fine Arts Studio Theatre, 
Hock's concerns are human. Her central figures are Toma, a young archeologist; 
Alexa, a miner; and the Widow's Daughter, an expatriate journalist come home to 
do a photo story on Romania's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio played together as children, alike as "brothers and sister." Their 
one meeting as adults bears the play's tragic main point. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is not enough time given by Hock to her three protagonists to find 
the dramatically viable humanity in their individual evolvement or in the 
bizarre circumstance of their final date with destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Her characters talk in events, even in their too-rare and too-brief scenes 
within Hock's structure, and they talk in philosophies. They have little 
concern with their own inner lives and, therefore, neither do we. 
</P>
<P>
 Hock has tried to say too much in her cinematic drama, and in so doing has 
managed to say less than she intended. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three Fates, gowned in blood red, who explain the creation of the 
universe, the stars, the planets and their satellites, all eventually resulting 
in Romania. Just when they are reaching their poetic point, a male figure 
crawls painfully before them, and when they ask why he has been beaten to 
death, he mumbles that he is Romanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the titular Almond Seller, Ion the Madman, appears. He is digging in a 
mass grave, looking for Romania's past, and finding its symbols in bone, 
chicken foot, wooden spoon and potato. Under the almond tree, he says, beneath 
the salty grass and the bones of those who went before, is a world of happy 
people. Presumably this is the world of monarch and peasant? 
</P>
<P>
 Time is wasted with three crones, including Toma and Alexa's grandmothers, 
bewailing the vegetable gardens that are gone; time is wasted with a hooker and 
her Italian tourist trick, a flamboyant mental patient, and time is wasted with 
a panoply of images that inform us about what was happening in Romania, without 
drawing us into the dramatic vortex of a people's soul, and the ties that bind 
Toma and Alexa and the Widow's Daughter but don't protect them from the social 
evils that destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 That is Hock's message -- the survival of a communal mind -- but she keeps its 
power from us with a design that is too complex and, in sum, too shallow. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Annie Loui has made a concerted effort to illuminate Hock's veiled 
icons, but her fine production can only provide what is in the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Sullivan's scenic design is imaginative and evocative, with its twisted 
wall and useful set pieces, L. Scott LeGrand's lighting is painterly, and 
Annaliese Baker's costumes are just right, as is Timothy Melbinger's sound 
design and original incidental music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jason Heil's Erratic Man, the mental patient, is overdone like a 
vaudeville turn, although the Fates (Heather Blackinton, Ali Hanson, Ann 
Shipley) have much less resonance in their recitation than they could have 
(they're better as the crones). Although some of the minor roles are more 
caricatured than characterized, the performers in the central roles try to give 
as much depth as they can to shadowy images. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Smith's Toma is powerful and intelligent, a heroic totem, and Pete 
Shilaimon's Alexa is a rock, solid and impregnable. If their performances have 
more stature and size than Lisa Colbert's frantic, scattered Widow's Daughter, 
they have more firm ground to work on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Barker has an interesting sense of calm as the Theatre Director, who is a 
born survivor, Marika Becz has a good honest fire burning inside her as Toma's 
girlfriend, and Thom Rivera makes much sense out of the blatherings of the 
mythic Almond Seller.

MUSIC REVIEW; SPIRITED CONCERT FROM GAY MEN'S CHORUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operatic concerts can be stodgy, stand-and-sing affairs, numerous excerpts 
parading by, with long stage waits and endless entrances and exits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the "Opera Our Way!" event performed Sunday afternoon by the Gay Men's 
Chorus of Los Angeles at its return to the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Not all the 
singing and playing was polished -- some of it was actually clunky and 
amateurish -- but pacing, visuals and continuity displayed a high standard of 
careful and astute planning. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one program a series of excerpts from the lyric theater (as we used 
to call the genre)? In 1994, very carefully, for what is, and what is not, 
operatic can be the subject of much controversy. Fearlessly, Jon Bailey, 
director of GMCLA, arranged an agenda of familiar and lesser-known pieces, all 
arguably operatic, performed as a vaudeville, with few stage waits and an 
engaging sense of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It included, of course, big choruses by Wagner and Verdi, appearances by a 
guest soprano and tenor, a couple of amusing operatic spoofs, a Gilbert & 
Sullivan sampler and, for a climactic closer, the Coronation Scene from 
Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the 170-member vocal ensemble sang handsomely and with spirit, 
with strong enunciation and presentable German and French. The singers did not 
always perform with restraint, and inconsistently differentiated between 
styles. The big, hearty, open sound one associates with male glee clubs is only 
one option in a possible palette of choral expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, all colors emerged well defined and tastefully coordinated: The 
stage was dressed in strong reds and blacks; a different lighting scheme had 
been devised for each piece; only some tentativeness in the use of spotlights 
marred the smoothness otherwise achieved. And the chorus members clearly knew 
what they were about -- their moves and gestures reflected an almost military 
precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Soprano Carmen Tejada sang arias from "Forza del Destino," "Fledermaus" and 
"Carmen" (Habanera) with inconsistent results. Daniel Ebbers, the guest tenor 
soloist, offered excerpts from "Sweeney Todd" and "Mikado." 
</P>
<P>
 The programmed encore was a choralized "Nessun dorma," from "Turandot," sung 
in a lowered transposition. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Divas! Opera Our Way!" will be performed twice, Saturday, at 4 and 8 p.m., 
at the Alex Theatre, 216 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Tickets: $18-$25.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; KAY STARR, THE MILLS: VITAL, IMPORTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The concert featuring Kay Starr and John & Donald Mills at the Academy Plaza 
Theatre on Sunday was designed, according to the producers, "for the older 
audience." A shortsighted view -- especially for the younger music fans who 
also should be urged to hear these important and still vital artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr's work in the '50s paralleled Elvis Presley's blending of blues, country 
and pop. A good example: her reading on Sunday of Willie Nelson's "Crazy" with 
a country sob and an R&B articulation. On her own hits, "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"Bonaparte's Retreat," the 71-year-old Starr's burry-edged voice and strong 
rhythms reminded how powerfully the energized singing of her salad years 
contrasted with the sweet sounds of such contemporaries as Doris Day, Jo 
Stafford and Dinah Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mills Brothers were the first African American group to achieve 
across-the-board pop acceptance. Donald Mills, 69, the last surviving member, 
now works as a duo with his son, John. Remarkably, father and son produced 
interpretations that had the character, swing and smoothness of the original 
quartet. DON HECKMAN

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'TESS' TOPS 'JACK,' 'ACE' AND 'ANGIE'

 "Guarding Tess," a comedy pairing Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas Cage, scored 
the best of the three new arrivals at the box office during the weekend, 
beating the Paul Hogan comedy "Lightning Jack." Business was softer for the 
third of the bunch, "The Ref," with Denis Leary, Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey. 
</P>
<P>

 At least they're unlikely to bump into another tour group there: The American 
Institute of Architects convention, to be held in L.A. in May, will offer 
several "professional tours," including one called, "The Real L.A." One of the 
stops on that jaunt will be "the flash point of the 1992 riots."

 Freeways we hate and the motorists who use them: A colleague saw a license 
plate that declared HATE 405 -- on the Golden State Freeway. Meanwhile, we saw 
where former President Richard Nixon recently said of the traffic in Moscow: 
"It's worse than the Santa Ana Freeway." Moving on to surface streets, it seems 
as though UCLA has some nerve-racking stretches, too, judging from the photo 
taken by Martin Waterman of Eagle Rock.

 Built-in problem: One small cause of concern at the convention of the Anxiety 
Disorders Assn. of America will be the meeting site, Loew's Santa Monica Beach 
Hotel. It has a large central atrium ringed by five floors of guest and meeting 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ADAA meeting draws not only researchers and clinicians but also people 
who suffer from anxiety disorders, such as fear of heights," explained Robert 
Finn, spokesman for the Thursday-through-Sunday event. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he pointed out, ADAA founder Jerilyn Ross, director of the Ross 
Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in Washington D.C., "is herself 
bothered by heights," Finn added. "But ADAA volunteers will be roaming the 
halls, ready to assist anyone who may be experiencing panic attacks while at 
the conference."

<P>
 Needless to say, the ADAA will not be visiting the corner of Florence and 
Normandie.

 Cloud fallout: The winning letter in our Mystery Photo contest came from Cecil 
Rose of Carson, who correctly identified the model of the never-built Steel 
Cloud. That's the sculpture that was supposed to be installed Downtown -- over 
Nixon's favorite freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's entry was among several correct ones that were postmarked the morning 
of March 8. (Unfortunately, postmarks no longer record the time that letters 
are received -- just "A.M." or "P.M.") Only in L.A.'s judges, a trusting group, 
pointed out that Rose had the earliest time typed on his letter (6:51 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 He receives from our Cave of Wonders one never-before-used media freebie -- a 
"Car-Pool Survival Kit" from a West Hollywood company called Urban Inversion. 
The contents include air and breath fresheners and, to combat that inveterate 
talker in your car pool, aspirins and earplugs.

 Another dangerous side effect of television: Noelia Rodriguez was at her first 
event as Mayor Richard Riordan's press secretary -- a round-table discussion at 
Reseda High School -- when she was struck in the head by a television crew's 
camera. She was so dazed that she was treated at a hospital as a precaution. 
Rodriguez, who formerly worked for Southern California Edison, said: "I might 
have to start wearing my old hard hat to work." miscelLAny:

 Barbie turned 35 on March 9, but an official with El Segundo-based Mattel told 
Reuters that the company doesn't use the word "birthday" in connection with the 
perky blonde. "She's whatever age a child wants her to be," the official said. 
That's the same policy Only in L.A. observes when our 5-year-old daughter 
guesses that we're 35.

RAPIST GETS 159 YEARS FOR ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-felon convicted of sexually assaulting six women and one man was 
sentenced today to more than 159 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Monette Johnson of Lake View Terrace a "menace to society," Superior 
Court Judge John Fisher sentenced him to the maximum term for the crimes he 
committed during a roughly seven-month spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 35, was convicted last month of eight counts of rape and five other 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-man, five-woman jury also found him guilty of six counts each of 
robbery and burglary, and a single charge of receiving stolen property. The 
panel deliberated less than two days.  
</P>
<P>
 "He should be taken off the streets and never set free again," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Phillip Rabichow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson will be eligible for parole in 79 years and eight months, Rabichow 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Johnson stalked his victims before breaking into their San 
Fernando Valley-area homes and sexually assaulting and robbing them. The 
attacks occurred between July, 1991, and his arrest on Jan. 9, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has a lengthy rap sheet, had been released on parole after 
serving time for extortion before his first attack, Rabichow said.

AL MARTINEZ: WHERE RON AND FRANK EAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time I wrote about an Italian restaurant an anonymous caller who 
sounded faintly Mafioso threatened to hand me back my nose. 
</P>
<P>
 As I thought about it, it occurred to me he would somehow have to gain 
temporary possession of my nose in order to return it to me. 
</P>
<P>
 That evoked images of having the appendage ripped from my face, a situation I 
found ultimately unappealing. I decided, therefore, to abandon the business of 
critiquing Italian restaurants. It wasn't worth my nose. 
</P>
<P>
 But then I heard about Matteo's. It is a place where old comics, old singers 
and old presidents chow down on veal picatta, linguine and clams, osso buco and 
other savory collations of a Roman nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Old gangsters used to go there, too, but the best-known ones, like Mickey 
Cohen and Sam Giancana, have long since gone off to their eternal shootouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jimmy Hoffa stuffed himself at Matteo's with pasta smothered in a spicy 
puttenesca sauce before he vanished in a cloud of cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Spiro Agnew . . . they have all eaten at Matteo's 
at one time or another, according to its owner, Matteo Giordano, who calls 
himself Matty Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Matty is a tough, growling 70-year-old who grew up in Hoboken across the 
street from Frank Sinatra and, in fact, was delivered into this world by 
Sinatra's mother, a midwife. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 5 feet, 8 inches tall, smokes three packs of Camels a day, is married to 
a beautiful young wife and runs the place like a combat tank officer. A 
photograph on the wall is doctored to make him look like George Patton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Matteo's has been in business on Westwood Boulevard since 1963. It is an L.A. 
landmark, one of the last of the bistros to endure in the postmodern age of 
anguished cool. 
</P>
<P>
 I was introduced to it through bail bondsman Joey Barnum, who goes there just 
about every Sunday night, as do most of those who eat at Matteo's; people like 
Phyllis Diller, Milton Berle, Rodney Dangerfield and Henny Youngman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every other night they go to Beverly Hills, where they can smoke," Matty said 
to me as we sat in one of the red imitation-leather booths. Red is the dominant 
color of the place, except for the chandeliers and the art on the wall, which 
is neopasticcio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dying because of the no-smoking laws, if you get my meaning. Whiskey is 
down 65%. I don't know what the hell we're going to do. You know what I mean? 
They started coming here on Sunday because every other place was closed. Now 
we're packed on Sundays and empty on Wednesdays." 
</P>
<P>
 I went to Matteo's when I heard Sinatra ate there. He sits in a corner booth 
surrounded by a warm glow of fame while others sneak glances and whisper of His 
Presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes in with actor friends, the old guys," Matty said. "He used to be a 
son of a bitch and had a barricade around him. You understand what I'm saying? 
Eddie Pucci was his bodyguard. Now he gives autographs and says hello to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I went to Matteo's, before I knew about Sinatra going there, I 
sat in that very same corner booth. Frank's booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," I said to my wife Cinelli, "I thought I felt a kind of warmth 
radiating up through my behind, if you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave it alone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Matteo's on a Sunday night is a noisy, friendly place. Table-hopping and 
waving at friends across the room are the order of the day. I met Cher's mom 
there once. Our conversation was not three minutes old when she informed me she 
was celibate. Cinelli smiled and said, "How nice," and led me away. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer Maurice Duke, who is full of bombast and goodwill, was there a 
few Sundays ago. So were Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who were sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "What're you eating?" Duke shouted to Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huh?" Reagan replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "WHAT'RE YOU EATING?" the Duke shouted even louder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huh?" Reagan said again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duke was ready to bellow at him a third time, by now determined to find 
out what the 40th President of the United States was eating, when Nancy 
whispered in her husband's ear and he replied amiably, "Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 " Beckerman chicken!" Matty shouted from another part of the crowded dining 
room. Sidney Beckerman is also a producer. If you're famous and/or loyal, your 
name might appear on the menu along with your favorite dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the exchange, Reagan stood and shook the Duke's hand and everyone 
went back to eating. 
</P>
<P>
 While not always full of wit and philosophy, Matteo's is my kind of place. I 
like it. That may not be a ringing endorsement, but it ought to keep the nose 
on my face for a while . . . if you get my meaning.

THE FAULT IS IN THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown has accused Gov. Pete Wilson of being 
responsible for the imminent release of a convict who admits raping more than 
100 women. The governor has responded by denying the allegation and vigorously 
defending his record on fighting crime. This is the sort of thing you get in a 
gubernatorial election year. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are that in 1982 one Melvin A. Carter was sentenced to 25 years in 
prison after he was convicted of 12 rapes. Because of sentence reductions for 
good behavior and working in prison, he is scheduled to be released on parole 
this week from Soledad Prison after serving just half the 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend gubernatorial candidate Brown charged that bumbling by Gov. Pete 
Wilson's Department of Corrections is allowing Carter to be released now. At 
issue is a technical dispute about the length of Carter's original prison term. 
Suffice to say that Wilson claims it is the trial judge, not the 
Administration, that is responsible for any error; the governor adds that 
indeed he has tried, without success, to prevent the release. Wilson, insisting 
he is far from soft on criminals, notes that he has endorsed life imprisonment 
for first-time rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that California law does permit Carter to be released although he 
has served only half his sentence. That outrages many Californians -- 
understandably, Carter's long string of rapes over more than a decade raises 
fear that he remains dangerous. For his part, the governor maintains that his 
office will take every possible measure to strictly supervise Carter once he is 
paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma posed by Melvin Carter is but a preview of those that await 
California when the newly enacted "three-strikes" law begins to fill state 
prisons with "lifers." Without enough beds, something or someone will have to 
give. This week, it's Melvin Carter. Next week, it's anybody's guess. The 
Carter flap needs to be understood in that context. 
</P>
<P>
 The main solution of the politicians -- whether Democratic or Republican, it 
seems -- is longer, more inflexible prison terms and more prison beds. But if 
that is the only answer to the crime problem, before long California will be a 
state in which prisons are the No. 1 domestic product. The thought makes for a 
depressing moment as the gubernatorial debate unofficially starts.

EDUCATION WATCH; TAFT'S HOT SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although students at Taft High School in Woodland Hills fared better than 
their state and county counterparts on the rigorous new California Learning 
Assessment System tests, the school's performance on the CLAS tests was nothing 
to crow about. Nonetheless, Taft offers an example of how students who work 
hard and who have supportive parents can receive an excellent education in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District: Last weekend a nine-member team of Taft 
students outdistanced public school -- and private school -- competitors in 
winning the state Academic Decathlon.It was Taft's fourth victory since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Decathlon tests students in 10 events that include math and science 
subjects. West High School of Torrance finished second. In the U.S. Academic 
Decathlon last year, Taft students finished second, and the school won that 
national competition in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In another achievement, Taft's overall student population recently perform 
admirably on advanced placement exams, with more than 72% scoring well enough 
to receive college credit for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's overall tepid scores on the CLAS were among disappointing figures 
recorded by public schools around the state -- figures that have fueled 
parental interest in switching children to private schools. However, Taft's 
victory in the state Decathlon indicates that this is no time to give up on the 
public schools. As Supt. Sid Thompson puts it to parents, "If your youngster is 
motivated and you provide the support, we can provide a good education. . . ." 
Those hot shots at Taft are a case in point.

 * In the exercise of my First Amendment right of expression, I take great 
exception to the view of Nat Hentoff (Column Left, March 8), that the 
condemnation by Congress of the rabidly anti-Semitic and racist remarks of 
Nation of Islam spokesperson Khalid Abdul Muhammad were inconsistent with the 
constitutional right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Amendment provides that, "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging 
the freedom of speech." By contrast, the congressional condemnation of 
Muhammad's Kean College speech took the form of a non-binding resolution, not a 
piece of legislation. It was therefore a measured and much-needed response to 
Muhammad's blood libel of the Jewish people and his call for the death of 
whites (including children and the disabled). Indeed, in this most powerful of 
democracies, it is not just the right but the duty of a free Congress to 
repudiate Muhammad's message with the nonviolent weaponry of words. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentoff quotes with approval the fears of Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), that 
throughout the world, Muhammad's speech will now forever be known as one 
"condemned by the U.S. Congress." Such a possibility fills me with pride, not 
fear. One can only wish that the Congress of the 1930s had condemned the 
fighting words of Adolf Hitler with the same language found in the resolution 
now bemoaned by Hentoff. How many innocent people -- Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, gays 
and others -- might then have been saved?

 * As a writer, I am generally in agreement with Hentoff's unequivocal defenses 
of free speech. But his criticism of Congress' resolution condemning the 
address given by Muhammad is just mystifying to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress can certainly be hypocritical, insincere and 
muddle-headed, but as long as what they're doing doesn't have the force of law, 
I don't think there's much to be concerned about. Impotent resolutions like the 
one they passed here amount to nothing more than speech countering speech. 
Hentoff's concern that congressional condemnation of speeches might lead to a 
chilling effect on speech ignores this point. Congress can resolve to its 
heart's content, and as long as that's all it's doing, and Hentoff or anyone 
else can resolve right back at them. It's only when Congress legislates about 
speech that we should start to worry.

'MISSING' QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Scientists Searching for 'Missing' Quakes," March 3: 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lucile Jones should have her knuckles rapped for testifying about Southern 
California earthquakes in Washington prior to sharing her information with the 
people of Southern California. Since Jan. 17, Jones has been very good about 
reassuring the people of Southern California: "This is a very normal series of 
aftershocks.There is no hard evidence that stress has been increased or 
decreased along the San Andreas fault." 
</P>
<P>
 But now we learn, not from a local press conference, but from coverage of a 
House subcommittee hearing, that our area is in for "at least five more 
earthquakes as large as the Northridge earthquake," or that "we are building up 
the stress to a much larger earthquake," or that faults are slipping without 
causing earthquakes (a phenomenon not yet observed in California). 
</P>
<P>
 I think that Jones has been speaking from two sides of her mouth: Southern 
Californians get reassurance, while congressmen get the true picture from her 
research. Her presentation to the subcommittee was a pitch for funding. And it 
was, simultaneously, an insult to the intelligence of Southern Californians.

JAILED DOG OWNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Am I supposed to feel sorry for Robert Lewis, who spent four days in jail 
for assuming that he was too good to answer a summons to appear in court (March 
8)? 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis admits that he has known for eight years that he was required to license 
his dog, but he was "too busy." This scofflaw and his daughter also think it is 
perfectly all right to allow their dog to roam free "twice a week to chase 
cats." My cat was killed recently in her own back yard by two marauding dogs. 
Lewis is completely lacking in responsibility to his pet as well as to his 
neighbors.

SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Alain Enthoven and Sara Singer, in their comments on the "One Huge Flaw of 
Single Payer" (Commentary, March 8) have demonstrated how the intellects of our 
society can lose all perspective by rigidly adhering to their own ideology and 
ignoring the real world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not realize that there are not two, but three great crises in health 
care in America: severe impairment of universal access, exploding costs and, 
now, significant deterioration of the quality system we have enjoyed, produced 
by the same market forces that they so strongly tout. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry and its managed-care subsidiaries, by using market 
forces, are destroying the quality of our health-care system. Because of 
competition, they sell their product at discount. They meet all of their 
overhead expenses. They retain their profit. They then contract with 
organizations, such as independent practice associations (IPAs), which, in 
turn, also meet their overhead and retain their profits. The providers, 
physicians and hospitals, then have additional overhead expenses handling the 
complicated requirements, such as prior authorization procedures and rigid 
billing processes. These extraneous middlemen expenses, in their fullest 
expression, are now consuming 30% of the discounted health-care dollar. This 
has left us with inadequate funds to provide proper medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The current market-driven insurance system has proven to be far more 
expensive, and far more evil, than any governmental bureaucracy could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 Any system can mandate universal access. Only a single-payer system, with a 
budget cap, can control costs, and, yet, maintain a quality health-care system, 
by directing the funds into patient care, rather than presenting them on a 
platter to greedy third-party payers.

 * A major problem with discussions of the President's health reform program is 
that most everyone articulate enough to present newsworthy opinions is already 
covered by some form of health insurance. They do not need the plan for 
themselves. This means they are talking about getting something for someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder they ask, "Can we afford it?" 
</P>
<P>
 What they mean is "Can we afford to spend our money for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the attitude should be, "Unless everyone is covered, no one is 
covered." That would end the discussions and bring action in a hurry.

be wonderful for the consumer!

 * It is richly ironic that President Clinton is trying to generate support 
among the elderly for his health-care reform plan by promising them free 
medicine and long-term care. In fact, the elderly will be hurt substantially 
under his proposal. The President is proposing enormous cutbacks in Medicare 
spending and intends to strictly limit health-care spending. When the medical 
care budget is rigidly fixed, it is obvious that fewer services will be 
provided. This inevitably means rationing, and the elderly are the most 
vulnerable group. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the elderly are wise enough to see through the empty political 
promises contained in the President's plan.

 * Hillary Rodham Clinton's mean-spirited and irrational attacks on the drug 
companies ignore the critical question of who will provide the clinical 
research and development for new drugs, which have been a hallmark of advances 
in medical therapy in the past several years. Due to the drug companies' 
activities in this field, we now have superior anti-hypertensive drugs, which 
have prolonged the lives of those suffering from hypertension and associated 
complications and have almost eliminated strokes as a cause of death. Another 
example is the development of useful chemotherapy and antibiotics. Nowhere in 
the Clinton proposal is provision made for continuation of such research and 
development of new drugs and techniques. And, by the way, whatever happened to 
President Clinton's repeated promises for tort reform during his campaign? This 
was a popular promise and drew much support for him; however, since his 
election, he has been notably silent in this area. It appears that he is in the 
trial lawyers' pocket, because of their very large financial contributions to 
his campaign.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: FACE UP TO PERMANENT JOBLESSNESS; EMPLOYERS 
NEED FEWER WORKERS, RETRAINED OR NOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone sitting here in the United States -- in Detroit, for example -- and 
thinking about jobs would do well to look eastward to Europe and then south to 
Chiapas. There's the future writ large. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, we find all the elements in place for what the Clinton 
Administration, notably Labor Secretary Robert Reich, deems to be the recipe 
for good jobs at high wages: training or retraining to produce highly skilled 
and productive workers. Germany has plenty of training schemes, a skilled work 
force and a stagnant economy with high rates of unemployment. The Reich 
equation between training, productivity and employment simply isn't working. At 
the turn of the year, Germany's official unemployment rate was over 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an alternative model to the one proffered by Reich, and it has been 
around considerably longer. Developed by Karl Marx, it's called the reserve 
army of the unemployed. Unemployed labor in a capitalist economy acts as the 
employers' bludgeon held over workers asking for better pay, job security or 
benefits. There's someone around who will work for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the past decade, the reserve army has been swelling as companies in 
search of higher productivity ruthlessly prune workers and export jobs to cut 
costs. Technology has extorted an additional toll. 
</P>
<P>
 This carnage is applauded vigorously by apostles of market magic; later, 
there's a macabre irony in finding these same apostles waking up to the fact 
that more people living on the dole means fewer people buying goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the aggregate, companies have been firing their customers," Eric 
Greenburg, of American Management Associations recently told the magazine 
Global Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same article, David Roche, who works for the investment banking firm 
Morgan Stanley in London, marries Marx to John Maynard Keynes when he says, 
"Investors love long dole queues as long as they're reducing costs and not 
damaging demand. But eventually there is a certain length of a dole queue which 
causes a reversal of this perception." 
</P>
<P>
 High unemployment rates and stagnant wages precipitate declines in consumption 
and thus usher in deflation, as Keynes pointed out 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Keynes didn't live to see the advent of the global economy, which renders moot 
his strategies for reflation and full employment in the industrialized 
countries. There are 4 billion new skilled workers in China, India and Brazil 
prepared to do the same job as European or North American workers, at 10% of 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessmen ruthlessly following market rules sometimes have a clear notion of 
where their ruthlessness is leading. Percy Barnevik, a Swede who heads ABB, the 
world's largest power-engineering group, runs a transnational enterprise that 
operates freely across borders and, in the admiring words of the London 
Financial Times, "is at home in all the 140 countries in which it operates, yet 
owes fealty to none." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1988 and 1992, ABB shed 50,000 jobs while increasing sales by 60%, to 
$28.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnevik predicted last year that the proportion of Europe's labor force 
employed in manufacturing and business services will fall from 35% to 25% by 
the end of the century and to 15% a decade further on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where will all those people go? Out they will go, because we don't need 
them," Barnevik told the Financial Times. "If anybody tells me, wait two or 
three years and there will be a hell of a demand for labor, I say, tell me 
where. What jobs? In what cities? What companies? . . . We end up with 
permanent unemployment or underemployment, or with two classes of differently 
paid people. Both are social dynamite."  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Chiapas. The Indians in Chiapas rose up on New Year's Day 
because they faced economic extinction, what they called the "death sentence" 
of cheap corn imports from the United States and Canada permitted under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 So, was that rising the last of old-style Latin America guerrilla movements, 
or was it an augury of the new fissures opening up in the global economy? 
</P>
<P>
 Those strategists of new employment in Detroit and elsewhere had better think 
big, about shortened work weeks, about a social wage, about the coming 
permanent absence of jobs. Job, by the way, is defined in the larger Oxford 
English Dictionary as being of "unascertained origin" and only "a small, 
definite piece of work" that doesn't last long.  
</P>
<P>
 Retraining isn't going to do it, as the capitalists for whom Reich works know. 
The real strategy is prison construction to provide a few jobs penning in the 
ever-growing desperate and dangerous classes.

PERSPECTIVE ON SCHOOLS; LETTING PARENTS RULE IS NO ANSWER; THE LAUSD NEEDS TO 
BE REORGANIZED AND REFOCUSED; IT DOESN'T NEED NEW FACES IN THE FAILING OLD 
STRUCTURE. 
</P>

 To be a parent of a student in the Los Angeles Unified School District is to 
know the meaning of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parents have submitted an 11-page report to the district that 
spells out their frustration with a system that is unresponsive and often 
disdainful of them. But the report's recommendations, while understandable, do 
not address the fundamental problem facing the second-largest school district 
in the nation -- how to successfully educate students so that they will have 
real options and opportunities in the coming global society.  
</P>
<P>
 The parents' recommendations for how LAUSD is to be organized and governed 
suggest that the answer to educational excellence lies in turning over control 
of the district to parents. On the surface, this is a seductive argument, but a 
flawed solution. The endless war by adults for control of this district is a 
distraction. It gets in the way of the real discussion and work that needs to 
begin, in a serious way, in LAUSD -- raising student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 The other troubling aspect of the set of recommendations is that it flies in 
the face of LEARN, the district's program for the reorganization of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN (the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now) is the 
concept presented to the LAUSD two years ago by a working group augmented by 
more than 600 community trustees from every walk of life who believe that the 
basic problem facing the district is the plethora of rules and compliances it 
is bound by. The recommendations proposed by the parents' group last week 
attempt to flesh out the vagueness of the LEARN plan. The uniqueness of the 
LEARN plan is its intentional vagueness -- which could also be viewed as its 
greatest weakness, if people misunderstand the fundamental concept. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN is not about student achievement as much as it is about a process that, 
if allowed to take root, can ultimately lead to academic excellence for all 
students. I am most concerned about the academic achievement of African 
American, Latino and other students of color in a district that has done 
miserably by them to this point. LEARN is an attempt to change a 
compliance-driven bureaucracy to an outcome-driven district responsive to the 
needs of students, parents, teachers and administrators at the school site, 
where instruction is delivered. It is an invitation to work collaboratively 
across interest groups to build a climate and a culture at each school and 
within each school cluster that meets the unique needs of that community's 
student learners. It is an invitation to set aside the hostile, adversarial, 
inflexible attitudes that have haunted this district -- attitudes that have 
hardened as its clients have become more and more people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 The intention of LEARN is to provide a process, not a blueprint, for 
discussion, careful thought, incisive critiquing, risk-taking and ultimately 
the action necessary to build school communities where all children will learn. 
Each school community receives training that arms a principal, a lead teacher 
and a parent representative with introductory skills to be effective leaders of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN is a way out of the morass of compliances, rules and regulations that 
now suffocate any attempt to change outcomes for students. Last week's 
recommendations to the LAUSD would lead us back down that path -- no change in 
mentality, only in the power players. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent group's recommendations would let the district off the hook. It is 
the district's job to develop sound education policy and find the resources to 
implement its policies. The district must retrain its employees so that they 
can deliver a world-class curriculum complete with standards and accountability 
that end disparity of achievement by race, gender, socioeconomic and linguistic 
group. There must be consequences for failure. It is our job, as parents, 
community members, citizens and taxpayers to watch, critique, participate, 
educate and organize ourselves in such a way that if change does not occur, or 
change that we are satisfied with, we can take corrective action swiftly.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JOSEPH FARAH: LIMIT SPENDING TO PERPETUATE INCUMBENCY; 
CHALLENGERS, WITHOUT OFFICIAL PERQUISITES, WOULD SUFFER.

<P>
 Tom Hayden was wrong about Vietnam. He was wrong about socialism. He was wrong 
about Big Green. He's been wrong about so many things that it's difficult to 
keep track.  
</P>
<P>
 But all of a sudden, Tom Hayden, the Rodney Dangerfield of California 
politics, is getting some respect. His Don Quixote- style bid to become the 
next governor or, at least, to reform our corrupt political system in the 
process, is actually getting positive reviews. Everybody seems to agree that 
campaign spending is out of control and that there should be additional 
restrictions on political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's tempting to attack Hayden on the ground of hypocrisy, given his own 
record of buying Assembly and Senate seats. But that would be too easy -- and 
miss the point. The point is this: Once again, Hayden is just plain wrong. As 
righteous as they might sound, imposing stricter limits on political spending 
and moving toward greater reliance on public financing are bad ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 Why? Well, for starters, they're predicated on a myth -- the idea that 
spending limits are needed to stimulate greater competition and protect poor 
challengers from high-rolling incumbents. The reality is that spending limits 
would represent the greatest incumbent-protection racket ever devised. 
Remember, between elections the officeholder has the advantage of sending out 
mass mailings to constituents at public expense. It's the incumbent who can use 
the office to strengthen name identification with voters. Clearly, it's the 
challenger who needs extra help at election time. If we're after 
competitiveness, we're handicapping the wrong horse by placing arbitrary caps 
on spending.  
</P>
<P>
 The only alternative to tighter controls on contributions and spending is more 
taxpayer-supported campaign financing. But this so-called reform has been an 
unmitigated disaster and has actually resulted in even more extravagant 
campaign spending. After all, if every dollar you spend is going to be matched 
by the taxpayer, the government is merely encouraging more profligate spending. 
In effect, public financing just subsidizes the most well-funded campaigns.  
</P>
<P>
 It also permits something even more pernicious. It allows extremist fringe 
candidates -- people like, say, David Duke and Tom Hayden -- to spend taxpayer 
dollars espousing divisiveness and lies. This is America, and even Duke and 
Hayden should be allowed to have their say and run for office. But why should I 
be forced to bankroll their campaigns? Why should victims of racism have to 
subsidize Duke? Why should the taxpayer dollars of Vietnam veterans be diverted 
to the Hayden-for-governor campaign? That's what public financing does.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and his born-again campaign-reform movement would tell you that 
limiting contributions is a way to check "special interests." The most powerful 
special interest in our state today is the California Teachers Assn. It spends 
millions on political campaigns -- money it collects from all public-school 
teachers, whether they like it or not. Now, I'm as opposed to that kind of 
coercion and power-brokering as anyone. But the way to stop it is not to limit 
what the CTA can spend, it's to deny any organization the right to extort money 
from people who have no choice. Watch how fast that "special interest" 
reservoir dries up when involuntary dues become illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing inherently evil about political contributions. In fact, money 
is not only "the mother's milk of politics," as Jesse Unruh used to say, it's 
also the pavement on the information superhighway. Without it there is no 
advertising, no direct-mail campaigns and no political literature. In other 
words, there's no communication, no challenge to the status quo, no exchange of 
ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 California is a big place. A candidate for statewide office can't walk 
door-to-door and expect to get a message out. Television and other expensive 
mass media are indispensable. So by limiting the amount a candidate can spend, 
we are, in effect, placing restrictions on the most basic form of 
constitutionally protected free speech. That may be the most important reason 
of all to oppose the kind of "reform" Hayden has in mind.  
</P>
<P>
 No system is ever going to be perfect. But big-government edicts and 
regulations never solve our most serious problems. In fact, they usually make 
them worse. And they always deprive us of freedom. Hayden may enliven the 
Democratic gubernatorial primary. But let's not get too caught up in his cause 
du jour. After all, his track record is hardly impressive.

WAS FOULED ON LAST PLAY OF 102-101 LOSS TO JAZZ. 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, yeah. That was really what the Lakers needed Monday night, as if all the 
injuries and the losing this season hadn't been enough. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a stretch in which seven of 10 games were on the road, 18 points 
down, they had to battle back against one of the NBA's hottest teams and its 
hot-tempered owner. 
</P>
<P>
 They stood up to the Utah Jazz and didn't shy away when owner Larry Miller 
forgot he was supposed to be watching the game and instead became part of it. 
But when the Lakers looked for help from the few impartial people in the Delta 
Center, the referees, they didn't get it and wound up with a 102-101 loss that 
ended a three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Last play first: After two free throws by John Stockton with 20 seconds to 
play gave the Jazz the lead, the Lakers called time out. Sedale Threatt, the 
first option for the final shot, brought the ball upcourt, but was closed off 
by Jeff Hornacek, forcing a pass to Vlade Divac. Divac got the ball to Nick Van 
Exel on the right side with about four seconds remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel headed left and, with the clock at two seconds, threw a wild shot 
from the top of the key that didn't come close. He thought it was because 
Stockton had hit his right shoulder, but the officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got an all-star player (Stockton), we don't have one," Divac said after 
another strong showing of 19 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. "That's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 So ended the comeback from 18 points down in the first quarter, when the Jazz 
shot 73.9%, and 18 again in the second before the Lakers trimmed the deficit to 
58-53 by halftime. The Lakers carried that momentum into the second half, 
taking a 60-58 lead when Threatt sank a three-pointer with 9:41 to play in the 
third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers led, 68-66, after Van Exel made back-to-back three-pointers -- he 
made five overall -- when Miller time started. Upset that Elden Campbell 
elbowed Stockton while fighting through a screen -- officials instantly called 
a technical -- the owner rose from his courtside seat not far from where the 
incident took place and shouted at the Laker forward. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of thing is nothing new for Miller. Before the Jazz moved out of the 
Salt Palace before the 1991-92 season, he sat next to the opponent's bench and 
yelled at coaches and players so furiously that he was admonished by 
Commissioner David Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he was so upset at the 6-foot-11 Campbell that another fan grabbed 
Miller's arm in a restraining manner, while Coach Randy Pfund ran over from the 
visitors' bench to ensure the Lakers had a voice in all this. 
</P>
<P>
 "He swung at him (Stockton) and I just told him he should pick on somebody his 
own size," said Miller. "He (Campbell) said, 'Who are you (talking to)?' I 
said, 'You.' He came over and wanted to discuss it a little more. It was 
nothing serious. We had a couple untoward comments." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller could have been ejected, but wasn't, maybe because he didn't step over 
the sideline and onto the court, and maybe because he owns the building. 
Campbell said he was shocked at first and found the whole thing "sort of 
funny." And if Miller had turned it into a physical confrontation? 
</P>
<P>
 "KO first round," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 It never happened, of course. The only ones not standing at the end were the 
Lakers.

NBA ROUNDUP; CELTICS GET MUGGED BY BOGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dee Brown learned a lesson that other guards have known for 10 years: You 
can't turn your back on Muggsy Bogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogues made a key steal in the closing seconds of regulation, then scored four 
points in the final 40 seconds of overtime to rally the Charlotte Hornets to a 
107-101 victory over the Boston Celtics Monday night at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersey Hawkins converted Bogues' steal into a layup with 19.5 seconds left to 
force the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogues even warned Brown that he would lose the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I was going to get it," Bogues said. "He peeked at the shot 
clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 108, Sacramento 102 -- Isiah Thomas scored 20 of his 22 points in the 
first half and Terry Mills had 20 points for the Pistons at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit outscored the Kings, 35-25, in the fourth quarter. Joe Dumars, who had 
been averaging 32 points in his last four games, scored only 16, but his 
three-pointer with 44 seconds left gave the Pistons a 104-98 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 116, San Antonio 88 -- Mahmoud Abdul Rauf scored a season-high 33 
points to lead the Nuggets to an easy victory over the Spurs at Denver. David 
Robinson had a season-low eight points.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HARD-HIT MARTINEZ SAYS HE WILL BE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez has spent the spring working on his pitching mechanics, but 
whatever he's doing, it isn't working. On Monday against the Florida Marlins at 
Melbourne, Fla., Martinez gave up eight runs on seven hits, including two home 
runs, in only four innings. His spring earned-run average swelled from 9.00 to 
12.27. The Dodgers lost, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three or four more starts this spring, and I'll be fine when the 
season starts," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said he is not worried about 
Martinez or any of the other veterans who are spending the spring getting into 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ramon threw with good velocity today, but not good location," Claire said. "I 
would be concerned if there was a physical problem, but as good as he threw 
last year, it's a matter of him throwing between starts and dealing with his 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Dodgers' five starting pitchers were durable last season -- none 
missed a start -- they were not consistently effective. The entire pitching 
staff had the third-lowest ERA in the league, but Pedro Astacio was the only 
starter with a winning record, 14-9. Tom Candiotti pitched much better than his 
8-10 record showed, but suffered from low-run production. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to see someone step up and take the lead," Claire said. "In order to 
have a big-time season, you have to have a big-time performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser said he is starting to throw his fastball for the first time in 
two seasons. And Kevin Gross, who is recovering from tendinitis in his right 
shoulder, will make his spring debut Sunday. Both Claire and Manager Tom 
Lasorda said that if Gross is not ready, there are others in the organization 
who can step in. Claire mentioned Chan Ho Park and Greg Hansell, but neither 
appears ready at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there are no standouts among the six left-handed relievers, Lasorda 
said. The Dodgers need an effective lefty in the bullpen, is a something the 
Dodger need, but Lasorda said he's not sure if the club will carry one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to make a decision," whether to carry a left-hander or not," 
Lasorda said. "If we have a right-hander who is pitching better than a 
left-hander, do we take the left-hander? We are not just going to bring him 
along because he's left-handed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he agrees with Ed Vargo, the director of National League umpires, 
that Park is not violating any rules with his hesitation moves on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything he is doing that is wrong and it's not even a penalty," 
Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargo said he would probably take the issue to the rules committee, but unless 
an interpretation is rendered, it is sure to cause problems when Park pitches. 
Veteran umpires who have seen Park pitch say he is in clear violation. Park 
will pitch again on Thursday against the New York Mets, who raised the issue. 
Met batters called time three times while in the box the first time Park 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza's home run in the fourth inning against pitcher Mike Gardner 
cleared the right-field scoreboard, a $90,000 apparatus that explodes when a 
Marlin hits a home run. Piazza has hit all four of his home runs this spring 
against the Marlins. . . . Carlos Hernandez, who had arthroscopic surgery in 
his right shoulder during the winter, made his spring debut Monday. Lasorda 
said Hernandez should be ready to back up Piazza when the season starts, but if 
he isn't, Tom Prince might be. Prince, 29, who played in the Pittsburgh 
organization the last 10 seasons, is batting .455 in 11 at-bats and has 
impressed the club with his throwing accuracy. MARYANN HUDSON

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: THIS COACH NEEDS TO CURB HIS TEMPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary McKnight has exceeded expectations as the boys' basketball coach at Santa 
Ana Mater Dei High. In 12 seasons, his teams have won nine Southern Section 
titles and two State championships. Many of his players have received college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is time, however, for the colorful coach to move on. His winning 
program is like a train out of control. He needs to take his energy and 
knowledge and channel them in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight's behavior has become erratic, often to the point where he is 
embarrassing himself and his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday night, Mater Dei played Crenshaw in the Southern Regional 
Division I title game before a large crowd and a live television audience at 
Anaheim Arena. The real action was on the Mater Dei bench, however, where 
McKnight acted like anything but a veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy over the officiating from the opening whistle, McKnight displayed his 
anger the entire evening. He seldom sat down and occasionally walked outside 
the coach's box. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a technical foul in the first quarter and probably should have had 
another any number of times. He used profanity freely, which was clearly heard 
by anyone standing within 50 yards of him. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point he yelled at Dean Crowley, the Southern Section commissioner 
sitting courtside, about the assigning of the game officials. The comment was 
not only inappropriate, but Crowley had nothing to do with the running of the 
game, because it was a state CIF event. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got downright ugly late in the game when a three-pointer by McKnight's 
son, Clay, was nullified by a controversial foul. The basket would have tied 
the score, 69-69. Instead, Crenshaw went on to win, 71-67, handing the Monarchs 
their first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, McKnight screamed about the call, and did not let up until 
well after the game. He complained during the awards ceremony and postgame 
interviews. He derided a reporter who asked about his temper. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight had displayed similar antics the previous weekend during the Southern 
Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fans began shouting for him to sit down and get in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As the basketball coach and boys' athletic director of one of the largest and 
most prestigious Catholic schools in Southern California, McKnight needs to 
curb his temper and re-examine his win-at-all-costs mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to talk with Gary about his actions after a few games, and Saturday 
night was one of them," said Lyle Porter, Mater Dei's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was taking out the officiating on the wrong people. There are proper 
channels for such complaints, and mid-court probably is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9's telecast of the Mater Dei-Crenshaw game finished with a 3.1 
rating, the second-highest for a basketball game on television during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, perhaps, it finished ahead of the UCLA-Oregon telecast (2.3), 
the Lakers' 2.8 and the Clippers' 1.7. It trailed only the Orlando-Phoenix NBA 
game Sunday on Channel 4, which had a 4.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Channel 9 will review the numbers in the next week or two and 
decide if they want to pick up the option on the four-year contract they 
recently signed with the CIF. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the future looks good," said Bob Seagren of Marketing and Financial 
Management, which is representing the CIF. "The people at Channel 9 were happy 
with the quality of competition and thought the rating was respectable. I think 
they'll pick up the option and perhaps even add more sports for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The State basketball tournament concludes this weekend with Southern Regional 
and Northern Regional winners meeting in five divisions. All games will be at 
the Oakland Coliseum. Divisions II and IV play Friday and Divisions I, III and 
V on Saturday. . . . The tournament's biggest surprise is Los Angeles Pacific 
Hills, which won the boys' Division V Southern Regional on Saturday. Pacific 
Hills, which changed its school name from Bel-Air Prep last October, barely 
made the Southern Section playoffs as an at-large entry. But the Bruins went on 
to win the section's Division V-A title and upset North Hollywood Campbell Hall 
in the regional semifinals last Thursday. "Nobody knows who we are because of 
our new name," Coach John Bobich said. "We've kind of snuck up on people all 
season." Times' Top 20 Basketball Polls

 Florida goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck got his second victory in four tries 
against his former team, the New York Rangers, making 27 saves in the Panthers' 
2-1 victory Monday night at Miami. Vanbiesbrouck spent his first 11 seasons 
with the Rangers before being traded to Vancouver and subsequently being 
selected by the Florida Panthers in the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Panthers within one point of the eighth-place 
Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said it wasn't extra special," said Vanbiesbrouck, who made 
10 saves in the third period to protect the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Boston 4 -- Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped Glen Murray and Glen 
Wesley on breakaways, and that helped the Canadiens come from behind to beat 
the Bruins at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens, after trailing 3-0, scored five goals in less than 19 minutes 
beginning late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 5, Chicago 1 -- Scott Young and Mats Sundin each scored one goal and 
added two assists at Quebec as the Nordiques snapped the Blackhawks' six-game 
unbeaten streak.

 Boris Becker and Nick Bollettieri never had a chance Monday against Andre 
Agassi. His game and tongue were simply too sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing a 6-2, 7-5 victory, Agassi took aim at Bollettieri, who 
severed their 10-year player-coach relationship last summer. Bollettieri now 
coaches Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick is insignificant, to be quite honest," Agassi said. "His knowledge of 
the game is limited, there's no question about that. If you're ever wondering 
how much he knows, go play him." But he can sell himself pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Michael Chang joined Agassi in the fourth round by rallying to 
defeat Alberto Berasategui of Spain, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2. Chang was serving and 
trailing in the second set, 0-3, 15-40, and overcame three break points.

 Jim Grabb upset No. 4 Sergi Bruguera, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, and top-ranked Pete

 Nutrition experts encourage consumers to eat low-fat, healthful foods, but 
meat dishes remain the most popular choices on restaurant menus. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of restaurateurs by Thomas Food Industry Register, a trade 
publication, found the favored entrees are meat and poultry, served 44% of the 
time. Pasta was second at 33%, followed by vegetarian dishes, 10%; fish, 9%, 
and salad, 4%.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; HIS SCIENTIFIC VIEW IS OUT OF THIS WORLD; HYPERSPACE: 
A SCIENTIFIC ODYSSEY THROUGH PARALLEL UNIVERSES, TIME WARPS AND THE 10TH 
DIMENSION BY MICHIO KAKU ; OXFORD $25, 344 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michio Kaku must have been the most interesting kid on his block. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't reading science fiction, or wondering how carp in the Japanese 
Tea Garden envision the universe, he was building his own "Betatron," an 
electron accelerator, with the help of very supportive parents. Kaku assembled 
it on his high school football field with parts scavenged from the electronic 
warehouses that dotted the Bay Area, where he grew up in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with degrees from Harvard and UC Berkeley, he is a professor of 
theoretical physics at the City University of New York and sometimes a visitor 
at Princeton's Institute of Advanced Study, where he wrote "Hyperspace: A 
Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps and the 10th 
Dimension." 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein spent the last decades of his life at the same institute, searching, 
unsuccessfully, for a unified field theory connecting all of nature's forces. 
It was Einstein's spirit, Kaku says, that inspired him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaku believes that he, along with his colleagues studying hyperspace, may well 
have found the theory that eluded Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of hyperspace, he explains, originated in higher-dimensional 
geometry, a new kind of math unveiled in 1854 by Georg Riemann at a lecture in 
Gottingen, Germany. There Riemann introduced the idea of a "fourth dimension," 
a concept that reverberated for almost a century in the worlds of art and 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 In science, Riemann's work was the realization that physical laws simplify in 
higher-dimensional space. These are dimensions beyond the familiar frame of 
length, width, depth and time -- dimensions beyond what our brains recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible for most, if not all of us, to visualize these other 
dimensions, even when they are described as folded over or curled up in a knot. 
We can only know them mathematically.  
</P>
<P>
 Riemann's geometry inspired one Englishman, Oxford mathematician Lewis 
Carroll, to write "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
 It inspired another, Edwin Abbot, to write "Flatland: A Romance of Many 
Dimensions by a Square." This best-selling satire described a two-dimensional 
world where those who suggested that a third dimension might exist were 
immediately sentenced to life in solitary confinement. That was more than a 
century ago. Today, most theoretical physicists have accepted other dimensions. 
The 10-dimensional universe Kaku describes is not only different from what the 
carp sees, but is also different from what we experience in our workaday, 
three-dimensional lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaku has enriched these pages with references to stories that illustrate the 
weird ramifications of hyperspace and the paradoxes of time travel. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not fairy tales. Kaku is a theoretician, but he is also the teen-age 
betatron builder. He reminds us that quantum mechanics -- which suggests that 
it is impossible to predict the precise position of any particular particle at 
a particular time -- is essential to such innovations in microelectronics as 
the transistor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaku works on the field theory of "strings," part of the larger discipline of 
superstring theory that galvanized physicists in 1984. At that time, John 
Schwarz of Caltech and Michael Green of Queen's College, London, published an 
article establishing superstrings as the only self-consistent theory of quantum 
gravity.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaku explains that the string theory knits together the four fundamental 
forces that explain all phenomena in the universe -- the electromagnetic force, 
the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force and the gravitational force. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he writes, "the essence of string theory is that it can explain the 
nature of both matter and space-time." These tiny strings, "about 100 billion 
times smaller than a proton," vibrate each subatomic particle at a distinct 
frequency. They are part of a universal orchestra of vibrations.  
</P>
<P>
 Taking the longest view, Kaku considers the day long after our sun has died, 
when the universe will end and the only hope for sustaining intelligent life 
will be to use the energy we have learned to control by mastering hyperspace to 
escape to another universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I am not a physicist, I cannot scientifically assess Kaku's theories. 
But knowing physicists, I suspect that many will disagree with his 
non-mathematical summaries of theories they hold dear. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Hyperspace" is not really written for them. It is for lay people excited 
by the possibilities of these discoveries. They will appreciate Kaku's good 
nature, clarity and respect for his reader's imagination.

TAFT HIGH WINS ACADEMIC DECATHLON AGAIN; EDUCATION: THE WOODLAND HILLS SCHOOL 
COLLECTS ITS SECOND STRAIGHT STATE TITLE. NATIONAL COMPETITION IS NEXT MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year, a team of students from Taft High School of 
Woodland Hills claimed the mantle of California's best and brightest, winning 
the state Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft team, representing the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
out-tested its Los Angeles County rival, West High School of Torrance, which 
finished second. Orange County's Laguna Hills High School was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's win on Sunday earned the San Fernando Valley school its fourth state 
championship since the contest began 15 years ago. The nine-member team will 
represent California in the national competition next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we shook Stockton," said Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, who took 
the gold medal for the highest overall score in the 10-event contest, earning 
8,937 points out of a possible 10,000. "I feel exhilarated." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was also a welcome back gift for Taft Coach Arthur Berchin, who 
had left decathlon training four years ago after leading the 1989 Taft team to 
the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 Taft parents, friends and district administrators cheered as team 
members raked in 12 gold medals for individual events, 11 silver and seven 
bronze. The school scored 48,974 points of a possible 60,000; West High's tally 
was 46,278. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a boost for the city's beleaguered school district, which fared 
poorly in state test scores released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 375 students representing 43 California regions joined in the battle 
of brains that began Friday at the University of the Pacific. The first day 
included written tests in math, fine arts, economics, science, literature and 
social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were back Saturday morning with essay writing, prepared and impromptu 
speeches, as well as interviews with judges. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's awards luncheon, Taft students nervously twittered at the table. 
Team members Sage Vaughn, 16, and Sheldon Peregrino, 18, created sculptures out 
of their water glasses and lunch remnants. Rebecca Rissman, 17, parked her 
elbows on the table and wrung her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is torture," Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came, the announcement could hardly be heard over the cheers of Taft 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so proud," said Jill Shapiro, whose 16-year-old daughter, Kimberly, 
took two individual event medals for the team. "They're all great. We love them 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 West High coach George Floratos said he was proud of his students even though 
he was disappointed by the school's 0-4 record at the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of these times we're going to win it," Floratos said. "But Taft was a 
super team and a neat bunch of kids."  
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft were Chris Huie, 17, who took home seven individual 
medals; Andrew Salter, 17, who finished second overall; Michael Michrowski, 17, 
who garnered three medals, and Stephen Shaw, 16, the team's only junior, who 
won four medals. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory means only a short break before they begin preparing for next 
month's national competition in New Jersey. "I think we get a few days off 
before we start studying again," Kimberly Shapiro said. "We only have a month 
left."

SCOTT HARRIS: READERS TAKE THEIR CUTS AT '3 STRIKES' LAW; PERHAPS THERE ARE 
BETTER CANDIDATES FOR EXHIBIT A, SUCH AS THAT EX-CON WITH THE LONG RAP SHEET 
WHO WAS ARRESTED IN THE MUGGING OF A HOMELESS MAN FOR 50 CENTS.

 Nelson Fay of Encino writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Until (recently) I thought it was quite an honor to consider myself your pen 
pal. Now I'm not so sure. Allow me to elaborate a little, please. I do not want 
to be classified in the same category as Brian Simpson. I guess if you care, 
you're going to have to find another pigeonhole for me or for him.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, he may write a good letter. He may also have a high degree of 
creativity . . . and a massive amount of gall . . . but in all seriousness, he 
is still A BUM!  
</P>
<P>
 "Bum" is such a vague term. To be more precise, Brian Simpson is a burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least was. These days, Brian Simpson, a thrice-convicted felon mentioned 
in two recent columns, is serving a well-earned prison term of six to 12 years. 
He might consider himself lucky. Now that the harshest of the so-called "three 
strikes and you're out" sentencing measures is California law, a felon with a 
similar record might be facing life imprisonment, even though their crimes 
suggest a desire to avoid violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has sent me about a dozen letters, from which I've quoted a few 
paragraphs. But to give such a felon even this tiny, well-filtered forum is to 
invite all kinds of interesting reaction. It would be fun to invite these 
people to the same party. Or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 What, I wonder, would the man from North Hollywood who recommends the death 
penalty for habitual offenders have to say to the Granada Hills woman who knew 
a polite, teen-age Brian Simpson, long before his taste for crystal 
methamphetamine started to rule his life. She was amazed, upon reading the 
first column, what had become of that nice boy. Now she corresponds with him 
and expresses faith that Simpson may yet redeem himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of these readers would have a good excuse for missing this party 
because, like Simpson, they are incarcerated. It feels a little strange 
receiving complimentary mail from Leavenworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how this column came to the attention of this convicted kidnaper is a 
mystery to me. Still, he wanted to let me know that he and other cons figure 
that "three strikes" would indeed make it more likely for streetwise two-time 
losers to eliminate witnesses to avoid getting caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Another letter came from an inmate who has a long rap sheet but now claims to 
be awaiting trial for a crime he didn't commit. He says he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A third came from a man at Calipatria State Prison, serving 20 years to life 
for second-degree murder. He writes: 
</P>
<P>
 If I were released today, I would never be back to this dreadful place . . . 
What does a person do when he has understood what he did wrong? How can I prove 
to the world that I won't be back to this? I should be locked up, but for how 
long? Am I supposed to get better by being locked up with people who did wrong 
also? The only thing that does is create better ways to commit crime and gain 
more connections. Anyway, I just thought you would like to get an opinion from 
someone with a lot of time to do.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't easy to muster sympathy for second-degree murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's odd that, even as American society cries out for tougher punishment, 
it produces juries of a more lenient bent. Damian Williams, Lorena Bobbitt and 
the Menendez brothers -- all have benefited from this paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which lends credence to a point made by J. Thomas Johnson of Winnetka: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . the idea that punishment can "fit" the crime is even more silly and 
incoherent today than it was when W.S. Gilbert mocked it in "The Mikado" over 
100 years ago . . . What the (three strikes) initiative represents is a new way 
of looking at crime. The type of crime is irrelevant. The measure treats a 
whole laundry list of crimes as identical, not identical in form but identical 
in effect: they one and all have the effect of making civilized people feel 
unsafe and insecure in their persons and property. And Harris' pen pal, Brian 
Simpson has exactly that effect on anyone made aware of his crime spree. Which 
is why Simpson is an argument FOR the three strikes proposal, not an "exhibit 
A" against it . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there are better candidates for Exhibit A, such as that ex-con with 
the long rap sheet who was arrested in the mugging of a homeless man for 50 
cents. No doubt other candidates will emerge who are less deserving of life 
imprisonment than Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some bold readers propose death factories as the cost-effective 
answer to crime, Niel Pendleton of Claremont, a retired American Baptist 
minister with a Ph.D. in American history, is fond of pointing out the 
experience of New York state some 60-odd years ago when, fed up with crime, its 
lawmakers adopted mandatory life sentences for four- time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was adopted in May, 1926. What happened? Confusion prevailed in 
courtrooms. Some juries, appalled by manifest injustice of the law, required 
ever higher standards for convictions. When one woman was given a life sentence 
for shoplifting, public clamor to repeal the law became overwhelming. When the 
law was overhauled in 1932, mandatory life sentences were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all this trouble, Pendleton points out, there was no decrease in 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no promise that California's experience in the 1990s will be anything 
like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, history is interesting. 
</P>
<P>

A CITY BUILT ON FALSE PRETENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Save Open Space still hopes to save the irreplaceable Ahmanson Ranch 
greenbelt (as it was zoned by Ventura County) for the millions of San Fernando, 
Conejo and Las Virgenes valleys' residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Needed now are a big-name celebrity and lots of money to appeal the recent 
Ventura County court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,050-home Ahmanson City will be built at the western terminus of Victory 
Boulevard in Woodland Hills adjacent to Los Angeles, Hidden Hills and 
Calabasas. Each day, Ahmanson's additional 48,000 cars will create unbearable 
gridlock and smog regionwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson's cohort, Potomac, the other developer involved in this mess, waited 
until now to disclose there has never been a formal partnership with Ahmanson. 
Under the guise of a combined Potomac/Ahmanson project, the process was 
fast-tracked. Ahmanson misrepresented to the public and Ventura County that 
there was joint partnership with Potomac. It was all a hoax! A sham enabled 
Ahmanson to get approval for its new city under false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine lawsuits challenging the environmental approval of Ahmanson City recently 
lost in Ventura County Court. The sham is so slick and the hoax so convoluted 
that even the judge misunderstood.

SNIVELING STUDENTS SOLVED NOTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As Richard Rodriguez wrote recently in the Opinion section, the Northridge 
earthquake is a middle-class calamity, and I cannot think of a better example 
than at that bastion of middle-class higher education, Cal State Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 After President Blenda Wilson put her reputation on the line by announcing the 
earliest possible resumption of classes, and then moved heaven and earth to 
marshal all possible resources and all available manpower to that end, how did 
the students react? They whined and complained: "What about me -- my classes -- 
my parking?" 
</P>
<P>
 They actually had the audacity to block nearby residents' driveways when 
common sense, if they had any, would have told them that anyone living in 
proximity to the campus had probably suffered damage and loss and certainly 
didn't deserve that added aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their mall-crawling has been greatly limited, why didn't some of those 
superannuated adolescents sit down in front of their PCs, which they claim they 
can't live without, and devise a car pool or van pool scheme that might 
ameliorate the campus parking situation? Then they could have contributed 
something to the renewed university community, which President Wilson, the 
administration and the faculty are working so hard to build, instead of 
sniveling and expecting the adults to wipe their noses.

ROBERTI DESERVES A PAT ON THE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * State Sen. David Roberti deserves compliments for the tremendous efforts he 
has extended to El Proyecto del Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 El Proyecto del Barrio is a nonprofit human-service organization that provides 
multiple services, including primary medical care at two clinics in Arleta and 
Pacoima.The Pacoima clinic was severely damaged and "yellow tagged" for limited 
entry as a result of the earthquake. This designation rendered the clinic 
unable to provide urgent and primary medical care in the direct aftermath of 
the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although faced with the distractions of the impending recall election, Roberti 
was the first elected official to offer his services. He assisted us in 
securing food donations that allowed El Proyecto del Barrio to distribute food 
to more than 5,000 people. He arranged for the lease of modular units and is 
assisting us in securing the necessary permits to set up the modular units. He 
visited the site of our damaged clinic and pledged to assist us in our efforts 
to provide medical services. All this was done without any fanfare or press 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recall forces stating that he does not care about his district and 
the wrath he is subject to due to his position on gun control, Sen. Roberti is 
due for some positive words. 
</P>
<P>
 We could not have resumed the immediate provision of medical services without 
his help.

RESIDENTIAL USERS ARE WATER RATE LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is not surprising that so many Valley homeowners have expressed anger 
over their recent water and power bills. The Department of Water and Power rate 
restructuring plan was deficient from the start, and those of us who opposed it 
warned of its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, water conservation is a worthy goal, and rate structuring is an 
appropriate vehicle to achieve it. But conservation does not have to include 
inequities -- nor should it penalize those who have been conserving all along. 
</P>
<P>
 The present rate structure does both. It does not account for large families, 
large lots, climate differentials or demonstrated conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, almost the entire burden of conservation is placed on residential 
users. Commercial users are allowed summer usage that is 125% of winter 
consumption at the low block rate, even though their landscaping needs are 
proportionally less in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the easiest solution, however, is not to throw out the proverbial baby 
with the bath water, but instead adopt an appeals procedure for residential 
users that expands their low block rate depending on family size, lot size, 
hotter climates and, especially, demonstrated conservation (both past and 
present). 
</P>
<P>
 Surely the worst thing that could happen would be to ignore the public's pleas 
and leave the present inequities intact. That would not only unfairly continue 
to penalize many Valley homeowners, but it would further erode their confidence 
in a wasteful DWP that is all too often seen as mean rather than lean.

THANKS TO ALL WHO HELPED AFTER DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On behalf of our daughter, Heather, and her husband, Tom Denning, who lived 
in the apartment complex next to the Northridge Meadows, which dramatically 
collapsed, we want to thank publicly the many good citizens who provided so 
much help and support after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Methodist Church immediately made available an office for 
coordinating relief efforts and communications with tenants.Guiliano's 
Delicatessen, which had much damage, helped the nearby residents with phone 
service and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, firemen from many stations in Los Angeles city and county brought out 
personal belongings by ladder and ropes. That was a great physical and 
emotional lift. City building and safety workers also helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when all insurance requirements had been arranged, Mike Mc Philomy and 
other Cullen and Sons Demolition Co. employees were very helpful and 
cooperative with tenants in bringing out personal items of financial and 
emotional value. 
</P>
<P>
 The police and National Guard members who protected the severely damaged 
complex from looting are also to be greatly commended. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's thank and remember the good people who have helped our daughter and 
son-in-law, and so many others, to begin to recover from a most devastating 
tragedy. They performed a beautiful and caring public service.

COLLEGE FACULTY ACTED LIKE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was amused by the story about the faculty and students of Los Angeles 
Valley College condemning Mary Lee, the college president, for reopening the 
college as scheduled (Feb. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 One can expect the students to behave like the children they are.Missing 
school is a treat. But the faculty behaved like petulant adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructors wanted postponement of the opening because of responsibilities 
to family and friends. I wonder if they would have voted the same way if their 
considerable salaries were docked for the days they missed because of the 
earthquake, as happened to so many others not in the education business. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to President Lee for making the right decision. In the time of 
turmoil, going to classes and being responsible for learning gave some 
structure and a touch of normalcy to the students' lives. Community college 
faculties always babble about "shared governance" but never about shared 
responsibility.

SCHOOL BUNGALOWS NOT VERY 'UNIQUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A recent story contained a quotation from a student at Cal State Northridge 
saying that the opportunity to attend a campus composed entirely of temporary 
structures was "unique."Unfortunately, not so. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in L.A., Los Angeles Southwest College at Western and Imperial was 
nothing but bungalows for more than four years. After the 1987 earthquake, the 
permanent structure was shut down and the bungalows were re-enlisted.  
</P>
<P>
 In my home town of Philadelphia, Temple University's football team plays ball 
at a stadium eight miles north of campus. Across the street in an open field 
are 15 bungalows, called Temple Community College, that have been there for 60 
years.

AGGRESSIVE AND NECESSARY MOVE; WELCOME ACTION BY RABIN GOVERNMENT AGAINST 
RADICAL ORGANIZATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The contest for control of the West Bank is not only between Israelis and 
Palestinians but between the government of Israel and those of its citizens who 
are committed by word and violent deed to resisting any change in the 
territorial status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has now moved aggressively and necessarily against some of the 
most extreme opponents of its efforts to negotiate a peace based on territorial 
compromise and political rights for Palestinians. Applying laws that for 
decades have been used to try to suppress Palestinian militancy, the Cabinet 
has defined as terrorist two Jewish radical groups, Kach and Kahane Chai, and 
made membership in them and similar organizations illegal. About 400 
individuals are now subject to prison terms if they continue their affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's action follows the slaughter in a Hebron mosque of more than 
two dozen worshipers by Baruch Goldstein, a follower of the late Meir Kahane, 
the founder of Kach. That atrocity has threatened the peace talks. It has 
forced the Israeli government to confront earlier than it had expected the 
issue of how to deal with the most radical of the West Bank settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mosque massacre, while motivated by a fanatical hatred of Arabs, was also 
an open act of rebellion against Israel's democratically elected government. 
The threat behind this mad and tragic challenge has been recognized throughout 
Israel. Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime minister whose right-wing Likud Party 
promised when in power that it would not give up one inch of the West Bank, 
immediately supported the government's move to outlaw Kach and Kahane Chai. 
</P>
<P>
 The welcome action against the radical organizations is unlikely to secure 
good behavior from Israeli extremists; already the banned groups are 
threatening to continue their activities underground. The possibility of 
further outrages directed against Palestinians has to be considered high. The 
heavy responsibility on the government now is to move against Israeli 
terrorists with the same commitment and vigor that it uses against their Arab 
counterparts.

 The Minnesota Vikings, deeming Jim McMahon too expensive, Monday cut the 
quarterback they had hoped would put them in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon, who will turn 35 before next season, could still return to the 
Vikings, but on their terms. Now an unrestricted free agent, McMahon might 
rejoin former Chicago Bear defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, coach of the 
Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon would have made about $2.1 million this year had the Vikings retained 
him. A clause in his contract gave the Vikings until today to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury, who has started eight games for the 
Vikings over the last two seasons, is a free agent, but the Vikings have the 
right to match any offer he receives. New Orleans, Washington and Atlanta 
reportedly are among the teams interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings, who hold exclusive rights to young quarterbacks Gino Torretta and 
Brad Johnson, are pursuing other veteran quarterbacks. The Rams' Jim Everett 
has been mentioned as one of the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons, maneuvering to stay under the NFL salary cap, let wide 
receiver Michael Haynes go to the New Orleans Saints. Haynes was a transitional 
player for the Falcons, meaning after he signed the Saints' offer sheet for $10 
million over four years, the Falcons had the right of first refusal. To keep 
him they would have had to match the Saints' offer.

 The New York Jets have signed defensive lineman Donald Evans of the Pittsburgh 
Steelers to a deal expected to pay him $3.45 million over three years. Evans, 
signed by the Steelers as a free agent in 1990 after being cut by Philadelphia, 
started all but two games the last four seasons for Pittsburgh. . . . The San 
Diego Chargers reportedly have reached an agreement with Phoenix free-agent 
defensive tackle Reuben Davis on a three-year, $4.5-million contract. Boxing

 Melchor Cob Castro of Mexico scored a unanimous decision over Domingo Sosa of 
the Dominican Republic in a 10-round flyweight bout at the Forum.

 There were no knockdowns, and neither fighter appeared seriously hurt at any 
time. Cob Castro improved his record to 40-4-4 with 17 knockouts. Sosa is 26-3 
with 18 knockouts. Jurisprudence

 Three former University of Washington athletes were convicted in Eugene, Ore., 
of third-degree sex abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Charles Douglas Barnes, 20, of Carson, Calif.; starting wide 
receiver Jason Paul Shelley, 19, of Vallejo, Calif., and point guard Prentiss 
Lavell Perkins, 21, of Minneapolis, were charged with groping a University of 
Oregon student in a dormitory room and taking a piece of jewelry last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley and Perkins were suspended for other incidents in Seattle and were 
kicked out of the Washington athletic program after their arrests last fall. 
Barnes has been suspended from the football program indefinitely. Olympics 
</P>
<P>
 The National Rifle Assn. withdrew as the official governing body of the U.S. 
Olympic Shooting Team, ending years of arguments over whether the NRA used the 
athletes for promotional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA decision preempted an announcement by the U.S. Olympic Committee that 
a USOC panel unanimously recommended last Friday that the NRA's official 
sponsorship be revoked. The five-member panel said that the NRA has exerted too 
much control over the independent governing body it had appointed to oversee 
the team, in violation of Olympic regulations. Names in the News

 Senior forward Mark Boyd, who averaged 11.9 points and 6.3 rebounds, has been

of Mickey Mantle, died after collapsing at a drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation 
facility near Dallas. The cause of death was not known, pending tests. . . . 
Martin Buser, the 1992 winner, stretched his lead in the Iditarod sled dog race 
to nearly a checkpoint over several other former winners. . . . Georgia State 
has promoted assistant basketball coach Carter Wilson to replace Bob Reinhart, 
who was fired after his second consecutive 13-14 season. . . . John Lilley, 21, 
who played for the U.S. Olympic hockey team at Lillehammer, will join the 
Mighty Ducks today after being called up from minor league affiliate San Diego.

 She would have to start out as a villain, but for $2 million, it might be 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how much Takashi Matsunaga, chairman of the All Japan Women's 
Professional Wrestling Assn., says he is willing to pay Tonya Harding to enter 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya was made to be a pro wrestler," Matsunaga said Monday. "She's about as 
tough as they come, and she'll last a lot longer in our sport than she will in 
figure skating." 
</P>
<P>
 But $2 million? 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what Disney's paying Nancy Kerrigan, that's what we'll pay Tonya, 
even if I have to go into debt to do it," he said, adding that he has sent a 
representative to Oregon to make Harding an offer. He said he hopes to meet 
Harding while she is in Japan for the World Figure Skating Championships, which 
will begin outside Tokyo next week. 
</P>
<P>
 And Harding's role? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, she'd have to be the bad guy at first, but I think she can learn 
to be a heroine as well," Matsunaga said.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; ROTHENBERG MIGHT HAVE STEPPED OVER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, president of the World Cup Organizing Committee, the U.S. 
Soccer Federation and of a proposed new professional soccer league, has always 
danced closed to the edge. In fact, he seems to revel in the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always a bad thing. Soccer leaders in this country have traditionally 
been conservative, narrow and slightly afraid of venturing beyond familiar 
borders. They had the gumption to bid for the 1994 World Cup, got it, and then 
very nearly lost it through inaction. Along came Rothenberg. Where the former 
regime would examine a risky situation and ask, "Why?" Rothenberg -- without 
pausing to take a breath -- would say "Why not?" He would detail an attorney to 
come up with a business plan, and find a way to fund the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some risks are calculated, however, and some are foolish. And lately, World 
Cup '94 might very well have taken the latter course. For months, money has 
been trickling from World Cup coffers into the bank account of Major League 
Soccer, the proposed new pro league. The trickle has grown into millions of 
dollars and the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing the legality and tax 
ramifications of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A few things to consider: Rothenberg is president of World Cup and heads the 
management team of the proposed league. World Cup is a tax-exempt, nonprofit 
entity. MLS is a private company that will operate for profit. World Cup is 
charged with organizing this summer's finals and, stop if you've heard this 
before, leaving "a legacy for soccer in the United States." MLS exists to form 
a viable professional league and make money for its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Few noticed or seemed to care when nearly half a million World Cup dollars 
were used to fund the sophisticated business plan that MLS presented to the 
U.S. Soccer Federation. The MLS bid won. Remember who's president of the USSF. 
Too bad the two other bidders didn't have the advantage of a 
multimillion-dollar sugar daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the World Cup board of directors, who are supposed to vote to 
approve all such expenditures, are a little slow or a little uninterested. But 
a few began to notice that the trickle of money to MLS had become a torrent. At 
a board meeting in Las Vegas last December, a tax attorney was present, at the 
request of some board members. The question: What are the potential problems 
when a nonprofit corporation funnels money to a for-profit company? 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, even with the questions being raised about the advisability of 
such money transfers, the World Cup board of directors voted to give Major 
League Soccer $3.5 million for start-up costs. All but two board members voted 
for the expenditure. One, Charles Cale, voted against it and another, Marian 
Wright-Edelman, abstained because she couldn't hear the proceedings clearly 
over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 What's still not clear is if the money was a loan or a gift or, as some say, 
an investment in the league. MLS, if it ever exists as a viable corporate 
entity, is under no compulsion to repay the $3.5 million. Why should it? 
Nothing was put in writing and board members say it will be settled after the 
World Cup. Where does the line form for that kind of deal? 
</P>
<P>
 The tax issue is thorny. World Cup tax attorneys met with the IRS last month 
in Washington, D.C., to seek a ruling. The IRS could say, "No problem. Keep 
giving your money away." It could allow the transaction and begin to tax the 
gift/loan. Or, the IRS could revoke World Cup's tax-exempt status and take all 
that legacy money for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the USSF who has knowledge of tax laws called World Cup's 
decision to fund MLS, risky, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 How sensible is it to spend the legacy money now and risk any future profit? 
What business does the World Cup organizing committee have in funding or 
becoming otherwise involved with the proposed professional league? The 
international soccer federation's mandate to launch a Division I league was to 
the USSF, not World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 If the United States sports market can embrace professional soccer, and if MLS 
is the right approach, why not let it stand on the strength of its own 
proposals and plans, rather than being propped up by World Cup? This country 
has one of the most competitive marketplaces in the world, and if MLS is truly 
a viable and worthwhile business it will do just fine on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Why bankrupt the World Cup? Why take the risk? 
</P>

 The other shoe was finally dropped this month, when the American Professional 
Soccer League made it clear it was going to challenge the MLS for the title of 
North America's premier professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer community had been waiting for the APSL, which had bid for Division 
I status but lost to Major League Soccer, to declare if it was going to accept 
its secondary position or fight. With the announcement of the league's 
expansion by three teams, the APSL clearly is going to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 League chairman William De La Pena notes that his league is currently the only 
professional outdoor league and its longstanding position within the soccer 
community makes it perfectly placed to become the new Division I league that is 
expected to begin in 1995. The APSL expansion is projected to bring the league 
to 12 teams by 1995 and De La Pena says that should speak volumes about the 
APSL's financial viability. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a significant group of people who want to be part of traditional 
soccer," said De La Pena, who is also the owner of the L.A. Salsa. "There are 
business people who are entrepreneurs and want to run their own team." 
</P>
<P>
 His reference was the MLS' single-entity concept, where all players, coaches 
and team administrators are employees of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Pena said the APSL does not want to have an antagonistic relationship 
with the USSF, but said the league would be willing to go to court to protect 
its right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will protect our ability to play, that's for certain," he said. "We will 
meet them on the field -- let's compete on the field. That's where people will 
decide the best team or league, on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the possibility that the professional mess could end up in the 
courts, De La Pena said the APSL's attorneys are confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the 1967 antitrust case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That case involved three competing professional soccer leagues in the United 
States. The USSF awarded Division I status to one, prompting a lawsuit by one 
of the others. By the time it was settled, remnants of the three leagues became 
the North American Soccer League, the last viable pro league in this country. 
</P>

 Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule for the U.S. national team is intensifying. The team's next game 
is March 26 against Bolivia at Dallas and World Cup preparation begins in 
earnest next month. Three games are scheduled in mid-April to approximate the 
World Cup's first-round schedule. The United States plays Moldova April 16 at 
Jacksonville, Fla., and again April 20 at Davidson, N.C., then Iceland on April 
24 at Southwestern College in Chula Vista. Tentatively scheduled is an April 13 
game against Argentina at Buenos Aires. The team plays Chile on April 30 at 
Albuquerque, then three games are scheduled against as yet unnamed opponents: 
May 7 at Cal State Fullerton, May 15 at East Los Angeles College and May 21 at 
Cleveland. The U.S. will play Saudi Arabia May 25 at an undetermined location 
and Greece May 28 at New Haven, Conn. Bill Nuttall, U.S. team general manager, 
said he hopes to schedule Mexico on June 4 at the Rose Bowl.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the kind of season it has been for the Kings: The possibility exists 
that Wayne Gretzky will break or tie Gordie Howe's record in the Southland, but 
not at the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen at the Anaheim Arena on Wednesday night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky -- who needs three goals to tie Howe at 801, but has been held 
scoreless in his last four games -- has a splendid opportunity to break his 
slump tonight at the Forum against the Ottawa Senators, the Washington Senators 
of hockey. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the team Gretzky has grown to hate, the Mighty Ducks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Great One performed in Orange County, he made Mighty Duck 
president Tony Tavares and a couple of players pay for some ill-advised 
quacking by scoring two goals and getting three assists. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, the Kings, who have won all four games against Anaheim, can't seem to 
get so aroused against the rest of the league. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose must accept some of the blame. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is mind-boggling that a team that has Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Luc Robitaille 
and Rob Blake probably will be one of only 10 not to make the playoffs in a 
watered-down NHL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Highly paid athletes should put out every night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the reality is that they don't, and it is the responsibility of the coach 
to make sure they do most of the time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I like Melrose. He has a terrific personality. He did a great job last year 
when the Kings reached the Stanley Cup finals.It isn't his fault that 
management decided not to re-sign Marty McSorley and to re-sign Jimmy Carson. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 However, like most of his players, the coach is in a season-long slump. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you like the chances of Glenn Robinson and Purdue in the NCAA tournament, 
harken back to 1988 when Danny Manning and Kansas won. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, that version of a one-man team had the home-area advantage in the 
Final Four, which was played at Kansas City, Mo. This time that edge could go 
to North Carolina or Duke at Charlotte, N.C. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We need some geography and math lessons around here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA players Ed and Charles O'Bannon and Tyus Edney said they didn't know that 
Tulsa was in the state of Oklahoma. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling, after his team accepted an NIT invitation, said 
that 95% of the schools are sitting home right now. Actually, 96 of the 301 
schools that play Division I basketball reached the NCAA or NIT tournament. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 George Washington and Alabama Birmingham are matched in the first round of the 
East Regional of the NCAA men's tournament Friday -- and in the first round of 
the Mideast Regional of the women's tournament Wednesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the alphabetical listing of Division I schools, Tulsa is No. 267 and UCLA 
No. 268. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jalen Rose of Michigan has scored the most points in NCAA tournament games 
among active players, 191. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to former Dodger Alejandro Pena, who returned $500,000 of his 
guaranteed $1.35-million salary to the Pittsburgh Pirates after reporting to 
camp with a bad elbow and then undergoing surgery last March that kept him out 
of the entire season. All Pena asked for was another chance this season -- at a 
base salary of $175,000. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Equipment from Fox Video's "Sandlot" will be included in the new motion 
picture wing at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., that opens in May. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Making big impressions at the recent NFL scouting combine at Indianapolis were 
Alcorn State linebacker John Thierry, who might be picked in the top 10, and 
Sonoma State offensive tackle Larry Allen, a probable first-rounder. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Referee Burton Gilliam, who worked the card Saturday at the Olympic, is an 
accomplished character actor who plays the part of the hotel clerk in "The 
Getaway." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Reader Sinclair Buckstaff acknowledges that Jersey Joe Walcott's left hook 
that knocked out Ezzard Charles in 1951 was a pretty punch, but claims the best 
ever was Sugar Ray Robinson's hook that flattened Gene Fullmer in 1957. Walcott 
was 37 when he won the heavyweight title from Charles in the seventh round at 
Pittsburgh, and Robinson was two days shy of his 37th birthday when he regained 
the middleweight title from Fullmer in the fifth round at Chicago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How come they are still called figure skaters, even though figures no longer 
are skated in major competition?

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HARD-HIT MARTINEZ SAYS HE WILL BE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez has spent the spring working on his pitching mechanics, but 
whatever he's doing, it isn't working. On Monday against the Florida Marlins at 
Melbourne, Fla., Martinez gave up eight runs on seven hits, including two home 
runs, in only four innings. His spring earned-run average swelled from 9.00 to 
12.27. The Dodgers lost, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three or four more starts this spring, and I'll be fine when the 
season starts," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said he is not worried about 
Martinez or any of the other veterans who are spending the spring getting into 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ramon threw with good velocity today, but not good location," Claire said. "I 
would be concerned if there was a physical problem, but as good as he threw 
last year, it's a matter of him throwing between starts and dealing with his 
technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Dodgers' five starting pitchers were durable last season -- none 
missed a start -- they were not consistently effective. The entire pitching 
staff had the third-lowest ERA in the league, but Pedro Astacio was the only 
starter with a winning record, 14-9. Tom Candiotti pitched much better than his 
8-10 record showed, but suffered from low-run production. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to see someone step up and take the lead," Claire said. "In order to 
have a big-time season, you have to have a big-time performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser said he is starting to throw his fastball for the first time in 
two seasons. And Kevin Gross, who is recovering from tendinitis in his right 
shoulder, will make his spring debut Sunday. Both Claire and Manager Tom 
Lasorda said that if Gross is not ready, there are others in the organization 
who can step in. Claire mentioned Chan Ho Park and Greg Hansell, but neither 
appears ready at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he agrees with Ed Vargo, the director of National League umpires, 
that Park is not violating any rules with his hesitation moves on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything he is doing that is wrong and it's not even a penalty," 
Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargo said he would probably take the issue to the rules committee, but unless 
an interpretation is rendered, it is sure to cause problems when Park pitches. 
Veteran umpires who have seen Park pitch say he is in clear violation. Park 
will pitch again on Thursday against the New York Mets, who raised the issue. 
Met batters called time three times while in the box the first time Park 
pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza's home run in the fourth inning against pitcher Mike Gardner 
cleared the right-field scoreboard, a $90,000 apparatus that explodes when a 
Marlin hits a home run. Piazza has hit all four of his home runs this spring 
against the Marlins. . . . Carlos Hernandez, who had arthroscopic surgery in 
his right shoulder during the winter, made his spring debut Monday. Lasorda 
said Hernandez should be ready to back up Piazza when the season starts, but if 
he isn't, Tom Prince might be. Prince, 29, who played in the Pittsburgh 
organization the last 10 seasons, is batting .455 in 11 at-bats and has 
impressed the club with his throwing accuracy. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TRADE WINDS ARE IN THE AIR IN TEMPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, losing patience with their inefficient pitchers, decided that they 
will have to trade for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office and coaching staff met for 1 1/2 hours after the team's 6-2 
victory over the Oakland Athletics at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The club is expected to entertain trade offers for veteran outfielder Dwight 
Smith, rookie outfielder Jim Edmonds and designated hitter Chili Davis. It's 
possible they might also listen to proposals for first baseman J.T. Snow or 
left fielder Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have talks with about three or four clubs," Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers said. "We'll then determine whether we should entertain any offers or 
make any offers." 
</P>
<P>
 They have already decided to put starting pitcher John Farrell on waivers 
today, according to General Manager Bill Bavasi, and might decide soon on Frank 
Tanana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who must pay Farrell $200,000 in termination pay, are offering to 
sign him to a triple-A contract if he's unclaimed on waivers by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell is 0-1 with a 15.63 earned-run average this spring. Tanana, 40, is 0-2 
with a 17.36 ERA. He will be given at least one more start -- on Wednesday, 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers Hilly Hathaway and Mark Holzemer were optioned to triple-A Vancouver 
and first baseman Nelson Simmons was assigned to the minor league camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also decided to go with an 11-man pitching staff instead of 
carrying three catchers. That means Mark Dalesandro soon will be optioned to 
Vancouver and veteran Mike Fitzgerald could be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Hathaway and Holzemer were coming off two of the finest performances of any 
Angel reliever this spring. Hathaway bailed Mark Langston out of a bases-loaded 
jam in the B game Monday, giving up one hit in 2 1/3 innings, and Holzemer 
pitched two hitless innings. BOB NIGHTENGALE

COLLEGE BASKETBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; SCOUT: FANS SHOULD SUPPORT HARRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's wrong with UCLA basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Newell has listened to critics hammer Jim Harrick for years and he's 
convinced there's nothing wrong with the Midwest Regional-bound Bruins that 
couldn't be cured by a little less criticism and a lot more support. 
</P>
<P>
 Newell, who runs a college scouting service for the Lakers and seven other NBA 
teams, has provided the same service for UCLA for seven years, the last three 
without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Newell, son of former California Coach Pete Newell, said he continues unpaid 
at UCLA because of his respect for Harrick, something that he said is wrongly 
slipping in many circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that when we lose a few games that the head basketball coach can't 
work here?" Newell said. "We just have to figure out a way to have a better 
perception of what they have here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (21-6), seeded fifth in the Midwest, begin NCAA tournament play 
Friday against 12th-seeded Tulsa (21-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Newell said the UCLA administration hasn't given Harrick enough support, 
notably Chancellor Charles Young and Athletic Director Pete Dalis. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I can't recall ever reading a statement from either one of them 
saying, 'Jim Harrick is my coach,' " Newell said. "It's just as wrong to 
compare Jim Harrick with John Wooden as it is to compare Pete Dalis with J.D. 
Morgan." 
</P>
<P>
 Newell said one of Harrick's most severe critics, Bill Walton, is unfair in 
his comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting personal and that's what really offends me," Newell said. "In 
order to make a name for himself, he has to be controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton suggested that Newell go back and listen to his taped comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only question is, what have I said that's not true?" Walton said. "I don't 
think I need to make a name for myself. I only say things I believe in and I've 
always done that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be a certain group of people in basketball who don't like 
me. That group is headed by losing coaches." THOMAS BONK

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: MCKNIGHT NEEDS TO CURB HIS TEMPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary McKnight has exceeded expectations as the boys' basketball coach at Mater 
Dei High. In 12 seasons, his teams have won nine Southern Section titles and 
two State championships. Many of his players have received college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is time, however, for the colorful coach to move on. His winning 
program is like a train out of control. He needs to take his energy and 
knowledge and channel them in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight's behavior has become erratic, often to the point where he is 
embarrassing himself and his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Mater Dei played Crenshaw in the Southern California Regional 
Division I title game before a large crowd at Anaheim Arena and a live 
television audience. The real action was on the Mater Dei bench, however, where 
McKnight acted like anything but a veteran coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy over the officiating from the opening whistle, McKnight displayed his 
anger the entire evening. He seldom sat down and occasionally walked outside 
the coach's box. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a technical foul in the first quarter and probably should have had 
another any number of times. He used profanity freely, which was clearly heard 
by anyone standing within 50 yards of him. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point he yelled at Dean Crowley, the Southern Section commissioner 
sitting courtside, about the assigning of the game officials. The comment was 
not only inappropriate, but Crowley had nothing to do with the running of the 
game, because it was a state CIF event. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got downright ugly late in the game when a three-pointer by his 
McKnight's son, Clay, was nullified by a disputed foul. The basket would have 
tied the score, 69-69. Instead, Crenshaw went on to win, 71-67, handing the 
Monarchs their first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, McKnight screamed about the call, and did not let up until 
well after the game. He complained during the awards ceremony and postgame 
interviews. He derided a reporter who asked about his temper. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight had displayed similar antics the previous weekend during the Southern 
Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fans began shouting for him to sit down and get in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As the basketball coach and boys' athletic director of one of the largest and 
most prestigious Catholic schools in Southern California, McKnight needs to 
curb his temper and re-examine his win-at-all-costs mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to talk with Gary about his actions after a few games, and Saturday 
night was one of them," said Lyle Porter, Mater Dei's principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was taking out the officiating on the wrong people. There are proper 
channels for such complaints, and mid-court probably is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9's telecast of the Mater Dei-Crenshaw game finished with a 3.1 
rating, the second-highest for a basketball game on television during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, perhaps, it finished ahead of the UCLA-Oregon telecast (2.3), 
the Lakers' 2.8 and the Clippers' 1.7. It trailed only the Orlando-Phoenix NBA 
game Sunday on Channel 4, which had a 4.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Channel 9 will review the numbers in the next week or two and 
decide if they want to pick up the option on the four-year contract they 
recently signed with the CIF. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the future looks good," said Bob Seagren of Marketing and Financial 
Management, which is representing the CIF. "The people at Channel 9 were happy 
with the quality of competition and thought the rating was respectable. I think 
they'll pick up the option and perhaps even add more sports for next year."

 Prep Notes

<P>
 The State basketball tournament concludes this weekend with Southern Regional 
and Northern Regional winners meeting in five divisions. All games will be at 
the Oakland Coliseum. Divisions II and IV play Friday and Divisions I, III and 
V on Saturday. . . . The tournament's biggest surprise is Los Angeles Pacific 
Hills, which won the boys' Division V Southern Regional on Saturday. Pacific 
Hills, which changed its school name from Bel-Air Prep last October, barely 
made the Southern Section playoffs as an at-large entry. But the Bruins went on 
to win the section's Division V-A title and upset North Hollywood Campbell Hall 
in the regional semifinals. "Nobody knows who we are because of our new name," 
Coach John Bobich said. "We've kind of snuck up on people all season." PREP

<P>
 In an attempt to rebound from his first losing season in eight years as

</P>
<P>
 The former Cal State Fullerton defensive coordinator has signed three prep 
defensive players from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Sweet, a 6-foot-4, 220-pound linebacker from Estancia High, signed 
during the weekend. Signing in the past week were Pete Silvey, a 6-3, 230-pound 
linebacker from Mater Dei, and Jeff Bodholdt, a 6-3, 255-pound defensive 
lineman from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were 4-6 last season.

 If Brian Earley were not a diver for USC, he might be a race car driver, or a 
mountain climber. A lion tamer, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that involves some element of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fear," Earley said, that has him addicted to diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, Earley's specialty is the platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of spinning out of control in a dive from the tower is very 
real and, if it happens, can cause severe injuries. This is precisely what 
keeps Earley interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some good accidents," said Earley, noting that he ranks one of his 
own wipeouts -- he landed flat on his stomach in a practice dive before a 
junior national meet -- one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was evident from the time he was a child that Earley would be a 
thrill-seeker, it was almost as evident that he would chose diving as his 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley's father, Rick, was a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic diving team, 
finishing sixth on the platform. Rick began coaching that same year and is in 
his 14th season as USC's diving coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of Earley's family also has been involved in diving. Brian's mother, 
Conni Pomeroy, coaches diving at UC Irvine; his older sister, Wendy, is a 
former USC diver, and his younger sister, Arika, dives with the Mission Viejo 
Nadadores swim club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived diving," said Earley, who competed in his first meet at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But after winning the 1992 NCAA championship on the platform, Earley began to 
feel pain in his back while training for the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials. It 
turned out that he had two broken vertebrae and had to sit out the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be a blessing in some ways. When he returned, he had to 
limit his practices to the one-meter board. Although he found that boring, he 
was third in the event at the U.S. outdoor national championships at USC in 
August, his first big meet since his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley won all three events at the Pacific 10 Conference diving championships 
last month at USC. Overall, he has won eight Pac-10 titles.  
</P>
<P>
 He has a chance to win all three diving events at the NCAA men's swimming and 
diving meet March 24-26 at University of Minnesota. If he does, he will become 
the first diver to sweep. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Life goes on for the UCLA softball team despite the departure of Lisa 
Fernandez, possibly the best all-around player ever. Fernandez finished her 
eligibility last season. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (17-3) is ranked second in the nation. The Bruins lost to third-ranked 
Oklahoma State, 8-2, in the championship game of the South Florida tournament 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason UCLA remains a contender for the national title is the return of 
senior pitcher DeeDee Weiman. She redshirted last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiman had 11 no-hitters in her first three seasons at UCLA, leaving her tied 
with Fernandez for the school record. She is 10-1 this season. She lost her 
first outing, 2-1, giving up two unearned runs against Arizona State on Feb. 
12. She has an earned-run average of 0.00 in 73 2/3 innings and averages 12.27 
strikeouts a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins also have been bolstered by the pitching of B'Ann Burns, a freshman 
from Phoenix who is 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA plays fifth-ranked Long Beach State (11-5) at 4 p.m. Wednesday at Mayfair 
Park in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State softball team is led by senior shortstop Linda Lunceford. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford has 217 hits in her career, a school record, and is batting .447 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach also has Stacy Van Essen, who was 20-9 last year. Van Essen, a 
senior, is 2-2 this season after a back injury prevented her from playing for 
the first month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Lunceford and Van Essen, however, the 49ers are an inexperienced 
team. All three of last season's outfield starters completed their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brigit Tapp, a reserve last season, is starting in center field; 
freshman Nicole Ochoa, who has hit four home runs, is starting in right, and 
junior Kristyn Frady and freshman Shari Shultz are alternating between catcher 
and left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with a lot of time and work and continuity, (this team) will be 
good," said Pete Manarino, 11-year veteran Long Beach coach who is approaching 
his 400th victory. He is 391-234-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Max Annavedder and Gordon Bartlett of Long Beach State will compete in the 
epee at the NCAA fencing championships beginning Friday at Brandeis University 
in Waltham, Ma. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team will play host to third-ranked USC 
at 5 p.m. Friday in Pauley Pavilion. The match will be televised live on Prime 
Ticket. The Trojans (12-1) were the last undefeated team in the nation before 
losing to Pepperdine on March 1. The Bruins (15-1) have swept six consecutive 
matches. Surprisingly, the Bruins' 6-foot-10 middle blocker, Tim Kelly, who is 
in his fourth year as a starter and has hit .490 in his career, has been 
benched the last four matches in favor of 6-4 junior John Speraw, who played in 
only six matches last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA women's swimming and diving championships will be held Thursday 
through Saturday at Indianapolis. USC's best hope for an individual title is 
freshman Kristine Quance, who set an NCAA record in the 200-meter breaststroke 
at the Pac-10 championships. USC has not had an NCAA woman champion since 1985, 
when Sue Habernigg won the 200 freestyle. UCLA's best hope for a title is 
senior Kristen Walls, a diver who won the one- and three-meter competitions in 
the Pac-10 meet. . . . The NCAA men's swimming and diving championships will be 
the final meet for the Bruin men's program, which is scheduled to be eliminated 
after this season, along with men's gymnastics.

MASTER'S TACKLES SEASON'S FINAL QUESTION; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: HOW DO MUSTANGS 
MEASURE UP AGAINST NAIA'S BEST? THEY FIND OUT IN FIRST-ROUND GAME TODAY AGAINST 
GEORGIA SOUTHWESTERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Oates approached his first season as basketball coach at The Master's 
College with several questions, but the Mustangs have had all the right answers 
in compiling a 28-4 record and earning a berth in the NAIA Division I 
tournament for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's will play Georgia Southwestern today at 8:45 a.m. PST in a 
first-round game of the 32-team tournament at the Mabee Center at Oral Roberts 
University in Tulsa, Okla., but at the season's outset Oates did not expect the 
Mustangs to be living on Tulsa time in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the players not only learning how to play with each other, but also 
within a new system, it is going to take this team some time to jell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates compiled a 598-252 record over a 30-year career at the high school, 
junior college, NCAA Division I, NAIA and international (Athletes in Action) 
level before replacing Mel Hankinson at Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankinson led the Mustangs to a 99-68 record from 1988-93 before taking an 
assistant coaching position at West Virginia, but Oates led the team to its 
best ever win-loss record by combining a more up-tempo offense with a more 
pressing man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's advanced to the NAIA tournament for the first time by defeating 
Biola, 93-80, in the championship game of the NAIA Far West Region Independents 
tournament March 7. The Mustangs are seeded 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southwestern (23-9), which lists former President Jimmy Carter and his 
wife Rosalyn as alumni, won the Georgia Athletic Conference tournament title 
with a 95-82 victory over Clayton State (Ga.). The Hurricanes are seeded 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's won seven of nine games to start the season, but it took victories 
over UC Riverside and Northwest Nazarene (Ida.) during a three-game, five-day 
stretch in December to prove that the team was for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was a really crucial week for us because we were in the middle 
of finals, yet we played well," Oates said. "That's when we realized that we 
were a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside went on win the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title ahead of 
defending NCAA Division II champion Cal State Bakersfield and Northwest 
Nazarene played Eureka (Ill.) in the semifinals of the NAIA Division II 
tournament Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's will use its standard eight-man rotation in today's game, led by 
senior center Emeka Okenwa (16.8 points, 9.6 rebounds per game), sophomore 
forward James Mosley (15.7 ppg) and senior point guard Andy Thompson (10.2 ppg, 
7.4 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Doug Leaman (12.0 ppg) and Colin Lubsey (7.0 ppg, 4.8 rpg) will round 
out the starting five at guard and forward, with reserve guard Mike Penberthy 
(9.6 ppg) playing an integral role in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman is averaging 16.7 points in the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southwestern is led by junior guards Dwayne Harper and Eric Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 Harper leads the Hurricanes in scoring (17.7), rebounding (7.6) 
and assists (7.9), and the 5-10 Taylor is averaging 17.2 points.

 Caulkins won the Southern Section Division III final and finished third at 
State in the 1,600 meters last year and appears to be on pace to do better this 
year. Wednesday at a non-scoring meet against Corona and Canyon, she ran a 400 
in 62.7 seconds, about the same time she ran at the end of the 1993 regular 
season."She's already that much further along," Coach Al Britt said. Saturday, 
Caulkins was named athlete of the meet at the Irvine Invitational after winning 
the 1,600 in 5:17.8, the 3,200 in 11:52 and running on the winning 1,600 relay 
team. Other notables:

 As a freshman in 1991, MacMillan combined with teammate Neil Weber on a 
no-hitter.Last season, he pitched a one-hitter in a Sea View League victory 
over Newport Harbor. Thursday, MacMillan achieved an elusive goal: a perfect 
game. He retired every batter he faced in a 1-0 victory over Foothill in a 
consolation semifinal at the Newport Elks tournament. He struck out 11, 
including five in a row at one point. Only one batted ball left the infield 
against MacMillan, who had a 1.88 earned-run average last season. Other

<P>
 Starks, who suffered torn cartilage in his left knee last Wednesday against 
Atlanta, can begin running in about six weeks, team doctor Norman Scott said.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; SABRES' HASEK SAYS ALL HE NEEDED WAS CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even Dominik Hasek looks twice at the league-leading 1.93 goals-against 
average and .931 save percentage listed next to his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe it," said Hasek, the Czech goalie who is carrying the 
Buffalo Sabres through an injury-filled season. "Before the season, I thought 
about playing maybe 30 games, because we had Grant Fuhr on the team. I never 
expected this." 
</P>
<P>
 He never expected Fuhr to need knee surgery, and he never expected he might 
become the first NHL goalie in 20 years to compile a goals-against average of 
less than 2. That he's European makes his success more unlikely, because no 
goalie trained outside of North America has compiled the league's lowest 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 The slender Hasek doesn't seem to block much of the net. But his flexibility 
gives him remarkable reach and his agility is ideal for a butterfly style 
because he gets up quickly after going to his knees to make a save. In 49 
games, he has been as close to unbeatable as anyone since the Flyers' Bernie 
Parent had a 1.89 goals-against average in 1973-74. 
</P>
<P>
 "To rise to the level of elite goalies takes time and dedication and working 
hard, and Dominik did that," Sabre Coach John Muckler said. "We felt he could 
play, but we didn't know he'd come this far. He's been sensational this year. I 
don't know what we would have done without him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hasek, 29, was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in 1983, but wasn't allowed 
to leave Czechoslovakia until 1990. Despite making the International Hockey 
League all-star team in 1991, he couldn't beat out Blackhawk incumbent Ed 
Belfour, and was sent to Buffalo in 1992 for goalie Stephane Beauregard. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to Chicago, the coaches didn't believe (in) me too much," he 
said. "The coaches didn't give me a chance. This year, I'm getting more chances 
to play. It has taken me a couple of years to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most European goalies are baffled by the number and angles of shots 
in the NHL, Hasek has adjusted well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had to learn how to . . . handle the puck," he said. "In Europe, 
coaches don't like goalies to handle the puck. They want you to just give it to 
the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sabres are promoting Hasek for most valuable player, and he's a good pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should be wonderful, but this is my first season (starting), and it 
would be very difficult," Hasek said. "I just think about the Sabres making the 
playoffs. Then I just think about the first round and the next game after 
that." STRAIGHT AND NARROW 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Fogarty had it all. A tall, mobile defenseman who was sure-handed at 
both ends of the ice, he was Canada's top junior player in 1989 and was chosen 
ninth overall, by Quebec, in the 1987 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 He nearly lost it all to alcohol abuse, which led the Nordiques to suspend him 
repeatedly before finally discarding him. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Tampa Bay 
Lighting also washed their hands of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still only 24, Fogarty got another chance -- perhaps his last -- when the 
Montreal Canadiens signed him as a free agent Feb. 25. So far, they say, so 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can call it a gamble, but we did our homework and he has not had a 
problem since the middle of May last year," Coach Jacques Demers said. "We 
talked to people who coached him recently (in the International Hockey League), 
and they said he straightened out. He has done all we've asked, hockey-wise, 
and off the ice, he has been excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 Fogarty said he is not in a treatment program and credits his wife for his 
turnaround, his sobriety dating to his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She deserved it. I love her very much," he said. "I'm going to work hard at 
it. SHARK HUNT 
</P>
<P>
 One season, they are playing Montreal for the Stanley Cup. The next, the Kings 
must sweep a home-and-home series from the San Jose Sharks this weekend to 
sustain their playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's do or die for us, it's as simple as that," Wayne Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marty McSorley thinks taking that approach will add more stress to an 
already tense team. His impression, when he was reacquired from Pittsburgh, was 
of "a lot of nervousness, a lot of pressure" among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 16 games left," he said. "That's 32 points. That's a lot of points. 
By saying we have to win those games, we're putting ourselves right behind the 
eight ball. . . . If you've got a bit of a snowball growing, it's tough to turn 
it around. You've got to do the extra things to turn it around and get 
everybody back in the mind-set of believing how capable this team is." 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Kings capable of passing San Jose? Probably not. It's too late to make 
up for a season's worth of being too lazy to hold up opposing wingers or limit 
shots on their goalies. Even if the Kings win 10 of their last 16, the Sharks 
can hold on by winning only six of 15. AM I BLUE? 
</P>
<P>
 Petr Nedved was the big winner Monday, when arbitrator George Nicolau ruled 
that the St. Louis Blues must give the Canucks center Craig Janney and a 
second-round draft pick as compensation for signing Nedved as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedved got $4 million for three years, $1 million more than Vancouver had 
offered, and he got to choose where he plays. Janney becomes the victim of 
Nedved's holdout and of the NHL's not-so-free agency. There is talk he might 
not report -- and if he does, the Canucks have questions about the strained 
knee that has kept him out of the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues get a player who is younger -- Nedved is 22, Janney 26 -- and has 
greater potential than Janney, an exceptional playmaker but average scorer. By 
including the pick, they made a reasonable offer and avoided losing 50-goal 
scorer Brendan Shanahan, whom Vancouver had wanted. Verdict: Blues win big. 
SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford General Manager Paul Holmgren says he gained grit and speed in his 
trades with Calgary and Chicago. He also cut his $13-million payroll by about 
$1.2 million by sending James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Mikael Nylander to 
Calgary for Gary Suter, and sending Suter and Randy Cunneyworth to Chicago. He 
ends up with Paul Ranheim, Ted Drury, Frank Kucera and Jocelyn Lemieux. Calgary 
will have a potent power play with Zalapski, Patrick and Al MacInnis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing stops Boston right wing Cam Neely. He overcame knee problems and 
scored his 50th goal last week, then last Saturday lost the tip of his right 
pinky when it was slashed off by the New Jersey Devils' Tommy Albelin. It was 
sewn back on and he returned by the end of the period to set up Boston's only 
goal.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; ZONE DEFENSE MIGHT HAVE HELPED ANTEATERS 
DURING REGULAR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anteaters' mad dash for a worst-to-first conclusion to their 1993-94 
roller-coaster ride brings up a few questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where was this zone defense when they were losing seven in a row, and 11 of 
13? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Could an appearance in the Big West Tournament final mean a contract 
extension for Coach Rod Baker? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And where do we go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tempo, tempo: Baker clung to his tempo-dictating, man-to-man and pressing 
defenses like a guy hanging from a ledge on the 20th story. His steadfast 
conviction that Irvine's athleticism and depth would wear opponents down might 
have been a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine succeeded at forcing most opponents to play at a fast pace, but the 
Anteaters also won only four games in conference and ended up chasing the other 
team into a layup too often. They always pushed the ball up the court but 
usually wound up with fewer fast-break baskets than their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooters such as guard Chris Brown -- who almost shot the Anteaters into the 
NCAA tournament with 24 three-point field goals in four games and had a 
school-record 122 on the season -- are rare. But the Big West is loaded with 
guys who can run and jump and excel against a man-to-man match-up. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to give Baker credit for adjusting in the tournament, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played more zone in the last three days than we have all year," he 
admitted after Irvine beat Pacific in the semifinals. And the Anteaters played 
the zone almost exclusively during their loss in the final to New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't they play the zone more during the season? 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did, would we be where we are right now?" Baker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the whole season was a ploy to surprise the rest of the conference in 
the tournament. If so, Baker's a genius. After finishing the regular season 
with a 7-19 record, that 10-20 looks pretty darn good. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Baker, the second consecutive 4-14 Big West record will not 
go unnoticed by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero when he and Baker sit down to 
"evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A season of grace: Four dream days in March aren't going to earn a contract 
extension for Baker, who will be in the fourth year of a four-year contract 
that Irvine can't afford to buy out next season. 
</P>
<P>
 What Baker needs is a reversal of fortune in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 On most nights, the Anteaters slit their own throats, but they did lose three 
times in overtime, three times by two points, once by four, once by five and 
twice by six. 
</P>
<P>
 A play here. A call there. The ball figures to bounce the other way once in a 
while. But Irvine was 0 for overtime and 0 for three when one basket decided 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the Anteaters aren't that far away. Their tournament blitz exhibited 
their potential and put a little fear in the Big West powers-that-be. But it's 
only a jumping-off point. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker will need more than a handful of victories to persuade Guerrero that he 
deserves an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about my job," Baker said. "It's really not an issue for me 
because I won't make the decision of whether or not I coach at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we do what we do and we're not going to stop doing what we think is 
right. And maybe we proved this week that what we do ain't half bad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wait 'til next year: Baker and Co.'s focus now turns to recruiting. Inside 
help is already on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Simmons, a 6-foot-8 forward from Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, 
N.Y., committed during the early signing period and should help offset the loss 
of center DeForrest Boyer. Boyer shot 65% from the field, averaged 11.3 points 
and 6.3 rebounds and blocked 52 shots this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the front line are LaDay Smith, who became a starter late in the 
season because of his defense and rebounding; Jermaine Avie, No. 3 on the team 
in minutes played and No. 1 in rebounding (6.7), and Shaun Battle, who seems to 
wait until the final month of the season before deciding to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The perimeter shooting spots are pretty much set with Chris Brown, the 
nation's most prolific three-point shooter (4.7 per game) and the team's 
leading scorer (17.4); Todd Whitehead, fifth on the team in scoring (7.5), and 
Mark Odsather, second in three-pointers with 47 on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd (Fudge) Mumford, the grit and soul of the '93-94 team who set a school 
record with 171 assists this season, leaves a legacy of acrobatic drives and an 
unabashed love for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He also leaves a large void. Zuri Williams is a good ballhandler, usually 
makes good decisions and plays solid defense. But his lack of offense is too 
great a liability to make him the No. 1 point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker needs a quick, smart point guard who's at least a threat to shoot 
outside if left unattended. The coach is scouring the community college ranks 
for the right man. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford sees a bright future. Of course, this guy makes Big Bird seem a 
pessimist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to see past the disappointment now," Mumford said after his 
last game, "but I feel good about what we did together as a team in the 
tournament. We showed some people what we're capable of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something these guys can share with the new guys, something they can all 
build on." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The golf team finished second in the 44th Southern California Intercollegiate 
Golf Championships at Torrey Pines Friday and Saturday. Nine teams competed in 
the university division, which was won by Cal State San Bernardino (601). 
Irvine shot 610. Irvine's Paul Calabrase shot a 74-76 -- 150 to tie for second 
place.

INFLATIONARY FEARS AGAIN WHACK BONDS 
</P>

<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields opened lower but quickly turned higher Monday after a 
fresh hint of inflation reawakened market fears. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market held its ground despite the rise in interest rates. Most 
indexes closed marginally higher, and smaller stocks led the market. But in 
Mexico City, stocks plunged more than 3.2% on political worries. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The beleaguered bond market started the day with a rally, but quickly fell 
apart after the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta released a February survey 
showing increased manufacturing activity and upward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the 30-year Treasury bond yield was at 6.95%, up from 6.90% on 
Friday. Yields on short-term securities also surged. The six-month T-bill yield 
hit 3.96%, up from 3.91% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said big investors remain unwilling to step up and buy fixed-income 
securities because they fear that too many of their peers are still looking to 
bail out, as the growing economy threatens to push up the inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Fed survey of regional manufacturers said activity had reached its 
highest level in two years, and more respondents reported paying and asking 
higher prices for goods than in January. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Atlanta report merely confirmed the trend described in a nationwide 
survey of corporate purchasing managers nearly two weeks ago, bond traders were 
in no mood to hear it again -- especially with two key inflation figures due 
for release this week: Today, the government will report on wholesale inflation 
in February; on Wednesday, the February consumer inflation report is due. Other 
Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The market turned in a good account of itself, given the jump in interest 
rates, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials traded in a narrow range and closed up 0.28 point at 
3,862.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Though trading was slow, winners topped losers by 6 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and another rally in technology issues pushed the Nasdaq composite 
index of mostly smaller stocks up 3.60 points to 792.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say the stock market is in the process of breaking away from the 
bond market's woes, as investors focus more on the promise of higher corporate 
profits than on rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks continued to lead the market, illustrating investors' hunt for 
companies benefiting from the expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer rose 7/8 to 38 1/8 after it unveiled its new Power Macintosh 
line of personal computers. IBM jumped 1 5/8 to 57 1/2, Digital Equipment 
soared 1 3/8 to 32 3/8, Lotus gained 1 5/8 to 79 1/8 and Intel leaped 1 3/8 to 
70. 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorola added 1 3/8 to 107 in the wake of Japan's agreement Saturday to 
allow the company to complete its cellular phone installation in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 Other telecom stocks gaining included DSC Communications, up 1 5/8 to 56 1/2; 
Broadband Technology, up 2 1/4 to 26 1/4, and Qualcomm jumped 1 1/4 to 26 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * A sharply higher quarterly earnings report from Federal Express drove its 
stock up 3 to 70 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's losers, NYSE-listed shares of Telmex tumbled 3 1/4 to 62 
1/4. In Mexico City, the Bolsa stock index plunged 81.05 points to 2,429.88, as 
investors again dumped Mexican shares on worries about the country's political 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index rallied 410.84 points to 
20,526.15, and European markets also rebounded sharply. London's FTSE-100 index 
surged 41.5 points to 3,233.4, while Frankfurt's DAX index gained 41.68 points 
to 2,145.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar rallied against other major currencies, reaching its 
highest closing level in a month against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Comex, gold continued to advance, rising $1.10 to $386.40 an 
ounce. Silver rose 7 cents to $5.45.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; A PALER VERSION OF RIP'S PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rip magazine is more or less the Rolling Stone of heavy metal, and the 
L.A.-based magazine's anniversary party is an important annual ritual in the 
life of rock 'n' roll -- a multiband spectacular where Guns N' Roses played its 
last-ever club show in Los Angeles a few years ago, and where Temple of the Dog 
made its only local appearance. The Rip party is also predictable for a certain 
display of decadence -- reasonably connected nonpartisans can gather enough 
ammunition to sling at hard rock for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ritual has come to mean slightly less since Helmet and Soundgarden 
have replaced GNR and Metallica as the thinking metalheads' bands of choice, 
and on Sunday at the Hollywood Palladium, this year's Rip party seemed almost a 
little sad. When Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee paraded through the balcony with 
a pneumatic blonde tethered to his extremely tattooed arm, barely anyone 
bothered to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuttering John, the tedious Howard Stern sidekick, played an equally tedious 
set of mainstream, Cinderella-style rock; Prong, former defenders of Maoist 
purity in metal, played half an hour of almost blues-flavored, start-and-stop 
hard rock. Pantera, probably the next big speed-metal stars, were sloppy and 
appealing, combining something very much like Robert Morse patter songs from 
Broadway musicals with riffage that tottered on the thin line between 
speed-metal and boogie. 
</P>
<P>
 But, mostly, there was an extremely rare performance by S.O.D. -- 
Stormtroopers of Death -- a broadly satirical all-star speed-metal unit beloved 
both by anti-fascists and by a certain cadre of intolerant metal lunkheads who 
just don't get the joke. And although the band (which includes Anthrax 
guitarist Scott Ian) was often loose and funny in the best tradition of 
joke-band punk, it was hard to crack a smile when singer Billy Milano, the size 
of a WWF wrestler, led the audience in a stiff-arm salute and the chant "Speak 
English or die." JONATHAN GOLD

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: OVITZ, DILLER DENY TIME WARNER RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They appear side by side, along with Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner, in a power photo prominently displayed in the New Yorker's special 
tribute to Hollywood this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz and QVC Inc. Chairman 
Barry Diller are both vigorously denying speculation that one of them is in 
line to run Time Warner Inc. if Seagram Co.'s Bronfman family makes a hostile 
play for the media and entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Seagram announced plans to purchase up to 15% of Time Warner shares 
on the open market, rumors have persisted that the Bronfmans had something 
hostile in mind. The family has repeatedly denied that, but speculation heated 
up again Monday when CNBC-TV's Dan Dorfman reported that Seagram may launch a 
proxy fight for the New York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner shares rose $1.25 to $38.75 on the New York Stock Exchange after 
the cable report aired. Seagram added 12.5 cents, closing at $28.50.  
</P>
<P>
 Said one well-placed source: "I think it's serious. That doesn't mean anything 
will happen. It just means they're serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner has enacted a so-called poison pill plan designed to make a 
hostile bid prohibitively expensive. Seagram on Monday denied that it plans a 
proxy battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovitz and Diller, who also happened to have lunch together Monday at the Grill 
in Beverly Hills, have been linked to the Time Warner job largely because each 
is close to Seagram President Edgar Bronfman Jr. A source close to Diller 
recently called the Time Warner rumor "nonsense." Ovitz's office said Monday 
that any talk of his taking on the job is "preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is . . . nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Steven Spielberg restaurant sweepstakes, that is. A spokesman Monday 
confirmed that the mega director-producer will not be giving a private party 
after Monday's Academy Awards ceremony, where he's expected to be showered with 
statuettes for "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 The top contenders for major prizes often reserve space at trendy restaurants 
on Oscar night to celebrate their victories. Clint Eastwood played to a packed 
crowd last year at Nicky Blair's after winning top honors for "Unforgiven." In 
an earlier sweep, Kevin Costner commandeered the Columbia Bar and Grill to 
celebrate winnings for "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 Several restaurants supposedly offered space to Spielberg. But Marvin Levy, 
his spokesman at Amblin Entertainment, said the director is too much the 
homebody to play party animal on Oscar night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll probably go to the Governors' Ball (the official reception) and then go 
home," Levy said. "At most he may have a few close friends over. But a party is 
not his style." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more on the style front. While no one has come up with a 
pronunciation for the stylish emblem that music star Prince has adopted as his 
name, that apparently doesn't matter to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 His new release, "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," is stacking up as one 
of his biggest recent hits, even though the name Prince is nowhere to be found 
on the cassette jacket. Adding to the song's unusual lineage is the fact that 
it is on the independent Bellmark Records label. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Bell, the veteran record executive who heads Bellmark, says Prince brought 
the song to the small Los Angeles-based company after it had signed on to 
manufacture, market and distribute records for the singer's private label, NPG. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussion started about artists he would put on the label," Bell said. 
"A week or so later, I got a call saying there might be a single from Prince 
first, which got my undivided attention. . . . From that point on, we set out 
to negotiate the arrangement that allowed us to put it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince stipulated that his given name not be used in connection with the 
release, but sources say he's "promoted it like crazy." "The Most Beautiful 
Girl in the World" is ranked at No. 16 with a bullet on the Hot R&B charts, No. 
21 with a bullet on Billboard's Hot 100 and No. 10 on Soundscan's extended 
single chart.  
</P>
<P>
 Chances are that Bell's Prince will come along only once, because the singer 
is still signed to Warner Bros. A source at Warner said Prince was given a 
onetime dispensation to record outside the label as part of Warner's recent 
decision to sever its business ties to his Paisley Park label. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bell, who turns 54 today, says he will take what he can get. "We probably 
were at the right place at the right time," he said. "Sometimes it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes it happens twice. Bellmark also released the monster single 
"Whoomp! There It Is" from Tag Team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes studios let the good ones get away. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar Pictures' "Guarding Tess," which led the competition with a 
$7.1-million gross for its opening weekend, was initially supposed to be made 
by Paramount Pictures two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tess" was one of the first movies given the go-ahead by then-Paramount 
Chairman Brandon Tartikoff. Shirley MacLaine and Nicolas Cage had already been 
signed to play the leads in the story about a beloved former First Lady and her 
browbeaten Secret Service agent when Tartikoff left in late 1992, sources say.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramount subsequently put "Tess" in turnaround, which is common when studio 
regimes change. Producers Ned Tanen and Nancy Graham Tanen took "Tess" on for 
TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Inc. Chairman Sumner Redstone, who toured Hollywood last week for the 
first time since acquiring Paramount Communications Inc., is still in his 
"getting to know you" mode. Redstone and Chief Executive Frank Biondi plan to 
meet with William Morris Agency President Jerry Katzman and several of his 
movie agents in New York next week. Redstone and Biondi have also committed to 
a second meeting with a larger Morris contingency in L.A.

BASIC, CARELESS MISTAKES TRIP MILLIONS IN FILING TAX RETURNS; FINANCE: 
FORGOTTEN SIGNATURES, MISSING FORMS AND MISCALCULATIONS DELAY REFUNDS AND CAN 
TRIGGER PENALTY CHARGES OR AUDITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A forgotten signature. Missing forms. Miscalculations. 
</P>
<P>
 They're the nightmare of any self-respecting tax preparer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these and other careless mistakes crop up on millions of tax returns each 
year, resulting in delayed refunds and, in some cases, interest and penalty 
charges for the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those things can slow the return process down. . . . Most can be 
avoided," said Nancy Anderson, manager of special tax projects for H&R Block 
Inc. in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathematical errors are by far the most common. The Internal Revenue Service 
says 4.3% of all individual tax returns for 1992 contained some type of 
miscalculation, up from 4.2% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Other frequent errors include failing to sign and date a return, note a change 
of address, write down a Social Security number, or enclose W-2 forms. Many 
also involve writing down the wrong tax liability from tax tables, filling in 
the wrong line on a tax form, or neglecting to claim a standard deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS computer system quickly spots the more obvious gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of math errors, the computers will automatically correct the problem, 
then process the return. Other mistakes -- particularly the more involved ones, 
like misinterpretation of the tax laws -- may first require an exchange of 
letters with the taxpayer, also known as a "tax contact." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's computer system has been especially vigilant in catching 
discrepancies between documents supplied by a bank or employer and information 
listed on a return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may not report all the income that's reported by companies to the 
IRS. That's a big mistake," said Fred Daily, a San Francisco tax attorney and 
author of "Stand Up To The IRS." 
</P>
<P>
 "They might say, 'Well, I only made $6 in interest on a savings account. Why 
should I include that on the return?' 
</P>
<P>
 "(Or) a handyman who works for cash may not realize that a company is 
obligated to report (to the IRS) . . . if they pay him more than $600 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Any mismatch usually will result in a tax contact, and could, in some cases, 
lead to a full-blown audit. There are about 5 million tax contacts each year 
and most are resolved quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS, though, has up to three years to assess a deficiency on a return, and 
up to six years if there's an error in calculations of at least 25%. The 
statute of limitations for fraud is unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that lulls people into a false sense of security is that the IRS 
may not get around to matching information on tax returns . . . until two years 
after the original due date of the tax return," said Daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether deliberate or unintentional, mistakes can bring taxpayers significant 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, failure to place a Social Security number on a return, statement 
or other document that requires it can result in a $50 fine for each offense. 
More serious errors, such as a substantial understatement of taxes due, can 
result in a 20% payment on the underpayment. 
</P>
<P>
 If a reasonable cause exists, however, the IRS may waive any penalties, though 
it may charge interest on taxes due if a mistake causes a return to be filed 
late, said Larry B. Scheinfeld, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick's New York 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think they wouldn't assess the penalty . . . unless you're doing 
something underhanded. They tend to have some sort of sensitivity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that hasn't always been the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Garner, national director of personal financial counseling for Ernst 
& Young, recalls one client who was hit with substantial penalties and interest 
charges after writing in a deduction on the wrong line. The client had 
discovered the mistake, but instead of redoing the form, made his own editing 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a tax error. It was an error in filing his return. It just 
mushroomed . . . and he ended up getting audited," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the IRS also has been known to make a few mistakes of its own. The 
agency has an estimated 1% to 2% error rate in processing claims, according to 
Daily. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not important who's responsible for the error. It's always up to the 
individual to correct the mistake, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is not self-fixing. If the IRS says you didn't report certain 
income and your return clearly says you did, it's up to you to correct that 
mistake," said Daily. 
</P>
<P>
 H&R Block's Anderson recommends individuals "prepare their returns as early as 
possible, set them aside for a couple of days, go back to review them for 
arithmetic, and make sure they're signed with the right address." 
</P>
<P>
 The return can always be amended later, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says H&R Block has a separate quality-control department that does 
nothing but check for theory and math. But if any mistakes slip by, the return 
probably will be kicked back automatically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS says the mathematical accuracy for returns filed electronically is 
nearly 100%.

TIPS TO AVOID ERRORS IN TAX FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few tips for avoiding common errors in tax returns: 
</P>
<P>
 * Check your math, recheck it, then let someone else do the same. (If your 
return is done via computer, the program will do the calculations for you.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you correctly write your Social Security number and the numbers 
for all dependents on the return. Include your number on each page of the 
return in case pages are misplaced during processing, and on the face of any 
checks made out to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign and date the return and make sure your spouse does likewise if filing 
jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check that W-2 forms and 1099 forms are correct. Otherwise, have them 
corrected as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you have used the correct column in the tax-rate table or the 
tax-rate schedule for filing status. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check that you have claimed all your dependents, even elderly parents who 
may not live with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't claim a personal exemption on your return if you can be claimed as a 
dependent on someone else's return. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sure to claim a credit for any overpaid Social Security taxes withheld 
from wages if you worked for more than one employer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Complete Form 2210, "Underpayment of Estimated Taxes," to calculate the 
underpayment penalty, rather than have the IRS do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Complete Form 8606, "Non-Deductible IRA Contributions," for any 
contributions to an individual retirement account even if you don't claim any 
deduction for the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep records of all documents sent to the IRS. Use certified mail for 
important correspondence.

HELP NEEDED BY TOWNS, CITIES ON SAFE WATER TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of small communities are financially unable to meet federal drinking 
water requirements and need help finding cheaper ways to make their water safe 
to drink, a congressional report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a 
separate study that the nation's largest cities are using outdated filtration 
technology to remove contaminants from drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRDC study and the report by Congress' General Accounting Office were 
presented to a House hearing on legislation aimed at improving federal drinking 
water requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report said that meeting federal drinking water standards is an acute 
problem for about 50,000 small communities that account for 90% of the drinking 
water violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that it will cost small 
communities nearly $3 billion to comply with federal drinking water regulations 
and another $20 billion to repair, replace and expand their current drinking 
water infrastructure to meet future needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) estimated that 70% of the costs will be incurred by 
communities that account for 10% of the population. "It can't be done," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some municipal water systems rely on technologies invented before the Civil 
War, the group said.

JACK KENT COOKE WIFE ARRESTED IN DEPORTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wife of billionaire Jack Kent Cooke was arrested Monday by the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service after she lost an appeal of her deportation order. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlena Ramallo Chalmers Cooke, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to a drug 
trafficking charge and served time in a federal penitentiary, was taken into 
custody without incident at her apartment in Alexandria, Va., INS spokesman 
Duke Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she lost her appeal of the deportation order originally issued in 
1988, before she married the owner of the Washington Redskins football team. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton ordered her released on $50,000 bond 
pending another hearing, INS spokesman Verne Jervis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jervis said the agency considers Marlena Cooke deportable because she left the 
country voluntarily while she was under the deportation order, negating her 
right to remain in the country. He said she would have an opportunity to appeal 
a decision after the hearing.

DANNY BARKER; GUITAR, BANJO GREAT SPANNED 60 YEARS OF JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Barker, a champion of the banjo and a virtuoso guitarist whose career 
spanned 60 years with jazz giants of all eras, has died. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker died Sunday of cancer at home in his sleep. He had been diagnosed as 
having the disease in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Although too weak to play, he reigned as the Mardi Gras king of the "Krewe du 
Vieux" on Jan. 29 -- a day designated by the city as Blue Lu and Danny Barker 
Day to honor the musician and his wife, Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Barker, famous in her own right, picked up her nickname as a blues 
singer -- particularly from performances of some of Barker's risque 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker's last performance was New Year's Eve at Preservation Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one will ever replace Danny Barker because he was an original," said Doc 
Cheatham, a trumpeter who played with Barker in Cab Calloway's orchestra in the 
1930s. "He went through the years of everything that happened (in jazz). That 
will never be again." 
</P>
<P>
 Barker was presented with the 1991 Lifetime Achievement Award by the National 
Endowment for the Arts, which designated him a jazz master. Shortly afterward, 
the U.S. Postal Service issued a cachet honoring him. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker could play any style of music. He started with Storyville jazz banjo at 
16, switched to guitar for big band swing in the 1930s, appeared in orchestra 
clips in movies and became a widely known soloist on the 1947 radio program 
"This is Jazz." He even played amplified guitar for rhythm and blues in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was known mainly for the kind of guitar he played with Cab Calloway's 
orchestra -- single-string solos with technical virtuosity. He was among the 
first to take jazz guitar out front, beyond the unheralded position of backup 
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 He played with the giants of jazz: King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis 
Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Red Allen, Bunk Johnson, Charlie Parker, Dizzy 
Gillespie and Wynton Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
 He was particularly fond of the banjo and was determined to help restore it to 
popularity -- contributing significantly to the mid-century ragtime revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker composed throughout his career. "Save the Bones for Mr. Jones" was one 
of his most famous, recorded by Johnny Mercer and Nat (King) Cole. His most 
recent composition was "Palm Court Strut," recorded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker wore a pencil-thin mustache, and in recent years his appearances 
frequently capitalized on his deadpan wit, accented by derby hat, flashy jacket 
and a repertoire of one-liners and banjo-backed vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker and his wife of 63 years had one daughter, Sylvia Barker of Rochester, 
N.Y.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; POST-RAMS PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim officials are right to plan for life without the Rams, even while 
trying to induce the professional football team to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 City executives said last week that they are considering a plan to create a 
sports and entertainment complex in the area of Anaheim Stadium, home to the 
Rams and the California Angels baseball team.The complex could be linked to 
Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center by monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 A second plan envisions a large retail center near the stadium and along the 
Santa Ana River trail, much like CityWalk in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 The major question in both concepts, which are still in the very early talking 
stages, is where to get the money. City officials rightly hope to raise as much 
as possible from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim wisely is trying to hang onto the Rams, who have said they are looking 
at other cities where they might make more money after their lease expires next 
year. Regardless of how the team does on the field -- poorly in recent years -- 
the city indeed benefits from leasing the stadium and getting a cut of the 
tickets and concessions. Area merchants also benefit from the tens of thousands 
of fans who show up on game day. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiations over renewing the lease on a former school the Rams use as a 
training facility show how tough a bargainer the team can be, and Anaheim 
cannot afford to give the team everything it may seek. The city would do well 
to have a plan in place if the moving trucks pull up to the stadium some time 
next year.

OWNER OF DENNY'S IN WATTS REPLACED; BUSINESS: CORPORATE OFFICIALS TAKE OVER 
FIRST BLACK-OWNED FRANCHISE IN THE CHAIN. THEY SAY OPERATOR WAS HAVING 
DIFFICULTY IN MEETING HIS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Donald J. Bohana appeared destined for success when he began serving soul food 
and wooing customers to Denny's "N" the 'Hood in the Watts-Willowbrook area. 
But nearly two years after the nation's first black-owned Denny's opened, 
corporate officials of the restaurant chain have taken over the eatery from 
Bohana. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar Companies, Denny's corporate owner, said the company was forced to 
take over because Bohana "was having difficulty in meeting the financial 
obligations to operate the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar declined to give details, but the action followed the eviction of 
Bohana from the restaurant, located at the Kenneth Hahn Shopping Plaza, for 
failing to make any payments on a $735,000 county government loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The eviction culminated months of negotiations between Bohana and the shopping 
plaza's landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my understanding that Mr. Bohana owed the landlord money, and that 
coupled with the problems with the county led to the eviction," said Victoria 
Pipkin, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohana built the restaurant after securing a $635,000 low-interest loan from 
Los Angles County because the project was in a redevelopment zone. The amount 
of the loan increased to $735,000 later that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohana has refused comment through his attorney, Jesse Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were different in 1992, when community leaders heralded Bohana for 
opening the first family-style restaurant in Watts since the 1965 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant appeared to take off when Bohana began serving collard greens 
and oxtails alongside pancakes and burgers at the eatery on South Wilmington 
Avenue. Despite the eclectic menu that broadened the restaurant's customer 
base, problems arose when Bohana failed to make loan payments for reasons that 
remain unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's officials declined to reveal whether Bohana was making a profit. The 
restaurant was closed Thursday after Bohana had been forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's moved quickly to reorganize the restaurant and reopened it Monday 
under new corporate management. Flagstar officials pledged that the Denny's "N" 
The 'Hood's menu will remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were back at work early Monday morning with the addition of three 
company managers, according to Karen Randall, a spokeswoman for Flagstar. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition took place so quickly that many customers were not aware of the 
change. But the failure of the nation's only African American-owned Denny's did 
not go unnoticed by those who had supported the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents a failure," said Teryl Watkins, vice chairwoman of the Watts 
Labor Community Action Committee. The nonprofit group and Alexander Haagen 
Properties Inc. own and manage the shopping plaza. "It crushes us to see this 
happen," she said. "We want more black-owned businesses in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials with the Community Development Commission have refused to 
discuss the loan agreement, except to say that Bohana did not meet his payment 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is awaiting the go-ahead from the Board of Supervisors to pursue 
legal action against Bohana if necessary, said Corde Carrillo, of the 
commission's economic development division, which oversees community block 
grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Denny's officials were working to secure a new franchisee for the 
restaurant, which once represented an opportunity to improve the company's 
tarnished image that has been plagued by racial discrimination lawsuits.  
</P>
<P>
 Denny's was accused in 1992 of discriminating against African Americans at two 
Denny's restaurants in Costa Mesa and San Diego, including allegations that 
African American customers were required to pay for meals in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In another high-profile case, six African American Secret Service agents 
accused a Denny's in Maryland of refusing to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Denny's reached an agreement with the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People to include more blacks in the company.

EX-STAFFERS ALLEGE ABUSES BY SVORINICH, AIDE; GOVERNMENT: THEY SAY WORK RELATED 
TO THE COUNCILMAN'S PAINT STORE WAS DONE DURING CITY TIME. HE DENIES THE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months after he took office last year, Los Angeles Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. and an aide engaged in phone calls and other business related to 
his Wilmington paint store despite a ban on such activity on city time, several 
former aides to Svorinich have told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 One former aide, John Barbieri, alleged that Svorinich would routinely visit 
his Industrial Paint Co. on Mondays -- one of two days each week the council 
does not meet. Other former aides allege that Svorinich aide Irene Mendoza 
often fielded phone calls from the store at the councilman's San Pedro office. 
That activity, they say, continued even after Svorinich's former chief deputy, 
John Vidovich, wrote a memo warning Mendoza that she would be put on leave if 
she continued to work on store business. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Svorinich and Mendoza deny the allegations by the former aides, who are 
among six whose recent departures -- voluntary or otherwise -- have left the 
councilman's office in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges and allegations (the former aides) are making are preposterous," 
Svorinich said. "If they have any allegations, they should contact the 
authorities and stop using the media as a bully pulpit. What is the next step . 
. . go on the Oprah (Winfrey) show?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the former aides have aired their allegations in recent weeks to the 
city's Ethics Commission and the district attorney's office. The former aides 
also have alleged that campaign contributions were brought to Svorinich's San 
Pedro office despite a ban on such political activity in city offices. 
Svorinich also has denied that allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, who worked for Svorinich's paint store before she took a job with his 
council office, said she went to the store only during her lunch hour or before 
work. She added that those visits occurred only during Svorinich's first few 
weeks in office last summer, when the store was hiring new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 After that period, she said: "The store people would call me but I would just 
take messages for the councilman. . . . But I wasn't conducting business." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Svorinich said he did not recall receiving any messages from the 
store, which he has owned since December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Solnic, the store's floor manager, said Svorinich has been too busy as a 
councilman to visit the store on weekdays, except for a brief stop on occasion. 
"The last time I saw him here was three Saturdays ago," Solnic said Saturday. 
"If he had a meeting in the area, he might stop in for a few minutes, but gosh, 
that was rare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent interviews with The Times, five former aides tell a different 
story, one that alleges instances of private business done on city time -- a 
potential violation of ethics laws because city resources are not to be used 
for private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Former chief deputy Vidovich, for example, became so concerned about work 
related to the paint store being done at the San Pedro office that he told 
Mendoza in an Oct. 18 memo that she risked being put on leave because of such 
activity. "It has come to my attention . . . that there are a lot of phone 
calls still coming into the office regarding paint store business," Vidovich 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to an August discussion on the topic with Mendoza and Svorinich, 
Vidovich's memo reiterates that Mendoza should not be doing anything relating 
to Industrial Paint on city time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working on IPC business on city time is not acceptable and definitely a 
violation of some type in regards to city ethics. Therefore, if in fact you are 
required to work on paint store business, I must put you off on leave (with) no 
pay for that period," Vidovich wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that this may upset you, but I have an obligation to protect Rudy 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 While refusing to discuss the memo, Vidovich confirmed in an interview that he 
was told Mendoza was working on company business for months after Svorinich 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware of Irene doing some paint store business and I talked to her 
about my concerns and I talked to Rudy," he said, explaining that he wrote the 
memo on the matter because former aide Kate Acuna told him "a lot of calls" 
were still coming to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna, who worked in the San Pedro office, confirmed that she went to Vidovich 
because of Mendoza's alleged actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, there were many calls from the paint store right up until" she left her 
job in January, Acuna said. "There were calls (from the paint store) all the 
time. Calling for Irene or Rudy. If they were there, I would connect them, if 
they were not, I would just take a message." 
</P>
<P>
 On other occasions, Acuna claimed, Mendoza was at Industrial Paint when she 
was scheduled to begin her workday. "I know (Mendoza) was at the paint store 
because she would say so," Acuna said. "And when I told her this could bring . 
. . problems, (she said), 'Well, Rudy wants me to go over there,' " Acuna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza denied making the remark and Svorinich denied asking Mendoza to do 
store work on city time. Both also said they never saw Vidovich's memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former aide Barbieri claimed that Svorinich himself was often at 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the council does not meet on Mondays or Thursdays, Barbieri said 
Svorinich was "routinely" at the paint store on Mondays during his first three 
months in office. "And it probably continued on for the first seven months. I 
just lost track," Barbieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that period and after that . . . when Rudy was at the paint store, he 
would call and I would say, 'Where are you?' And he would say, 'I'm at the 
store,' " Barbieri claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would comment to him . . . about the example he was setting. (Vidovich) and 
I would tell (Mendoza) and others this is not the way things are done," 
Barbieri said. "And it became clear to me that this was being done at the 
direction of Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Barbieri claimed, Mendoza told him on at least two occasions -- late 
last year and again in mid-January -- that she was doing paint store work on 
city time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recalling both meetings, Mendoza said she never told Barbieri she was 
doing store work on city time. "He (Barbieri) told me, 'You better be careful 
about what you are doing.' And I said, 'John, I'm not doing anything illegal.' 
And he said, 'Rudy better be careful.' And I said, 'Well, I don't know what 
he's doing. But I'm not doing anything illegal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lilia Hernandez, another former aide who worked in the San Pedro office, also 
remembered calls from Svorinich's paint store routinely coming to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know calls came in because I answered the phones," Hernandez said. "They 
would call from the store and ask for (Mendoza)." Hernandez said "that happened 
pretty much throughout" the seven months she worked for Svorinich. 
</P>
<P>
 And Brian Hannon, a former aide based in Harbor City/Harbor Gateway, said he 
knew of paint store calls coming to the San Pedro office when he would visit 
there. "It was pretty much continuous. People from the paint store were 
calling," Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It was well known in the office that (Mendoza) was going to the 
paint store during the day."

MTA HALTS TUNNEL WORK AFTER MISHAP; SUBWAY: OFFICIALS CITE A LOCOMOTIVE 
ACCIDENT THAT HOSPITALIZED THREE WORKERS. THEY SAY THE INCIDENT IS THE LATEST 
IN A SERIES OF SAFETY VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles subway project's largest tunneling job has been shut down 
because of the contractor's "serious safety violations" and a locomotive 
accident that hospitalized three workers, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's rail construction 
staff said the tunneling operations, along Vermont Avenue and Hollywood 
Boulevard, would remain halted until the contractor takes corrective actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The most seriously injured worker, a tunneling superintendent for the 
contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, suffered cut leg tendons when he jumped from the 
out-of-control locomotive. Citing alleged violations of safety regulations and 
other problems, the MTA's construction manager halted tunneling and ordered the 
superintendent's removal from the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is under investigation by the California Division of Occupational 
Safety and Health, according to the agency's deputy chief, Mark Carleson. 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries occurred at 10:10 a.m. Friday, after the superintendent 
transported seven other workers into the tunnel on the locomotive, according to 
the superintendent and MTA officials. When the locomotive began careening out 
of control and the superintendent feared a derailment, he and the seven others 
jumped off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped off and it hit my knee," said the superintendent, Norm Hutchins, who 
was recuperating from leg surgery Monday at Queen of Angels Hollywood 
Presbyterian Medical Center. ". . . It's not hurt bad. It's just a cut." 
Hutchins later could not be reached for comment on the effort to remove him 
from the Metro Rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the MTA and the state labor department said it would be a 
violation of safety regulations for workers to ride on a locomotive not 
outfitted with seats and other passenger features. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were seven people on top of the engine, which is itself a violation of 
safety standards," said Bill Heard, an MTA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the engineer who administers the tunneling 
contract on behalf of the MTA's construction manager described the accident as 
the latest example of "your ongoing unacceptable safety and quality performance 
on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, a joint venture of three construction 
firms, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Sandberg, the MTA's subway project manager, said the alleged safety 
violations included the contractor's improper maintenance and operation of the 
construction rails and the trains that haul dirt from excavation sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the number of safety violations that has been of concern, but the 
length of time it's taking the contractor to correct them," he said. "Safety 
wasn't given priority attention by the contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 The closure is only the latest difficulty to beset the $165-million contract, 
encompassing 12.1 miles of twin tunnels under construction along Vermont Avenue 
and Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 From last July through December, tunneling underneath Hollywood Boulevard was 
halted while workers pumped the equivalent of a small town's water supply from 
the tunnel's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputes worth tens of millions of dollars are already under way between the 
MTA and Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, regarding responsibility for the water problems and 
other conditions. And the MTA's construction manager, Parsons-Dillingham, has 
within the last two months reassigned its top engineer overseeing the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the tunneling shutdown announced Monday, the MTA's top executive, 
Franklin E. White, called the action "a clear demonstration of our commitment 
to safety both for our workers and for the public."

$42 MILLION DIVIDES L.A. UNIFIED, UNIONS; EDUCATION: TEACHERS AND OTHERS LAY 
CLAIM TO MONEY SAVED BY A CUT IN HEALTH BENEFITS. SUPT. THOMPSON SAYS THE FUNDS 
WILL BE KEPT ON RESERVE IN CASE OF A BUDGET CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest round of sniping between the Los Angeles Unified School District 
and its unions, teachers and others who took a 10% pay cut are laying claim to 
an unexpected $42 million saved by reducing health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special Board of Education meeting Monday, Supt. Sid Thompson pledged to 
keep the money on reserve to be used -- if necessary -- to balance next year's 
school budget. If the district does not need the money, however, Thompson said 
its use will be negotiated with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the promise did not satisfy the unions representing teachers, aides, 
clerks and others among the district's 70,000 employees, most of whom received 
a pay cut last year and gave up some of their health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein said Monday that the $42 
million belongs to the unions and cannot be used to balance the budget. "That 
is our money and he will find himself in court faster than he can count to 3 if 
he uses it," Bernstein said. "This infuriates me. I am not going to play games 
with him -- this will go to court." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the labor contracts last year, six employee unions took over 
administration of the health plan. The $42 million in savings was realized 
because benefits were reduced and fewer people filed claims, according to 
district and union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the teachers' contract stipulates that any new money must be 
applied to restoring teacher salaries. The labor contracts expire in June, and 
negotiations are expected to begin again next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Moreno, an official with the California School Employees Assn., which 
represents office workers and clerks, said the $42-million saving should be 
kept in an account specifically earmarked for the benefits program. She said it 
could be used to offset higher costs next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That money was squeezed out of employees," Moreno said. "It came from cost 
savings generated by our six unions." 
</P>
<P>
 While Thompson said Monday the district is expected to end the school year in 
the black, he said the budget is tenuously balanced. Changes in state funding 
in the next few months could require use of the $42 million to balance the 
budget or to help next year's finances. About 90% of the district's revenue 
comes from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson disputed that the cost saving belong to the unions. "These are 
district dollars," Thompson said. "Yes, we have the authority to use it in case 
of a major budget issue." 
</P>
<P>
 A financial report released Monday showed that the district will end the year 
with an $18.8-million surplus. In next year's preliminary budget estimates, 
also discussed Monday, the district could have a $3.7-million reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about how fluid this is," Thompson told reporters in a 
budget briefing session. "This talks about what may be in June -- not what will 
be. It means the system is just balanced . . . but it's precarious." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget estimates, however, do not reflect any funding for new programs 
already promised or announced, such as grouping schools into new clusters to 
streamline operations, increasing campus security and adding schools to the 
LEARN reform program. Thompson said he will bring to the board next month his 
requests for budget additions. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they, too, will bring forward suggestions for the budget in 
the coming weeks. But they were reluctant to speculate about whether there will 
be money to implement any new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to make some tough decisions . . . (such as) how are we going to 
pay for the reform efforts that we are hanging our hats on," said board member 
Jeff Horton. "It's clear that there's no extra money anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials expect a $4-billion budget for 1994-95 that largely depends 
on how much money the state Legislature devotes to schools. Any shortfalls in 
the state budget could mean deep problems for Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $1-billion shortfall in the state, for example, could mean a loss of $40 
million to the district -- the equivalent of a 2% salary restoration for 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we present to you today could change very quickly -- very drastically 
even -- depending on any number of funding developments or actions at the state 
and federal level," Thompson said. "This is the tightest of budgets."

HERO AT THE WHEEL; WHEN MOTHER COLLAPSES, BOY, 9, DRIVES ACROSS FREEWAY LANES 
TO SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A third-grader with a stomachache was hailed as a hero Monday after he guided 
his unconscious mother's van through a quarter-mile of freeway traffic after 
she collapsed behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom said she was getting sick, and then she started to shake and then she 
passed out," said 9-year-old David Dillman of San Pedro, whose mother, Mary 
Dillman, was driving their minivan in the fast lane of the southbound San Diego 
Freeway when she apparently suffered a seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I took hold of the steering wheel and unbuckled my seat belt, and I drove 
through four lanes to the right-hand side. My mom had showed me how to drive 
when I was 7 -- she put me in her lap and let me drive the wheel. I just kept 
thinking that my mom was going to die, and I just had to get the van over to 
the right-hand side." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dillman, 38, was taken to Gardena Memorial Hospital for examination after 
the incident, which took place about 11 a.m. near the freeway's Western Avenue 
exit, authorities said. Her husband, Air Force Lt. Col. Robert Dillman, said it 
was the first time such a thing had happened to her, and that her doctors had 
not determined why she collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities lauded the child's poise in handling a 
life-threatening emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him afterward how he had learned to drive, and he said it was just by 
watching his mom," said California Highway Patrol Officer Todd Sturges. "I 
said, 'Were you scared?' And he said, 'No.' And I said, 'Well, you're a real 
hero' -- which he definitely is. This had a happy ending, and it could have 
turned out a lot differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Dillman said his wife and son had been visiting him at the Air Force 
base in El Segundo and were heading home when his wife collapsed. David, he 
said, had stayed home from school, complaining that his stomach hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in the lane adjacent to the car-pool lane, and had drifted into it 
before David could unbuckle his seat belt and take the wheel," Dillman said. 
With no idea which pedal was the accelerator and which was the brake, he said, 
David stepped onto the gas, then managed to slow the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a magnificent job," the father said. "We're very proud of his presence 
of mind and clarity of thought in a pressing situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "He steered it for approximately a quarter-mile, until it came to rest on its 
own. Then he put it in park and turned off the ignition," Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Highway Patrol officers were on the scene within minutes, having been summoned 
by other drivers who had seen the van begin to swerve, Sturges said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dillman, Sturges said, was semiconscious when paramedics arrived. She was 
released from the hospital after several hours of testing, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 David said he was surprised "that a 9-year-old like me" could manage such a 
feat -- especially because "I was weaving in and out of cars, and none of 'em 
slowed down." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his mother shed a few frightened tears at the end of the ordeal 
but otherwise remained calm. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, he said, was still feeling a bit woozy Monday night. He did not 
say whether his stomachache had gone away.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; PIZZA PARLOR 
EVACUATED; PEPPER SPRAY BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A children's pizza parlor was evacuated and several customers were taken to 
the hospital when someone apparently sprayed the restaurant's game room with 
pepper spray, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people were evacuated from a Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant in 
Torrance on Sunday when fumes, ostensibly from pepper spray, spread through the 
restaurant, said Torrance Police Lt. Paul Besse. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were getting a little crazy, but no one was seriously injured," said 
restaurant general manager Mike Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven people, including at least four children, were treated at hospitals and 
released, Besse said. Police were investigating the incident but had no 
suspects Monday, Besse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of pepper spray for self-defense was legalized in the state this 
month. Made from an ingredient found in cayenne pepper, the spray causes 
excruciating pain and breathing problems when blasted into the eyes, nose and 
mouth.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-SEN. 
ROBBINS ORDERED TO PAY $3 MILLION TO FDIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ordered former state Sen. Alan Robbins on Monday to pay more 
than $3 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. but 
spared him additional prison time for illegally obtaining bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who has just completed a prison sentence on political corruption 
charges, told reporters later that he was relieved that "the ordeal of my 
incarceration is over."He said he is fully committed to making restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The former multimillionaire said he could not say when he will be able to make 
the payments because much of his net worth is tangled up in lawsuits with 
former business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing before U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi stemmed from 
Robbins' 1992 guilty plea to three counts of failing to fully reveal in writing 
his financial situation when applying for loans from Independence Bank of 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, 50, had $3.38 million in loans outstanding from the bank when it was 
taken over by federal regulators. The FDIC is the conservator of the bank's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi could have sentenced Robbins to a maximum of six years and a $750,000 
fine. Bowing to the recommendations of federal prosecutors, Takasugi imposed a 
prison term that ran concurrently with his recently completed time at a federal 
prison camp at Lompoc in Santa Barbara County.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO 
DISMISS LAWSUIT BY DENNY, 2 OTHERS AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused Monday to dismiss a lawsuit 
alleging that the city violated the civil rights of trucker Reginald O. Denny 
and two other victims by pulling police forces out of a neighborhood where 
rioting erupted on April 29, 1992, leaving citizens at the mercy of their 
assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John Leahy ruled that the city and the Police Department are not immune 
from potential liability in the lawsuit, which alleges that police forces 
withdrew from Florence and Normandie avenues in the early hours of rioting, 
allowing the violence to escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. has argued that the Police Department 
followed a policy of racial discrimination and redeployed its forces to protect 
predominantly white neighborhoods. Florence and Normandie, in a largely black 
and Latino neighborhood, was a flash point of the worst rioting in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Annette Keller had argued that previous rulings have 
found that cities and city officials are largely immune from liability for the 
illegal activities of its residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Can a governmental agency and its officers succeed . . . with an argument 
that they are immune or that they have no duty to protect?" Leahy wrote. "I do 
not think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying she will appeal Leahy's ruling, Keller added that she continues "to be 
surprised that the judge won't apply the statutory immunities to this case. 
It's the first time a judge has ruled like that. It's puzzling, at a minimum. 
He's charting his own course here." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Ferrer, an attorney in Cochran's office, said Monday: "We're just very 
happy about the judge's ruling and not entirely surprised by what he did. 
Hopefully we can move forward and try to bring this case to some resolution as 
soon as possible."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES AIRPORT; 
AIRPORT PANEL TO CONSIDER ADDING RESTAURANTS, BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Airport commissioners will consider a plan today to allow more restaurants and 
bars in Los Angeles International Airport terminals, including fast-food 
chains, upscale eateries and cafes.  
</P>
<P>
 The move is intended to give travelers more food and beverage choices as they 
pass through the nation's third-busiest airport, and to improve LAX's 
profitability, Commission President Ted Stein said."We're trying to make Los 
Angeles into a world-class airport, and the food and beverage concessions 
(should) reflect that," Stein said. In the future, travelers waiting for 
flights could sip cappuccino at Starbucks or dine on pasta at a California 
Pizza Kitchen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the change would help drive up airport revenues, which 
could be used to pay for city services. But the city still must win federal 
approval to divert those LAX profits.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for offering eight more concession contracts-four for 
fast-food establishments and four for specialty restaurants and bars. 
Host-Marriott Inc. now runs all airport restaurants and bars. Airport officials 
could begin the search for new concessions within a month, but the new 
establishments probably would not open in time for the World Cup soccer 
tournament this summer, Stein said.

MALATHION SPRAYING TO START AGAIN; RULING STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As another round of malathion spraying begins this week, lawyers are sorting 
out the significance of an appellate court decision that put new life in a 
lawsuit linked to the state's Medfly battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of malathion pesticide to kill an infestation of the 
agricultural pest in the Riverside County cities of Corona and parts of Norco 
is scheduled to begin again at 9 tonight and will last three to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials and others say the appellate decision made public last week 
signals that such spraying has been recognized by the courts as a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that the maker of 
malathion might not have adequately warned the public of potential health 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling, in itself, is enough to stop spraying, in my opinion," said Bill 
Miller, mayor of Corona, which has sought to halt the spraying. "If for no 
other reason, from the standpoint of human decency. If there is any doubt at 
all then that is far too much doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter spraying of malathion has been part of the state's long-running 
effort to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from establishing itself in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate decision reopened a lawsuit filed by the parents of 14-year-old 
Juan Macias. The parents claim that spraying the chemical caused the 
teen-ager's blindness. A lower court had dismissed the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court ruled that American Cyanamid, which stopped making 
malathion in 1991, might have had a duty to warn the public if it had reason to 
believe the state was not adequately informing people of the dangers of 
spraying. The spraying had been ordered by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is not likely to be decided until 1995 or 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy G. Weatherup, the lawyer who argued the appeal for American Cyanamid, 
wrote in a legal journal that it is "unbelievable" that a court could expect a 
private company to go over the state's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Getz, deputy attorney general defending the California Department of 
Food and Agriculture in the Macias case, described the ruling as limited in 
scope, noting that it did not say the spraying was negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court is saying that the trial court and the lower court made a mistake 
in letting the manufacturing company out this early in the case," Getz said. 
"It certainly does not say that malathion causes blindness." 
</P>
<P>
 State authorities say the Medfly threatens California agriculture, but city 
officials say the pesticide poses a risk to residents.

RAPIST WITH HIV GIVEN 159 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six women -- all of them victims of a rapist who carries the AIDS virus -- 
listened quietly Monday as the ex-convict was sentenced to 159 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Monette Johnson, 35, cannot be released from prison before 
2073, but that provided scant solace for his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monette Johnson is the true essence of evil, and he has no remorse at all for 
anything he has done," said one of the women. "He deserves not to see the light 
of day (while) free again." 
</P>
<P>
 A second victim said, "I just wanted to say to Mr. Monette that even on your 
deathbed, you'll never understand the pain you have caused all of us the past 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever want to see or hear from this piece of filth again," said a 
third victim, a woman so brutalized by his attack that she must use a crutch 
and requires the assistance of a trained dog to help her walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's case gained notoriety when several of his victims were informed by 
health officials that they had been exposed to the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 While four of the victims were told they were exposed, they are prevented by 
law from learning the source of the exposure. It is a felony under state law to 
reveal whether someone carries the HIV virus -- even a convicted rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this type of situation where someone is charged with a sexual assault, 
(confidentiality) is not appropriate because he is forced to take that (HIV) 
test," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow. "So why should he have any 
right to confidentiality?"  
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, the disabled woman blamed Johnson for sending her on a journey 
of uncertainty and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 7 a.m. phone call from health department officials, the woman went to 
a meeting at which she was told she had been exposed to the human 
immunodeficiency virus, but she was not told who was responsible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know who it was because I am not sexually active," said the woman, who, 
ironically, tried to prevent her rape by falsely telling Johnson that she was 
infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 All six of the women said that their tests for the HIV virus have been 
negative for more than a year, by which time the virus is usually detectable, 
although they continue to be tested regularly as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, of Lake View Terrace, was convicted a month ago on 26 felony charges. 
Half of those were sex counts, including rape and sodomy. The jury found that 
Johnson assaulted six women and one man during a series of late-night break-ins 
in the San Fernando Valley in 1991 and early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John Fisher sentenced Johnson after reading a lengthy 
list of his previous crimes, which date back to an arrest for robbery in 1972 
when he was juvenile. Johnson has spent at least 11 years in prison as an 
adult. He was paroled in July, 1991, five weeks before the first rape. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing, Fisher commended the victims' "courage" and "great 
dignity" for testifying against Johnson and praised the Los Angeles Police 
Department for compiling evidence.

 Six women, each one a victim of the same rapist and each fearing she has been

</P>
<P>
 The woman looked at Johnson and said she hopes that he dies "from the 
disease."

 Johnson's case has gained notoriety when several of his victims were informed

compiled evidence to "clearly" show Johnson's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 During a trial that began Jan. 11 and was interrupted by the Northridge 
earthquake, a jury heard evidence that included a positive identification by 
one victim, a fingerprint that was found at one scene, and stolen property from 
each victim that was recovered in Johnson's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, according to Rabichow and to the jurors, was genetic 
evidence that almost conclusively identified Johnson as the man who raped and 
sodomized the victims.

DWP CONSIDERS CLOSING ITS AGING SUN VALLEY PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is considering closing its San 
Fernando Valley power plant, despite concerns by some DWP workers that the 
plant has been serving as the area's backup power source during emergencies, 
such as the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950s-era plant in Sun Valley is the oldest and least efficient power 
generator of the DWP's four city plants and DWP officials say closing it would 
save money because electricity can be purchased more cheaply from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can provide electricity from other sources at a cheaper price, then 
that is what we are going to do," said Rufus Hightower, the DWP's assistant 
engineer for power operations and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hightower said the Valley plant is 20% to 25% less efficient in generating 
power than newer plants, such as the newly modernized DWP station in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 But some DWP workers and employee union representatives point out that the 
Valley plant provided vital power after the Jan. 17 quake knocked out other 
power sources. Closing it, they say, would eliminate a vital reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we look at it, this plant just saved their bacon," said Steve Cook, 
assistant business manager of the electrical workers union that represents DWP 
employees, including those who work at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in earthquake country. This is very liable to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hightower said DWP supervisors are aware of the crucial role the Valley plant 
played after the quake. Because of that, he said, the DWP is conducting a study 
to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of closing the plant. The study should 
be completed in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the results of the study, Hightower said the consensus among DWP 
managers is that the plant will close. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP obtains nearly 80% of its power supplies from coal-fired plants in 
Arizona, Utah and Nevada and hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest. The 
remaining 20% or so of the power is generated within the city at four 
natural-gas burning plants. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, the gigantic network used to import power from plants 
outside the city was temporarily knocked out, forcing the city to rely heavily 
on its four local plants to get through the crisis. The Valley plant was the 
first local station to come on line. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Valley plant, the generating stations are the Haynes plant 
in Long Beach, the Scattergood plant in Playa del Rey and the Harbor plant in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley plant has four generating units, each of which can produce power 
independently. Just over a year ago, the DWP closed two of those units and now 
plans to close the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 By closing the plant, the DWP could save up to $7 million annually on the cost 
of operating and maintaining the facility, a DWP official said. The facility 
employs about 85 workers. They are not concerned about losing their jobs if the 
Valley station is closed, because most would probably be transferred to other 
plants, but are genuinely concerned about the supply of power to residents in 
emergencies, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plant is closed, it could not be used as an emergency backup because it 
would take six months to a year to get back in operation, Hightower said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Acosta, a shop steward who has worked at the Valley plant for 15 years, 
said that although the Valley plant is old, it is reliable. He said it would be 
a mistake to close the plant because it would leave the city vulnerable in 
another natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 15 years I've been there . . . the Valley plant has never failed to 
come on line when needed," he said. "That is not an exaggeration. It's like a 
reliable car that starts whenever you turn the key."

GETTING IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time since the Jan. 17 earthquake, students and faculty members 
resumed classes in a handful of major buildings at battered Cal State 
Northridge on Monday, marking a small milestone on the long road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 After a rush of preparations, university officials were able to open the 
ground floors of three science buildings and the engineering building solely 
for lab classes. The move provided some much-needed work space for biology, 
physics and computer lab classes that had been held over the past month in 
portable trailers with no equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It also made some students nervous about returning to the multistory concrete 
buildings where cracks were still visible on walls. "I'm scared to be here in 
this building right now," conceded Haleh Kia, 22, a senior biology major taking 
a lab in the relatively undamaged Science 4 building. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But most students, including Kia, said they were glad to get back to their 
normal quarters, and she said of the nervousness: "We'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Professors, meanwhile, said they expect to recover lab time lost during the 
past month during the rest of the semester and predicted students' academic 
performance will not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a little bit behind. We've overstressed the theory and 
understressed the physical contact thus far. But I think it's something we can 
make up," said Duane Doty, a professor of nuclear physics who had just one of 
four scheduled students show up for his morning lab class in experimental 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three no-shows, Doty said one was out of town on a trip, the other had 
voiced concern about returning to the Science 1 building after the earthquake 
and Doty was unable to contact the third student with the news that their lab 
class, for the first time this semester, would no longer be held in a bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the earthquake, classes at CSUN began two weeks late on Feb. 14. 
And because the temblor closed virtually every major building on campus due to 
varying degrees of damage, most classes until now have been held in several 
hundred portable classrooms trucked to the campus or moved to about two dozen 
off-campus locales. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they made it a top classroom priority to restore the 
on-campus lab space because the lab areas house equipment and other materials 
that were difficult to duplicate elsewhere. Only a handful of classes were held 
in the reopened portions of the buildings Monday, where equipment appeared to 
have survived surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground floor portions of the one engineering and three science buildings 
were the first among the university's roster of major classroom buildings to 
reopen since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they expect to gradually begin restoring more 
permanent classroom space, with the next priorities being more science and 
engineering labs. Officials said the second floors of the Science 1 and 3 
buildings may reopen later this week. The ground floors of Sierra South and the 
Speech/Drama building also will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Said computer science professor Philip Gilbert, whose students worked on 
computers in class Monday: "If we had to wait any longer, I think you would 
have had some very unhappy faculty. But here it's only the fifth week of the 
semester and we're more or less back to a semblance of normalcy."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; HAMBLIN STARTS THERAPEUTIC RIDING CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth resident Gloria Hamblin has started a new therapeutic 
horseback-riding charity in the wake of her departure from another Chatsworth 
riding group, the Institute of Equestrian Therapy, which is under investigation 
by the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin, who was one of two founders of the Institute of Equestrian Therapy, 
was fired after raising questions about alleged mismanagement of the institute. 
Her queries prompted the attorney general's investigation. Institute officials 
deny any wrongdoing, and are still offering classes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin's new group is called Ride On Therapeutic Horsemanship, a shoestring 
operation made possible by the donation of four docile horses and donated space 
at a Chatsworth stable. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 20 years of teaching riding to disabled riders in the area, 
Hamblin has been able to quickly fill two days a week of classes with former 
students, and she said she is looking for more horses so that those on a 
waiting list can take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she started giving Ride On's first lessons with the help of 10 
volunteers. Her students included Lloyd Anderson, who lost motor skills and 
suffers other side effects as a result of a head injury he sustained in a 
traffic accident eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Physical therapy is no easy matter for someone like Lloyd, a big-boned 
23-year-old who towers over his parents, said Nancy Anderson, Lloyd's mother. 
She said she has strained her own arms trying to help Lloyd regain the use of 
his limbs, and was grateful to watch from the sidelines Thursday as Shotgun, a 
slow-moving, elderly chestnut horse, took over the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of head injuries, Lloyd and one classmate, Dawn Rader, 27, have a 
tendency to cross one leg in front of the other as they walk. Horseback riding 
forces their legs apart, explained Norman Anderson, Lloyd's father.  
</P>
<P>
 "A therapist can't do it as well as this," Nancy Anderson said. "Many people 
don't understand. It's not just something fun to do. It does so many things." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when he began riding, Lloyd couldn't get out of a wheelchair 
or sit up by himself in the saddle, Nancy Anderson said. Today, he walks with 
the aid of a walker, and can guide the horse on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first it was difficult," Lloyd said. "I'm developing balance a little at a 
time. I see improvement a little at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hamblin, the future of the organization is in doubt. She faces losing the 
use of the borrowed Chatsworth property at the end of the month, and says she 
needs more funds -- and older, docile horses -- to expand the classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, families such as the Andersons are getting what they can from the 
new charity. Riding, said Nancy, "gives Lloyd a freedom he doesn't have. It 
gives him command." JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FREE VAN SERVICE FOR REVELERS EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A free van service for intoxicated St. Patrick's Day revelers will be expanded 
from a San Fernando Valley program to a citywide project this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Los Angeles Police Department and Budget Rent-A-Car of 
Southern California, the fourth annual van service program will give 
party-goers a safe alternative to driving home tipsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Tom Souza of the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division started the program as 
a way to cut back on the number of drunk-driving incidents on St. Patrick's 
Day, one of the biggest drinking nights of the year, and to parallel the 
successful programs he had heard about in other countries, according to Officer 
Gil Ramos, who is helping Souza supervise the program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been so successful, LAPD has decided to start similar efforts 
on a citywide basis. Last year, off-duty police officers who volunteer their 
time drove 119 people home. There was only one arrest for drunk driving and no 
injury accidents on that night in the Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't had the program, it would have been like turning loose 119 
potential DUIs," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 From 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Thursday, people who have had too much to drink can 
get a free ride home by calling the nearest police station. More than 500 bars 
and restaurants throughout Los Angeles will participate in the community 
awareness and safety program by posting flyers with police phone numbers. The 
rental car company has donated 15 passenger vans to the program. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 2 QUAKE-DAMAGED LIBRARIES REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Fernando Valley branches of the Los Angeles Public Library that were 
damaged by the Northridge earthquake reopened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Small crowds gathered as the doors opened at 10 a.m. at the Canoga Park and 
Sherman Oaks libraries, which were closed for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 At both locations, shaking from the quake toppled heavy wooden bookshelves or 
pulled them loose from the walls, sending tens of thousands of books to the 
floor. At the Canoga Park branch, fluorescent light fixtures fell and smashed 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven branches of the public library remain closed, and a schedule for their 
reopening has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Reagan, a spokesman for the libraries, said public support has helped 
push forward the repair and reopening process. "The public is being very 
helpful and understanding," Reagan said. "We get a lot of help from volunteers 
in putting books back on the shelves, and we get calls every day from people 
asking, 'What can we do to help?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A library supporter from Canoga Park dressed in a clown costume to alert 
passersby to the reopening. And at the Sherman Oaks branch, library workers 
decorated the interior with potted flowers donated by a supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so happy to be back," said Judy Sanchez, branch librarian in Sherman 
Oaks. "People have been so wonderful to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan said that many books were thrown off the shelves during the quake, but 
most of the library shelving did not topple. Nonetheless, he said, the damage 
prompted an evaluation. "We are checking shelving in all the branches to find 
out what needs to be done to make them stand up to evaluation," Reagan said.  
</P>
<P>
 The two branches will be open extended hours -- Monday through Wednesday from 
10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Thursday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. SUSAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WINNETKA; RESIDENTS SEEK TO CHANGE AREA'S NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents in what is now called South Winnetka are seeking a name change that 
would make their neighborhood part of Woodland Hills, and they have begun 
joining the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization to speed up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt is the most recent in a long series of controversies over San 
Fernando Valley place names. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's likely to add another dimension to a long-standing muddle in the 
South Winnetka area over what the place is really called. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said they had always thought that they lived in Canoga Park, 
until informed by the post office a few years ago that their 91306 ZIP code 
roots them firmly in Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Weinmann, a longtime resident who opposes the name change, said he has 
always thought it was Canoga Park despite persistent rumors of a Winnetka 
designation. "If they can get Woodland Hills stuck in there, I'd be living in 
three places at once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the name change want the area south of Vanowen Street to Victory 
Boulevard and east of Mason Avenue to Winnetka Avenue to be listed on city 
planning maps as Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Teeter, a resident who supports the name change, said the area feels 
itself to be a "left-over finger of Canoga Park" misidentified by the U. S. 
Postal Service as Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents want to be part of Woodland Hills, she said, to gain political 
clout. Issues involving Pierce College and Warner Center affect the 
neighborhood directly, yet residents are excluded from much of the discussion 
surrounding them, Teeter said. Property values are also thought to be higher 
for those homes that can claim to be part of the Woodland Hills community, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change is opposed by City Councilwoman Laura Chick. In a letter 
addressed to the South Winnetka Neighborhood Watch, Chick wrote that name 
changes are divisive, and suggested that members expend their energy improving 
conditions in Winnetka rather than trying to escape it. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents have shifted the focus of their efforts to the powerful Woodland 
Hills Homeowners Organization. More than 60 have joined in the last two weeks, 
said Bob Gross, organization president. So many joined that the homeowners were 
persuaded to name Teeter to their board of directors to represent the new 
neighbors, Gross said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; 40 HAVE APPLIED FOR PARKS DIRECTOR POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty people have applied so far to replace Jess Margarito as parks director 
in San Fernando, and 160 people have expressed interest in the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito was fired from his job as director of the Department of Recreation 
and Community Services in January for alleged misuse of his office.An interim 
director, Rollie Wright, has held the job for the past seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of questions and a lot of concerns in the community 
that we get the right person," said Christine Manriquez-Lissik, personnel 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The position, which pays from $57,000 to $70,000 depending on experience, 
involves planning and developing recreational and community programs in the 
largely Latino city. To find qualified candidates, the city has been 
advertising in local newspapers, on TV stations, and in trade publications 
throughout the nation, Manriquez-Lissik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked for someone who understands the culture as well as speaks the 
language," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent panel made up of parks officials from other areas and other job 
experts will interview candidates from March 28 to April 4. On April 12, a 
short list of candidates will be interviewed by a panel of three job experts, 
and on April 14 City Administrator Mary Strenn will choose the finalists and 
recommend them to the City Council, Manriquez-Lissik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The normal process will follow," said Council member Doude Wysbeek. "The 
ultimate decision is the council's." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

DWP MAY CLOSE SUN VALLEY POWER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is considering closing its San 
Fernando Valley power plant despite concerns by some DWP workers that the plant 
has been serving as the area's backup power source during emergencies, such as 
the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950s-era plant in Sun Valley is the oldest and least efficient power 
generator of the DWP's four city plants. DWP officials say closing it would 
save money because electricity can be purchased more cheaply from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can provide electricity from other sources at a cheaper price, then 
that is what we are going to do," said Rufus Hightower, the DWP's assistant 
engineer for power operations and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Valley plant is 20% to 25% less efficient in generating power than 
newer plants, such as the recently modernized DWP station in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 But some DWP workers and employee union representatives point out that the 
Valley plant provided vital power after the Jan. 17 quake knocked out other 
power sources. Closing it, they say, would eliminate a vital reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we look at it, this plant just saved their bacon," said Steve Cook, 
assistant business manager of the electrical workers union that represents DWP 
employees, including those who work at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in earthquake country. This is very liable to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hightower said DWP supervisors are aware of the crucial role the Valley plant 
played after the quake. Because of that, the DWP is conducting a study to 
evaluate the effects of of closing the plant. The study should be completed in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the results of the study, Hightower said the consensus among DWP 
managers is that the plant will close. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP obtains nearly 80% of its power from coal-fired plants in Arizona, 
Utah and Nevada and hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest. The 
remaining 20% or so of the power is generated within the city at four plants 
that burn natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, the gigantic network used to import power from plants 
outside the city was temporarily knocked out, forcing the city to rely heavily 
on its four local plants to get through the crisis. The Valley plant was the 
first local station to come on line. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Valley plant, the generating stations are the Haynes plant 
in Long Beach, the Scattergood plant in Playa del Rey and the Harbor plant in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley plant has four generating units, each of which can produce power 
independently. Just over a year ago, the DWP closed two units and now plans to 
close the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 By closing the plant, the DWP could save up to $7 million annually on the cost 
of operating and maintaining the facility. The facility employs about 85 
workers. They are not concerned about losing their jobs if the Valley station 
is closed because most would likely be transferred to other plants, but they 
are concerned about the supply of power to citizens in emergencies, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plant was closed, it could not be used as an emergency backup because 
it would take six months to a year to get it back in operation, Hightower said.

MAHONY APOLOGIZES TO PARISHIONERS, OFFERS NEW PLAN; RELIGION: CARDINAL 
TEMPORARILY BRINGS BACK SPANISH-SPEAKING PRIEST TO ST. THOMAS AQUINAS. 
COMMITTEE WILL BE SET UP TO WORK ON OUTREACH TO CHINESE AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a weeks-long struggle between a prideful Latino parish and an unmoved 
Roman Catholic archdiocese, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has temporarily brought 
back a popular Spanish-speaking priest to a Monterey Park church. 
</P>
<P>
 In another concession, he also announced that the church will give members a 
voice in planning outreach to the Chinese American community via St. Thomas 
Aquinas Church, a parish of 1,200 families, most of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the archdiocese announced plans to bring more Chinese Americans 
into the Catholic Church, in part by replacing St. Thomas Aquinas' one 
Spanish-speaking priest with two Chinese-speaking priests, as well as by moving 
a Chinese school to the church grounds and opening a Chinese community center 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans, which were made without consulting church members, outraged Latino 
parishioners and many in the Chinese American community, who said the moves 
would stir up trouble between two ethnic groups that have been striving to live 
together peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony appeared Sunday before St. Thomas parishioners to read a prepared 
apology and the revised plan. His action was a turnaround from the position the 
archdiocese had taken earlier this month when it rejected pleas for a meeting 
and chided the congregation for stirring up controversy, saying that the 
Catholic Church was not a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must be willing to admit when we have made mistakes, and to take action to 
correct those mistakes in a spirit of humility," Mahony read to the parish. 
"Once again I apologize for the hurt and pain this has caused your parish 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 But some parishioners said Mahony's actions fell short. They also were angry 
that the cardinal delivered his address on Sunday without answering their 
questions or seeking their comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have been resolved so long ago if Cardinal Mahony had sat down 
with four members of the parish council and we could say with dignity and 
respect what we were expecting and avoid media," said Eddie Ramirez, 71, a 
leader in the fight to meet with Mahony over the church's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to this day, he is stubborn. He will not speak to us," Ramirez added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony's letter said that instead of proceeding immediately with its plans, 
the diocese would appoint Bishop Gabino Zavala, the new regional bishop for the 
San Gabriel Valley, to serve as chairman of a church planning committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine parishioners -- three Latinos, three whites and three Chinese Americans 
-- will be appointed by Zavala to serve on the committee. The move includes the 
parishioners in the planning for any Chinese American outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Father Brian Cavanagh, the Spanish-speaking pastor transferred 
this month, will be returned to St. Thomas for the rest of 1994 to aid Father 
Delos Humphrey, the new pastor. But Ramirez said he was told by Cavanagh that 
the priest would be transferred at the end of the year to a Covina church. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony said he hopes that the committee's work will be concluded by the fall, 
with a new Chinese American outreach program in place by the end of the year. 
St. Thomas' parishioners include 840 Latino families but only 20 Chinese 
American members. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioner Monty Villajin, a Filipino American, said Mahony fooled no one by 
transferring Cavanagh back temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason he did that is to pacify parishioners," said Villajin, a 
57-year-old Monterey Park architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Villajin said many older Latinos in the church do not speak English and want 
to receive the Eucharist from somebody who speaks Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey Park City Councilman Sam Kiang, who had earlier criticized the 
archdiocese's plans, said he was pleased that Mahony moved before tensions 
escalated between the parish's Chinese American and Latino members. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Chinese-speaking brothers and sisters are caught in the middle, but 
it's only for the time being," he said. "I'm glad Cardinal Mahony is trying to 
do something."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; LIBRARY TO LOSE TEMPORARY STAFF

<P>
 For most communities, the reopening of a library that was closed after the 
Northridge earthquake is a cause for celebration. But in Sun Valley, where the 
library was never closed, the opening of libraries across the San Fernando 
Valley will mean a loss in personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Library was one of only four Valley libraries that opened 
quickly after the Jan. 17 quake. Two librarians from closed branches were 
transferred to Sun Valley, allowing the facility to expand its outreach and 
other services. Now that the librarians are preparing to return to their 
regular branches, Sun Valley is feeling the pinch again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we would have managed without them," said Judith Tetove, the 
senior librarian at Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tetove, the return of the borrowed librarians underscores the problem of 
short staffing within the city library system. Recently, Tetove said she 
learned that only one of two part-time openings at the branch would be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely going to have to cut back on outreach and services to the 
public," Tetove said. Next week, Sun Valley will only have two librarians on 
duty. They will staff the library for 40 hours per week. But they will have to 
stay on site and do less community work, such as visiting local schools or 
working with local groups. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SPEECH STUDENTS PUT ACCENT ON CLEAR ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Neill Hicks is reviewing the "ow" sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that she would allow us to eat wontons downtown," a female student 
reads dutifully from the spiral notebook in front of her, which contains a 
diagram of a tongue-and-palate formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks is an "accent reduction" instructor at Glendale Community College. His 
students, from Mexico, the Philippines, Iran, Sweden and 10 other countries, 
are the inheritors of a longstanding American tradition of immigrants 
attempting to modulate their accents. But whereas previous generations of 
immigrants saw losing their verbal signatures as a step toward becoming "real" 
Americans, the accent-reduction students at Glendale College say they just want 
to be understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even said they want to keep a trace of their accent, as an expression of 
who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as others can understand me clearly, I don't mind having an accent," 
said Kris Kim, an engineer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "I'm 
proud of being Korean." 
</P>
<P>
 Just six of the 14 said they would like to speak completely unaccented 
English. Some wanted to polish their English as a matter of pride, to show that 
they had achieved success in the language. Others said they wanted to avoid 
embarrassment and overcome discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to have an accent," said Patricia Renderos, who emigrated from 
El Salvador when she was 17. "I want to speak like newscasters." Renderos said 
that as a high school student and homecoming princess in Eagle Rock, she was 
shunned by the other members of the homecoming court because of her heavy 
accent. Nonetheless, the Burbank college student, who prefers the Anglicized 
pronunciation of her name, said she, too, is proud of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Stembridge, an instructor at Glendale College who has taught English as 
a Second Language for 12 years and accent reduction for six, says that her 
previous students were more interested in completely eliminating their accents 
than are her current students. She said the change is probably related to the 
emphasis in recent years on taking pride in one's culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some people find the whole idea of accent reduction offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The English as a Second Language division of the college changed the name of 
its advanced pronunciation class two years ago, from one that had Accent 
Reduction as a subtitle to simply Listening and Speaking 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really can't call a course Accent Reduction anymore, because there are 
people who would object to it," said Kathleen Flynn, director of the for-credit 
ESL division. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; $61,000 GRANT OKD FOR PARK PICNIC AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Land and Water Conservation Fund Program has approved a $61,000 
grant for a picnic area in San Fernando's Las Palmas Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The picnic area is part of a larger park improvement program that includes the 
addition of baseball and soccer fields, restrooms, landscaping and irrigation, 
said Rollie Wright, interim director for the San Fernando Recreation and 
Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando officials have been trying to solicit money from state and 
federal agencies to pay for the improvements, which are expected to cost about 
$400,000, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Land and Water Conservation Fund grant, the park has 
received an $88,000 park bond from the California Department of Parks and 
Recreation, $120,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds, and officials 
have applied for a Proposition A grant, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has become increasingly popular in recent years, attracting seniors, 
families and church groups. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 After complaints about parking problems around the renovated Alex Theatre, the 
city of Glendale is offering free parking to theatergoers who dine at 
participating restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 20 restaurants citywide have agreed to take part in the 
program in time for the April 7 opening of "Mame" at the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 The program allows theater patrons who dine at one of the restaurants to 
receive a free pass to park at a garage on North Brand Boulevard before a 
theater performance, said Jeanne Armstrong, director of redevelopment. Other 
theater patrons will be allowed to park for $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to launch the program in the next few weeks by sending flyers 
explaining the venture to Alex season ticket-holders and placing advertisements 
for parking passes in participating restaurants' windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort stems from parking problems experienced in areas around the 
69-year-old landmark theater during the three-week run of "Sayonara." Parking 
snafus occurred primarily because the 2,000-space Glendale Galleria parking 
structure was closed for repairs during the show, overloading other lots and 
meter spaces, Armstrong said. Two-thirds of the spaces in the Galleria 
structure are now open. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking in the immediate vicinity of the 1,463-seat theater during the first 
musical in a three-show series was also full because theatergoers were unaware 
of parking lots located several blocks away that remained largely empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that there's a lack of parking, it's just that people don't know how 
to get to it," Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 To inform patrons of alternate parking, the city plans to erect signs along 
Brand Boulevard pointing ticket-holders toward alternative lots on Maryland 
Avenue and Orange Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will evaluate the parking pass program after the theater's third 
musical, "Fame," closes in June. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 Damage to city of Burbank facilities from the Northridge earthquake will total 
about $4.8 million, according to an estimate to be presented to the City 
Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, 47 city buildings were damaged along with city streets, 
traffic signals and the power and water systems. The city has spent $1.6 
million in repairs so far. Tonight, the City Council is scheduled to consider 
hiring a consultant to prepare Burbank's application for federal and state aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, David M. Griffith and Associates of Chicago, would provide 
management services as well as apply for federal and state aid. The company is 
expected to charge $25,000. ED BOND

VALLEY INTERVIEW: COMMUNITY LEADER SAYS TIME IS RIPE FOR RESEDA'S TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hilborn was interviewed by Times correspondent Jill Leovy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Hilborn, president of the Reseda Chamber of Commerce and the owner of an 
auto upholstery shop on Reseda Boulevard, has helped form a group called the 
Reseda Business and Community Alliance (formerly Renew Reseda.) 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is counting on an infusion of federal earthquake relief funds 
and the expiration this month of an ordinance, which blocked certain kinds of 
businesses on 24 blocks, to boost redevelopment in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilborn was interviewed by Times correspondent Jill Leovy. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the point of Renew Reseda?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's about revitalizing Reseda. Many cities throughout the country are 
going through similar processes, trying to get older communities back on their 
feet. We have put together a group that has members affiliated with the City 
Council, the city Planning Department, the business community, the schools, the 
KYDS (Keep Youth Doing Something) program, Kiwanis, police. We have met twice 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our ultimate goals is renovating old buildings to attract more 
businesses. For people to want to relocate into an area, it has to be a safe, 
clean, presentable area. Image is the main component, though there are other 
factors, like bringing a couple of anchor businesses into the area and bringing 
in some entertainment for nighttime. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's wrong with Reseda now?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The worst thing is the number of vacant buildings you see. Vacant buildings 
lead to the decay of a community. When you see the vacant buildings, then the 
graffiti pops up and it looks like an area people just want to drive through as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The last three years have been extremely difficult. To give you an idea, just 
in driving by the Reseda business corridor -- around Reseda Boulevard and 
Sherman Way -- there were visibly 70 vacant buildings before the earthquake. We 
are talking business spaces that were available, and buildings that had been 
boarded up. Now we have well over 100. And that we feel will be climbing before 
it turns around. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the '50s, '60s and '70s, Reseda was wonderful. It was new, it was 
safe. The landlords were very involved in the upkeep of their properties. As we 
progressed into the '80s, they found they could rent anything at any price and 
just let them deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Reseda has a problem similar to a lot of small towns -- safety. How can 
you run a business community or a community in general where you don't feel 
safe at night? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What caused that decline?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The recession. If you look at the businesses up and down the streets in 
Reseda, you see a lot of mom-and-pop businesses. They are not as 
recession-proof as many businesses that have large capital backing. 
</P>
<P>
 We are similar to the whole Valley with the downturn in the aeronautics 
industry. Reseda has been hit very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing has been the Interim Control Ordinance. It's so restrictive. 
Businesses that wanted to expand haven't been able to expand, so they moved on. 
It's had a lot of negative effects. It's one of the reasons Reseda has gone 
downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some silver linings, though. We have a tremendous amount of 
automotive businesses which have done pretty well here. There are also a lot of 
doctors in Reseda -- I've counted over 100 doctors' offices here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can you describe the kind of area you want Reseda to become?  
</P>
<P>
 A. A vital community is a community where people feel safe to shop, with a 
nice, clean, presentable look to it, where there is some type of theme, like a 
'50s theme or a gaslight district or a Western theme -- something to make it 
special. Plus we need anchor stores and possibility a multiscreen movie 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice to incorporate sort of an Old Town Pasadena look, where the 
building fronts would reflect a common theme, common colors. Taking away a lot 
of the visual clutter here would be a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 My dream would be a place where families could walk down and shop day or night 
without really worrying, and feeling very safe. I dream a lot. I admit that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you really think these things are very realistic? Isn't it really market 
forces that determine how an area develops?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Market forces are affected by marketability. And that's what the focus of 
our game plan has got to be: attracting businesses into Reseda. Is it a tough 
process? It's not easy. Does that mean we shouldn't try? No. 
</P>
<P>
 I get a lot of feedback like that. People say, "Don't bother. Let it go to 
hell. Who cares?" The bottom line is, at some point you have to care. At some 
point you've got to go against the odds and say, "Hey, let's try to change 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 And, you know, Reseda is actually poised for this. It's at the best place it's 
been for the last decade at least for revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda was steadily going downhill. Everyone just basically said to hell with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, all of a sudden we are at the epicenter of this massive earthquake. 
That's forced a lot of the landlords and the businesses that are currently here 
to make a decision. We can't go on as it was. We are at a crossroads.  
</P>
<P>
 A year from now, Reseda will either be a whole lot better or a whole lot 
worse, but it will not be the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. What makes you think Reseda is in a position to improve?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Reseda has some real advantages. We are one of the most heavily traveled 
areas on the grid of Valley streets. On Sherman Way and Reseda Boulevard, we 
average about 86,000 cars per day. 
</P>
<P>
 And Reseda is a very interesting community. We have approximately 27 different 
ethnic groups represented here, and about 67 different dialects are spoken. A 
lot of people who have come into this country from other countries start off 
their businesses here. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a Business Watch, which we just started in November. In our 
newsletter, we already cover four languages: Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot of resistance to these changes. A lot of the older community 
remembers how it was years ago. It was suburbia. This was your typical white, 
middle-class suburb. They want to go back to that. We have to say: "Wake up, 
that is gone. You have to start working with what you have here." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we talk a lot about working with the people who live here, and 
that's why I stress that ethnic diversity is a plus. It's very intentional 
because we need to break down those barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is Renew Reseda doing?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We are trying to involve the community. We are going to be sending out a 
survey to the business community, and later to homeowners, asking input on 
establishing a theme for Reseda and asking what their major problems are. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the theme evolves, we are thinking of trying to get a unification of 
colors to dissipate the visual clutter. 
</P>
<P>
 We are also putting together some grant requests. We are working with city 
officials. One way you attract business is by giving them an incentive, a game 
plan, a purpose to come into a community. So we are looking into options of tax 
incentives or low-interest loans to start a businesses here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will it require an initial large investment of public money to bring new 
businesses into Reseda?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I can't give you the specifics on that honestly right now. We have got some 
new (street) medians going in, and we are looking at lighting. We may want to 
change the lighting to an older-style, lower-profile lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The magic of Reseda is that many places like this would take a fortune to turn 
around because they are so huge. Reseda is relatively small. The city can test 
an idea here a lot more cost effectively than other places. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Some of the past efforts to improve Reseda, such as the Interim Control 
Ordinance, have been aimed at keeping out certain businesses, like pawnshops 
and pool halls. Are you afraid that some of these revitalization efforts might 
actually discourage redevelopment?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That's a concern of mine. You don't want to stifle businesses that can make 
a living here, but we also want to attract other businesses into the area. I 
think we can do both. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is really that a lot of the businesses are not maintaining 
themselves. There is nothing inherently wrong with thrift shops or pawnshops, 
as long as they keep up their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What kinds of new businesses do you think Reseda could attract?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It depends on the theme. We could have a row of outlet stores, factory 
outlet stores, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Food stores are doing well in Reseda. Ethnic food stores are doing very well. 
We might try to have a whole area where people drive for miles just to get a 
certain food that you can't get anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What will happen if nothing is done to revitalize Reseda?  
</P>
<P>
 A. In five years? Reseda now would look like Beverly Hills compared to what it 
would be then. The people who have real estate investments here will lose, big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 'Reseda was steadily going downhill . . . Then, all of a sudden we are at the 
epicenter of this massive earthquake. That's forced a lot of the landlords and 
the businesses that are currently here to make a decision. . . . We are at a 
crossroads.'

3 INMATES INJURED IN RACIAL FIGHT AT COUNTY JAIL IN CASTAIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three inmates suffered minor injuries Monday in a racially motivated fight 
involving about 20 inmates at two dormitories at the Pitchess jail, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured inmates were treated at the jail infirmary for minor burns and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting between African American and Latino inmates broke out about 1:20 
p.m. in two 50-inmate dorms at the maximum-security North County Correctional 
Facility of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, said Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates obeyed orders to stop fighting at one of the dorms, but at the other, 
deputies had to use sting grenades -- explosive devices that spray hundreds of 
small rubber pellets. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of both dorms turned up seven handmade jail knives commonly called 
"shanks," Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four inmates in the second dorm are being held responsible for initiating the 
disturbance and will be charged with assault with deadly weapons and inciting a 
riot, Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another disturbance, about 14 African American and Latino inmates clashed 
in a medium-security dormitory about 8:40 p.m. Sunday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, more than 1,000 black and Latino inmates fought at the jail in 
what officials described as one of the biggest brawls in recent years in the 
county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail houses nearly 10,000 inmates at five facilities spread over 2,800 
acres.

ROBBINS ORDERED TO PAY $3 MILLION; COURTS: FORMER STATE SENATOR MUST OFFER 
RESTITUTION FOR ILLEGALLY OBTAINING BANK LOANS. JUDGE SPARES HIM FROM MORE 
PRISON TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ordered former state senator Alan Robbins on Monday to pay 
more than $3 million in restitution but spared the former lawmaker from 
additional prison time for illegally obtaining bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, who has just completed a prison sentence on separate political 
corruption charges, told reporters later that he was relieved that "the ordeal 
of my incarceration is over." He said he is fully committed to making 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The former multimillionaire could not predict when he will be able to make the 
payments because, he contended, much of his net worth is tangled up in lawsuits 
with former business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing before U. S. Dist. Judge Robert M. Takasugi closed yet another 
chapter in the story of Robbins' legal difficulties, this one stemming from his 
1992 guilty plea to three counts of failing to fully reveal in writing his 
financial situation when applying for loans from Independence Bank of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, 50, had $3.38 million in loans outstanding from the bank when it was 
eventually taken over by federal regulators. The restitution is payable to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the conservator of the bank's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi could have sentenced Robbins to a maximum of six years and a $750,000 
fine. Bowing to the recommendations of federal prosecutors, Takasugi imposed a 
prison term that ran concurrently with his recently completed time at a federal 
prison camp at Lompoc in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect was to spare Robbins from more prison. Takasugi said Robbins 
deserved credit for his "extraordinary cooperation" with federal authorities 
conducting a probe of political corruption in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For five months, Robbins wore a concealed microphone that produced evidence 
crucial to the conviction of lobbyist Clay Jackson and former state senator 
Paul Carpenter. "You have to give the devil his due," Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Jeffrey Isaacs said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Robbins was released from Lompoc after serving less than two years 
of his original five-year sentence after pleading guilty to political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Robbins completed his sentence on the corruption charges and was 
allowed to leave a Hollywood halfway house and move to an apartment in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins pleaded guilty in November, 1992, to failing to disclose, as required 
by federal law, several of his other loan obligations, including a $1,450,000 
unsecured loan from another lending institution, when he applied for a $900,000 
loan at the Independence Bank of Encino in 1985 and when renewing the loan in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino bank, which was secretly controlled by scandal-ridden Bank of 
Credit and Commerce International, was seized by federal regulators in January, 
1992, when they determined that its bad real estate loans had rendered the bank 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins has denied that he intended to lie to the bank. Rather, he has said, 
he had told the bank's executives orally of his other financial commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hallway interview after Monday's hearing, Robbins told reporters that he 
would make the restitution as soon as he can recover funds that he now claims 
several of his former business partners owe him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are various individuals who've tried to use the opportunity (of 
Robbins' imprisonment and criminal legal difficulties) to take millions of 
dollars . . . to stick my money in their pockets," Robbins said. "When I get 
this money, the $3,380,000 will be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins is embroiled in disputes with former partners in a Marina del Rey 
apartment venture, as well as with several developers, including Jonah Goldrich 
and Jerry Snyder, over real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the sentencing decision, Isaacs, the federal prosecutor, noted that 
Takasugi also placed Robbins on five years' probation on condition that he 
makes restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs said he was confident that the government could recover the money. 
"There are valuable assets out there (and) if Robbins and the FDIC can navigate 
the civil litigation that's now tying them up, they can be had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the state commissioner of real estate revoked Robbins' 
real estate license, contending that Robbins' political crimes should 
disqualify him from the vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this month, the Fair Political Practices Commission approved a fine of 
$15,000 against Robbins for failing to disclose all sources of his income when 
he was a state legislator.

DEDICATION PLANNED FOR NEW CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The formal dedication of Palo Comado Canyon as part of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area has been scheduled for April 2, six months 
after it was postponed because of wildfires sweeping across Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be several more months before the public will be provided picnic 
tables, restrooms and other amenities on the 2,308-acre property, known as 
Jordan Ranch when it was owned by entertainer Bob Hope, said Jean Bray, a 
spokeswoman for the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 She said park service officials plan to hold public meetings in late spring or 
early summer on proposed accommodations for the park. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted, however, that picnic tables and restrooms are available in 
neighboring Cheeseboro Canyon, part of the National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the agency is hoping to develop hiking trails as well as bike and 
equestrian paths using other access points, Bray said. But so far, only one 
entrance is open -- at the park service's Cheeseboro Canyon public parking 
area, she said. From there, it's more than a mile hike into Palo Comado Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of amenities and easy access, 3,028 people hiked through Palo 
Comado Canyon during February, Bray said. The canyon has been open to the 
public since October. 
</P>
<P>
 For next month's dedication ceremony, visitors will be able to enter the 
canyon by way of Chesebro Road, Bray said. Visitors are advised to take Palo 
Comado Canyon Road north off the Ventura Freeway, turn right onto Chesebro Road 
and follow the signs to the parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten permission from homeowners to use the road for the dedication," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the featured guests at the ceremony will be Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) and Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, Gov. Pete Wilson's former planning director and now a 
Republican candidate who wants to replace Beilenson in Congress, will also 
attend as Wilson's official representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its significance as a recreation park, Palo Comado Canyon is 
considered crucial as a wildlife habitat and corridor. Bobcats, deer, mountain 
lions and dozens of other animals live among the rolling hills and rock 
outcroppings of the former cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very thrilled that it was saved," said Mary Weisbrock, president of 
the environmental group Save Open Space, which fought to block development in 
the canyon. She said several members of her group also plan to attend the 
dedication ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The park service purchased Palo Comado Canyon from Hope for $16.7 million in 
June. The purchase represents the single largest acquisition within the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: AT COLLEGE, DIVERSITY CAN INSTRUCT; RANCHO SANTIAGO'S 
MOTTO, 'A DIVERSE LEARNING COMMUNITY,' COULD BE A VISION FOR THE BIG PICTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS J. OSBORNE, Thomas J. Osborne is an instructor of history at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana and chairman of its Faculty Senate Task Force on 
Incorporating Diversity in Community. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the heart of the most feared city in Orange County lies our community 
college. In Santa Ana, where 17th Street meets Bristol, Asians meet whites, 
Latinos meet blacks, Muslims meet Hindus, Christians meet Buddhists, gays meet 
straights, old meet young -- some 30,000 people come together to learn.  
</P>
<P>
 A more diverse body of people would be hard to find. This extraordinary 
diversity is a sure prescription for conflict, or worse -- spasms of violence 
such as those that grip the surrounding city nearly every Saturday night. 
Recently, for example, an interracial conflict on our campus resulted in one 
student pulling a gun on another who had told an ethnic joke. So, educational 
intersections can be places where people meet, or where they collide. 
</P>
<P>
 With a student population that is 59% minority, mostly Latinos and Asians, and 
with 29% non-U.S. citizens, our college runs the risk of fragmenting into 
segregated enclaves of ethnicity, disconnected from each other and the college 
as a whole. This would lead to a downward spiral of "us" against "them," which 
would eventually paralyze the educational process. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything depends on how we respond to our diversity. If diversity becomes an 
end in itself, rather than understood and valued as part of a larger whole, 
then beware! It will tear apart not only our college, but our nation, and the 
world. Sarajevo, Capetown, Belfast, Los Angeles: The places differ, the 
cultural contexts differ; yet the dynamics and destructive outcomes are the 
same. Rancho Santiago College is a microcosm of the big picture, and the big 
picture tells us that when diversity is carried too far, a point of no return 
seems ominously awaiting us. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more promising response to Rancho's diversity would be to recognize its 
richness and connection to the larger college community. 
</P>
<P>
 A small but growing number of people on our Santa Ana campus are working to 
keep our fragile sense of community from being eclipsed by the diversity. 
Community and diversity are seen as being interconnected; individuals and 
groups should reverence their own diversity and that of others as well. Rather 
than assimilation, transformation of everyone would occur as diverse 
individuals and groups learned from and valued each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Last October, the Faculty Senate and the Board of Trustees unanimously adopted 
a motto to appear on the college's stationery and elsewhere: "A Diverse 
Learning Community." It is our college's "signature," saying who we are and 
what we stand for. It could be a statement of what we want to become, our 
vision for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this vision hold? Foremost, it is a vision of ourselves as a 
community of learners. Beneath our considerable diversity, we are all human 
beings with the same basic needs and aspirations to develop our potential and 
contribute to society. All of us are learners: faculty, students, 
administrators, staff. An English worker in Botswana put it this way: "Don't 
try to teach anyone anything until you have learned something from them." As 
faculty more fully express this attitude in the classroom, less hierarchy and 
greater connectedness among people will result. 
</P>
<P>
 A second component of this vision is our willingness to accept personal 
responsibility for our learning environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, such a vision embodies sweeping changes. Staff development courses on 
diversity could be offered. Courses in cross-cultural understanding and 
conflict resolution might be required. A multicultural complex, featuring 
ethnic art, language training and a community mediation center might be 
established with city redevelopment funds. Community service projects could be 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 These are but the broad brush strokes of a vision in our motto: "A Diverse 
Learning Community." The question remains: What will we do with it? Will it be 
a mere slogan decorating our letterhead? Or will it become our declaration that 
we are committed to saving our college and equipping it for the important work 
it has to do.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OFFICIALS PUSH TO MERGE 3 REDEVELOPMENT AREAS; 
BUILDING: THE CITY SAYS $200 MILLION WOULD BE GENERATED. THE DEADLINE FOR THE 
PLAN IS MARCH 31. SOME RESIDENTS FEAR THEIR PROPERTY WILL BE SEIZED. 
</P>

<P>
 Facing a March 31 deadline, Palmdale officials are scrambling to assemble and 
approve the final documents needed to merge three of the city's four 
redevelopment areas, a move that city officials say could generate $200 million 
for improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger has triggered concern among some residents in these areas, 
who fear the city will seize their property for an urban renewal project or 
impose new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials say these fears are unfounded and stem from complex legal 
notices the city was required to mail to about 8,300 property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "They misunderstood, but I understood their reaction," said Danny R. Roberts, 
the city's redevelopment manager. "Unless you deal with redevelopment all the 
time, it just scares you." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and other city officials acknowledged that the legal notices arrived 
with a poorly printed map of the affected area and little explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the city's Redevelopment Agency has agreed not to use its 
eminent domain powers to force anyone to sell any residential property for a 
renewal project, Roberts said. He also said no new taxes will be imposed under 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger was initiated because the city will soon lose its ability to 
collect its share of property taxes in the current redevelopment areas. As new 
buildings are constructed in redevelopment areas, the land becomes more 
valuable and more property tax revenue is collected. A redevelopment agency 
receives a share of the increased revenue collected in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the merger, Palmdale will reach the limit on the amount of money it 
can collect in this manner within the next two to five years, Roberts said. 
Also, the merger will give the city more flexibility because money generated in 
one redevelopment area usually cannot be spent on a project in a different 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined redevelopment area will encompass more than 7,000 acres. A new 
state law that revised redevelopment rules this year gave Palmdale, which was 
already working on its merger last year, until March 31 to complete the work. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting last week, Palmdale City Council members gave preliminary 
approval to several ordinances that would allow the merger to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 They also scheduled a special March 24 meeting to take a final vote on these 
laws and on agreements with a local school district and a water agency, which 
will share revenue from the combined redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Teri Jones abstained from voting on the ordinances, saying she 
approved the merger idea, but did not believe the public had been adequately 
informed about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 To help eliminate confusion, Mayor Jim Ledford instructed the city staff to 
mail letters of explanation to each property owner who received the original 
legal notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like for us to work up something in plain English . . . to explain what 
is the result of this merger," he said. "I think it will put a lot of these 
fears to rest."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; METROLINK TO CUT SOME FARES IN HALF; 
TRANSPORTATION: THE COST OF PASSES FROM THE SANTA CLARITA AND ANTELOPE VALLEYS 
WILL BE TRIMMED TO KEEP COMMUTERS ON THE TRAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Metrolink officials Monday announced reductions of up to 50% on monthly 
commuter passes for passengers traveling from the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys to Burbank, Glendale and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new deals will be in effect for three months, beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes for commuters originating in the Antelope Valley were cut in 
half and the cost of a pass for travel from Santa Clarita was reduced by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fares were approved by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority 
on Friday and are effective April 1 through June 30. Also taking effect on the 
first of April is a move to bring the city of Burbank into a fare zone closer 
to the northern valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the fare reductions and the zone change, there are going to be some 
significant savings," said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. "We believe the 
effects of the quake are still with us, and this is going to help a lot of 
people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley riders were paying $208 for a monthly pass to Burbank and 
beyond. The 50% reduction combined with the zone change will reduce the cost of 
monthly passes to Burbank to $80, and $112 for passes to Glendale and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, it cost $144 a month to travel from Santa Clarita to Burbank, 
Glendale or Los Angeles. While the reduced fares are in effect, it will cost 
$80 for a monthly pass to Burbank and $112 for a pass to Glendale or Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are aimed at keeping post-earthquake commuters off local 
freeways and are expected to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials praised the reduction, saying complaints about high fares have 
been common among potential and actual rail passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea behind this is to get people out of their cars and using 
public transportation," said Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who 
also sits on the Metrolink board. "I've been pushing for this zone change all 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said ridership on the Santa Clarita line has increased by eight times, 
to 9,000 passengers daily, since the quake, making it the busiest line in the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita city spokeswoman Gail Foy said that between 30% and 40% of those 
riders originate in Santa Clarita and travel to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody will be affected by the fare reduction, but we're really going to 
benefit here -- this will be great for the city."

PROPERTY VALUES: FILING HOME CASUALTY LOSSES A COMPLEX INCOME TAX MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has jolted many homeowners throughout the San 
Fernando Valley and Ventura County into a crash course in the tax implications 
of casualty losses and home foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local residents have learned that their "casualty losses," or damages to 
the property, from the earthquake aren't fully tax-deductible, and that they 
may also owe the IRS a tax for a "profit" on their home, even if their homes 
were destroyed and they are walking away from their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 One key factor in sorting out all this is what the IRS calls the adjusted 
basis -- or real cost -- of your residence. The adjusted basis for a home is 
the purchase price, plus any permanent improvements added during the time you 
have owned that home. Or when a homeowner moves up in value from one house to 
another, the tax basis of the second home is equal to the tax basis of the 
first home, plus any difference between the sales price of the first home and 
the purchase price of the second home, plus improvements on the second home. 
</P>
<P>
 Calculating the adjusted basis correctly is important for two reasons. First, 
the higher the adjusted basis of your home, the smaller your capital gains tax 
on the property. Second, you have to know your adjusted basis to figure out 
your casualty losses, including earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 While the IRS does not recognize capital losses in the sale or exchange of a 
residence, the IRS does recognize casualty losses -- including from earthquake 
damage -- as tax-deductible, explained Marvin L. Weisbrod, a vice president at 
Triple Check Income Tax Service Inc. in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the math on casualty losses is convoluted. Why? Because the IRS requires 
homeowners who suffer a casualty loss to report the lesser of the difference 
between 1. fair market value of the property just before and just after the 
earthquake, or 2. the adjusted basis of your residence, minus 10% of your 
adjusted gross income (plus $100). 
</P>
<P>
 Weisbrod gives an example of a couple in Northridge who had a home worth 
$700,000 before the January quake. Because the home was destroyed, the fair 
market value is now just $300,000. This couple lived in their home for several 
decades, and so the adjusted basis of their home is a modest $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the before and after earthquake value of their home is 
a whopping $400,000. Still, in this situation for tax purposes, the couple 
would only be able to write off a total casualty loss of $104,900. Why? Using 
the other calculation the IRS insists on: This couple has an adjusted gross 
income of $150,000; by subtracting $15,100 (10% of their adjusted gross income, 
plus $100), from their $120,000 adjusted basis of their home, they wind up with 
only $104,900 in casualty losses, Weisbrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an example of why it pays to do everything possible to beef up the 
adjusted basis of the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners who receive money from their earthquake insurance policy, or 
other compensation from property that was damaged by the quake, ordinarily have 
a taxable gain if the compensation received exceeds the adjusted basis of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 But that tax can be deferred by electing to use the insurance proceeds to 
restore the property within four years. If the residence cannot be restored, 
the gain can be deferred by using that gain toward the purchase of another 
residence. The replacement period for the property involuntarily converted as a 
result of a presidentially declared disaster -- such as the Jan. 17 quake -- 
was extended by Congress in 1993 to a period of four years after the close of 
the first taxable year in which any part of the "gain" upon conversion is 
realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners can defer capital gains indefinitely by rolling over their gain on 
one home into another home of equal or greater value. Owners age 55 and over 
who sell their homes also have a onetime opportunity to realize up to $125,000 
in profit tax-free on the sale of their primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been no absolute ruling from the IRS that the "capital gain" in 
a quake foreclosure can be rolled into another residence, pursuant to IRS 
Section 1034. Not all accountants agree on whether this is a legal option for 
homeowners who suffered a foreclosure -- assuming they have the wherewithal to 
buy another residence within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents who suffered a casualty loss, may be able to argue that the 
foreclosure occurred because of the earthquake and that therefore it is an 
"involuntary conversion," which is given more favorable treatment by the IRS in 
Section 1033, said Tony A. Rose, CEO of Burbank accounting firm Rose, Snyder & 
Jacobs. Ultimately, he said, this issue of rolling over a "gain" from a 
foreclosure may depend on getting a more definite answer from the IRS in the 
form of a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more to this tax nightmare. "After the earthquake, there are many 
homeowners who have lost the records of how much money they have spent to 
improve their homes. That makes estimating the adjusted tax basis of the 
residence a problem," said Robert Jay Grossman, an attorney in private practice 
in Century City. When homeowners don't take the time to properly calculate the 
increase in their adjusted basis due to improvements, Grossman said, "they can 
be devastated when they get the tax bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The general rule is that "permanent improvements" can be added to your 
adjusted basis whereas maintenance or replacement can't be included in that 
calculation. If, at some point, you replaced your carpets, this probably won't 
help you increase the cost basis of your home. But, owners who upgraded from a 
cheap shag to a pricey wool Berber can probably use the price differential 
between merely replacing the old carpet versus installing the upgraded floor 
covering. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters become further complicated when a homeowner does a series of 
renovations over several years. An owner might reface kitchen cabinets one year 
and then replace the cabinets altogether a few years later. Can the refacing 
job still count as part of cost basis? The answer depends on whether the old 
improvements were trashed or whether they were added to. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants and attorneys generally agree on the following: The cost of buying 
a home does figure into your cost basis. This includes attorneys' fees, title 
search and insurance, late closing charges, the cost of cleaning up title, 
brokers' commissions, property surveys, appraisal fees and the cost of 
recording documents. Improvements include installing storm windows and doors, 
adding a room, finishing a basement or attic, new plumbing or a furnace, a 
swimming pool or landscaping expenditures. Some of the things generally not 
considered permanent improvements are repainting a house, mending leaks or 
fixing gutters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before and after photos or videotapes can also help if you're ever called in 
for an IRS audit. 
</P>
<P>
 More information about the cost basis of your home is available by ordering a 
free 14-page IRS publication entitled "Tax Information on Selling Your Home." 
This booklet, along with IRS form 2119, used to figure the cost basis of the 
old home and the so-called adjusted basis for any new home purchase, are 
available by telephoning the IRS toll-free at (800) TAX-FORM.

 CRYSTAL BALL: We hate to mess up all the Valley office pools, but we now know 
the teams in the Final Four of the NCAA tournament that begins Thursday. We got 
the scoop from CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy, whose team (8-18), believe it or not, 
didn't make it. . . . His picks: North Carolina, Purdue, Arkansas and 
Louisville. The winner: North Carolina. "I like their size and experience," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 WRONG LARRY: We also asked Larry Bird. No, not that Larry Bird. This Bird, 46, 
is running for City Council in Santa Clarita. But he couldn't help us because 
he doesn't keep track of college basketball. He owns and manages an apartment 
building in Newhall and sometimes gets tired of being associated with the 
former Boston Celtic superstar. . . . "I had the name first." 
</P>
<P>
 MIGHTY MAGS: Big companies like to branch out -- that's why they're big 
companies. Disney is no exception. These days, the folks in Burbank (above) are 
putting a lot of effort into magazines. It's another way to get the Disney name 
out there. . . . The latest publication is a computer magazine for the whole 
family -- Family PC. See Valley Business, Page 12. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEAPER COMMUTE: Good news for some Metrolink riders: Starting April 1, the 
price of monthly passes is going down. For passengers from Antelope Valley, 
passes will go from $208 a month to either $112 or $80, depending on the final 
destination. Those commuters originating in Santa Clarita will also get better 
monthly deals. . . . The new fares will be in effect for three months. (B14) 
</P>
<P>
 MASTER'S MADNESS: OK, so it's not the big dance, but it's better than staying 
home. The Master's College in Newhall will play today in the first round of the 
NAIA Division I basketball tournament. . . . Master's faces a school that 
graduated a president. That's Georgia Southwestern, with Jimmy Carter and wife, 
Rosalyn, among its alumni. (C7) Michael Arkush

 SEARCHING HART: With his days in office numbered, 50-year-old state Sen. Gary 
K. Hart hasn't the foggiest idea what he'll do when he retires in December. . . 
. At a dinner roast in Oxnard on Friday, his staff poked fun at his 
absent-mindedness: arriving at a tennis tournament without proper shoes, 
driving off with his briefcase on the car roof. They ended the skit singing the 
1970s lyrics "Whatcha' gonna do when we say goodby, Whatcha' gonna do when 
we're gone." After the number, his wife, Kari, retorted: "What am I going to do 
when you're all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 NAME-CALLING: It's not in the Latino neighborhood of La Colonia, but the 
Oxnard City Council has finally pinpointed a street to call Cesar E. Chavez 
Drive. The only catch: The street has yet to be built. . . . At its meeting 
today, the council will consider a resolution showing its intention to name a 
street after Chavez in the planned Northeast Community. . . . About 1,200 
residents petitioned the council to honor the famous farm labor organizer who 
once lived in Oxnard. "We can accommodate them," said Councilman Thomas E. 
Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX TIME: With a month to go, procrastination has seized unusually large 
numbers of taxpayers. Requests for forms are unseasonably low. Financial 
planners report a noticeable slowdown. . . . But computer wizards are working 
ahead, scooping up software to help them breeze through new tax-law changes. 
"It's selling really well," said Andrew Frueh of Egghead Software in Thousand 
Oaks. . . . Once a taxpayer punches in the numbers, the software does all of 
the math.

 ECONOMIC MOVES: Boxed in by neighbors, the Weyerhaeuser Co.'s 
corrugated-box-making plant in Santa Paula is planning to move to a bigger 
location in Camarillo to expand and add more jobs. (Valley Business, Page 14) . 
. . Future Automation Inc., a high-tech manufacturer, will double its plant 
size this week when it moves from Simi Valley to Moorpark. "Business is good 
and we're hiring," said Mike Chicos, Future's operations manager.

16th-Century icons left behind by Spanish colonizers, church officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen ivory crucifix and ivory head of the Virgin Mary could be worth 
$360,000 each, Deputy Bishop Cirilo Darunday of the central city of Tagbilaran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the icons, kept in a church museum near Tagbilaran, were believed 
stolen last week by two men who came through the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said the statue of Mary, venerated by Filipinos in this 
largely Catholic country, was a gift from 16th-Century Spanish Queen Catherine 
of Aragon.

NATURE TEACHES FIRE RECOVERY; UNTREATED AREAS OF CASPERS PARK ARE DOING BETTER 
THAN LAGUNA BURN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Take away the human tragedy, the devastating fires that wiped out thousands of 
acres of wilderness in South County last year are providing a fascinating test 
of nature, say wildlife biologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Where much attention has been focused on reseeding the blackened hills near 
Laguna Beach homes, nature has been allowed to run its course in the 4,500 
acres scorched by fire in Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park near San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost five months after the blaze, the results are coming in for both areas: 
As usual, Mother Nature seems to know what she's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Caspers Wilderness Park, many of the formerly charred hillsides are now 
blanketed in a thick, green carpet of grass. From the gnarled, blackened trees, 
new growth is sprouting and being consumed by deer craving the fresh young 
shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The human loss associated with fire is devastation," said Trish Smith, a 
biologist for the Nature Conservancy in Irvine. "But what happened in Caspers 
is not a disaster, but rejuvenation; not destruction, but a natural process of 
rebirth. But even so, I'm amazed at how fast the terrain has regenerated here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 366 homes dramatically lost in the Laguna Beach fire on Oct. 27 turned 
attention away from what happened to the vast unpopulated areas scorched when a 
wave of flame swept over Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The toll was heavy: more than half the 7,500-acre Caspers Wilderness Park 
burned. Another 15,000 acres in adjoining Cleveland National Forest burned in 
the same fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 49,000 annual visitors of the park who bike, hike and ride horses 
over Caspers' 30 miles of trails were hit hard by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Sorenson visited the park nine days after the fire when "everything was 
very charred and smelly," she said. "If I were to use a word to describe the 
park, it would be 'moonscape.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, "if you looked very close, you could already see signs of life 
peeking out from some of the bushes," said Sorenson, an equestrian who is a 
member of the county trails advisory committee. "The park was already coming 
back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the fire stopped at the edge of Bell Canyon and San Juan Creek, 
where the richest concentration of live oaks, sycamores and other wildlife in 
the park are located.  
</P>
<P>
 But in fire-blasted sections of the park, the rapid recovery of trees, bushes 
and grass is due in part to deep root systems developed by plants used to 
living in desert-like conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three or four months ago, this park looked pretty bleak," he said. "The way 
everything is regrowing, there'll be very few signs of the fire in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 14,000 acres burned in the Laguna coastal area were also left 
alone, Smith said. Those wilderness acres are doing much better than the 
residential areas treated by hydroseeding (a mix of mulch, seeds and water 
sprayed by hose) and aerial seeding, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some areas, (seeding efforts) seem to be inhibiting natural regeneration," 
said Smith, whose nonprofit conservation group is managing 16,000 acres of 
Irvine and Laguna Beach coastal wilderness areas owned by the Irvine Co. "In 
some sense, it helped keep the soil in place for a period, but in terms of 
recovery, it doesn't seem to be doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 However, supporters of the reseeding program have pointed out that initial 
growth has already helped protect the damaged hillsides from mudslides during 
recent rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies are being conducted to measure how the burn areas recover "so we can 
learn lessons from what happened in the fires," Smith said. "We can learn how 
to manage fires better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife biologists say that fire is a part of a natural cycle that helps 
rejuvenate the land. For example, several plants have tough-skinned seeds that 
only germinate after fire burns away their hard outer husks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are species of plants you won't see until we have fires," said Pete 
DeSimone, manager of the National Audubon Starr Ranch Sanctuary, which had 
about 450 acres burn in the Ortega fire. "Fire helps nutrients return to the 
soil," 
</P>
<P>
 "Some areas burn on a regular basis and that's what they deal with so that's 
what they adapt to," he said. "Like our land adapts to drought conditions, it 
adapts to fire."

BRANCH IS MAKING BIG EFFORT TO BOOST MORALE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Recorder Lee A. Branch, censured by the Board of Supervisors for 
misconduct in office, has made significant efforts to boost productivity and 
sagging morale among employees who had complained of harassment and a hostile 
working environment, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 County Budget Director Ronald S. Rubino said that a report was issued to the 
supervisors Monday indicating that Branch has been complying with 
recommendations made to improve office relations. At the same time, the 
recorder has sought no retaliation against the dozens of employees who offered 
testimony against him during a protracted personnel investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 That investigation by the county affirmative action office found that Branch 
had mismanaged his office, sexually harassed two female employees and carried 
on a particularly disruptive romance with an office manager. The misconduct 
findings resulted in the board's unprecedented censure of the recorder in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter since has been referred to the Orange County Grand Jury to 
determine whether the misconduct warrants Branch's removal from office. Sources 
said that inquiry is nearing completion and is likely to end without a call for 
the recorder's removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch said Monday that he is aware that a report is being prepared but did 
not know that it had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on what I haven't seen," Branch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino, who has been working as an operations consultant to Branch's office 
since the affirmative action investigation was made public, said the office was 
"progressing nicely" and that Branch has been "absolutely cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last month and a half, significant efforts have been made to improve 
and resolve issues of the past," Rubino said. "I'm very pleased with the 
process. My whole focus is to move the organization forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes proposed for the office are the reassignment of two 
employees. One of them, the office manager linked romantically to Branch, was 
named by employees as having received favorable treatment from the recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees told investigators that the manager actually "ran the recorder's 
office and intimidated employees at all levels in the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The other employee, an information systems manager, reportedly has not spoken 
with Branch in more than a year because of their differences over department 
policy issues, even though that position is a key in office operations.  
</P>
<P>
 The recorder's office functions primarily as a repository for documents 
relating to real estate and loan transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said negotiations regarding new assignments for the two employees 
are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the affirmative action investigation and after its findings were 
made public, the 57-year-old Branch said the county inquiry was part of a 
political "hidden agenda" initiated by the board to remove him from office to 
make room for a favored candidate, County Clerk Gary Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Branch has vowed to seek reelection to a fifth term this year, 
saying Monday that the campaign was "going fine, terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch also faces an internal challenge from Assistant Recorder Ella M. 
Murphy. Branch said Murphy's candidacy has been "disruptive" and that 
communications have been "guarded."

MINORITY LEADERS SEEK U.S. PROBE OF DEPUTY'S DEATH; REACTION: GROUPS PLAN TO 
ASK FOR A CIVIL RIGHTS INQUIRY INTO FATAL SHOOTING OF BLACK OFFICER BY A WHITE 
COLLEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of several minority groups agreed Monday to ask for a federal 
investigation into the fatal shooting of Darryn Leroy Robins, a black sheriff's 
deputy, by another officer during an impromptu training exercise in Lake Forest 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 About 30 representatives of the Orange County NAACP, 100 Black Men of Orange 
County, Los Amigos and the League of United Latin American Citizens called for 
a federal grand jury investigation and agreed to ask the Orange County District 
Attorney's Office to reconsider bringing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The justice system in Orange County has proven to be a system of injustice," 
said Eugene M. Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men. "The Darryn Robins case has 
shown us that all are not equal under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's meeting was called after the Orange County grand jury last week 
decided not to indict Deputy Brian P. Scanlan in the Christmas Day shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had recommended that Scanlan be indicted on involuntary 
manslaughter charges, because his conduct was "not simply negligent, but . . . 
aggravated, reckless and grossly negligent," according to a statement by Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
 For those attending the meeting, the grand jury's decision was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised at all," said Jim Colquitt, chairman of the Orange County 
chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. "The grand 
jury is a cop-out." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that Robins' death was a human rights violation, the group agreed that 
each leader of an organization present at the meeting would write to U.S. Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno asking for an investigation. Those letters are to be mailed 
together in a packet on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 100 Black Men will ask to participate in the pending inquiry by a 
panel of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission into charges of institutionalized 
racism in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 The groups also voted to ask Amnesty International to investigate the shooting 
of 30-year-old Robins, again arguing that it constituted a human rights 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those at the meeting were angry that it had taken two months for the 
grand jury to reach its conclusion and felt there was enough evidence to indict 
Scanlan, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury made its decision after four days of closed hearings that began 
two weeks ago and included sworn testimony from 14 witnesses and the 
examination of 25 pieces of evidence that were offered by the district 
attorney's office.  
</P>
<P>
 With only rare exceptions, grand juries follow the recommendations of 
prosecutors who bring potential criminal cases before them. But Deputy Dist. 
Atty. John D. Conley has called the Scanlan case a "close call" that could have 
gone either way.  
</P>
<P>
 An official account of the mishap was released for the first time last week 
following the grand jury's decision.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say that Scanlan and Robins were running an impromptu training 
exercise behind a Lake Forest movie theater during a slow Christmas Day patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official account, Robins was playing the part of the driver 
in a car stop when, simulating a technique used by Los Angeles gang members, he 
reached for a small pistol hidden behind the sun visor of his patrol car to 
beat Scanlan to the draw.  
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan, who was holding a loaded gun in apparent violation of department 
training policy, was startled and fired, hitting Robins in the head.  
</P>
<P>
 Minority leaders acknowledge that they have no evidence that race played a 
part in the killing or in the way authorities handled it, and critics have 
accused the leaders of inflaming the issue with racial rhetoric.  
</P>
<P>
 But they insist that the slow release of public information and close 
relations between the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office 
have only fueled their communities' suspicions of wrongdoing.

GAYS BECOME NO. 1 TARGET OF HATE CRIMES; HUMAN RELATIONS: THEY HAVE REPLACED 
AFRICAN AMERICANS AS THE MOST FREQUENT VICTIMS OF SUCH INCIDENTS, COUNTY REPORT 
FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For the first time since officials began keeping records three years ago, gays 
and lesbians have replaced African Americans as the most-targeted victims of 
hate crimes and hate-related incidents, according to a study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, issued by the Orange County Human Relations Commission, showed 
that the overall number of reported hate crimes and incidents declined slightly 
from 1992 to 1993. But reported incidents in which gays and lesbians were 
targeted rose 40%, making them the group most victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly doesn't surprise us," said Craig B. Coogan, executive director 
of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County. "I think 
we're in a political climate here where politicians and so-called religious 
leaders have made gay-bashing an acceptable form of freedom of expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many high-profile issues involving gays and lesbians have come to 
the fore in recent years, such as whether homosexuals can serve in the 
military, Coogan said it is understandable that more gays and lesbians would 
end up the victims of hate crimes and incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "As our struggles are set forth in the media, people who disagree with us are 
expressing that and the result is more hate crimes," he said. "I hope we don't 
see more violence, and I hope we can educate people who don't understand us." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most widely publicized incidents, two men, aged 18 and 20, went 
looking for gays to fight in Laguna Beach last January, and beat a Vietnamese 
man so badly that his face was virtually unrecognizable. Both men pleaded 
guilty to charges arising from the attack. One received a 10-year prison 
sentence and the other received one year in jail and five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident two months later, a man shouted anti-gay remarks and 
hurled a Molotov cocktail against the outer wall of a Newport Beach bar as he 
drove by, causing minor damage. The man, who police say had a lengthy 
psychiatric history, was committed to an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics released Monday also show that reported incidents involving 
Jewish victims increased 63%, and incidents with Asian American victims fell by 
the same percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of all cases involved the distribution of racist flyers, 
the scrawling of swastikas or use of other symbols of skinhead or neo-Nazi 
groups, the report shows. The Human Relations Commission attributed 45 cases, 
or one-quarter of the total, to actions related to white supremacist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finding that more and more young people are attaching themselves to 
hate literature," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. "But it's not just one school system or one 
area. It's a national problem. A hate crime may not leave a physical scar, but 
it leaves an emotional scar." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Southern California was shaken by the arrests of members of the 
Fourth Reich Skinheads, a group of youths from Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members were said to be plotting an attack on the First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in South-Central Los Angeles, and had thrown pipe 
bombs or Molotov cocktails at a number of residences and synagogues, including 
Temple Beth David synagogue in Westminster. Two were sentenced to lengthy jail 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 180 hate crimes and incidents, eight were prosecuted last year using 
special allegations that a hate crime had been committed, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases had mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, an African American suspect shot and robbed a white victim in 
Orange after telling a friend he was going to get "whitey." The suspect was 
found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 17 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, a 26-year-old African American woman and mother of four was 
beaten to death after an altercation in a La Habra parking lot. Although some 
witnesses said the suspects used racial slurs during the beating, prosecutors 
said there was insufficient evidence to include hate crime allegations, because 
other witnesses said no racial slurs were used. The three suspects pleaded 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics gathered by the Orange County Human Relations Commission may be 
low, officials say, because some law enforcement agencies are more diligent 
than others in reporting hate crimes or hate incidents. Many victims never 
report incidents of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news that the overall number has declined pleased members of the Human 
Relations Commission, says Rusty Kennedy, its executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's better that the number is going down than going up," said 
Kennedy, who added that "it's important to remember that this is not a 
comprehensive report. It's just what we've become aware of. It's entirely too 
many (incidents) and we should be concerned about that." Hate Crimes Decline 
</P>
<P>
 Reported hate crimes and hate-related incidents in Orange County dipped 
slightly in 1993 from the previous year. While African Americans and Asians 
were less frequent targets of attacks, the number of incidents involving Jews 
and gays and lesbians increased.

WOMAN SHOT TO DEATH ON APARTMENT BALCONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY and FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 55-year-old woman who moved here from rural Mexico eight months ago was shot 
dead on her balcony Sunday night as she engaged in one of her favorite pastimes 
-- watching the action on the street below. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Roque was shot in the chest about 9 p.m. Sunday and died after she 
staggered into her apartment in the 300 block of West Washington Avenue, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have no idea why she was shot," said Lt. Bob Clark. No 
witnesses have come forward, and investigators were still combing the area 
Monday afternoon for clues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly unusual, a lady standing on a balcony, struck once with a 
bullet," Clark said, adding that police do not know if the shooter drove or 
walked past Roque's home. It is the 17th killing in the city this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said gang activity and drug deals are common in the block, but the 
two-story apartment complex with the fenced-in swimming pool -- named 
ironically Casa Serena or "serene home" -- is well-managed, said police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't, to my immediate recollection, had any other homicides in that 
block, certainly not in that apartment complex," said Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's son, Santos Alvarez Roque, said that gang members cause frequent 
problems near the apartment complex and that when residents complain, police 
rarely come.  
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, interviewed by telephone, wept as he asked his mother's killer "not 
to be so cruel, to think about the (innocent) people who are affected" by the 
use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors suggested that her shooting may not have been random, saying Roque 
may have witnessed a drug deal or other criminal activity from her perch.  
</P>
<P>
 "We hear them arguing out there all the time," one woman said. "They take over 
the street, and nobody wants to confront them."  
</P>
<P>
 Police would not confirm that speculation about a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque usually slept in the bedroom of the apartment, while her son and 
daughter-in-law, both in their twenties, shared the living room with their 
young child. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, there were six votive candles burning in the kitchen. 
Roque's friend Benita Duarte moved despondently around Roque's bedroom, where a 
few plain dresses and two pairs of shoes were kept, along with a picture of the 
Virgin of Guadalupe that hung over her headboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Known to her friends as "Dona Vale," Roque eight months ago left her husband 
and four other adult children, as well as years of working in cornfields in the 
village of San Martin Pachiveain the Mexican state of Guerrero, to spend more 
time with her son in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to take care of her because of her age, Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she got here, she had made few friends in the complex, so she amused 
herself by watching what was happening on the streets. Duarte said she 
preferred to look out her bedroom window, which faced directly onto Durant 
Street, than watch television.

CITY SEEKS TO SCRAMBLE ACCESS TO SPICE SHOWS; OXNARD: ADULT-ORIENTED CABLE 
CHANNEL CAN INADVERTENTLY BE HEARD BY ABOUT 5,000 WHO DON'T PAY FOR IT. CITY, 
CIVIC LEADERS DISCUSS THE ISSUE.

 Oxnard officials are attempting to block the audio portion of a soft-core 
pornography channel available to thousands of cable subscribers in Oxnard, Port 
Hueneme and surrounding areas even though they don't pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spice channel premiered at the start of the year and is available only on 
a pay-per-view basis. But for about 5,000 Jones Intercable subscribers, those 
who don't have cable converter boxes, the audio portion of the adult-oriented 
telecast bleeds into their television sets even though the picture is 
scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Frank Allen said he stumbled onto some of Spice's "adult 
conversation" a few months ago while flipping through the channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very detailed, very explicit," said Allen, whose complaint prompted city 
officials to ask Jones to block the audio signal for those who don't order it. 
"I was appalled that this material would be made available to our youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Jones, general manager of the Oxnard-based cable company, confirmed 
Monday that the audio feed is inadvertently available to about 5,000 of the 
company's estimated 37,000 subscribers. Jones said the cable company has 
received only one complaint, and that came secondhand through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the company lacks the ability to block the audio feed systemwide, 
Jones said it will gladly silence the signal for any customer who doesn't want 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will run out immediately the same day," Jones said. "If someone calls and 
has a problem with any one of our products, we respond immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, government officials and civic leaders met to discuss the issue. 
The press was barred from the meeting, and some in attendance were reluctant to 
discuss the matter afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to meet with Jones to attempt to get them to black this out," 
Supervisor John K. Flynn said. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Scala, the city government's liaison with Jones Intercable, said the 
company and city officials have been trying to keep the issue quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to bring too much attention to it," said Scala, who also 
attended Monday's meeting. "The more people you inform about this, the more the 
problem is spread." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to Jones Intercable, Scala expressed the depth of the city's 
concern over the inadvertent audio signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are requesting that you review your current scrambling methods for this, 
and other 'Adult' channels, to scramble or otherwise block out the audio signal 
of the channel," Scala wrote. "More importantly, we feel that subscribers 
should be protected from these signals without any specific action on their 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter in response, Jeff Jones detailed the efforts the company has taken 
to ensure that youngsters don't have access to adult programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers with cable converter boxes do not pick up the audio feed to Spice or 
any other pay-per-view program unless they pay for it, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, personal identification numbers are made available to all 
customers to prevent curious youngsters from ordering the service. And the 
cable boxes are equipped with a system that allows parents to block out 
individual channels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, as a last resort, those without cable converters can have a filter placed 
on their cable line that permanently blocks the audio feed. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . We took extra security steps in this system so that concerned parents 
can make sure that this programming is only received by those who truly choose 
to receive it," Jones wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, city officials and others say they believe that many parents are 
unaware that the audio for the Spice channel seeps into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said Jones should find a way to scramble the audio signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young kids can just turn on the TV and listen to that," said Lopez, who was 
supplied a tape recording of the adult conservation by those who want to block 
it. "I don't think that's right." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Jones has blocked out the Spice channel from Frank Allen's 
north Oxnard home.

TAXPAYERS ARE WAITING LONGER TO FILE RETURNS; IRS: MANY SAY THEY'RE 
PROCRASTINATING BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXPECT REFUNDS. CHANGES IN LAW THAT CUT 
DEDUCTIONS ARE BLAMED.

 Ray Lanouette knows exactly what he'll do with the sheaf of densely printed 
forms he picked up at the Internal Revenue Service office Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll itemize every last deduction, 'fess up to every scrap of income, add and 
subtract and check and double check -- and come up with a grand total of his 
debts to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he'll plunk the papers on his desk and try to forget about them until tax 
deadline rolls around -- exactly one month from today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an April 15th-er," Lanouette said with a grin. "I'll get it done this 
week and then just sit on it until April 15." 
</P>
<P>
 He has plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Ventura County, residents are busily finding excuses to delay their 
annual number-crunching. 
</P>
<P>
 Procrastination, of course, has always been a popular response to tax-filing 
time. But financial planners from Newbury Park to Ojai say their clients are 
putting off the inevitable in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're unbelievably slow this year," Bruce Berman said. A Thousand Oaks 
accountant, Berman has seen his business drop nearly 20% this month compared to 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Form-filing requests have been similarly sparse at Total Tax Services in 
Ventura -- so sparse, in fact, that accountant Michael Allread plans to quit 
the business later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are thinking they'll try to do the forms themselves, because even $35 
or $40 is pretty dear to them," Allread said. "Also, fewer people are getting 
refunds, so they're putting it off to the very last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Some procrastinators blame the January earthquake that sent files tumbling and 
houses crumbling. Others mumble about hectic schedules. Still others file late 
out of habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Homer Adrianse, for example, picked up his forms at the Internal Revenue 
Service a full month in advance, and estimated that he would need just a couple 
of days of work to get everything straightened out. Yet he could guarantee when 
he'd drop them in the mail: "April 15, you bet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Come mid-April, however, last-minute filers may end up wishing that they had 
been a bit more organized. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do their taxes themselves, they'll face the annual stampede at post 
offices everywhere. If they give up and hire a professional just before 
deadline, they'll face steeper fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, of course, they'll get their refund later -- if they get one at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Even taxpayers who have diligently withheld money every quarter are finding 
themselves in debt at filing time, due to some changes in federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic change affects the richest, whose income tax rate has jumped 
from 31% to 36%. But middle-income residents who refinanced their homes may 
also end up paying unexpected sums, especially if they forgot to adjust tax 
withholdings to reflect their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 And all taxpayers are finding some favorite loopholes gone -- like the popular 
deductions for home offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just took all my stuff to an accountant and said, 'You handle it,' " 
Fillmore resident Jane Munoz said. "I don't know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who work with professional financial planners may find their forms 
whizzing toward the Internal Revenue Service via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic filing costs a little more -- $15 to $50, depending on the 
accountant -- but taxpayers get their refunds about a week faster. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can rest assured that their forms arrive in the IRS computer just as 
the accountant prepared them. In contrast, when forms arrive on paper, federal 
clerks enter the data by hand -- and one errant keystroke could touch off 
months of legal hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 What with learning computer programs and keeping up with paperwork, many 
accountants have stayed busy this spring, even though procrastination fever has 
kept some clients away. 
</P>

 In Thousand Oaks, Susan E. Cohen has abandoned her comfortable 30-hour 
workweeks for a full-time grind -- and then some. Her teen-age daughters know 
that they'll see less of her during tax season, Cohen said -- and they've 
become used to cooking dinner themselves this March. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county in Ojai, certified financial planner Chris Morrow has so 
many clients that she already knows she won't have time to prepare her own 
taxes by April 15. She's filed for an extension, and she hopes to have her 
forms ready by May -- although last year, she didn't make it until October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to take my time," Morrow said, "so I can be sure I've taken every last 
deduction." Getting Tax Help The Internal Revenue Service operates several

DISCOVERING THE POWER OF THE PRESS; EDUCATION: STUDENT NEWSPAPER IS MAKING 
WAVES WITH ITS COMMENTS ON SUBJECTS RANGING FROM CAFETERIA FOOD TO 'BEAVIS AND 
BUTT-HEAD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of writing boring articles about teachers and school officials, 
eighth-grade student Paul Houston decided that he wanted to do a story for the 
Anacapa Middle School newspaper that would truly interest his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 So he penned a column defending the MTV show "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paul hoped that his column might inspire responses from classmates, 
he hadn't considered another group of potential readers of the Ventura school's 
newspaper: parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the article, parents called the Anacapa principal to complain that 
Paul's column implied that the school supports the controversial TV show. Some 
even threatened to take the matter to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the parents would see it," Paul said. "I just wrote what I 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul and the rest of the staff of the Anacapa Title Waves have been making 
waves among parents and school officials since the first issue came out in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school launched the newspaper to give pupils different kinds of 
writing experience, officials said the students are also getting lessons in 
some of the finer points of journalism, including the issues of censorship, 
privacy and fairness. And newspaper adviser Sharon Mittelholtz is becoming a 
quick study in the art of diplomacy between her muckrakers-in-training and the 
powers-that-be. 
</P>
<P>
 In the November issue, the same one that carried Paul's column, eighth-grader 
Jennifer Woodman had an article that quoted students calling the school 
cafeteria lunches "greasy" and "gross." That did not make the lunchroom manager 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the seemingly innocent personal ads in the back of the newspaper have 
stirred trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the newspaper published a personal message that called for a boy named 
Matt to "dump" his girlfriend -- who was named -- because "she's not good 
enough for you," the girl's parents phoned to complain. Now the newspaper staff 
screens personal ads more carefully and omits all last names. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to other complaints, Mittelholtz has had to do some quick damage 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 After she was told that Anacapa cafeteria manager Billie Hayes was distraught 
over the article criticizing the lunchroom fare, Mittelholtz made a quick trip 
across campus to assure Hayes that not all students shared the views of those 
quoted in Jennifer's article. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hayes had a bigger concern than having her feelings hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like other businesses that worry about bad press, Hayes was anxious about 
the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer's story could have spurred some students who regularly buy cafeteria 
food to begin bringing their lunches instead, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't understand how much power there is in the press," Hayes said 
about the eager young journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mittelholtz has been surprised by the controversy provoked by the paper. 
"It's a lot easier to teach history," said Mittelholtz, an English and history 
teacher who is making her first foray into teaching journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittelholtz managed to smooth things over with the cafeteria staff by 
publishing follow-up interviews with Hayes and other school food-service 
workers pointing out that Anacapa has one of the most varied cafeteria menus in 
the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mittelholtz has become more cautious about what she will publish. 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming issue, due out at the end of this month, two reporters have 
penned articles denouncing a school proposal to get rid of student lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mittelholtz showed one of the articles to Anacapa Principal Charlotte 
McElroy, the principal promptly visited the journalism class to explain the 
school's reasons for the locker proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The students who wrote the articles condemning the proposal say they now 
understand the school's position better: Last year, the school received bomb 
threats, which proved false, warning about incendiary devices left in the 
lockers. And the 42-year-old locker stalls are falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But some newspaper staff still oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mittelholtz is concerned that if she prints their criticism, she risks 
offending McElroy. "There's things that are worth battling over and this is 
isn't one of them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy said she has no problem with eighth-grade reporters criticizing her 
decisions. "A lot of times, what they have to say might give me an idea I 
haven't thought of." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She draws the line, however, at "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy has read every Title Waves issue before it was photocopied in the 
school office and sold on campus for 25 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she approved the "Beavis and Butt-head" column because she thought 
that it was harmless banter among children. In the article, Paul concluded 
that: "If parents don't want their kids to watch it, then make sure they don't 
watch it." 
</P>
<P>
 When alarmed parents alerted McElroy to the crude antics of the show's title 
characters, the principal decided that the show is indeed harmful to children 
and ruled against any further stories on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy said she was also concerned that parents' complaints could lead school 
board members to clamp down on the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Such control from above has caused some frustration from the newspaper's 
writers: After his "Beavis and Butt-head" column was published, Paul wrote an 
article condemning censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear of reprisals hasn't silenced the newspaper staff or led 
Mittelholtz to shy away from all potentially controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent issue, reporter Chris Muirhead defends a video game called 
"Mortal Kombat," which is so violent that some parents have complained to local 
video arcades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted people to know about it and I wanted them to have their own 
opinions," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Title Waves articles are contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper also has an occasional fashion page with photographs of some of 
Anacapa's trendiest dressers, standard news articles on school activities and 
student poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular features is a coupon approved by the principal that 
entitles the bearer to a night free of homework in a particular class, such as 
math. "They sell better with the coupons," said Joan Kim, an eighth-grade 
student who is one of two co-editors this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Title Waves staff say one of the best things about their newspaper is that its 
writers know what subjects interest their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to hear about the national economy," said Amrit Chima, a 
seventh-grader who was on the Title Waves staff last semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as eighth-grade reporter Trevor Dasnoit said: "This is more fun because 
kids your age wrote it."

COALITION WANTS PERMIT OVERTURNED; LITIGATION: ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY COUNTY 
VIOLATED ITS OWN POLICY IN APPROVING THE FARMONT GOLF RESORT NEAR OJAI. JUDGE 
WILL HEAR FINAL ARGUMENTS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists will ask a Superior Court judge today to overturn a permit 
granted by Ventura County that they say would wrongly allow for the use of 
drinking water to irrigate a private golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Coalition of Ventura County sued the county last year after 
the Board of Supervisors upheld a Planning Commission ruling allowing 
development of the Farmont golf resort on 200 acres near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed by a Japanese broadcasting tycoon, the Farmont project would include 
a golf course, 19,000-square-foot clubhouse and 4,000-square-foot maintenance 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Final arguments in the case will be heard this morning by Ventura County 
Superior Court Judge William A. Peck, who could issue an immediate ruling or 
take the matter under submission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Farmont suit is one of a series of challenges to development and growth 
filed by activists in the Ojai Valley. In recent years, local environmentalists 
have thwarted a $100-million refinery expansion, helped kill construction of a 
state university at Taylor Ranch and stopped a proposed landfill at Weldon 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, upper Ojai residents are fighting the federal government over a 
microwave-emitting radar tower recently erected in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Farmont challenge, coalition members say the county violated its own 
water policy by granting the Farmont Corp. permission to build the golf course 
on land designated as open space in the county's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where feasible, reclaimed water shall be utilized for new golf courses," the 
county policy states. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaimed water comes from sewage treatment plants, but there is no source of 
such water near Farmont. The development's county permit allows it to use 
drinking water for irrigation until 2001, at which time it would have to use 
reclaimed water for most irrigation needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also contends that the proposed clubhouse is too big for the area and 
that it would be open until late in the evening, causing noise and traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a simple case of the board not following its own rules and not 
following its own priorities," said Santa Barbara attorney Philip A. Seymour, 
who represents the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to create this massive resort-type facility that's not 
allowed," Seymour said. "It's a scenic, rural area. It's not an appropriate 
place for a golf course." 
</P>
<P>
 The developers, however, say a golf course is one of the least obtrusive uses 
for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Its clubhouse would be one-third the size of the Sherwood Country Club 
facility near Thousand Oaks and half the size of the clubhouse at Spanish Hills 
near Camarillo, a Farmont attorney pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they would stand back and look at the benefits of this, they would see 
that it's a fairly benign use of land -- other than nothing at all," said 
attorney Lindsay F. Nielson, who represents the development firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it's nothing at all, they'd better buy the property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant County Counsel Robert R. Orellana said he will attend today's 
hearing, but said Farmont lawyers will argue the case. Nonetheless, he defended 
the county's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking a literalist view of the policy and taking it to an unjust 
extreme," Orellana said of the environmentalists. "The Farmont project will 
save a great deal of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Irrigating the private golf course would divert hundreds of acre-feet of 
potable water each year from residential or other uses, the suit claims. An 
acre-foot equals 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is currently an overdraft in the ground-water basins in the Ojai, and 
an acknowledged long-term shortage of water," the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the property owners and county officials contend that a golf course would 
use barely 20% of the water required for lemon or orange trees -- uses already 
allowable under the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can use five times the water to plant citrus, and there's no requirement 
for any approval at all," Nielson said. "By approving the (use permit), the 
county has put a limitation on the water we have rights to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company also agreed to grant an easement on about 1,500 acres it owns 
nearby to the Ojai Valley Land Conservancy -- another concession that ensures 
that the bulk of Farmont's 2,000 acres remains undeveloped, Nielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under approval conditions imposed by the county, Farmont agreed to spend up to 
$600,000 to build a plant or water line to get reclaimed water to the site by 
the 2001 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 That contribution "is another area in which the project will prove to be a 
benefit to the community," Nielson said in a legal brief to Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 A feasibility study is under way to determine how best to irrigate the golf 
course with reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eric J. Oltmann, general manager of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District, 
which administers waste-water treatment throughout the valley, said any 
satellite or package treatment plant would cost far more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not paying for it, that's for sure," Oltmann said. "We've got a whole 
lot of other problems that are more significant." 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district is under a state order to better treat the water it 
releases into the Ventura River -- an improvement project with a $27-million 
price tag, Oltmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmont opponents complain that the county permit does not require the company 
to cease its operations if it fails to use reclaimed water for irrigation by 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the Farmont golf course has been constructed . . . it is highly unlikely 
that it would be shut down by an irresolute board for failure to secure a 
reclaimed water supply," the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 But county planners are still comfortable with the conditions imposed for the 
use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clear what the obligations of Farmont are," Planner Patrick 
Richards said. "If they proceed with implementing the project and open their 
doors, the bottom line is they've got to provide that reclaimed water."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; EVERY DAY IS A WEE BIT O' IRISH AT SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Patrick's Day on Thursday is that time when everyone wants a "wee bit o' 
heaven" and to be Irish for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Tom and Mary Kelly of Tustin, every day is St. Patty's Day. At their 
gift shop on El Camino Real, the shamrocks never disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's Gift and Hobby Shop sells a variety of Irish products throughout the 
year, from food to clothes to jewelry to gifts. Little-known items such as 
shillelagh , a hammer-like device from a root of a tree that will bring luck, 
and walking sticks out of roots also are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel we like to share the spirit of Ireland in America," said Tom 
Kelly, who is of Irish descent, as is his wife. They moved to California in the 
1950s from Philadelphia and thought a store that specializes in Irish 
merchandise would be the best way to share their Irish roots with their 12 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Tom Kelly said it was pretty smart to specialize in something to 
make their business different. He and his wife opened the shop in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for anything Irish, this is the place to go," said Vickie 
Hoegee of Newport Beach, who ordered wedding invitations for her daughter on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another place to go is Rick Mowery's store in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When the leprechauns began disappearing from the shelves, Mowery knew it was 
that time of year again -- the "wearing o' the green" and feasting on corned 
beef and cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 And when customers at his shop, Mr. D's Fine Gifts and Collectibles, began 
wiping out his inventory of the figurines, he knew his customers wanted a 
little magic. The leprechauns, according to legend, can reveal a buried crock 
of gold to anyone who catches one. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection at Kelly's is so big that Liz Capp, who was looking for greeting 
cards for a couple of friends, could not make up her mind what to get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for something humorous, and it seems every card is funny," Capp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A plateful of Irish cookies and a steaming cup of Irish tea are available to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fun place to come," said Marilyn Marsh, a regular customer. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD TO RESPOND ON GRAND JURY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors today will respond to several suggestions on how to 
expand the Orange County Grand Jury's recruiting practices and how to clarify 
the requirements for serving on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations seek to better publicize the grand jury and assure 
prospective jurors they will be screened fairly. The suggestions, compiled by 
jury members, were submitted to the county in January and address criticisms 
leveled at the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's recruiting process came under fire late last year from a variety of 
ethnic groups who said the panel does not reflect the county's increasing 
diversity. Much of the criticism was sparked by a September grand jury report 
that attributed a host of societal ills -- from crime to health care woes -- to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors today will consider endorsing a report prepared by the county 
administrative office that addresses the list of suggestions and responds to 
each one. Several of the suggestions have already been acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's recommendations and CAO's responses were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue and expand Grand Jury Outreach Program, which publicizes the jury 
through community and civic groups to boost recruitment, the jury recommended. 
The recommendation also suggests encouraging members of the jury to join in the 
campaign by speaking about their participation. The CAO report supported this 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue to seek annual approval from the Board of Supervisors to designate 
November as Grand Jury Awareness Month, the jury recommended. The board 
approved the designation last November, and the jury commissioner will add the 
item to the jury's regular recruitment campaign, the CAO report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judges on the selection committee should eliminate the home visit portion of 
the juror background check, the jury recommended. The CAO report responded that 
a review of state statutes showed the home visit to be necessary to confirm 
qualifications, including county residency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judges should establish written, standard guidelines for narrowing the field 
of applicants to 30 candidates, the jury recommended. The CAO report said state 
statutes and case law grant Superior Court judges the discretion to whittle the 
field as they see fit. "To remove this step from the process would . . . be 
inconsistent with applicable law," the CAO report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transfer the background checks of potential jurors from the district 
attorney's office to the Orange County Marshal's Department, the jury 
recommended. This suggestion was meant to diffuse any conflict of interest. The 
jury decides the merits of prosecutors' cases, so they should be distanced from 
the candidate selection, jurors said. This suggestion has already been 
implemented, the CAO report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order the jury commissioner and the Marshal's Department to author 
guidelines for background checks, the jury recommended. This has already been 
done and will be used for the next panel selection process, the CAO report 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury serves as the county's government watchdog and as an 
investigative branch of the district attorney's office. Jurors serve a one-year 
term. Applicants must be U.S. citizens and over 18. The applicant deadline has 
passed for the 1995-96 panel, but people can placed on a mailing list for 
information on future juries by calling (714) 834-6747. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA HEIGHTS; CLUB FACES FINES FOR VIOLATING 
ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local nightclub owner and his dancers face thousands of dollars in possible 
fines and jail time after an Orange County Superior Court judge found the club 
had violated a county ordinance prohibiting topless shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining an invitation to view a live exhibition of makeup techniques used by 
dancers to comply with the county law, Judge Robert A. Knox last week found the 
Laff Stop in contempt and ordered sentencing for late next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling follows a series of court actions related to the topless show 
prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach club attorney Paul Mast and managing partner Jorn S. Rossi 
on Monday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 The county ordinance outlaws such entertainment within 500 feet of a 
residential community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laff Stop is located on the fringe of unincorporated Santa Ana Heights, 
near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last December, when a permanent injunction was issued against topless 
dancing there, Deputy County Counsel Thomas C. Agin said, performers began 
experimenting with latex and other makeup to cover their breasts and comply 
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 During the court hearing Friday, Laff Stop officials used mannequins to show 
how the makeup was used, Agin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, they offered to show the judge how the application appeared on a 
live model. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a young lady there with the makeup already applied, and they offered 
to have her open her jacket," Agin said, adding that the judge declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Agin said that the makeup, while an attempt to cover the dancers, actually 
allowed them to appear as if they were performing topless. 
</P>
<P>
 "If customers are led to believe that they are dancing topless, that violates 
the ordinance," Agin said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for April 22, and Agin said that both 
Rossi and the dancers face fines of up to $1,000 each and five days in jail for 
each day the club was in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The county contends that the club has been in violation for nearly 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Agin estimated that up to 20 dancers were served with injunction papers late 
last year, but he was unsure how many have continued to perform in violation of 
the county ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems we're facing is that as soon as you think you served 
(papers on) everybody, they have a whole new crew working in there," he said. 
"It's a business with very high turnover." 
</P>
<P>
 Agin said the club could continue operation as long as the dancers were 
properly clothed. 
</P>
<P>
 Club owners and the county have been at odds since the Laff Stop, which once 
featured such comedians as David Letterman and Robin Williams, was converted to 
topless dancing in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi made the change without first obtaining adult entertainment permits from 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to remain open, he filed a lawsuit against the county, alleging 
that the county's zoning ordinances do not apply to Santa Ana Heights. KEVIN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: LA CONCHITA; 2-MILE BARRIER ALONG FREEWAY IS 
CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-mile concrete barrier along the Ventura Freeway near La Conchita is 
drawing criticism from local environmentalists, who complain that they were 
left out when state officials decided to replace a metal guardrail formerly at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Department of Transportation officials say they decided to build the 
wall only after local bicyclists said they needed a wider bike path to prevent 
injuries or deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concrete barrier is approximately four feet closer to the ocean" than the 
old metal railing, said Caltrans engineer Robert Joe. The space will "provide a 
wider area for parking and for bicyclists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 65-year-old Tarzana woman was killed by a southbound driver in June as she 
peddled along the bike path at La Conchita. Within weeks, Caltrans officials 
began working on alternatives to the metal railing. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Ventura chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, however, said 
Caltrans excluded them from the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice if they'd put out the information or held a public 
hearing," said Brian Brennan, who serves on the local chapter's executive 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a positive thing, then people would have at least understood what 
they were trying to accomplish," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall is designed to prevent cars from veering off the southbound lanes of 
the highway onto the beach. It is 32 inches tall -- five inches higher than the 
metal railing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the wall is concrete, however, environmentalists also complain that 
they can no longer see the coastline while driving along the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public doesn't think of a rail as something made out of precast 
concrete," said Larry Manson, another Surfrider board member. "To me, a 
guardrail is mounted on posts and made out of steel, but this thing's two miles 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Manson, however, said there is little that can be done about the wall now. But 
he said the complaints will motivate Caltrans to hold public hearings on future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get some method by which government agencies are open to 
public input," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the site Monday said they should complete the wall by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we started building this, there have been a few (cars) that have gone 
over" the barrier, said Dave Hendry of Modern Alloy, the Orange County-based 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendry said his crew has reported some complaints about the new wall from 
passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're concerned that it might have taken away their horizon," Hendry said. 
"But other than that, they're just curious." JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; ARTIFACTS DISCOVERED AT DEVELOPMENT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The remains of a former Native American village, a campsite and other 
artifacts have been discovered on 4,000 acres slated for development northeast 
of Moorpark, but the developer said the find poses little threat to its 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The archeological remains were discovered during preparation of an 
environmental impact report to gauge the effects of Messenger Investment Co.'s 
proposal to build roughly 3,200 homes on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Messenger Vice President Gary Austin said the company would be able to 
reconfigure its project in response to the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to either completely avoid the areas altogether or to make 
sure that the necessary investigations are conducted before proceeding 
further," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants preparing the environmental document stressed that the nature of 
the discovery was not unexpected or sensitive enough to threaten development, 
Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was their opinion that this was not unique or new information," he said. 
"It's probably pretty typical of what you would expect to find over 4,000 acres 
that contain riparian habitats." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said the city would continue to monitor 
developments on the Messenger land and await more detailed information on the 
recent discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're interested," Lawrason said. "There are some real 
restrictions on development, depending on what you find there." JAMES MAIELLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CHAPMAN GETS GRANT FOR BUSINESS CHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman University has received a $1.5-million grant to endow a chair in 
international business and economics, officials announced Monday. The grant is 
the largest foundation award ever received by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, donated by the Los Angeles-based Fletcher Jones Foundation, will 
pay the salary and research expenses of a professor, who will be selected by 
the fall of 1995 after an international search, according to Richard McDowell, 
dean of Chapman's School of Business and Economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions in international business are rapidly changing and we hope 
that this person will help bring those changes not only to students but to the 
Orange County community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fletcher Jones Foundation was established in 1969 by the will of the late 
Fletcher Jones, a financial wizard who co-founded Computer Sciences Corp., one 
of the world's largest computer firms. The foundation awards grants to 
independent universities and colleges in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fletcher Jones Chair in International Business and Economics is the 
university's second endowment established this academic year. Last December, 
Chapman received $384,400 from a former university professor, the late Paul 
Delp, to establish an endowment for peace studies.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; LOAN PLAN AIMED AT SMALL BUSINESSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's economic development division is offering loans to small businesses 
that qualify under its federally funded Small Business Loan Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses eligible for assistance include those that will create or retain 
jobs for low- and moderate-income residents, as well as those that provide 
goods and services in areas designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Loans are offered at a 3% interest rate and can be used for property 
improvements, capital equipment purchases and working capital. Repayment terms 
vary depending on the use of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for businesses to obtain loans for less than $50,000 in 
today's conventional lending market," said Ellen Bonneville of the city's 
development division. "We saw a strong need for such loans in the small 
business community and, for the first time, tapped into the city's community 
development block grant entitlement funding."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN GETS YEAR TERM UNDER STALKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first person convicted in Orange County under the state's anti-stalking 
law was sentenced Monday to one year in jail for violating a court order that 
he stay at least 10 miles away from the woman he had been convicted of 
harassing. 
</P>
<P>
 James Otis Sims Jr., 39, who was convicted in January, 1992, was released 
hours after sentencing because he was given credit for time already served. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been convicted of stalking Sandra Potter, 34, of Westminster, and was 
sentenced to 60 days in jail under the new anti-stalking law, which had gone 
into effect one year earlier. A condition of his probation in 1992 was that he 
remain more than 10 miles from Potter's work and home. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that conviction, Sims has twice violated probation. In September, 1992, 
he was spotted in an Anaheim movie theater near her home and was arrested. He 
served two months in jail and was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months later, Sims violated probation again when a detective caught him 
eating a sandwich in a Garden Grove park a few miles from Potter's home. In 
July, 1993, Sims was sent back to jail, where he asked to be held until 
Monday's sentencing. In both cases, Sims did not contest the violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter has said she dated Sims for five months nearly 15 years ago, and that 
she ended their short-lived relationship after he became "too possessive." 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 years after the breakup, Sims stalked Potter, slashed her car tires, 
uprooted plants in her yard and once even assaulted her, which landed him in 
jail, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the stalking law went into effect in January, 1991 -- making 
stalking a misdemeanor -- Sims was arrested and charged with that crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims' attorney, James Brott, said his client plans to move from Orange County 
and not bother Potter again. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Monday's sentencing, Sims was given 15 months probation, and could 
receive more than a year in jail if he violates it.E. J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NEW PROGRAM OFFERS ACTING IN AFTERNOON 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local youths can try their hands at acting as part of an after-school program 
approved by the City Council this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama organization is aimed at giving teens something to do in the 
afternoon and is one of several new city programs designed to reduce youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is expected to spend about $61,000 this fiscal year on the 
anti-violence effort, which was sparked by a community task force report that 
looked at ways of preventing youth crimes in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The council allocated $85,000 last year for youth programs, but officials said 
that finding suitable activities to fund has been more difficult than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend $7,460 on the drama program, which will be administered by 
Northwood Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The activity is targeted for students in grades 6 to 8 and will involve the 
production of a play or musical to be performed sometime in June, said Marsha 
Burgess, Irvine's community services superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to performing, participants will take part in set designing, 
makeup and costuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council decided to spend $14,900 on "parent training" sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to help families deal with issues such as discipline, 
parental authority and youthful rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess expects the council to vote in June on a proposal to spend $40,000 for 
more after-school programs, including athletic events and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council decided not to spend $2,160 to fund several 
recreational events for children at Woodbridge's lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected the proposal because the Woodbridge Village Assn. refused 
to open the event to youths who don't reside in the Woodbridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said that whatever remains from the $85,000 in youth funds will be 
carried over to next year's youth budget. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL BOARD WILL DISCUSS TEST SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District board tonight will discuss the results of 
new statewide proficiency examinations that tested students' reading, writing 
and math abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's test scores were among the best in the county, but district officials 
vowed to examine the results closely and look for ways to improve them next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a time to brag or feel defeated," said Dean Waldfogel, deputy 
superintendent of the district. "We are less concerned about how we compare. We 
want to help more students produce work at a high level." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldfogel enthusiastically endorsed the new California Learning Assessment 
System (CLAS) tests, saying they do a better job of evaluating students' skills 
than the old tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS exams go beyond testing basic skills by asking students to use a 
variety of different skills to solve real-life problems, Waldfogel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major shift in emphasis, and one we wanted to make," he said. "We 
think they are testing the right things." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine students did better in the writing portion of the test than they did in 
the math section. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldfogel attributed this in part to the district's recent emphasis on the 
importance of writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS tested students in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials plan to go over the test results and examine sample 
"correct" answers provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also hopes to develop new teaching methods aimed at helping more 
students gain the skills necessary to do well on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be more complex than just asking students to change textbooks," 
Waldfogel said. "We are asking them to be thoughtful." SHELBY GRAD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PRINCIPAL AT HIGH SCHOOL QUITS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard High School Principal Rick Rezinas has resigned from his post amid 
allegations by parent leaders that the educator's efforts to reform the school 
were stymied by some teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired to take over the principal's job after Oxnard High School was rocked by 
a violent brawl between black and Latino students in February, 1991, Rezinas 
notified Oxnard Union High School District officials last week that he is 
resigning Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've done what I could do here at Oxnard High School," Rezinas said 
Monday. He declined to elaborate on the reasons for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rezinas said he hopes to find a job as a school-district 
administrator in another area, he has not secured a position yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Bill Studt said Rezinas' efforts to restructure the school had no 
bearing on his decision to resign. "This is Rick's decision," he said. "He's 
looking to move up and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Rezinas' resignation comes in the middle of a four-year period during which he 
had been attempting to restructure the school with the help of a $116,400 state 
grant, which he helped secure. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure also will come just months before the scheduled January, 1995, 
move of Oxnard High's 2,400 students and their teachers to a new campus on 
Gonzales Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Herold, a former school Parent Teacher Student Assn. president who is 
still active at the school, said Rezinas' efforts to restructure Oxnard High 
were resisted by some teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of teachers that just do not want to change their style of 
teaching," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Oxnard Federation of Teachers could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state restructuring funds, Rezinas had hoped to institute several 
reforms, including a still-pending proposal to establish homeroom classes that 
could encourage interaction among students of different ages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rezinas' most controversial proposal was for a year-round school calendar, 
which sparked heated opposition from some teachers and was eventually dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard High science teacher Herb Suskin said Rezinas made the mistake of 
taking advice from a small group of teachers who are out of touch with most of 
their colleagues. "I think he could have presented a better picture to the 
faculty" of his ideas for restructuring, Suskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suskin said Rezinas "had a really difficult job." He added that some veteran 
teachers find it difficult to change their instructional methods. "You get set 
in your ways," he said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PETITIONERS TO SEEK TO REOPEN POLI STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About three months after the City Council decided to block off a section of 
Poli Street at Ventura High School, residents today will begin circulating 
petitions for a November ballot initiative to reopen the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Councilmen Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan said they will be the 
first to sign the petition in a noon ceremony on Sunset Drive, which has also 
been blocked off to detour traffic that resulted from the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided in December to use metal gates to block off a section of 
Poli that cuts through the campus during school days to lessen the chances of a 
drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision angered many residents of nearby hillside neighborhoods who 
object to the increased traffic in their areas and want voters citywide to 
decide the issue. Parents and students at Ventura High School are pushing to 
keep the street closed for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that we're just a bunch of whiners, and this only affects 
400 to 500 people," said resident Dave Gladstone, who is helping to organize 
the petition drive. "But the situation is that we have a main east-west artery 
in the city that is closed during the day. It is a citywide issue." 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara Kam said the residents must gather a minimum of 8,588 
signatures of registered Ventura voters to qualify for the measure for the 
ballot. The petitions are due June 25. PEGGY Y. LEE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CRASH VICTIM'S KIN AWARDED $1.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury on Monday awarded $1.34 million to the 
family of a Placentia man who died after his car crashed into a tractor-trailer 
that had arbitrarily stopped in the middle lane of the Orange Freeway almost 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for three days, the jury decided that the truck's driver, 
Mustafa Yaman, caused the accident that claimed the life of 52-year-old Warren 
Botha, a former mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wylie A. Aitken, a Santa Ana lawyer who represented Botha's wife, Gillian, and 
her three children in a negligence lawsuit, said the family was pleased with 
the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel vindicated that this long fight is over," Aitken said. "When a 
father of three children gets up and goes to work and never returns, it feels 
good to know that it was not his fault for the pain this family has been 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Aitken said the fatal crash occurred about 5:30 a.m. on July 24, 1991, on the 
northbound Orange Freeway in Diamond Bar. Botha was taking the same route he 
had driven for 15 years to his work at Brown & Root Braun, an engineering firm 
in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 After Botha crashed into Yaman's big rig that had stopped down an incline, 
another truck rammed into Botha's vehicle moments later. Botha died from the 
injuries suffered in the two crashes, according to testimony during the 
three-week trial before Judge Robert J. Polis. 
</P>
<P>
 Several eyewitnesses, including an off-duty Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy, testified that Yaman failed to switch on his hazard lights or set out 
any warning devices even though he had stopped in the middle lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaman owned the big rig, but at the time of the incident, he was hauling two 
trailers of tomatoes for B & P Bulk, a Bakersfield company that specializes in 
transporting agricultural produce. The jury also found that B & P Bulk was 
negligent in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Aitken contended that the Bakersfield firm should have known that Yaman had 
been cited for reckless driving and was involved in two previous accidents with 
the same truck a few months before the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaman, 39, who testified at the trial, has since moved to New Jersey, where he 
is a bartender on a cruise ship, Aitken said. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, John Barber, declined to comment on the verdict. DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; STUDENT ART SHOW WINNERS HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Christine Leva created a work of art that portrays herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-portrait has a bird perched on a branch, a moon with a shooting star 
and a saxophone with notes streaming out. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old student at St. Pius V Catholic School said her artwork 
captures her talents and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm creative, and I'm shy and sensitive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine was among participants in Buena Park's 18th annual Student Art Show 
who were honored at a City Hall reception last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine, the first-place winner among sixth-grade entrants, said her 
accomplishment as an artist makes her feel proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to say they like my artwork," said Christine, who aspires to be 
a nurse. "It makes me feel happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar Martinez, 11, a fourth-grader at Danbrook Elementary School who wants to 
be an artist, also expressed pride in winning a first-place award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," said Edgar, who drew a colorful picture of a jungle with an 
elephant, a monkey swinging from one tree to another, birds flying and a tiger 
killing a deer. "I thought I wasn't even going to get a prize." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual show is sponsored by the city's Fine Arts Commission. This year's 
show attracted artworks from 160 youngsters, said Carol Young, who ran the show 
and is a teacher at Charles G. Emery Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception for the young artists was a showcase for the children and was 
attended by parents, teachers and school and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them a chance to shine," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Entries were submitted by students in kindergarten through sixth grade from 
St. Pius V and schools in Buena Park and the Centralia School District. 
Students competed against others in their grades for ribbons for first, second 
and third places, and honorable-mention awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a lot of art coming from younger students," Young said. "Now 
I'm seeing a lot of sixth-grade entries." 
</P>
<P>
 And the children seem to be producing higher-quality artwork. "It seems they 
have more confidence in their work," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the winners were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kindergarten -- Jovie Lopez, St. Pius V, first; Tierra Keahey, Arthur F. 
Corey Elementary, second; and Vincent Castaneda, St. Pius V, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * First grade -- Ann Marie Laroza, Gordon H. Beatty Elementary, first; So 
Jyung Kang, Corey Elementary, second; and Rosemarie Tamayo, St. Pius V, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second grade -- Heather Armstrong, Emery Elementary, first; Alex Heath, 
Beatty Elementary, second; and Mark Mancilla, Centralia Elementary, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third grade -- Gwam Oh, Corey Elementary, first; Julie Lee, Corey 
Elementary, second; and David Puthoff, Emery Elementary, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourth grade -- Edgar Martinez, Danbrook Elementary, first; Wilfred Asperin, 
Danbrook Elementary, second; and Jeffrey Kulp, Emery Elementary, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifth grade -- Grace Oh, Corey Elementary, first; Alana Barrios, George B. 
Miller Elementary, second; and Kenia Casillas, San Marino Elementary, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixth grade -- Christine Leva, St. Pius V, first; Nicholas Piscitelli, 
Beatty Elementary, second; and Gustavo Rodriguez, James A. Whitaker Elementary, 
third.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; 2 HEADLANDS PROJECT HEARINGS TO BE HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two crucial hearings will be held this week on the controversial $500-million 
hotel resort and residential project proposed for the Headlands overlooking 
Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the City Council is expected to vote tonight on a plan that would allow 
the landowners to build a 400-room hotel, two commercial centers and 394 homes 
on the 121-acre parcel, which offers 180-degree views of the South County 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's proponents claim it is crucial for the financial future of the 
city, while its opponents claim it would destroy one of the last undeveloped 
coastal parcels in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Planning Commission will review a proposed development 
agreement on the same Headlands plan, which could lock in the city's approval 
of the project for 23 years or more. The commission could vote on the agreement 
as early as Wednesday, but it must still be approved by the council before it 
goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific plan and development agreement are related, but different aspects 
of the city's approval process, said Edward M. Knight, Dana Point's director of 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The specific plan lays out all the parameters of the development of the city, 
including policies and regulations," Knight said. "The development agreement is 
more like a contract written by attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Lynn Dawson called the development agreement "very, 
very, very important because it's so long a term." 
</P>
<P>
 Included among the stipulations in the development agreement are: 
</P>
<P>
 * An option that gives the city the right to buy a parcel of the Headlands at 
the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Street of the Green Lantern for 
use as a civic center. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposal that calls for the developer to donate the proceeds of the sale 
of one residential lot to the Orange County Marine Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 * The right of the developer to choose which portion of the project to build 
first. The landowner has indicated that the 95 custom-home lots on the 20-plus 
acres along The Strand, a former trailer park at the northwest section of the 
project, will be sold first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at this real carefully and not rush," Dawson said. "This is 
our last remaining piece of property. . . . We may have to go back to the 
drawing board and make sure everyone understands what they are getting into." 
</P>
<P>
 Celia Kutcher, a spokeswoman for the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy, said 
her group will continue to oppose the project at both meetings this week. The 
conservancy hopes to raise funds to buy a large portion of the Headlands 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the end of the process by any means," Kutcher said. "We still 
feel as much of this property as possible should remain as open space." 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands property is owned by the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times.LEN HALL

BOATS RESCUED FROM HIGH WINDS, WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong Santa Ana winds combined with 6-foot seas made last weekend the busiest 
this year for boat rescues off the Ventura County coast, Coast Guard officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Sunday, Coast Guard crews based at the Channel 
Islands Harbor received eight distress calls, most from small boats overwhelmed 
by the wind and waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard crews performed five rescues; the Channel Islands Harbor 
Patrol and other boaters assisted with others. No one was seriously injured, 
said Petty Officer Marc Engelbrecht. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call came just after 9:10 a.m., when Bachian Haroutioun of Pasadena 
radioed for help as his 22-foot boat was struggling to turn back against the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't find their way into the harbor and they were really scared," 
said Petty Officer James Dubea, who piloted the Coast Guard rescue boat. "They 
had six people on board and they were pretty seasick." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes after escorting Haroutioun's boat into the harbor, the Coast 
Guard received another distress call involving a 22-foot boat, Slow Starvation, 
with a disabled motor. The boat was towed into Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The other distress calls involved a 12-foot boat capsized near an oil 
platform, two boats aground on the harbor breakwater, a 13-year-old boy who 
fell off the Port Hueneme pier, a 25-foot boat disabled four miles from Oxnard, 
and a 23-foot boat with engine failure off Goleta, Dubea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engelbrecht said the Coast Guard station at the Channel Islands Harbor has 
answered 92 distress calls since Oct. 1, compared to 51 during the same period 
the previous year. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DRAWINGS SERVE AS ART THERAPY FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, the crayon-colored creations hanging in the Ventura office of 
the American Red Cross look like typical children's drawings. But they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 The sketches depict homes with cracked walls and crooked doorways, the twisted 
remains of the Northridge earthquake. Other drawings show severed freeways and 
Red Cross shelters -- unusual material for elementary-age schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawings are examples of art therapy, a technique that counselors have 
used to encourage youngsters to express their feelings about the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be effective, particularly with younger children or children who have 
a hard time talking about things," said Don Kingdon, director of the county's 
mental health department for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdon said art therapy became popular after the Los Angeles riots as a way 
of getting children to communicate their fears and emotions after a devastating 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County mental health counselors started using art therapy immediately 
after the earthquake by going to shelters where displaced children were in need 
of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors asked children to draw scenes from the earthquake on one side of a 
piece of paper, and draw a place, person or thing that made them feel safe on 
the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Eaton, an art therapist and Red Cross volunteer, said the sessions were 
beneficial. "Art therapy is a visual language; it helps people express thoughts 
and feelings that words can't," Eaton said. "When the pain is on the page, the 
children can gain control of their emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who sense that their children are still trying to cope in the 
aftermath of the quake can use art therapy at home, Kingdon said, but added 
that parents should seek professional assistance if problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
 Recurring nightmares, bed-wetting and fear of separation from family members 
are symptoms of post-traumatic stress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are children in all populations that are at risk, and some of those 
children will be adversely affected no matter what parents and schools do," 
Kingdon said. TRACY WILSON

 The family of a slain Cal State Fullerton honor student and police released a 
photograph of the young woman's car Monday, hoping somebody will remember 
something that will help catch her killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Torrez, 20, was driving her red 1990 Toyota Corolla on Feb. 12 when she 
disappeared after leaving her job at the Sav-on Drug Store at Yorba Linda 
Boulevard and Bradford Avenue at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was found Feb. 19 in the trunk of the car in the front parking lot of 
the Placentia-Linda Medical Building.She had been stabbed. The building is part 
of the Placentia-Linda Community Hospital complex at 1301 N. Rose Drive. A 
doctor told police the car had been parked in the lot since at least Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some leads, but we are still missing some pieces of the puzzle," 
Detective Donna Rose said. "Maybe somebody was taking their kid to the 
emergency room and saw something and this picture will help them remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bennett, Torrez's mother, said she hopes the crime will be solved soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know what happened," she said. "We need justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-on, the city of Placentia and the union of which Torrez was a member have 
combined to donate $30,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of her killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives can be reached at (714) 993-8146 or (714) 993-8164. A 24-hour 
anonymous tip line is also available at (714) 993-8226. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PROFESSOR AWARDED EDUCATION HONOR

 Saddleback College math professor James Thorpe has been recognized as one of 
the state's top community college instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The California community college system's board of governors last week 
presented Thorpe with the 1994 Gerald C. Hayward Award for Excellence in 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, which includes a $1,250 cash prize, is given to four community 
college faculty members each year who exhibit the highest level of commitment 
to their students, college and profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has provided pioneering leadership and has helped shape how our 
institution operates," said Terrill Robinson, who as the college's academic 
senate president nominated Thorpe for the award. "Most of all, his committed 
belief in education has set standards unequaled at our college." 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe has been a faculty member of the college since its founding in 1968. He 
holds a master's degrees in mathematics from Harvard University and in 
government from Miami University in Ohio, and a doctorate in education from 
Nova University in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six of us created Saddleback College," he said. "We wrote the catalogue, 
ordered furniture and supplies, hired faculty and had students in classrooms, 
all while trying to understand the mission of the community college." 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe also was elected to the San Juan Capistrano City Council in 1970 and 
1978. He served as mayor in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is the third in five years for a Saddleback faculty member. RICHARD 
CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; AIR SHOW READY FOR SATURDAY TAKEOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vintage aircraft, dog-fighting model airplanes, the Goodyear Blimp and a 
parachute team will be among the attractions of "Airport Day '94" on Saturday 
at Fullerton Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the aircraft on display will be the Stearman, an open-cockpit biplane 
used to train pilots in World War II, said airport director Roland Elder. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators can pay $15 per person for an airplane ride with the Fullerton 99s, 
a women's aviation group. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter rides are also available, and several radio air-traffic controllers 
will be on hand to emcee the event, which runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and is 
free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the show, radio-controlled airplanes flown by the California Air 
Show Team will perform at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just capture the day. They do dog fights and barrel rolls," Elders said 
of the model planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport is the oldest general aviation field still in its original 
location in the county. During the show, it will be designated as one of the 
county's 40 historical landmarks by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime pig farm and city sewage site was transformed into an airfield by 
William Dowling, a Placentia citrus rancher and pioneer aviator, who landed the 
first plane there in February, 1927.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting next month, third- through eighth-grade students who buy breakfast at 
school in the La Habra City School District will be offered a choice of meals. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members decided last week week to allow students to choose a hot 
meal or cereal and to decline any foods they would not eat. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, district officials said, less food will be wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some children are used to eating certain kinds of foods in the morning, so if 
they don't like hot meals, they can have their choice of cold cereals or 
something else," said Mary Jo Anderson, principal at Las Lomas Elementary 
School in La Habra.MIMI KO

EX-RAM DENIED SEPARATE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Monday denied a request by former Los Angeles Rams 
cornerback Darryl Henley to have a separate trial from three co-defendants who 
with Henley face charges of conspiring to operate a nationwide drug network. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorney, Roger L. Cossack of Los Angeles, told Judge Gary L. Taylor 
that he feared evidence used against the other defendants might jeopardize 
Henley's chance for a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a federal grand jury indicted Henley and former Rams cheerleader 
Tracy Donoho on charges of cocaine possession and conspiring to distribute 
cocaine. Henley pleaded not guilty, while Donoho has pleaded guilty and will 
cooperate with the prosecution. The three other men are charged with extortion 
as well as conspiring to distribute cocaine.

NEWPORT POLICE HOPE TO CLOSE BACCHUS NIGHTCLUB; DISTURBANCES: REVOCATION OF 
PERMIT WILL BE SOUGHT IN WAKE OF WEEKEND BRAWL, LATEST IN A SERIES OF PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Police Department to will try to shut down a nightclub where a melee last 
week was the latest in a "litany" of problems over the past six months, the 
police chief said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Robert J. McDonell said the Bacchus nightclub on Lido Peninsula 
"gets top billing" as the city's most troublesome nightclub, especially after a 
brawl early Friday outside Bacchus and the Warehouse Restaurant. Police 
arrested four people, but three of them escaped -- one still wearing handcuffs 
-- from an unlocked patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically there's a problem with a lack of control, and it's the 
responsibility of the management," McDonell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's owners said Monday that they will do "whatever it takes" to remain 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's trouble camenear closing time, about 2 a.m., police Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. About 30 people were entangled in a huge fight on the street, while a 
crowd of more than 200 looked on, keeping half a dozen police officers busy, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the crowds came from both nightclubs, police are most worried about 
Bacchus, where there have been more than 50 criminal incidents -- most 
involving drugs, guns and public urination by both men and women -- since the 
place opened six months ago, Gonis said. Several of the incidents have involved 
felony arrests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which is only open four nights a week and has both live music and 
disc jockeys on two dance floors, also has two pending violations before the 
state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department. One violation is for doing less 
than 51% of its sales in food as the permit requires, and the second for 
running a VIP room, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than a nuisance. It's a big problem for us in terms of causing a 
lot of field services that could be used better elsewhere," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the club's troubled history, the Police Department will ask the 
Planning Commission to revoke Bacchus' permit at the commission's meeting on 
March 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to run businesses out of town, but this is a drain on our 
resources," McDonell said. "It cannot continue to operate as it is without 
seriously impacting our service to the rest of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting Monday afternoon, Bacchus owners pleaded with 
officials to let them remain open, saying their problems were caused by poor 
managers who had since been fired. Regarding the fight in the wee hours Friday 
morning, part-owner Robert Mitchell said most of Bacchus' security personnel 
were inside at the time, and that of the six to eight security guards outside, 
four were working their first night on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our past performance has been bad and inexcusable," Mitchell admitted. 
"People get drunk and get in fights, it's just going to happen. . . . We're 
going to do what it takes to hire extra security guards." 
</P>
<P>
 Bacchus is a new tenant on the peninsula, but the Warehouse, a seafood 
restaurant that has live bands on weekend nights, has been operating for eight 
years and enjoys a good relationship with local police and other city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warehouse responds well to queries from police, Gonis said, and has no 
violations before the state alcohol board. 
</P>
<P>
 Warehouse owner Warren Levy said that he does not know what happened during 
the brawl Friday morning, but that in general Bacchus has been a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very busy, there's no doubt about that. Busy in terms of a lot of 
people, but in terms of problems with us? No," Levy said Monday. "When (the 
clubs) let out, it's not rowdy, but it's sure loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, anytime you have two popular and successful situations so close to each 
other, you're going to get a lot of people in this area and we do. I think 
we've done a pretty good job of controlling it."

PROPOSED 28-MILE URBAN RAIL LINE DEBATED; TRANSIT: FOES AND SUPPORTERS OF 
FULLERTON-IRVINE LINK TRADE BARBS, BUT MOST TESTIMONY AT HEARING FAVORS PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Split into militant camps, supporters and critics of a proposed 28-mile urban 
rail line clashed before Orange County transit officials Monday, with each side 
blaming the other for current traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't listen to "a few elderly men with an exaggerated emotional attachment to 
asphalt," Irvine activist Judy Davis said of rail's pro-auto foes. "Building 
more roads will only give us more of what we already have. . . . We must change 
our ways." 
</P>
<P>
 But warning of rail transit's high costs, Leon McKinney of Huntington Beach 
described the proposed $2-billion project as a "social program for minorities" 
who live or work along the rail line. He charged that rail projects are a 
liberal, misguided attempt to "order" people's lives and take away their 
ability to make their own choices, including eliminating cheap bus service for 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA board member Sarah L. Catz of Laguna Beach protested McKinney's 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the opposite of what we're trying to do," said Catz during the 
standing-room-only session that drew 26 public speakers, about three-fourths of 
whom supported the proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, also on the OCTA board, defended McKinney, 
saying that he is correct about choices being reduced, if operating funds for 
rail have to come at the expense of other transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board won't vote until April 11 on whether to pursue federal funds 
for such a rail line. Under the current proposal, the line would connect 
Fullerton and Irvine with Disneyland and South Coast Plaza. Monday's meeting 
was the first time OCTA has invited the public to testify specifically on a 
proposed route since Measure M funding for transportation projects was approved 
by county voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure hiked the sales tax rate by half a cent in hopes of raising 
$3.2 billion for traffic improvements over 20 years. About $340 million has 
been earmarked for intra-county urban rail, which would have more stations and 
run more frequently than inter-county, Metrolink commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of rail service contended Monday that even if the proposed 
Fullerton-Irvine rail line is financed entirely by the federal government, 
Orange County shouldn't take the money to construct any new passenger rail 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need ox-carts, we don't need stagecoaches, we don't need canal 
barges, and we don't need urban rail," said Bill Ward of Costa Mesa, a member 
of Drivers for Highway Safety, a pro-auto group. "Under no circumstances should 
we bite on the bait of federal pork that is being offered. . . . The upkeep and 
operating expenses from local taxes would keep going, and going and going, like 
the battery bunny. . . . Just say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward added: "If you have extra money laying around, spend it on earthquake 
upgrades for freeway bridges, not trains." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ward was countered by several people who endorsed rail either because 
they are confident that commuters will flock to trains or because rail projects 
may have other benefits, including jobs, neighborhood redevelopment and gains 
in air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the transportation benefit," said Les Card, an engineering 
consultant who represents the Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Local shopping, sports center and development firm executives also paraded to 
the rostrum in support of the proposed route. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Tanya Thomas, general manager of Santa Ana's MainPlace mall, 
said, "We believe that such a transportation system will have extreme economic 
and lifestyle benefits." And Kevin Owens, parking manager for the 
traffic-plagued Anaheim Arena, strongly endorsed the rail plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's largest single employer also weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Reeder, a spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co. in Fullerton, cited surveys 
that show rail is a preferred alternative to autos among its workers. And 
Reeder spoke of Hughes' recently announced $39-million contract to double the 
capacity of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system -- without new trains or 
right-of-way purchases -- through use of digital radio communications first 
developed for the military and used in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The new equipment can pinpoint each train's exact location, telling it how 
fast to go so the trains can run closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who was impressed with the 
presentation, Reeder agreed to return to OCTA soon with a special briefing on 
the technology.

USE OF TAX MONIES DISPUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest that the Board of Supervisors will direct the majority of 
Proposition 172 monies toward law enforcement agencies -- which is, of course, 
what we California voters wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the allocations made by our Board of Supervisors go strictly to 
county agencies; my concern is their denial of funds to city police 
departments. The cities that do not contract for police services with the 
county maintain their own police forces, and I feel some of the Proposition 172 
funds should be allocated to those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 When I voted in favor of the measure, I was voting for more police funding for 
all citizens of our county -- not just for citizens who live in unincorporated 
areas or who live in cities where the county sheriff provides contracted police 
services. I do not think I was alone in this appraisal of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Won't any Proposition 172 monies be allocated to my city's Police Department?

 The voters passed the half-cent sales tax in large part because of the October 
fires. Large areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties were burning. Our 
firefighters were working heroically to contain the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 And the TV commercials in favor of 172 were changed to show the work of the 
firefighters and the need to increase personnel and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney will get 
the bulk of the money. They need all the financial help they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 But not one dime is going to the Ventura County Fire Department. This is 
outrageous and fraudulent.

 As a member of the Citizens Advisory Board on the county Fire Department, I 
was deeply angered to read Supervisor John K. Flynn's comments about the 
citizens' panel being a "puppet of" and a "rubber stamp" for the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't recall seeing Supervisor Flynn at any of our meetings. If he had 
attended, he would see all members participating and having spirited debates 
over the issues concerning the Fire Department and its future. It has been 
clear that there are areas in which the Fire Department can improve its 
service, and the committee has been willing to make those recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Mr. Flynn has had a representative in attendance at all the meetings. 
If that is the case, then I am dismayed that the representative would describe 
the proceedings as "rubber-stamping" because that has clearly not been the 
case.

DEFENDING GROWTH

<TEXT>
<P>
 As an Oxnard Plain resident, I feel I must respond to the comments of Ken 
Shelton Jr. of Ojai (Letters, March 1). 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Shelton is proud of Ojai's effort to derail the Weldon Canyon landfill, 
while rebuking Oxnard for its pro-development policies.But he probably thinks 
nothing of his weekly trip to the end of the driveway to deposit 70 gallons of 
trash -- trash that will end up on the Oxnard Plain in the Bailard dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Servant Sisters of Mary will no doubt thank Ojai residents for their 
contribution (for Ojaians surely will say that their trash stinks sweeter than 
ours). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is true that Oxnard is a bit overzealous in its development of 
farmland, but the daily traffic jams along California 33 show how much Ojai 
depends on that development for its daily bread. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the radar tower on Sulphur Mountain, local residents probably get more 
radiation from the channeling crystals hanging around their necks than from the 
National Weather Service.

POOR MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It appears that the Ventura County Sheriff's Department is attempting to cover 
up poor management practices by punishing a pilot involved in the loss of a 
firefighting helicopter while being directed to use it to start a controlled 
burn. 
</P>
<P>
 If the department's chain of command functions with the lowest level employee 
bearing the ultimate responsibility and risk for the mistakes of those in 
charge, perhaps the grand jury should investigate the sheriff's management 
policies.

LEAVE TREES ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hope I am not the only one to protest vigorously the decision to replace the 
trees along Ventura's Main Street with palm trees, as well as to plant 
California Street with palms ("Committee Picks Items to Spruce Up Downtown," 
March 3). 
</P>
<P>
 The trees lining Main Street from Chestnut Street westerly are established, 
healthy and certainly help more than any palm tree to overcome air pollution. 
Thompson Boulevard is planted with a mixture of shade trees and various types 
of palms. All the palms are ratty looking; the shade trees are mostly in good 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members are probably not aware that about 20 years ago, there was 
also an assessment district to revitalize downtown. (It wasn't popular then, 
either.) One improvement was to replace all the street signs with the present 
drab brown ones. The wooden beams at the crosswalks were also put in at the 
same time as the street signs, as were the tiled planters. It sounds like an 
outrageous waste of money to replace street signs and the crosswalk beams when 
essentially there is nothing wrong with what is there. The faded beams can be 
re-stained. The crosswalks already have nicely tiled planters, although the 
plantings may leave something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is ever written about downtown Ventura without slighting remarks about 
the prevalence of thrift stores. Those who do the denigrating seem not to 
realize that the thrift stores are what bring shoppers downtown in the first 
place. If thrifts were driven out, what would replace them?

 Two men shot at a party in El Rio over the weekend remained hospitalized 
Monday, one in serious condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Carrillo, 22, of Santa Paula was in the intensive care unit of St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, a spokeswoman said.Sergio Martinez, 
19, of Oxnard was listed in good condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were shot about 11 p.m. Saturday during a birthday party in the 1000 
block of Salem Avenue. According to the Sheriff's Department, two men in a 
heated argument were wrestling over a semiautomatic handgun when shots were 
fired into a crowd, wounding Carrillo and Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a verbal argument and some shoving and then this thing occurred," 
Sheriff's Detective Raul Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived, most of the people at the party had scattered, Munoz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are trying to identify the two men who had the gun. No arrests 
had been made by late Monday. JULIE FIELDS

SCENIC STATUS IS AGAIN DENIED FOR STRETCH OF VENTURA FREEWAY; HIGHWAYS: 
THOUSAND OAKS AND TWO OTHER CITIES HAD SOUGHT RECOGNITION FOR DEVELOPED 
STRETCHES THAT RETAIN NATURAL CHARM. STATE SAYS NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in four years, state transportation officials have foiled 
efforts by Thousand Oaks and two other Conejo Valley cities seeking scenic 
vista status for a segment of freeway dotted with gas stations, shopping malls 
and occasional billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to honor the 16-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway, the cities of 
Thousand Oaks, Agoura Hills and Westlake Village had asked the state Department 
of Transportation to create a new "urban vista" category to recognize developed 
roadways that retain some of their natural charm. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had hoped that the views of the Santa Monica Mountains from the 
freeway segment, which winds through all three cities, would qualify it for 
scenic status under the proposed new category. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans Senior Transportation Planner Bill Felts said the agency's 
attorneys decided that a new state law would have to be enacted to create a 
category allowing for urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped to do this administratively," Felts said. "But it looks like 
it's not going to be that easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The cities pushed for creation of an urban vista category after a 1990 
application by Agoura Hills for scenic highway status was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that rejection and the new setback, Thousand Oaks City Councilman 
Frank Schillo said the cities will reapply for the existing scenic highway 
designation. He said the makeup of Caltrans' advisory committee on such matters 
has changed, improving the cities' prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a good chance because I don't know that there are that many 
scenic urban corridors," Schillo said. "There's a different kind of beauty here 
that we've worked hard to preserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, who also serves on the Ventura County Transportation Commission, said 
the scenic status would help the cities get state funds to remove billboards 
and maintain views, and would encourage other cities to keep their freeways 
free of clutter. 
</P>
<P>
 If the application fails, the cities will seek passage of a new law creating a 
special urban vista category, Schillo said.

A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE; SIMI VALLEY: COMMUNITY LEADERS SHADOW SCHOOL 
PRINCIPALS FOR THE DAY. MOST ARE SURPRISED BY WORKLOAD AND RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Simi Valley veterinarian Michael Gerardo never imagined how much work it takes 
these days to be a public school principal. Then he spent Monday shadowing the 
boss at Simi Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't even have time to go to the bathroom," Gerardo said after following 
Principal Barbara Patton for half a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I'm sorry, I never even showed you where it was," Patton quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen community and business leaders Monday fanned out to schools 
across Simi Valley to see firsthand what it's like to manage a staff, dole out 
praise and discipline to students, and efficiently handle unexpected problems 
that arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the "principals for a day" walked away surprised at the workload and 
responsibility level. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the three hours I've been here, the number of interpersonal situations 
she's gone through has exhausted me just watching," said Cindy Pandolfi, 
president of Med Center Medical Group, who spent the day at Sequoia Junior High 
School with Principal Jan Britz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very emotionally draining." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim King, executive director of the Simi Valley YMCA, received a few special 
gifts from students at Mountain View School who wanted to welcome the new guy. 
Sixth-grader Ricky Waldriff ran up to give King his offering during recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's new for a day, so I thought I'd draw him a picture," said Ricky, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serene setting to calm me down," King said as he admired Ricky's 
drawing of a sun setting behind a palm tree and reflecting off the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators hoped for a not-too-hectic but not-too-slow day for the third 
annual event, Assistant Supt. Susan Parks said. If it's too hectic, it can be 
overwhelming, and slow days are uncommon, Parks told the would-be principals at 
a debriefing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want you to go home and say, 'Oh, that's a piece of cake,' " Parks 
said. "The research is very convincing that you can have a good school without 
a fine, excellent principal, but you'll never have a great school without it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The principals for a day visited classrooms, supervised recess and sat in on 
conferences with parents whose children were having trouble at school. One 
watched as a police officer escorted two fifth-grade girls into Berylwood 
School after they were caught skipping school. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officer stood briskly at attention nearby for fullest effect, Berylwood 
Principal Dolores Pekrul gently scolded the girls, whom she described as 
normally good students who wandered off to deal with one girl's family 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what's going to come in your door," Pekrul said. "It could be 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Pekrul's shadow for the day, insurance consultant Ovedia Santos, said she had 
no idea how much a principal had to be prepared to handle at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not playing games here," Santos said. "They're here to educate 
children and get them out into the world to do the best they can." 
</P>
<P>
 But the principal did not only handle discipline, said Ken Kolz, a Simi Valley 
dentist who spent the day at Justin School. Principal Frank Chapman knew many 
students' names and interacted with many of them on a friendly basis, Kolz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed, because when I was in elementary school, the principal was 
one of those faraway people that you really didn't want to visit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the stand-in principals also noted the financial constraints limiting 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 King, whose experience overseeing the budget of the nonprofit YMCA made him 
sympathetic to the financial plight of schools, lamented the lack of money for 
new equipment from playground toys to computers. 
</P>
<P>
 When a sixth-grader at recess suggested to Principal Karyn Crytser that 
students should be considered to serve as principal for a day, King's 
fund-raising expertise kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each student could pay $5 for a lottery ticket and the winner gets to be 
principal for a day," King said excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd call summer vacation," responded Elizabeth Cormick, 12.

PALO COMADO TO FINALLY HAVE DEDICATION CEREMONY; PARKLAND: THE EVENT WILL 
OFFICIALLY MAKE PALO COMADO, OPEN TO PUBLIC SINCE OCTOBER, PART OF SANTA MONICA 
MOUNTAINS RECREATION AREA.

 The formal dedication of Palo Comado Canyon as part of the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area has been scheduled for April 2, six months 
after it was postponed because of wildfires sweeping across Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be several more months before the public will be provided picnic 
tables, restrooms and other amenities on the 2,308-acre property, known as 
Jordan Ranch when it was owned by entertainer Bob Hope, said Jean Bray, a 
spokeswoman for the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 She said park service officials plan to hold public meetings in late spring or 
early summer on proposed accommodations for the park. She noted, however, that 
picnic tables and restrooms are available in neighboring Cheesebr Canyon, part 
of the National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the agency is hoping to develop hiking trails as well as bike and 
equestrian paths using other access points, Bray said. But so far, only one 
entrance is open -- at the park service's Cheeseboro Canyon public parking 
area, she said. From there, it's more than a mile hike into Palo Comado Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy hiking," Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of amenities and easy access, 3,028 people hiked through Palo 
Comado Canyon during February, Bray said. The canyon has been open to the 
public since October. 
</P>
<P>
 For next month's dedication ceremony, visitors will be able to enter the 
canyon by way of Chesebro Road, Bray said. Visitors are advised to take Palo 
Comado Canyon Road north off the Ventura Freeway, turn right onto Chesebro Road 
and follow the signs to the parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten permission from homeowners to use the road for the dedication," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the featured guests at the ceremony will be Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) and Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, Gov. Pete Wilson's former planning director and now a 
Republican candidate who wants to replace Beilenson in Congress, will also 
attend as Wilson's official representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its significance as a recreation park, Palo Comado Canyon is 
considered crucial as a wildlife habitat and corridor. Bobcats, deer, mountain 
lions and dozens of other animals live among the rolling hills and rock 
outcroppings of the former cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very thrilled that it was saved," said Mary Weisbrock, president of 
the environmental group Save Open Space, which fought to block development in 
the canyon. She said several members of her group also plan to attend the 
dedication ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The park service purchased Palo Comado Canyon from Hope for $16.7 million in 
June. The purchase represents the single largest acquisition within the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park Service 
that is stitching together a network of mountain parks and trails in Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition pushes National Park Service holdings within the National 
Recreation Area to about 20,400 acres -- well on its way to its stated goal of 
35,000 acres.

DU-PAR'S TO MAKE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY HOME; DINING: GATHERING PLACE KNOWN FOR 
ITS PIE AND LOYAL PATRONS WILL RETURN AS PART OF THE THOUSAND OAKS INN, HOTEL 
OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Once the central gathering place of Thousand Oaks, a place for pie and 
friendly conversation, Du-par's Restaurant & Bakery plans to return to the city 
two years after the original restaurant was demolished to make way for a 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Thousand Oaks Inn -- the former Howard Johnson's near the old 
Du-par's -- said Monday that they have reached agreement with the diner chain 
to open a restaurant in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certain that there are people in Thousand Oaks who have missed Du-par's 
since it closed," said Jane Gorney, vice president of operations for BON 
Innkeeping Inc., the Westlake Village company that manages the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping there will be a return to the very steady following that they 
once had," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Du-par's Sherman Oaks office declined to comment on plans for the 
restaurant, but hotel officials said they expect Du-par's to duplicate the food 
and atmosphere that made it a popular fixture for 30 years at Moorpark Road and 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One local resident, who in 1991 gathered 1,000 signatures in a failed attempt 
to save the restaurant, said he is eager to see it return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it's only 50% of what the old Du-par's was, I think there will be a 
lot of people who will want to return to their old traditions," said Nick 
Renna, a retired electronics engineer who moved to Thousand Oaks in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not they can recapture what they once had remains to be seen," he 
said. "Everyone knew each other at Du-par's. It was a very comfortable place to 
gather." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renna said the restaurant was known for its pot pies and desserts but, more 
than anything, people gathered there to see friendly faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The diner, which many considered the central meeting place in the city, 
predated the city's incorporation by four years, according to Steve Rubenstein, 
executive director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the place that buses would stop to drop people off and pick them up," 
Rubenstein recalled. "People would stop in before a game of golf in the 
morning, or late at night after work. When they decided to demolish it, people 
were really disheartened because it was truly a city landmark." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1991, the Thousand Oaks City Council approved a $5.5-million, 
26,895-square-foot shopping center, which forced demolition of the diner at 33 
W. Thousand Oaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Du-par's officials expressed their desire to relocate in Thousand 
Oaks, but hotel officials said it was only a few weeks ago that they finally 
closed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we finally came to an agreement with them, we were thrilled," Gorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorney said the familiar name will help establish the Thousand Oaks Inn, which 
took over the Howard Johnson's at 75 W. Thousand Oaks Blvd. on Jan. 6. She said 
the diner is expected to open in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people who will really be looking forward to it," Renna said. 
"It would be nice for us to regain what we lost when they tore that place 
down."

 City officials said they have talked with the Mission Viejo Co. about trading 
city-owned land to the company to get a library.  
</P>
<P>
 For several months, the officials have been discussing swapping a 23-acre 
parcel for a 3-acre site belonging to the company, City Hall sources said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in value between the two parcels would be used to finance 
construction of a new library. 
</P>
<P>
 The land deal was discussed in a closed-session meeting of the council Monday. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the deal also could result in the construction of a 
civic center complex. The 3-acre site at La Paz Road and Marguerite Parkway 
sits next to a plot bought by the city two years ago that is earmarked for the 
proposed library.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Mission Viejo Co. would build a city hall and lease the 
building to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-acre parcel at Los Altos, of which six acres can be built upon, 
originally was Mission Viejo Co. property. Transferred to the city three years 
ago in exchange for development concessions, the land was the intended site for 
a city hall that was turned down by voters in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has made several other land trades since incorporating in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the city bought an office complex on Chrisanta Drive for $3.1 
million, also intending that it be a city hall.  
</P>
<P>
 The council eventually changed its mind about a two-story building and traded 
it to the Mission Viejo Co. 18 months ago for an existing four-building 
recreation center complex.  
</P>
<P>
 The city currently rents space in an office building on La Alameda for 
$388,000 per year.

POLICE REPORT 3 ARMED ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police reported three armed robberies over the past three days, one of them 
leaving a Santa Ana man critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man, Jose Ramos, 28, was stabbed about 2 a.m. Monday near Newport 
Pier, according to Sgt. Andy Gonis.He was stabbed two to three times in the 
upper torso and taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old juvenile and two men, all of Santa Ana, were arrested shortly 
after the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The two adult suspects were identified as Sylvester Diaz, 20, and Jose 
Jimenez, 18. Both are being held in Newport Beach City Jail on suspicion of 
attempted murder and armed robbery, with bail set at $250,000 each, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7 p.m. Sunday, a 36-year-old Newport Beach man walking on the beach near 
G Street was approached by two men with guns, authorities said. The man was 
forced to his nearby parked car to get his wallet. He turned over cash to the 
men, who fled by car. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:30 a.m. Saturday, a man making a withdrawal from a Wells Fargo ATM in the 
3200 block of Newport Boulevard was robbed at gunpoint by a man driving a faded 
red Datsun, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three robberies do not appear to be related, Gonis said.

<P>
 An electrical transformer blew out with a loud blast at the nuclear power 
plant here but caused no power interruptions, a Southern California Edison Co. 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformer, which was outside the protected area of the plant, caught 
fire about 1 p.m., said Joseph McDonough, an SCE spokesman.Oil inside the 
transformer caught fire and caused a thick plume of smoke, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no danger of any kind of leakage or radiation or any of that type 
of danger," McDonough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby beach users complained of hearing a loud explosion at the nuclear power 
plant, and then became worried after seeing black smoke rising from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was quickly put out by the company's on-site firefighters, McDonough 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no dollar estimate of damage.DAVID REYES

JIM MURRAY: '8 SECONDS' A DIFFERENT KIND OF COWBOY MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Hollywood heard that the teen-age heartthrob from the nighttime soap 
"Beverly Hills 90210," Luke Perry, was going to make a cowboy movie, they 
thought it would be the standard oater. 
</P>
<P>
 Luke would be packing a six-gun, riding a white horse, wearing a black hat and 
saving the fort from Geronimo or, given the temper of the times, Geronimo from 
the fort. Or, he'd be facing down the rustlers at high noon or cleaning out the 
Last Chance saloon or saving the noon stage.  
</P>
<P>
 There isn't a shot fired in "8 Seconds," the Luke Perry-starring vehicle, but 
it's as Western as sagebrush. It's about the last stand of cowboy culture in 
this country -- the rodeo. The most romantic era of American history is kept 
alive only through traveling ride-and-rope shows that remind wistfully of the 
time when great cattle herds roamed the prairie and the bunkhouse, not the 
sound stage, was the citadel of the riders of the range. 
</P>
<P>
 The title "8 seconds" refers to the time the rodeo cowboy has to stay aboard a 
bucking bull to score any points in a rodeo and the story is that of one of the 
legends of that sport, a young buckaroo named Lane Frost who died on the back 
of a bull in Cheyenne in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Young Frost grew up the son of a rodeo bareback rider in small-town Oklahoma 
and the movie chronicles his determined -- and ultimately fatal -- attempt to 
outdo his father on the tanbark of the re-creations of that old West of 
cowcatchers and bronc riders.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a sports story in sum. Billy the Kid might have been a bull rider -- or 
bulldogger -- if he'd been brought up in another era.  
</P>
<P>
 For Luke Perry, the part was a labor of love. Not that he was a rodeo fan, but 
he confesses that his earliest show business ambition was to be a stuntman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in Ohio as a boy, I not only used to think the stars did their own 
stunts, but I thought every movie was a documentary. Those things were not made 
up, they were really happening up there on screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a bull rider gave him a chance to fulfill part of his dream. He spent 
hours -- more than 30 -- riding horned, homicidal critters on a ranch in 
Northern California to prepare for the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of every ride in the picture, I rode," he says. "We found the script on 
the shelf. It had been bought, tried, but never got to the screen till we 
whipped it into shape." 
</P>
<P>
 His theatrical-release screen career up to then had consisted mostly of 
vampire flicks, but his TV popularity with Misses America prompted producers to 
lay other scripts before him. He chose "8 Seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Bull riding is a sport like no other. You know all you need to know about it 
when I tell you that you don't face a foe named Dick Butkus or Lawrence Taylor 
or even Ronnie Lott. Your foe is listed in the program as Homicide, Evil 
Intent, Murder One, The Widow Maker, and even Stalin, or Capital Punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a famous sports cartoon that shows a skinny, big-eyed fighter 
standing in a corner, looking over at a troglodyte in the other corner while 
his manager is saying to the referee, "My boy says he don't fight till he finds 
out precisely why they call him 'The Bushwick Assassin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeo cowboys would know where he was coming from. You spot a bull about an 
1,800-pound pull in the weights, to say nothing of horns and hoofs. You ride 
him one-handed. You wind your riding hand in a rope hold called a death wrap. 
Lane Frost's was so tight he frequently couldn't let go of the bull even after 
his ride was over.  
</P>
<P>
 Getting off a one-ton Brahma is a little like jumping off a truck speeding 
down the Grapevine with the brakes gone. When you get off, the bull frequently 
wants to make sure you never ride anything again. That's what happened to young 
Lane Frost.  
</P>
<P>
 These cowboys do it for a belt buckle and a little traveling money. There are 
no million-dollar contracts in rodeo. Michael Jordan might have taken an 
occasional elbow to the ribs, but he never had to worry about a horn to the 
eye.  
</P>
<P>
 Luke Perry, who might have chosen a drawing-room drama or a costume picture 
for his big screen debut, knew he was opting for controversy. Rodeo is the 
target for animal activists trying to make the world safe for the grizzly bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love animals," Perry protests. "How come I was a hero when I fought to be 
able to raise horses and hogs on my own (San Fernando Valley) farm and I'm a 
villain when I 'glorify' rodeo? I'm no spokesman for the sport, but when so 
many livelihoods depend on the well-being of animals, don't you think they will 
see to that well-being?" 
</P>
<P>
 The film might not appeal to all critics. But it will appeal to everyone who 
ever wore a 10-gallon hat, or wished they could wear one. It's not Kafka. It's 
not Victorian England. But it's a film about a sport that takes us back in time 
and place to where, as a narrator once had it, "Men were men and the women were 
glad of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If it has a theme, it is expressed when another champion cowboy, Tuff Hardeman 
-- played by Stephen Baldwin -- tells Lane Frost to quit whimpering and to 
"cowboy up." 
</P>
<P>
 This cool hand Luke is to be commended for attempting to recapture a part of 
Americana we can ill afford to be without.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT: A LOOK BACK; WOODEN'S WONDERS; SHORT 
UCLA TEAM DEFIED LOGIC BY GOING UNBEATEN IN 1963-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blue and gold banner from UCLA's first NCAA basketball championship hangs 
in the northwest corner of Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in good company. Nine others, each representing a championship, surround 
it. But they are all different from the 1963-64 banner, mainly because you can 
only be first once. 
</P>
<P>
 So on the 30th anniversary of the first of UCLA's 10 national basketball 
championships, here are the reasons it happened: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-hundred-fifty-pound Fred Slaughter, who was 6 feet 5 standing up or lying 
down, said he was particularly effective against the player throwing the ball 
inbounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who could see past me?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was a defense so smothering it could suck the air right out of a gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hirsch was the designated hit man on defense and he possessed an uncanny 
ability to knock away passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keith Erickson: "After all, his arms hung down to his ankles." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was Coach John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Walt Hazzard: "Everybody talks about that rolled-up program, that smile, 
what a nice man. Yeah, right. On the practice court, he was a tyrant." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was Erickson, the last man in the press, who stole so often he could 
have transferred from UCLA to Folsom. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden said that without Erickson, the Bruins never would have won. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Erickson: "I'm glad he never told me that or I probably would have 
fainted." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the backcourt combination of Hazzard and Gail Goodrich, one of the 
best in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wooden: "Possibly the best passing guard and the best scoring guard we've 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was because nobody expected them to. 
</P>
<P>
 No starter was taller than 6-5 and there was no way a team that needed booster 
seats in restaurants could win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Slaughter: "We were the unknown midgets from Westwood. People said all we 
thought about were surfboards, beaches and Playboy bunnies." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, all UCLA thought about was winning games. It has been three decades 
since the first UCLA basketball championship, when the Bruins surprised 
everyone but themselves with a 30-0 season and a 98-83 romp over Duke in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget a couple of their players saying, 'Hey, can you guys slow 
down?' " Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins couldn't. They ran a fast break straight into UCLA history as the 
team that put the Bruins on the map, changed college basketball forever and 
started a run of 10 NCAA titles in 12 years. It is a streak of success that the 
sport never has seen the like of, before or since. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden had coached at UCLA for 15 years and would coach for 11 more, but said 
he never will forget the time he spent on the bench during the 1963-64 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be the most gratifying of my championships for more than one reason," 
he said. "It was my first, it was undefeated and it was my shortest team to 
ever win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also one of his loneliest. This was before Pauley Pavilion was 
completed, in June of 1965, so UCLA had no real home court. The Bruins played 
13 games at the Sports Arena, two at the Long Beach Arena and two at Santa 
Monica City College. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA practiced at the old men's gym, sharing the floor with the wrestling team 
and gymnasts' trampolines. There were no private locker room, private coaches' 
room or private showers. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the court, the players had to climb three flights of stairs, which, 
although annoying, was aerobic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ended up in pretty good shape," Hazzard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win a championship under these conditions, well, before we did it, I 
thought our chances were impossible," Wooden said. "So I consider that first 
championship more improbable than any of these others." 
</P>
<P>
 The players, though, thought that a championship wasn't all that improbable. 
THIS ISN'T KANSAS 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was from Topeka, Fred Slaughter might well have gone to the Kansas 
or even Kansas State. But he didn't. He wanted to go to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed some heat on my buns," Slaughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The top basketball player in the state, Slaughter, despite his weight, was 
also a star sprinter. He wrote a letter to Wooden, because Wooden didn't 
recruit out of state, and asked about joining the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter always battled a weight problem, but he was strong and quick, a 
one-man front line in UCLA's full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our secret was our quickness and speed and we understood our roles," said 
Slaughter, a player agent and the attorney representing the NBA officials. "Our 
full-court press killed teams. It was one of the greatest things that John 
Wooden did. We would run people to death." 
</P>
<P>
 The press was actually assistant coach Jerry Norman's idea and Wooden 
implemented it as a full-time weapon for the 1963-64 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been kicking myself ever since that I didn't use it earlier," Wooden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter was a busy player that season. In Game 6, he went up against 
All-American center Paul Silas of Creighton. Silas had 20 points and 33 
rebounds, but UCLA won by 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the people I played against, the two guys I had the most trouble with 
were Paul Silas and Bill Buntin of Michigan," Slaughter said. "Mel Counts was 
no problem. He was taller, but not stronger. I had problems with the guys who 
were taller than me, and thick." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody else had trouble with UCLA's press. The Bruins were 11-0 after 
beating Washington State, 121-77, setting a school scoring record, breaking the 
previous mark of 113 set in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the half against Washington State, UCLA got five consecutive 
steals before the Cougars could cross midcourt and scored on them all. 
</P>
<P>
 After the next voting, UCLA was No. 1 in both national polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaughter explained the Bruin press: "There I was, waving, and Keith was back 
there picking off passes and Gail was sneaking around and stealing it and we 
killed them." THE NATURAL 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Erickson of El Segundo High spent one year at El Camino College, then 
went to UCLA on a half-basketball, half-baseball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Erickson could play just about any game -- basketball, baseball, tennis, 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the finest all-around athlete I've ever been associated with," Hazzard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, who does television commentary on Phoenix Suns' home games, said he 
was just happy to be at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no great dreams of going to UCLA," he said. "It was the only school 
that offered me a scholarship. I never even had seen a UCLA basketball game 
until I played in one, so I guess I was part of history without ever thinking 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you thought about the UCLA press, you thought about Erickson. His job 
was to stop a layup if anyone got past midcourt. He usually was outnumbered. He 
usually won anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA defeated Stanford, 100-88, to go 22-0, Erickson came up with three 
steals in an 18-3 stretch that put UCLA, which had trailed at the half, 
comfortably ahead, 77-65. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next game, Erickson scored 21 points, 12 more than his average, in a 
78-64 victory over Washington that clinched UCLA's third consecutive Big Six 
title. It was Wooden's ninth title, including old Southern Division Pacific 
Coast Conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the press, not the points, is Erickson's legacy of that team 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened so fast, other teams couldn't even call a timeout," he said. 
"We'd just give you the rat-a-tat and you couldn't breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it was 30 years ago. I still feel like in my mind that I'm 26 
. . . my body feels like I'm 80." THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Nuys High, Jack Hirsch was the City player of the year as a center. He 
was 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden quickly assessed Hirsch's value as a defensive stopper at UCLA and 
assigned him to the other team's top player. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 8 of the 1963-64 season, Hirsch's task was to defend a Michigan 
sophomore named Cazzie Russell. It was a matchup of 7-0 teams, the third-ranked 
Wolverines and fourth-ranked Bruins in the L.A. Classic at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA won in a breeze, 98-80, and Hirsch was the star. He had 15 rebounds, 
scored 16 points and held Russell to 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could defend," Hirsch said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard, who was Hirsch's roommate, called him the most underrated player in 
the country. But Hirsch said he didn't think too much about that kind of 
appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in there," he said. "I was just playing." 
</P>
<P>
 He played with those long arms, described by Erickson, as well as a sort of 
simmering malevolence that sometimes caused him trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 18 at California, for instance, Goodrich scored 26 points and UCLA 
rolled up the most points for an opponent in Harmon Gym in 32 years. But when 
Hirsch complained to referee Tom Ross about a call, he was ejected. Erickson, 
who had also complained but wasn't tossed, explained:  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a baby face. Jack looked like a gangster." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch played like a gangster in the full-court press. He had decided after 
the Bruins lost to Arizona State in the West Regional semifinals in 1963 that 
he didn't like losing, so he would do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ever want to lose again," said Hirsch, a marshal at PGA West in La 
Quinta. "We had other guys who felt the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 As the years have gone by, Hirsch has become the least-known member of the 
starting five from 1963-64, but it's nothing he isn't used to.  
</P>
<P>
 "Once the ball went to Gail and Walt, it was all over," he said. "But it was 
in pretty good hands with those two characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch still wears his 1964 NCAA championship watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never forget," he said. "You don't understand the (scope) of it until 
later," he said. LEFTY 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Goodrich put a basketball into the hands of his infant son, also Gail, in 
the crib. The captain of USC's Southern Division co-champions in 1939, the 
elder Goodrich saw Gail go cross-town to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail, a slender left-hander, led Poly High to the City championship and was 
player of the year. It got better. Goodrich's UCLA freshman team was unbeaten. 
Then, as a sophomore, Goodrich handed the Bruins' play-making job to Hazzard, 
at Wooden's request, and all UCLA's pieces for a championship were in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich led the Big Six in scoring in 1963-64, averaging 21.7 points a game, 
but he was UCLA's key point-producer all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 27 was the Bruins against Seattle in the first game of the West Regional 
at Corvallis, Ore. Bob Boyd's Seattle team, led by John Tresvant, was 21-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins led, 81-80, with five minutes to play when Goodrich gave them some 
breathing room. He assisted Kenny Washington on a layup and a three-point play, 
then stole a pass and scored on a layup for a six-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA pulled out a 95-90 victory with Erickson, Hirsch and Slaughter on the 
bench with five fouls. Said Slaughter: "We just decided we wanted to give the 
fans their money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich, a senior vice president of acquisitions for American Golf 
Corporation in Greenwich, Conn., said UCLA set a pattern for successful teams.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you looked at that team, how we played was very characteristic of how 
successful teams play, even today," he said. "Team play, quickness, pressure. 
When I look back, I think that team played together better than any team I ever 
played on and I played on a Laker team that won 33 straight games. We were the 
underdog, basically the whole year, even when we played Duke in the 
championship game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils featured Jeff Mullins and Jack Marin and arrived in Kansas 
City for the semifinals riding a blue streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins scored 43 points against Villanova in the fist game of the regional 
and 30 in a 101-54 wipeout of Connecticut in the East final at Raleigh, N.C. 
Although Cazzie Russell had 31 points, Duke beat Michigan by 11 in the first 
game of the national semifinals and Mullins had 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Blue Devils were no match for the Bruins. UCLA outscored Duke, 16-0, 
in a stretch of 2:33 in the first half, and led by 20 at the half. "That was 
characteristic," Goodrich said. "It looked like we were just trading baskets, 
then boom-boom-boom. Knowing we were capable of that, we played with a great 
deal of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 With Washington playing a key role off the bench -- 26 points and 11 rebounds 
-- the Bruins coasted in, 98-83, bagging both the title and an NCAA tournament 
single-game scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodrich finished with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look back when I was a kid, I grew up watching the NCAA tournament," he 
said. "Then to really achieve it yourself, well, it's just indescribable." THE 
FIRST TIME FOR 'SHOWTIME' 
</P>
<P>
 On the asphalt playgrounds of Philadelphia, Walt Hazzard learned the tricks of 
the basketball trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard brought to UCLA a style that was as suited to Hollywood as Westwood. 
The dribbles were behind the back and through the legs. The passes were bounce, 
one-handed, two-handed, look and no-look. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that stuff, Walt did," said Erickson. "He was the first one who brought 
'Showtime' to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem was, no one knew what to name it until Magic Johnson came to 
the Lakers 15 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard was UCLA's leader 30 years ago and not just because of his basketball 
skills, which were plentiful. Hazzard was a leader through sheer willpower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really believed a team with our size was capable of going all the 
way," he said. "I did. It's not how big you are, it's how big you play. We were 
not big in stature, but boy, we played big. The people we had on our team were 
not going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard, assistant vice chancellor for student affairs at UCLA, never 
experienced wavering confidence.  
</P>
<P>
 After Game 14, an 84-71 victory over Stanford, Hazzard said: "Somewhere, 
sometime, we know our pressure will get 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ominous warning to opponents. After Game 26, a 91-81 victory over 
USC before 14,553 at the Sports Arena, Hazzard said: "We're still hungry for 
the big party." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard backed up everything he said. He scored 26 points against Seattle in 
the first game of the West regional and 23 in the regional final, a 76-72 
victory over a San Francisco team led by Ollie Johnson and Erwin Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had 53 rebounds and Erickson scored 28 points in UCLA's 90-84 
victory over Kansas State in the first semifinal at Kansas City, but it was 
Hazzard who put the punctuation mark on the victory over Duke when he was asked 
to comment after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't run with us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard counts UCLA's first basketball championship as his No. 1 
accomplishment as a player. "I still have good memories about that season," he 
said. "It started the beginning of an era. It set a precedent for UCLA 
basketball and established a style of play. And that's a great deal to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, March 21, 1964, a crowd estimated at 1,800 braved a downpour and 
drove to LAX to meet the UCLA players when they arrived on their flight from 
Kansas City just before 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The door to the plane opened and the players walked into the terminal with 
Hazzard carrying the NCAA trophy. He presented it to the UCLA chancellor, 
Franklin Murphy. It was Hazzard's last assist of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The final Associated Press poll showed UCLA No. 1. The only other times UCLA 
had finished in the top 10 were in 1950 as No. 7 and in 1956 as No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was different. UCLA was No. 1 -- in the polls and on the court. For 
the Bruins, it was the beginning of an era and neither UCLA nor college 
basketball would ever be the same.

BASEBALL / SPRING TRAINING; STEP BACK!; ANGELS' BUTCHER USES FEAR TO KEEP FOES 
ON THEIR TOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was 11 at the time, and absolutely terrified his father was making him do 
this. Please, let him keep playing third base, he cried. Don't make him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, what if I hit somebody," he said. "I don't want to hurt anybody. I can't 
do it, I just can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Butcher refused to listen, ordering his son to the mound and giving him 
advice that would forever change his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son, if you hit somebody," Bob Butcher said, "just go ahead and hit the next 
batter, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy went out and hit the first batter in the thigh. He plunked the next 
kid in the ankle. The third one started crying in anticipation of getting hit. 
</P>
<P>
 A legend was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher no longer is terrorizing the kids in the East Moline (Ill.) Youth 
League, but as a closer in the Angels' bullpen, the hitters in the American 
League will tell you that little has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would New York Yankee pitcher Jim Abbott telephone the Angels' 
clubhouse last season, asking Butcher if he intentionally was throwing at 
teammate Paul O'Neill? 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would Butcher be ejected from a game last June for throwing a 
curveball over the head of Oakland outfielder Dave Henderson? 
</P>
<P>
 Why else would Yankee slugger Danny Tartabull still be looking for his first 
career hit against Butcher in six at-bats? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'll be honest," Tartabull said, "I hate facing the guy. He just makes 
you feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know if his next pitch is coming under your chin or over the 
plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bob Butcher: "I'd be a liar if I thought he'd ever make it as a major 
league pitcher, but there was never a doubt in my mind that he would be one 
tough SOB." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, 6 feet 1, 200 pounds, was never considered one of the most gifted 
athletes in his hometown, but his reputation quickly spread. He was the center 
on his United Township High football team and inside linebacker on defense. He 
played every minute of every game, until the referees occasionally intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the game against Quincy his junior season when he was ejected for 
chasing an opposing player down the field long after the play was over. "I got 
clipped," Butcher said, "so I got mad." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the game his senior season against Moline when he challenged the 
entire team to a fight. "Maybe I got a little carried away in that one," he 
said, "but they were our big rivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bob Butcher: "It got to be a little embarrassing. He wasn't always 
blatant about it, but he was sneaky. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be a pile-up on the field, and all of a sudden, you'd see this 
hand making into a fist, and going in and out of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd go, 'Oh-oh, there's Mike.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike: "I never got the impression that it really bothered my dad. I mean, 
he's a retired cop. Now, my mom, that was a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was, 'Now, Mike, you should really calm down. You're too old to be doing 
this kind of stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it's this same unabashed aggressiveness that has enabled Butcher to emerge 
this spring as a candidate to become the Angels' primary stopper. He won't 
dazzle anyone with his array of pitches, but he has the ability to intimidate 
some of the game's finest hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to watch what he does to guys," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina 
said. "He's got this mean streak. I mean, we know he's not going to 
intentionally throw at somebody's head, but they don't know that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just watch them stand up there with their knees knocking together." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "Believe me, no one digs in at the plate on 
Butch. If you do, he'll stick it in your neck. It has nothing to do with being 
a bean-baller, but everything to do with intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Drysale, (Juan) Marichal, (Sandy) Koufax, they all had that quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher's aggression certainly has not always been beneficial to his career. 
He was released in 1988 by the Kansas City Royals organization for being 
disrespectful to his double-A manager. A couple of years later, he punched an 
opposing manager in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Lubratich, who was managing double-A Wichita, remembers screaming at 
Butcher for knocking down first baseman Guillermo Velasquez on a brushback 
pitch. He tries not to remember the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled, 'If you got something to say to me, come out and say it,' " Butcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he got on the field, I popped him one. You know something, that 
started a pretty good brawl." 
</P>
<P>
 This same guy who was without a college scholarship until he thumbed through a 
phone directory and called North Eastern Oklahoma Junior College, now believes 
he will be the Angels' everyday closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher won't promise to erase the memories of Bryan Harvey, but after 
spending this past winter in Phoenix to rehabilitate his right elbow, he 
believes that he is the man for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked my (rear) off all winter to get this job," Butcher said, "and I'm 
taking the job. I'm telling everybody I'm going to be the closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be cocky, but I'm taking it, and nobody's going to stand in 
my way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never wanted anything so bad in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who love Butcher's temperament but still are not sure his arm can 
stand the rigor of an entire season, nearly denied Butcher his opportunity. 
They made a multiyear offer to free-agent reliever Gregg Olson, only to be 
spurned in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Butcher looks at it, the Angels merely saved themselves a lot of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have blamed them if they got him," said Butcher, 27, "because he's 
a premier closer. But I wouldn't have been scared competing against him. Hey, I 
would have enjoyed the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never backed away from anything in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this self-confidence that sets him apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love standing on the mound," Butcher said, "looking into a hitter's eyes, 
and see that he's uncomfortable. I can look into his eyes when he gets into 
that box, and know right away whether I have him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest feeling in the world to have the game on the line, being 
out on the mound, and having that ball in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're giving him that crazed look. You've got a scared batter. And it's your 
game to win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, man, that's living."

BASEBALL / SPRING TRAINING; IN ASTRO BLUE; COLLINS, A FORMER MEMBER OF DODGER 
FAMILY, IS ON OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is perceived as animated and aggressive, the antithesis of Art Howe, his 
laid-back predecessor as manager of the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new life," pitcher Pete Harnisch said of the environment under 
Manager Terry Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took only four or five days to see that the atmosphere is entirely 
different. I think that, personnel-wise, we were ready to get over the hump, 
and the manager has put a new energy behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change is refreshing. We expect to win now. I'm not saying we'll win the 
division, but we know we'll win a lot of games. Before, it was, 'Can we win? 
Will we win? Are we good enough to reach .500?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred? Terry Lee Collins will say that the Astros, out from under the 
domination by the Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants in the National 
League West, can win the title in the realigned Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 At 44, he is managing for the first time in the majors and said he welcomes 
the pressure of those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes to the job after two years on Jim Leyland's staff with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, three managing the Pirates' triple-A Buffalo farm team, eight managing 
in the Dodger system, including 5 1/2 at triple-A Albuquerque, and 10 as a 
minor-league infielder. 
</P>
<P>
 His energy, General Manager Bob Watson said, was evident from the start of his 
first Houston interview, and he ultimately beat out 75 or so candidates, among 
them Bob Boone and Davey Lopes, in a down-to-the-wire final. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first to receive calls from Collins were his former mentors from the 
Dodger organization: Bill Schweppe and Ben Wade, the former farm and scouting 
directors; Guy Wellman, a longtime scout and minor-league instructor, and Monte 
Basgall, a former coach and infield instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins didn't call Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda didn't call Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs has been a strained relationship since Collins, in print, questioned 
Lasorda's use of the system's minor-league players while managing Albuquerque 
in 1987 and Lasorda reacted angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins promptly called Lasorda to apologize, but they have not talked since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm not sure Tommy ever liked me that much anyway," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lasorda: "I wish him well. He's a nice young man. It's in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Really? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, he has a right to his opinion, but he hurt me," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel it was warranted or the truth. I have six rookies of the year 
under my belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've obviously given some young players the chance. There's not many managers 
who can say they've had six rookies of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had recently gone outside the system to sign Phil Garner and Enos 
Cabell. Lasorda was asked about it by USA Today and said there was no one in 
their minor-league system to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins responded with two quotes deep in an article written for The Times by 
Marty Esquivel of the Albuquerque Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his opinion," he said of Lasorda. "Unless they give their players a 
chance, no one knows if they can help out." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "Sometimes I think what Tom Lasorda is doing is wrong. But that's his 
decision, and he's going to have to live with it. He's going to have to pay the 
consequences, good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Collins the other day: "I was trying to protect my players and thought we 
had some who could help him. I should have said, 'Tommy's the major league 
manager, and that's his opinion.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I made him look bad, and that wasn't my intent. I was shocked when I saw how 
the quotes were used and called him to apologize, but he was rightfully upset. 
It was my fault. I recognize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins recognized one other thing. The hopes he had of moving up with the 
Dodgers, of joining the varsity coaching staff one day or being recognized as 
one of Lasorda's guys in the way that Bill Russell or Joe Ferguson is, or even 
being considered a possible successor to Lasorda, "were pretty much nil after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh called at the end of the 1988 season to offer the Buffalo job, a 
chance to coordinate the organization's baserunning drills in spring training 
and the opportunity to join the varsity in September and study under Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been at Albuquerque for 5 1/2 years at that point and had to ask myself 
how long could I stay, where was the opportunity to advance?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the Pittsburgh offer because it was the best thing for Terry Collins, 
not because I was forced to take it by the Dodgers. It turned out to be the 
best move I've ever made." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins cited the chance to manage in Buffalo, where the atmosphere and 
attendance approximate those of the major leagues, the ensuing coaching job 
under Leyland and the recognition that led to the Houston opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that none of it would have happened without the initial 
opportunities and support he got from the Dodgers. He hopes to instill the 
Astros with the same pride of organization he experienced with the Dodgers and, 
despite differences with Lasorda, he comes to the Astros as part Lasorda and 
part Leyland in that he recognizes the need for a positive approach and 
communicative skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Pirate executive Syd Thrift nominated Collins for the Astro job, but he 
was also recommended by Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president and 
one of many with whom Watson talked in Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Albuquerque and 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred said he felt Terry's time had come, that he was a winner, highly 
organized and very positive," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the one negative was that he and Tommy didn't get along, but that he 
didn't view that as Terry's fault. He said Terry made a statement any triple-A 
manager would make protecting his players and he considered Terry an 
organization man who understood the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 New Astro owner Drayton McLane's motto is "Keep charging!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is always there," Collins said. "I was hired to win. People 
expect a lot from us, and it's my job to get it done. That's one of the things 
that drives me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear whether McLane or Watson made the final call on Collins, but it 
was the owner who cleaned house after the 85-77 finish of last season, firing 
Howe and General Manager Bill Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Both paid for the collapse of McLane's $36-million investment in hometown free 
agents Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell, who were a combined 21-31.  
</P>
<P>
 If both rebound as part of a rotation that includes Harnisch and Darryl Kile, 
if Mitch Williams recovers his 43-save form of the regular season rather than 
his incendiary style of the playoffs, if the Astros can find a right fielder to 
join a talented lineup of Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell, Andujar Cedeno, Ken 
Caminiti, Luis Gonzalez and Steve Finley, well . . . "The core of the club is 
composed of guys who have been up for three or four years now," Collins said. 
"It's time for them to take the next step, and it's my job to instill some 
aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot different than Art Howe, no question about it, but it starts with 
the players, and we have some very good players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new division will be very competitive, but we have a legitimate chance to 
win it. Getting away from the two teams with the best records in baseball (the 
Braves and Giants) changes the outlook on what you think you can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be foolish for me to say otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have to do it, but the players seem to sense the energy that 
Watson did when he first interviewed Collins and which, Watson thinks, will 
stimulate the Astros "to be the intimidators and not the intimidated. That's 
how we want to go about our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Swindell: "We needed a complete turnaround. We needed a fire lit under 
us. That's why (Collins) is here." 
</P>
<P>
 And Collins was going to be managing somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to stay in baseball until somebody told me I couldn't," he said. 
"I wasn't a big name. I knew I had to pay my dues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 20 years in the minors, but it wasn't like I beat around (Class) A 
leagues all that time. I spent nine years (as a player and manager) in 
Albuquerque and three in Buffalo. I was in some pretty good spots." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins has been known to pierce clubhouse walls when he raises his voice in 
anger, and his wife, Linda, recently told Houston reporters that the best thing 
about all those years in the minors was "watching him fight with umpires, 
because he gets so animated." 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros are hoping to see some of the same. They think it has been a 
missing ingredient. Will Collins save it for one team or another? 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to make the Astros as successful as possible," he said. "I want to 
beat Jim Leyland and the Pirates as much as I want to beat Tom Lasorda and the 
Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference being that he and Leyland are apt to sit and chat about it 
later.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Ward, the Heisman Trophy winner from Florida State, won the Sullivan 
Award on Monday night as the nation's outstanding amateur athlete for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback is the first football player to win the Sullivan since Army 
teammates Doc Blanchard in 1945 and Arnold Tucker in 1946.Ward and Blanchard 
are the only ones to win both the Heisman and the Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this is different than the Heisman," Ward said. "I kind of knew what 
was going to happen there, but tonight was a big surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward led Florida State to its first national championship last fall and was 
the most valuable player in the Seminoles' 18-16 Orange Bowl victory over 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 The other nine finalists were wrestler Bruce Baumgartner, gymnast Shannon 
Miller, figure skater Brian Boitano, sprinter Gail Devers, basketball players 
Sheryl Swoopes and Bobby Hurley, speedskater Dan Jansen, decathlete Dan 
O'Brien, and swimmer Jenny Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sullivan winner is chosen each year in a vote by more than 2,000, 
including members of the Amateur Athletics Union, the U.S. Olympic Committee, 
past Sullivan winners and selected news media.

<P>
 The coaching turnover at UCLA continued Monday with the announcement that Bill 
Rees, the Bruin recruiting coordinator, would leave Westwood after 15 seasons 
to become an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA hired Mike Sherman, most recently on the staff at Texas A&M, as an 
assistant and placed him in charge of the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees is the fourth full-time assistant to leave UCLA since the 1993 season, 
joining offensive coordinator Homer Smith, offensive line coach Bob Palcic and 
receivers coach Rick Neuheisel in new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman rejoins offensive coordinator Bob Toledo, with whom he worked at Texas 
A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees had overseen recruiting of more than 90 prep All-Americans and more than 
30 of his recruits played in the NFL last season. JIM HODGES

THE TIMES 1994 WINTER ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; CALVARY CHAPEL OWES SUCCESS TO VALDEZ 
BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They form the cornerstone of Calvary Chapel wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in and got the ball rolling at Calvary," Coach John Azevedo said of 
senior twins Shane and Dane Valdez. "They've helped raise the interest level to 
what it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is considerable. When wrestling was still a glint in the Eagles' eye, 
the Valdez brothers joined forces with Azevedo to help create a wrestling 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In their tenure at the small school, Calvary Chapel has won back-to-back State 
championships, something no other Orange County school has done. For their 
contributions, the Valdez brothers are The Times Orange County's 1994 wrestlers 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their credentials include two State team titles, two individual State crowns, 
four Southern Section championships, three individual Masters' triumphs and 
more recently, national recognition and ranking. The four-year letter winners 
together posted a 369-30 record -- Shane was 201-8, Dane was 168-22. 
</P>
<P>
 They have won dozens of tournament titles together, but their individual 
triumphs at Masters' this year marked the first time they won a "major" 
tournament together. Dane won his second consecutive meet title. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top-seeded wrestlers in their classes, they looked forward to becoming 
the first brother duo to win State titles since Merced High's Adam and Dan 
Cuestas did it in 1977. But Dane was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shane's third trip to the final, he won the 119-pound class in a 5-4 
decision. Dane, the defending champion at 119 and the heavy favorite at 125 
pounds, was upset in the semifinals and finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel dominated the State meet to the point that the Eagles had the 
championship wrapped up before the final round began. They scored a 
State-record 121.5 points. Runner-up Moreno Valley Canyon Springs had 81.5 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Valdez brothers are close friends -- Azevedo said you don't have 
to ask if one is accompanying the other on a ski trip, for example -- they are 
anything but joined at the hip, especially when it comes to their wrestling 
styles. Shane is shifty; Dane uses stare-down tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shane moves more, Dane likes to stalk his opponents," said Azevedo, who was 
named the national high school wrestling coach of the year by U.S. Wrestling.

GE CAPITAL OFFERS $2.2 BILLION FOR KEMPER CORP.; FINANCE: BOARD OF TAKEOVER 
TARGET OPPOSES BID. ITS ASSETS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT HOLDINGS IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucking a clear signal that its advances are unwelcome, a General Electric 
Corp. unit said Monday that it has made a $2.2-billion unsolicited offer for 
Kemper Corp., a giant Illinois-based financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital said it might boost its $55-per-share offer after it obtains more 
information about the real estate holdings of Kemper, a major player in the 
insurance, mutual fund and brokerage businesses. Kemper's assets include the 
Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, now part of Kemper 
Securities, and a significant share of its real estate holdings are in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 GE said it decided to make the offer public after failing to win support from 
Kemper's board in private talks over the last several weeks. Bruce Bunch, a GE 
spokesman, declined to say if GE would consider a hostile bid if Kemper's board 
continues to reject the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are focusing our efforts on making it happen by dealing with the board," 
Bunch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper issued no immediate comment. But a March 4 letter from Kemper Chairman 
David B. Mathis to GE Chairman John F. Welch, made public by GE, said Kemper 
firmly opposed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly believe that a sale of the company at this time is not in the 
best interests of our stockholders," Mathis' letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer for all of Kemper's stock was announced after the markets closed. In 
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kemper closed at $40.875. But 
in after-hours trading, Kemper shares rocketed $16.125 to $57. GE closed at 
$105.25, unchanged, and stayed at that price in the after-hours market. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said GE mainly was attracted to Kemper's mutual fund business. In 
addition, Bunch said GE believes it could profitably manage the considerable 
real estate holdings owned by Kemper's life insurance unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great deal of experience managing real estate assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement appeared to quell longstanding speculation that GE was 
considering the sale of its own Wall Street investment bank, Kidder Peabody & 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch declined to say how Kidder and Kemper's brokerage operations might be 
combined. Kemper Securities is primarily a retail brokerage operation, 
emphasizing sales to individual investors and small companies, while Kidder has 
a large corporate finance and investment banking operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Monday to Mathis, Gary C. Wendt, chairman and chief executive of 
GE Capital Services, said, "We believe that there are clear and compelling 
advantages from the combination of our two companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin Long, a brokerage industry analyst with First of Michigan Corp., said 
the offer shows that GE Capital, in conjunction with Kidder, "wants to move 
more aggressively into the asset management and retail side of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Long said Kemper's strong retail presence in strategic markets such as 
Southern California, Chicago and Cleveland could be a big boost for Kidder. The 
Long Grove, Ill.-based firm had put its securities subsidiary up for sale last 
June but took it off the block after failing to receive what it considered 
suitable offers. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Kemper exited the property and casualty insurance business, 
completing the sale of its Federal Kemper Insurance unit for $100 million to 
Anthem P&C Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper reported net income for 1993 of $87.5 million, or $2.47 a share, 
including discontinued operations, contrasted with a net loss for 1992 of 
$198.2 million, or $4.02 per share.

8 PLEAD GUILTY, 5 INDICTED IN HONDA MOTOR FRAUD CASE; LITIGATION: FORMER 
EXECUTIVES OF FIRM'S U.S. DIVISION ALLEGEDLY TOOK BRIBES FROM WOULD-BE DEALERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal prosecutors Monday announced indictments against five former 
executives of Torrance-based American Honda Motor Co. and said eight others 
have pleaded guilty to charges stemming from alleged preferential treatment in 
awarding car dealerships and allocating certain popular Honda models to 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael J. Connolly in Concord, N.H., said Monday that 
the charges stemmed from activities that occurred between 1979 and 1992. The 
individuals face charges ranging from fraud and bribery to racketeering and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the former Honda executives were accused of taking an estimated $10 
million in bribes, including payments of between $100,000 and $750,000, from 
people seeking new Honda and Acura dealerships. The indictment also alleges 
that some of the executives took cash and expensive gifts from dealers in 
return for increasing allotments of the most popular Honda and Acura models. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 13 executives face up to 35 years in prison on fraud-related 
charges, Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal charges and guilty pleas -- entered in recent months -- followed 
a yearlong federal investigation sparked by a 1991 civil lawsuit in which a New 
Hampshire dealer alleged that the company failed to deliver his allocation of 
Acuras. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation subsequently spread to dealers in 26 states, including 
California, Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda executives are cooperating with investigators, federal 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is "outraged and saddened . . . (because the) criminal activities 
. . . represent a betrayal of trust that harmed the company and defrauded 
American Honda of millions of dollars," American Honda Executive Vice President 
Thomas Elliott said Monday in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal investigation by Honda uncovered some schemes designed to defraud 
the company, Elliott said, but the incidents were viewed as "isolated 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
 The five executives charged Monday include former Senior Vice President 
Stanley James Cardiges of Laguna Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said agents with warrants to seize furniture, gifts and records 
arrested Cardiges on Friday at his home.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the eight who pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy are Robert 
N. Rivers of Irvine; Mark L. Benson of Corona del Mar; Thomas A. Caulfield and 
Robert A. Mazzitelli, both of Foothill Ranch, and Edward A. Temple of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictments, Cardiges and Dennis R. Josleyn of Penn Valley, 
Calif., diverted as much as $3 million in advertising and sales training funds 
to their own pockets. Investigators also allege that executives accepted Rolex 
wristwatches, $1,000 business suits, furniture and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly would not say whether the federal investigation will be broadened to 
include other automobile companies. "Since it's an ongoing investigation, I 
can't tell you whether or not it will eventually expand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott of American Honda said the company, a subsidiary of Japan's Honda 
Motor Co., will take "aggressive legal action" against those who are found to 
have defrauded the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda is also developing a "financial disclosure policy" for all senior 
executives, he said.

NLRB'S NEW CHIEF UMPIRE IS CALLING FOR SOME CHANGES; LABOR: CHAIRMAN WILLIAM B. 
GOULD SAYS HE'LL WORK TO FOSTER COOPERATION BETWEEN WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an ardent baseball fan and devoted follower of the Boston Red Sox, William 
B. Gould IV relished his role as an arbitrator in four salary disputes between 
major league owners and players in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gould, sworn in last week as chairman of the National Labor Relations 
Board after a bitter confirmation fight, says with pride that he kept his 
personal feelings out of the decision making and was fair in his rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Gould is umpiring the American workplace -- the agency he heads is 
the nation's chief arbiter of labor-management disputes -- he promises to be 
just as scrupulous in keeping his personal politics out of NLRB deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both Gould and the business interests who contested his nomination 
agree that the NLRB under its new leader could profoundly change relations 
between U.S. employers and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, 57, whose term runs until August, 1998, said he would like his tenure 
to be remembered for "fostering a more cooperative relationship between labor 
and management. Only if we move in this direction as a country will we be able 
to compete more effectively in the global arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, a longtime Stanford University law professor and the first African 
American to head the NLRB, said he will try to accomplish this by "bringing the 
board back to the center" and re-establishing the credibility of an agency that 
became "increasingly politicized" under the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet among his critics, Gould is considered a threat to promote a pro-labor 
agenda that will spur union-organizing efforts. They fear that when 
unfair-labor-practices complaints stemming from organizing drives come before 
the NLRB, the agency will consistently side with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Cameron, a spokesman for the Labor Policy Assn., the big-business group 
that led the attack on Gould, said his organization's members were frightened 
by the proposals in Gould's 1993 book, "Agenda for Reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Gould advocates such measures as giving workers the right to 
bargain collectively with their employer if a majority of employees at a work 
site sign union authorization cards -- an innovation that would preclude the 
often drawn-out process of conducting union representation elections. Gould 
also supports proposed legislation to ban the permanent replacement of 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview at his Stanford office during a break from packing for 
his move to Washington, Gould hewed to his long-stated philosophy that unions 
are the best vehicle for advocating employees' interests. But Gould, has worked 
both for a management law firm and on the staff of the United Auto Workers 
union, has also been critical of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, for example, he derided labor for discriminating against 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Gould said his critics should have no fear of his trying to push 
a personal agenda on the NLRB. As chairman, "you are circumscribed in your 
ability to decide things the way you'd like them to be decided," he said, 
emphasizing that he would be restricted to interpreting the law as it's written 
and would lack the authority to enact the reforms he has advocated in his 
writings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I decided cases as I would like Congress to decide the issues . . . I 
would be violating my oath of office," Gould said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many others who know Gould and his work say that although he is clearly 
interested in rejuvenating the union movement, he is far from the "radical" he 
was portrayed as in congressional hearings. In fact, Louis Melendez, associate 
counsel for Major League Baseball's player relations committee, says he 
couldn't detect either a pro-management or pro-player bias in Gould's 
deliberations. (For the record, the box score on Gould's baseball salary 
decisions were three in favor of the owners and one in favor of a player.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very bright, very knowledgeable about baseball and a fair person," 
Melendez said. "You can't ask for anything more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cameron points out that although Gould has pledged to "reduce 
polarization" between labor and management, he lashed out at his critics 
immediately after winning confirmation March 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, normally soft-spoken, issued a news release citing his "victory over a 
determined campaign of cynical character assassination waged against me for 
these past nine months by right-wing ideologues in the Republican Party and in 
some elements of the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 The release, "with that tone, was an incredible thing. Usually, after a fight 
like that, everyone is gracious," Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould declined to explain the rationale for his statement and promised to try 
to ease tensions between opposing factions on employment law issues once he 
arrives in Washington. To help weather his future crises, Gould says, he will 
draw inspiration from several personal heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 One is his late father, an electrical engineer who Gould says always 
maintained his "inherent goodness" despite being "subjected to the most rank, 
overt discrimination" in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the Boston Red Sox pictures and other sports memorabilia in his modest 
Stanford office, Gould has also kept a photo of his meeting with another 
personal hero, anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, who has visited South Africa eight times to give labor law lectures -- 
and who was banned from the country in the 1980s -- has met with Mandela twice 
and knows of him mainly through working with his deputy. Gould said Mandela's 
"demeanor and his manner of speech and conduct inspire me. South Africa has 
extreme good fortune that someone like that, without bitterness and instead 
interested in promoting reconciliation, is in the position he is in."

TACO BELL, JOINING GROWING LIST OF FAST-FOOD CHAINS, WILL BAN SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI and SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. said Monday that it will ban smoking at its company-owned 
restaurants and that most of its franchisees are expected to follow suit, 
giving the Mexican-style fast-food chain the largest number of smoke-free 
outlets in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said it will snuff out cigarettes, cigars and pipes 
at its 3,300 company locations nationwide on March 28 and that at least 1,000 
franchisees also will ban smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's action follows similar steps taken by other fast-food chains, 
including No. 1 McDonald's Corp., as the effects of secondhand smoke -- 
especially on children -- are being scrutinized more closely at local and 
federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's said three weeks ago that it will ban smoking in its 1,400 
company-owned outlets, but a spokeswoman said Monday that no franchisees have 
yet adopted the company's policy. The Carl's Jr. and Chuck E. Cheese chains 
banned smoking in company-owned eateries two years ago. And Arby's and Dairy 
Queen announced plans earlier this year to eliminate smoking at company-owned 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders on Monday praised Taco Bell, McDonald's 
and other smoke-free chains for "taking this stand for our children, who cannot 
decide their own environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Texas attorney general sued Taco Bell, McDonald's and three 
other major chains, alleging that they endangered the health of patrons, 
particularly children, by exposing them to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear Monday what effect Taco Bell's action will have on the suit, 
and spokeswoman Janis Smith said the company's decision to ban smoking is not 
related to it. "This is something we've looked at a long time and something our 
customers want."  
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong survey by an independent firm showed that 70% of Taco Bell 
customers who smoked and 84% of customers who didn't favored smoke-free 
fast-food establishments, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers say that smoking bans are less risky for fast-food chains 
than sit-down restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think smoking bans will have virtually no effect on fast-food restaurants," 
said Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco. "You wait in line, you eat, you go." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for a tobacco industry trade association said fast-food chains 
can't ignore smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell's decision potentially alienates up to 30% or more of its customer 
base," said Thomas Lauria of the Tobacco Institute.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: REBIRTH OF BASEBALL; THE NATIONAL PASTIME HAS 
REINVENTED ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With or without Michael Jordan on its 1994 roster, Major League Baseball 
appears to be making a magnificent off-the-field comeback. Behind it all: 
shrewd marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one year ago, baseball was saddled with more image problems than Tonya 
Harding. TV viewership was in the tank. Attendance had been flat for four 
years. Advertisers were grumbling. Fans were fed up with greedy owners, crybaby 
players and high ticket prices. Media criticism was relentless. Baseball became 
the Rodney Dangerfield of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet fans flocked to ballparks in record numbers last year -- a record that 
would have been achieved even without the two expansion teams that joined the 
National League. Now, with opening day less than three weeks away, it appears 
to be OK again to admit to liking baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This image reversal -- while far from complete -- is due in large part to 
clever marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is making a major-league comeback," said Alan Friedman, editor of 
Team Marketing Report in Chicago. "The sport is finally playing up its strong 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround began last year with an announced overhaul of baseball's 
playoff structure -- which is expected to pump some pizazz into the game. It 
continued this winter with the formation of the Baseball Network, a powerful 
marketing group that will give fans more of what they want most: home teams on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketers are also catching on to the emergence of several young superstars 
who are showing up in national ads -- and even in computer games. And it is no 
accident that two marquee athletes -- Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson -- are 
wearing baseball jerseys this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball has finally gotten ahead of the curve," said Michael Trager, 
executive vice president of sales and marketing for the New York-based Baseball 
Network. The group is a joint venture of Major League Baseball and ABC and NBC, 
the two networks that will share baseball's national TV time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first move was to scrap baseball's Saturday afternoon Game of the Week. 
Reason: Viewership has declined 35% since 1986, Trager said. In its place will 
be weekly evening broadcasts of local or regional teams on the networks. 
"That's what fans want," Trager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some off-the-field changes are expected to immediately make baseball a more 
marketable commodity in 1994. A new league alignment -- with fewer teams in 
each division -- means each team has a better shot at making the playoffs. And 
a revised playoff structure also means more teams will participate in 
post-season play this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of advertising baseball by showing fans cheering in the stands, the 
networks are calling upon baseball's stars to promote the '94 season. Some of 
these young stars are finally picking up endorsement contracts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds, the reclusive slugger for the San Francisco Giants, is in TV 
spots for Wilson and Nike. Ken Griffey Jr., the Seattle Mariners star, has 
linked up with Nike and Kellogg. And a Nintendo computer baseball game bearing 
Griffey's name hits the market next week. Chicago White Sox batting star Frank 
Thomas is featured in a Reebok TV spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baseball Network is expected to soon announce a handful of sponsors that 
will buy ad time during the games and forge promotional tie-ins. Texaco will 
sponsor the 1994 All-Star Game balloting. In fact, more ballots are expected to 
be filled out at Texaco gas stations this year than in all 28 baseball 
stadiums, said Tom Matthews, president of Texaco Refining & Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former NBA superstar Jordan -- whose minor league performance has 
been, at best, disappointing -- has still created a media frenzy while trying 
to catch on with the White Sox. And Jackson -- whose hip surgery two years ago 
may have shortened his baseball career -- is a sure bet to fill some seats at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both teams have been careful about how they promote these superstars to 
local fans. Neither player is expected to be a starter this year -- and Jordan 
may not even make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are shedding light on the hunger there is for a larger-than-life 
baseball hero," said Brian Murphy, editor of the Westport, Conn.-based Sports 
Marketing Letter. "Baseball doesn't need to retool its marketing; all baseball 
needs is one or two heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for the time being, at least, Angel fans won't see much of Jackson in ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a marketing person, you salivate over the fact that you have a Bo Jackson 
in camp. He just walks on the field and everyone cheers," said Joseph Schrier, 
vice president of marketing for the Angels. "But we don't want to mislead fans 
or embarrass anybody by featuring him in our advertising. We have to first make 
sure that he makes the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jackson did appear in a preseason newspaper ad in Tempe, Ariz., which 
helped fill the spring training ballpark. The ad showed Jackson in an Angel 
uniform under the headline "Un-Bo-lievable." 
</P>
<P>
 An even touchier marketing dilemma is taking place in Chicago. Officials there 
are trying to decide what credible role -- if any -- White Sox wanna-be Jordan 
can play in the team's marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, just allowing Jordan to try out for the team has been a marketing 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox found a way to get Jordan's mug into one ad. A TV spot shows him 
reminiscing about how the Chicago Bulls won pro basketball's World Championship 
just one season after they first made the playoffs. The spot implies that this 
will be the White Sox's big year too. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ad clearly portrays Jordan as a basketball star -- not a baseball 
player. And the real star of the TV spot is Frank Thomas, the White Sox's 
hitting star, who is seen smirking at the end of the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our responsibility from the marketing side is to stick with the guys who got 
us here," said Rob Gallas, White Sox senior vice president of marketing. "Even 
if Jordan makes the team, it will be as the 28th man. We don't want to market 
Michael Jordan as a novelty act." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nike may be doing just that. The firm is selling T-shirts and baseball 
caps that promote Jordan as a baseball player. One shirt shows Jordan -- bat in 
hand -- under the headline "The Great American Pastime Just Got Greater." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a demand out in the marketplace for Michael Jordan baseball stuff," 
said Keith Peters, a Nike spokesman, "even if his baseball career only lasts a 
few months." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles agency GBF/Ayer has picked up the $1.4-million ad business for 
the Avery Division of Pasadena-based Avery Dennison, an office products maker. 
. . . Los Angeles-based Fox Broadcasting Co. is talking to local ad agencies 
about a campaign to help it promote broadcasts of National Football League 
games. . . . Central California Advertising Connection, an ad sales company 
specializing in cable TV and radio, has opened in Los Angeles. . . . To help 
raise money for the Minority Advertising Training Program, the Western States 
Advertising Agencies Assn. will host a private screening of Ron Howard's film 
"The Paper" at 7:30 tonight at Cineplex Odeon in Universal City. Gimmicks to 
Fill Seats 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Dodgers and California Angels have devised new marketing 
gimmicks to fill seats during the '94 baseball season. Here are some of the 
newer or more unusual efforts: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dodgers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ad campaign promoting Dodgers as "the best buy in town." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ads promoting the team's "back-to-back" rookies of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minority marketing campaigns aimed at Latinos, Japanese, Koreans and 
Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baseball clinics with Dodger players and various youth groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Photo Ball Night" at Dodger Stadium featuring baseballs with photos of top 
rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dodger Dog Night" featuring free hot dogs for every fan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special Dodger Stadium clothing line to be sold only at Dodger Stadium. 
California Angels: 
</P>
<P>
 * New Angels "mascots" leading cheers in stands and on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Angels "halo cheer" to be introduced following Angel home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 * More quizzes and games on scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-for-one ticket promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 * New slogan: "Angels Baseball: You Gotta Love It." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Calculator Night," with 20,000 calculators given away. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Umbrella Night," with 20,000 umbrellas given away.

sharply last year. The two new expansion teams--which attracted nearly 7.5 
million fans--accounted for a little over half the gain.

 Northrop to Get Grumman Data: Northrop Corp. formally launched its $2-billion 
tender offer to buy Grumman Corp. and said Grumman agreed to provide Northrop 
with the same non-public information about the company that it earlier gave 
Martin Marietta Corp. Grumman had accepted a $55-a-share takeover offer from 
Martin before Los Angeles-based Northrop bested that deal last week by 
announcing its $60-a-share bid. Grumman's stock, meanwhile, climbed 62.5 cents 
to $65.375 on the NYSE.

 Business Inventories Hold Steady: Inventories were all but unchanged in 
January, while sales -- due to a weather-related decline in retail spending -- 
dipped for the first time in six months as 1994 began, the government said. 
There were few surprises in the Commerce Department report showing stocks held 
on shelves and back lots totaled a seasonally adjusted $872.9 billion, 
virtually unchanged from December.

 Carter Hawley Posts Loss: Carter Hawley Hale Stores, operator of the Broadway 
department store chain, reported a net loss of $95.9 million for the 52-week 
period ended Jan. 19. Non-recurring charges -- including the costs of voluntary 
work force reductions and earthquake damage -- accounted for $45 million of the 
loss. The Los Angeles-based retailer had earnings of $1.2 billion for the same 
period a year ago, but the 1992 profit stemmed partly from debt reductions and 
asset adjustments relating to the company's emergence in October, 1992, from 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

 Home Sales Rise Again: Nearly 13,000 units were sold in the six-county 
Southern California area last month, up 7.5% from January and 26.4% higher than 
a year earlier, Dataquick Information Systems said.It was the eighth straight 
month in which sales showed a year-over-year gain. Month-to-month sales climbed 
14.5% in Los Angeles County, despite the lingering effects of the January 
earthquake, and surged 65% in Orange County. Prices were flat or slightly 
higher than a year ago in San Diego, Riverside and Ventura counties. Prices 
were down about 3% from year-earlier levels in Orange and Los Angeles counties, 
but the research firm said that the worst of the prolonged drop in prices 
appears to be over.

DELOITTE & TOUCHE AGREES TO PAY $312 MILLION IN S&L SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY KNIGHT, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deloitte & Touche, one of the nation's biggest accounting firms, agreed Monday 
to pay the government $312 million to settle charges that it failed to properly 
audit several savings and loan associations, contributing to failures that cost 
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is the second-largest by an accounting firm for its part in the 
costly S&L debacle, exceeded only by the $400 million paid by Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had filed 
18 lawsuits against Deloitte & Touche for alleged auditing lapses and were 
investigating additional cases that had not yet reached the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulators' charges against the firm involved some of the most costly S&L 
failures ever, including Franklin Savings Assn. of Ottawa, Kan., which lost 
hundreds of millions of dollars by speculating in exotic financial instruments, 
and Columbia Savings and Loan of Beverly Hills, which lost massive amounts on 
deals with convicted junk bond financier Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 What RTC officials described as "a global settlement" ends pending cases and 
potential new ones as well as settles a disciplinary case brought by the Office 
of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>

 Deloitte & Touche is to pay $236.8 million to the RTC and another $75.2 
million to the FDIC. The company also agreed to abide by an OTS order calling 
on it to change S&L auditing practices, according to the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Deloitte & Touche, which had denied wrongdoing in all the cases, 
described the settlement as "fair for both the government and for the firm" and 
said it "will have no effect on the financial viability of our firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte said "a substantial portion" of the cost will be paid by insurance 
companies that provided professional liability coverage, but it said the exact 
amount will not be known for several months.

 Keating Reportedly to Settle SEC Charges: Charles Keating Jr., the former 
Lincoln Savings & Loan chief, will settle securities fraud charges by 
forfeiting any money regulators can find in his accounts, Associated Press 
reported. Keating, 70, who is serving a 12-year federal prison sentence on 
related criminal charges, was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
of inflating financial statements and using misleading sales practices to 
peddle more than $200 million in risky securities as safe investments. Keating 
agreed to repay millions of dollars -- if he is ever found to have hidden 
assets -- but the SEC would be unable to seize future earnings.

FUJITSU, TOSHIBA BUY INTO START-UP GENERAL MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Japanese electronics giants took key steps Monday toward ensuring that a 
computer language developed by Mountain View, Calif.-based General Magic Inc. 
will become a global standard for multimedia communications technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. said they will purchase equity shares in 
General Magic, the developer of the Telescript computer language and Magic Cap 
software, which is used in some of the new-generation hand-held computers known 
as personal communicators or digital assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 General Magic, a 4-year-old start-up, already includes among its investors the 
world's leading computer and electronics firms: Apple Computer Inc., Sony 
Corp., AT&T, Motorola Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. The addition 
of Fujitsu and Toshiba provides strong impetus for General Magic technologies 
to become worldwide standards. Neither Fujitsu nor Toshiba disclosed what its 
equity will be in the privately held firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujitsu and Toshiba said they plan to make hand-held computing and 
communications devices and offer on-line services based on General Magic 
software technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly endorse Telescript and Magic Cap as new industry standards 
because we are convinced that they are the right technologies for our industry 
and will truly help bring about the information society of the future," Mikio 
Otsuki, Fujitsu executive vice president, said at a news conference. Fujitsu 
will use Telescript to offer Japanese language communications services, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira Kuwahara, general manager of Toshiba's Multimedia Division, said that 
Toshiba is buying into the firm because it "recognizes the importance of 
offering insider support for General Magic's software systems, strong 
candidates to become de facto standards in the emerging communication 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Beirne, a Fujitsu spokesman, said there is a strong trend toward 
Telescript becoming an international standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're adding our momentum behind it as well," he said. "When we see a 
standard coming up, we have to evaluate our product lineup. For us, a common 
standard that would allow our multimedia products to reach a wide audience is a 
very good thing."

TIANGUIS STORES' FATE UNDECIDED, VONS SAYS; RETAIL: IT DENIES REPORT THAT 
REMAINING THREE LATINO-AIMED OUTLETS WILL BECOME CONVENTIONAL SUPERMARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Vons said Monday that it has converted six of its nine Tianguis stores to 
conventional supermarkets but hasn't yet decided what to do with the three 
remaining stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons spokeswoman Mary McAboy denied a report in Supermarket News quoting a 
Vons executive as saying the Arcadia-based company had decided to convert all 
Tianguis stores to other formats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is just his opinion," McAboy said of statements by Vons Vice President 
Chris Linskey, who was quoted in the article. "We have made no decision to 
convert the stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Vons has steadfastly maintained that it hasn't decided to close its Tianguis 
chain, although it has converted two-thirds of them into Vons groceries or Expo 
warehouse-style stores since November. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Supermarket News, a trade publication, Linskey said the three 
remaining Tianguises -- in Cudahy, Huntington Park and Montebello -- would be 
converted into either Vons or Expo stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hunch is they will probably become Expos," Supermarket News quoted Linskey 
as saying. He told the trade paper that sales had increased at the converted 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain was opened amid great fanfare eight years ago to win over the 
region's fast-growing Latino population. With its specialty foods departments 
and weekend performances by mariachi bands, the stores drew large crowds at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons has acknowledged problems with the Tianguis stores, blaming the recession 
and a grape boycott by the United Farm Workers Union, whose members are mostly 
Latino. Although Tianguis stores stopped selling grapes, sales did not recover. 
Tianguis' problems came at a time when the poor economy was taking a toll on 
Vons' other operations. Vons' 1993 sales fell 9.3% compared to the previous 
year, to $5.1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers have also said that Tianguis was at least partially undone 
by charging higher prices than its competitors and failing to aggressively 
promote the store with specials and coupons. A recent comparison showed that 
Vons offered three times more bargains at its upscale Pavilions markets than at 
Tianguis outlets.

GROUP LAUNCHES AMBITIOUS HOUSING PLAN; CONSTRUCTION: A NONPROFIT GROUP, LENDERS 
AND PENSION FUNDS PLAN TO BUILD AS MANY AS 5,000 AFFORDABLE UNITS IN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's largest nonprofit housing group and a consortium of lenders and 
pension funds launched a novel $300-million program Monday to build as many as 
5,000 affordable homes in the state over the next three years with no direct 
government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, known as the World/Bridge Initiative, is the brainchild of Bridge 
Housing Corp. in San Francisco and World Savings in Oakland.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials hailed it as a prototype for other plans that 
could lead to the construction of tens of thousands of affordable homes across 
the country at a time when federal money for these projects has largely 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this period of severe budget deficits, this initiative is a major step 
forward," U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros told 
reporters at the news conference in San Francisco on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 If other groups start similar programs, he said, "we have the potential to 
unleash billions of dollars nationally for desperately needed affordable 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two projects will be a 344-unit apartment complex for low-income 
families in the San Diego County city of Carlsbad and a 34-unit townhouse 
project for first-time buyers in the Bay Area city of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Seed money for the program was provided by World, the nation's third-largest 
savings and loan, which started the construction fund with an interest-free 
$15-million loan.  
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank then pledged to make a combined $100 
million in market-rate loans through the fund, and the Ford Foundation 
contributed nearly $4 million in grants and low-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The $82-billion California Public Employees Retirement System then agreed to 
lend $150 million under the program, and the California State Teachers 
Retirement System has added $75 million in credit guarantees designed to 
attract even more money to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction duties will be handled by Bridge Housing, which has built more 
than 5,000 low-cost houses and apartments in California since its inception a 
decade ago. It now ranks as the second-largest nonprofit developer in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been pressing pension funds to become involved in the 
construction of affordable housing, citing the funds' combined $4 trillion in 
assets and the reluctance of many traditional lenders to finance such projects. 
The two California pension funds' involvement with the Bridge project is the 
latest sign that the Administration's efforts are beginning to pay off. Last 
month, the AFL-CIO said it was nearing an agreement with HUD to use at least 
$500 million in union pension funds to build urban housing in 20 cities across 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300 million pledged by the consortium will immediately finance the 
construction of about 5,000 affordable homes across the state, Bridge President 
L. Donald Terner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But to leverage its investment and build even more houses, Terner said, the 
construction money Bridge borrows from the fund will be repaid as soon as each 
project is completed and permanent, long-term financing can be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the $300-million fund works like a revolving line of credit that 
we can use over and over again," Terner said. "The money will finance about 
5,000 homes right away, but that number will grow as the money is 'recycled' 
into new projects in the future."

 Film: Producers Gil Friesen and Andy Meyer, who together formed A&M Films in 
1981, confirmed Monday that they are reuniting to form Free Range Pictures, a 
production company that expects to develop as many as 12 projects over two 
years in an exclusive deal with Warner Bros. The company's headquarters will be 
in Port Townsend, Wash., Meyer's hometown.In an interview, the two men said 
they hope to develop films in the $12-million to $20-million budget range. The 
deal marks the end of what Friesen, who resigned as president of A&M Records in 
1990, described as a sabbatical. Friesen and Meyer worked on such A&M films as 
"The Breakfast Club," "Birdy" and "Bring On the Night." Meyer is also the 
former president of Robert Redford's Wildwood Productions, where he worked on 
"The Milagro Beanfield War," and of Norman Lear's Act III Productions, where he 
worked on "Fried Green Tomatoes." JAMES BATES

NEW SEGA, NINTENDO ADD-ONS TO HIT MARKET; VIDEO GAMES: DEVICES WILL BOOST SPEED 
OF GENESIS, PUT GAME BOY ON A TELEVISION SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There is no rest for the video game addict. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, apparently, for the feuding manufacturers Sega and Nintendo, who each 
announced new products Monday designed to improve the performance of their 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Sega of America, whose Genesis machine sits atop the television sets of 13 
million U.S. households, said that it will begin selling a $150 add-on 
cartridge this fall that will allow its 16-bit system to process data at twice 
the speed, making for better sound and more realistic, arcade-style graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo of America introduced an adapter that lets players transfer the 
display of its ubiquitous Game Boy cartridges from the 2-by-2-inch, 
black-and-white Game Boy screen to full-color TV screens. The company expects 
to ship the $60 Super Game Boy adapter in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition for dominance in the next generation of video game machines 
has become increasingly intense as new-technology fervor draws more players 
into the $5.7-billion U.S. video game market. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a news-release war between the two chief rivals in the field 
erupted last week over a report that Nintendo provided a congressional 
committee with a videotape of the most violent scenes from the Sega game Night 
Trap. It culminated in the following exchange between Sega President Tom 
Kalinske and Nintendo Chairman Howard Lincoln: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really amazed that Nintendo would . . . so irresponsibly drag retailers 
and the entire video game industry through the mud in their efforts to slow our 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Came the response: "Dear Tom, Roses are red, violets are blue, so you had a 
bad day, boo hoo hoo hoo. All my best, Howard." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the most recent moves by Sega and Nintendo represent attempts by 
both companies to extend the life of their older products as they build 
customer demand for a new generation of technology. For newcomer 3D0, which as 
of November had sold only 30,000 of its $700 compact disc-based game machine 
(the price has since been dropped to $500), the Sega add-on cartridge could be 
another obstacle in attracting customers at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, the onslaught of product introductions and promises of 
introductions to come raises the question of whether to buy any of them at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confusion creates a wait cycle," said Bruce Ryon, multimedia analyst for 
Dataquest, who forecasts a dip in the video game machine market next year. "The 
more announcements that come out from a technology standpoint, the more people 
hang back and say, 'We'll let somebody else invest in the mistakes.' "

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LASER MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY COMPLETES YEARLONG 
RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laser Medical Technology Inc., a maker of medical laser products, said Monday 
that it has completed its yearlong restructuring after its founders sold their 
stock to long-term investors and severed their relationships with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente company, which has seen its work force shrink from 77 to 22 
in the last two years, said the completion of the restructuring will probably 
give it a gain of $400,000, or 6 cents a share, for the first quarter.Last 
year, the company lost $1.59 million, or 9 cents a share, for the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Levy and his son Francois sold 1.2 million shares to unidentified 
investors. Another son, Philip, previously had sold his stock on the open 
market. The sale by the Levy family was important, the company said, because 
the family had been "the only important suppliers of stock in the marketplace, 
particularly in the past few months." Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sale condition, Guy Levy sold back to the company his patent royalty 
agreement for $100,000 plus 50,000 shares of restricted stock and an option to 
buy three lasers. The royalty agreement, which expires in 2010, had been worth 
$84,000 annually plus a cost of living adjustment.

JUDGE KEEPS FORMER HEAD OF O.C. FIRM IN JAIL; COURTS: DEFENDANT WON'T DISCLOSE 
WHEREABOUTS OF $12.3 MILLION ALLEGEDLY DEFRAUDED FROM INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge on Monday upheld a contempt ruling against Michael Gartner, 
former president of an Orange County company accused of defrauding 450 
investors of $12.3 million, and fined his attorney for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Manuel Real ordered Gartner to either disclose the whereabouts of money 
raised by Interlink Data Network of Los Angeles Inc. or stay in jail on a 
contempt of court charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner was arrested Jan. 19 for contempt of court while crossing the 
U.S.-Canada border and has since been in custody. He is being held at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Gartner's Costa Mesa-based 
company never built a video phone network for which it raised the money. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission sued last summer and won a $12.3-million 
judgment against Gartner and the company. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC attorneys sought the contempt charge last fall after Gartner allegedly 
used money from bank accounts that the judge had ordered frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner has denied any wrongdoing and refused to provide further information 
by citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. His attorney, 
Robert Rosen, said SEC officials went too far in pursuing the contempt order, 
which he believes deprives Gartner of his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge ordered Rosen's law firm -- Lewis, d'Amato, Brisbois & 
Bisgaard in Los Angeles -- to pay to the court $41,823 which the firm received 
from Gartner. The judge also fined the firm another $5,838. The SEC attorneys 
argued that the money the law firm received was another violation of the 
asset-freeze order. Rosen could not be reached Monday for comment.

 A Gigabyte of Caviar: The personal computer mass storage market keeps getting, 
uh, more massive. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital Corp. in Irvine launched a Caviar hard disk drive Monday that 
can store one gigabyte of data on a PC. 
</P>
<P>
 One megabyte can store 500 single-spaced typewritten pages. A gigabyte is 
1,000 megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnetic drive, and its accompanying 730-megabyte version, are based on 
Western Digital's Enhanced Intelligent Drive Electronics technology, which 
improves data transfer capabilities within a PC. The company hopes to establish 
Enhanced IDE as an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Irvine-based Pinnacle Micro Inc., a maker of optical disk drives, 
is expected today to release a 5.2-gigabyte optical disk drive that for the 
first time combines four of Pinnacle's current optical drives in a single 
system, which sells for $14,995. Western Digital did not list the Caviar price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orray drive represents a challenge to the supremacy of the magnetic hard 
disk drive technology, particularly makers of systems that use multiple disk 
drives known as disk arrays, said Scott Blum, executive vice president of 
Pinnacle Micro.

KEATING AGREES TO SETTLE CHARGES BY REGULATORS OF CIVIL FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles H. Keating Jr., the former Lincoln Savings & Loan operator serving a 
12-year federal prison sentence, has agreed to settle civil fraud charges 
brought by securities regulators, lawyers told a judge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, who contends that he is broke, has only to provide a detailed 
financial statement for the deal to be completed, Securities and Exchange 
Commission attorney Rory Flynn told U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating's son, Charles H. Keating III, also settled the civil case brought by 
the SEC, said Scott Devereaux, a lawyer for the Keatings. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating and his son were convicted 14 months ago on criminal fraud, 
racketeering and conspiracy charges stemming from the collapse of the Irvine 
thrift five years ago. The younger Keating is free pending appeal of his 
criminal conviction.  
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's failure is the nation's costliest, leaving taxpayers with a 
$3.4-billion repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's brief court session, Devereaux and Flynn declined to discuss 
the elder Keating's settlement until it becomes final. 
</P>
<P>
 A source who knows about the deal and spoke on condition of anonymity said 
Keating agreed to repay millions of dollars -- if he is ever found to have 
hidden assets. The source said the agreement would not allow the SEC to seize 
future earnings, assuming the 70-year-old convict generates any.

PERSONAL HEALTH; CRANBERRY JUICE GETS CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cranberry juice has long been the drink of choice among women with 
urinary-tract infections, but urologists have remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes a study from Harvard Medical School giving the drink a boost in 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers divided 153 elderly women -- average age 78 -- into two groups and 
gave each woman 10 ounces a day of either ordinary cranberry juice or "a 
specially prepared synthetic placebo" cranberryish juice. Urine samples were 
collected every month for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the test, nearly the same number of women in each group had 
urinary-tract infections. But those who drank the real stuff tested positive 
for infection only 42% as often as those who drank the fake. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the Harvard research team intends to test younger women, whose 
urinary-tract infections generally are more severe.

FRESH AIR, OPEN SPACES: IS THIS REALLY EXERCISE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN RYAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A aaaah . . . the wind on your face, as the sounds of whirling spokes soothe 
your soul. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like the refreshing tranquillity of bicycling. Few 
exercises offer more variety with such mobility. Hard to believe you get all 
this and a workout, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clearly one of the best exercises available for aerobic training," says 
Jeanne Earley, a cycling enthusiast and physical therapist at Barnes Hospital 
in St. Louis. "Over an extended period of time, cycling trains the heart and 
lungs to become more efficient with the fuel they receive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder patients recovering from heart attacks are often put on a 
cycling regime. Studies show that biking at least three times a week for 30 
minutes strengthens and protects the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Biking) is a good exercise for a lot of different types of people," says 
Dennis O'Connell, exercise physiologist and director of the Human Performance 
Laboratory at the Health Science Center of the University of Texas, San 
Antonio. "People with orthopedic problems or osteoporosis, elderly people, 
people with diabetes, and (people) who are overweight. It's an excellent mode 
of exercise because it's non-weight-bearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Biking -- which burns 400 to 700 calories an hour -- is also great for legs, 
which hold 65% of the body's main muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a recent study conducted at the University of Vermont found that 
longer workouts at lower intensities burn more fat.  
</P>
<P>
 Bicycling is also a favorite among physical therapists. "We use the exercise 
bike a lot to increase a patient's range of motion," Earley says. "Cycling is a 
great way to restore flexibility in patients who have flexibility problems." 
</P>
<P>
 And a good cycle is also good for the joints. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) is a less stressful exercise for the body and a perfect way for joints 
to get the oxygen and nutrients they need to function," Earley says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like any exercise, though, good form is imperative to getting the maximum 
benefit and avoiding injury. "Keep your body aligned so muscles are working in 
the positions they were meant to," Earley says. 
</P>
<P>
 For less stressful biking, use higher gears going down hills and in tail 
winds, and lower gears going up hills and on level ground. Pace yourself and 
restore your energy not only physically, but by shifting gears mentally, too.

NO DOUBT, IT'S WHEEL LOVE; HEALTH CONCERNS, AND ADVANCES IN BIKE TECHNOLOGY AND 
COMFORT, ARE INSPIRING MANY TO GET BACK IN THE SADDLE -- FOR COMMUTING AND FOR 
FUN

<P>
 If you left your old chrome-plated, balloon-tired Schwinn in a closet 40 years 
ago and haven't thought much about bicycles since, these items might surprise 
you: 
</P>
<P>
 * 900 million bicycles are in use worldwide, making the bike the prime source 
of transportation for most people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 100 million bicycles -- that's three times more than cars -- were produced 
globally in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The number of bikes in the United States has soared to 120 million. That's 
more bikes per capita than there are in China or India.  
</P>
<P>
 * Only "exercise walking" and swimming are more popular participatory 
activities than biking in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over the past decade, the number of Americans who commute by bicycle has 
increased nearly threefold, to 4.3 million. Every state has a staff bicycle 
coordinator attempting to integrate bicycles into the transportation system of 
the future. (In car-clogged Los Angeles, $50 million has been allocated over 
five years for such programs as bike lanes, bike bridges and bike lockers at 
Metrolink stations.) 
</P>
<P>
 Why are Americans getting back into the saddle? 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 reason people give in surveys we conduct every year is always 
health, fitness, exercise," says Chuck McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling 
magazine. "They've embraced the bicycle as they did the running shoe in the 
'70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that advances in bicycle technology and comfort and, well, let some 
bike riders tell it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ezra Brown, 54, heads out of his home in West Windsor, Conn., at 6:15 a.m. on 
a 10-speed Peugeot. He turns left on Herman Way, makes his way over to 
Ellington Road, then does some hair-raising navigation on congested Route 5, 
careful to avoid broken glass along the shoulder. The 12-mile trip to Trinity 
College, where he is plant engineer, takes 45 minutes. His estimated annual 
savings in fuel: more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been commuting by bike for about 15 years," he says. "Hartford's not 
bike-friendly, but the drivers are decent and courteous. When I lived in 
Fairbanks (Alaska), I had drunks throw bottles that shattered in front of my 
wheels. In western Pennsylvania, (people) would give me the finger and try to 
run me off the road with their pickups. So Hartford's not bad, but if they want 
to get more people biking to work, they've got to sweep the glass off the edges 
of the street and fill the potholes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Norville Jones, a 64-year-old retired Washington lobbyist, left 
the West Coast on his 21-speed Trek 520, designed for long-distance touring, 
and pedaled for two months until he made it home to Virginia, 4,246 miles away. 
He averaged 74 miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he's made a 3,000-mile transcontinental crossing, taken a 
1,500-mile trip through New England, and started planning a big loop through 
the West as he closes in on his goal to bicycle across all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 His only complaint? "The head winds. They're psychologically debilitating, 
like pushing a rock uphill. Other than that, it's been terrific. My bike has 
never broken down. People have been great everywhere. It's just a wonderful way 
to discover America at ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Linda Erwin and Dianne Gittins of the Alexandria, Va., Police 
Department, one of 600 law-enforcement agencies in the country that uses bike 
patrols, took some good-natured ribbing from their male colleagues when they 
showed up in shorts and with their own mountain bikes as the first volunteers 
for a pilot program two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes later, they made a heroin bust. Soon each was averaging 30 
arrests a month; the department average for officers in cars was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a bike, you tend to roll right up on stuff happening, like drug deals," 
Erwin says. Alexandria now has nine full-time bike officers, patrolling 24 
hours a day, and a long list of volunteers who want to join the unit. (Los 
Angeles has 119 officers on bikes.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When bicycling was at the peak of its popularity a century ago, 400 U.S. 
companies were manufacturing bikes. Today the United States has only six major 
producers and the industry is split into two distinct segments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The mass retail market for low-cost and children's bikes, dominated by three 
U.S. manufacturers: Huffy, Murray and Roadmaster, which are keeping a wary eye 
on imports, particularly from China. This segment accounts for about 8.5 
million of the 12 million bikes sold in the nation annually. (Californians buy 
one out of every six new bicycles). 
</P>
<P>
 * The upscale market, which caters to 5,000 independent dealers. The dominant 
manufacturers in this segment -- Trek, Cannondale and Raleigh -- have always 
faced keen international competition, and, like the Big Three auto makers in 
Detroit, have staked their futures on technology, design and quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Trek is a good example of the renaissance of the U.S. bicycle manufacturer. 
Started in 1975 with one model and four employees working in a rented warehouse 
in Waterloo, the company has grown into a major international producer with 812 
employees, 41 models of advanced design, and sales that have increased 40% 
annually since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 On these busy days of the pre-spring rush, up to 2,000 bicycles a day roll off 
the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we tried to sell the same product as the Chinese, they'd blow us out of 
the water because we can't compete on price," says Thomas Albers, Trek's chief 
operating officer. "So in a global market, we have to differentiate our 
product, and you do that through, among other things, quality and innovation." 
</P>
<P>
 At Trek and other manufacturers, the mountain, or off-road, bike has captured 
the lion's share of the market, and enthusiasts are finding no shortage of 
routes to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 They can roll through 45 states on 6,808 miles of abandoned railroad 
right-of-ways that have been converted into paved recreational pathways. 
</P>
<P>
 One interlinking bike path extends from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburgh, Pa., 
save for a 20-mile section still under construction. The Rails-to-Trails 
Conservancy in Washington, D.C., hopes its off-road bikeways will extend coast 
to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 More significantly, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 gives 
states flexibility so that federal funds traditionally set aside for highways 
can now be used for biking, pedestrian and transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The act, which will provide $155 million over six years, reflects a major 
revision of the goals of the federal transportation program, created 40 years 
ago to build the interstate highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 One result, transportation planners say, will be more bicycle-friendly cities 
that try to accommodate bike commuters with protected lanes, parking facilities 
and access to public-transit vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of communities are already moving in that direction. City workers in 
Santa Monica who regularly bike to work receive an extra $1 a day. Pasadena 
bought 12 bikes and gave them to city employees who promised to pedal to work.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles hopes to put bike racks on all 2,000 city buses. Davis, Calif., 
has an extensive network of pathways to virtually every neighborhood. Madison, 
Wis., has a bike thoroughfare that carries 7,000 bikers a day through the heart 
of the city. New York City is planning a 500-mile network of bike routes 
through Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation experts point out that if 10% of car commuters switched to a 
combination of public transit and bicycles, the nation's saving in fuel costs 
would be $1 billion a year. Additionally, they say, traffic problems would be 
greatly reduced because 18 bikes can be parked in the space needed by one car. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many companies encouraging bike commuting, Fleetwood Enterprise Inc. in 
Riverside, the world's largest maker of recreational vehicles and manufactured 
homes, is considered among the most innovative. 
</P>
<P>
 Its four-year-old program, known as "Blood, Sweat and Gears," provides 
bike-commuting employees with shower and parking facilities, free helmets, 
reflective vests, headlights and mirrors, discounts at a local bike shop, a 
work area and tools to fix flats and make repairs, and a guaranteed ride home 
-- by car -- for family emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, more than 10% of Fleetwood's 650 employees were bicycling to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Roberta Holden, Fleetwood's employee-transportation coordinator: "This 
isn't the answer to all our congestion and pollution problems, but it's 
certainly one of the strategies that needs to be considered."

BIKING, SWIMMING, YES -- WALKING? NO WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Schlosberg, a former editor at 
Shape magazine, leaves April 18 for a 3,300-mile bike trip across the United 
States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a phenomenon begging to be explained: 
</P>
<P>
 I will bicycle across North Dakota in a thunderstorm, I will wake up at 6 a.m. 
to swim a mile in the 57-degree ocean, and I will spend three hours in the gym 
toning my triceps, deltoids and other assorted muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under no circumstances, however, will I walk more than one block to work. Or 
to any place else, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's no parking space within 100 yards of my Woodland Hills office, I 
will circle the block until a car pulls out. Or -- despite threatening notices 
that have appeared on my windshield -- I will park in the lot next door, which 
has a sign that says, "Private Property. All cars without permit will be 
towed." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, I quite enthusiastically bicycled 80 miles a day for 48 days, 
transporting myself from Seattle to the Jersey shore. But rather than walk five 
minutes from any given campground to the Dairy Queen, I would stand on a street 
corner for 20 minutes until I succeeded in hitching a ride. (You can do this 
sort of thing safely in Malta, Mont.) I did briefly halt the practice in West 
Virginia, after catching a lift with a professor returning from a lecture on 
reptiles. I didn't enjoy sharing the bed of his pickup with the leftovers from 
his snake's dinner: a caged trio of rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, my life is governed by the fact that I am too lazy to walk 75 
feet. Am I truly lazy? Or am I merely a product of contemporary society, which 
has turned the original notion of physical activity on its head? 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, I will engage in physical activity when it has no purpose other 
than to cause profuse sweating, lactic-acid burn or the transformation of my 
face into a large tomato. But I refuse to increase my heart rate when it will 
serve any practical purpose, such as getting me from my Honda to my cubicle at 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of an intelligent explanation for this behavior, I called my friend 
Julie, a graduate student who knows how to conjugate Latin verbs and writes 
papers titled, "A Comparative Analysis of a Quasi-Experimental and a Randomized 
Comparative Post-Test Evaluation Design." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie said I can't blame contemporary society; I really should blame myself. 
She did allow me to blame Los Angeles, where I have lived my entire 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You live in a warped city," she said. "You were raised to believe that you 
should drive from your front door to your mailbox, but that you should spend at 
least 10 hours a day on the StairMaster. You really can't help it that you're 
incapable of walking three feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, who has never spent two minutes on a StairMaster, lives in Ann Arbor, 
Mich., and claims that she enjoys her 35-minute walk to class. "I love it," she 
said. "It totally pumps me up, even when it's 20 below and mucus freezes." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite satisfied with Julie's explanation, I contacted an exercise expert, 
Dr. Stephen Blair of the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. In 
his book "Living With Exercise," Blair encourages people to incorporate 
exercise into their everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his suggestions: Go for a two-minute walk during TV commercials and walk 
across the hall to speak to a colleague rather than use the phone. Blair's book 
is intended for sedentary types, not avid cyclists who spend 40 minutes 
searching for a good parking space. But Blair knew what I was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 He said I shouldn't blame myself or Los Angeles for my laziness. Instead, he 
went with the contemporary-society theory. "In ages past," he explained, 
"energy expenditure was more a normal part of the day. We've just been 
successful in engineering it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said the phenomenon began about 10,000 years ago, when humans 
domesticated plants and animals, stopped wandering across large geographical 
areas and settled in fertile valleys to grow crops. By the 18th Century, we 
congregated more and more in cities, and eventually we reached a point where we 
get pizza delivered and refuse to change the channel without the remote. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair pretty much got me off the hook. Still, I can't help but believe that 
there's something inherent in my personality that precludes me from exercising 
for any sensible purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 When I try to imagine myself roaming the savanna to gather roots and seeds, 
hunting wild game on the plains and carrying the meat back to camp, the picture 
is a bit fuzzy. Somehow, though, I can imagine hanging out in my cave and 
bench-pressing buffalo bones.

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; A BOSNIA WITH NO MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no map for the new country being created by Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats because rebel Serbs still occupy more than 40% of its coveted territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials mediating the latest round of peace talks for war-battered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina refuse to be discouraged by such details.

 On Friday, political leaders of the Bosnian Muslims and Croats who had been 
fighting each other until a few days ago are due in Washington for a ceremony 
to endorse the draft constitution they have written for their 
yet-to-be-delineated state.

DOCUMENTARY; FOUR YEARS AFTER THE WALL'S FALL, GERMANS ARE TROUBLED, HAUNTED; 
THE EUPHORIA OF THE EAST-WEST REUNION HAS FADED, A JOURNALIST FINDS. PEOPLE ARE 
SUSPICIOUS AND SHRINK FROM A DEMANDING FUTURE.

<P>
 The Berlin Wall had fallen the night before, and the mined, barbed-wire, inner 
German frontier had been open less than a day when I arrived at the busy 
Helmstedt checkpoint to witness the euphoric reunions of Germans east and west. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotion of those initial hours in the cold November of 1989 stayed with me 
for months, as did many other symbolic things that happened that day: the 
Helmstedt police who put marigolds rather than tickets under the windshield 
wipers of eastern cars illegally parked in the town's main square, the nervous 
excitement of the young East German mother, toddler on her arm, lined up at the 
Town Hall to collect her 100 mark (about $65) "welcome present," and the 
Germans crowded onto autobahn overpasses waving at the sputtering little 
Trabant cars of the easterners as they passed below, moving west. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nearly a year later in Berlin -- well after the glow had faded from the 
Great Reunion -- that I saw another West German waving at a sputtering Trabant. 
This time there were no smiles. The Trabi, trapped in rush hour chaos, its 
confused driver obviously lost in the western part of the city he hardly knew, 
had simply come to a halt. Blocked on all sides, the impatient westerner began 
to rage, honking his horn, yelling and flapping his arms at the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time that scene became my metaphor to describe the chemistry 
between Germans east and west. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first arrived in Germany just over four years ago, I came to a nation 
expectant, hopeful, optimistic. The prospects for peace and prosperity in 
Europe seemed boundless, and no country stood to win more from all this than a 
freshly reunited Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 As West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his delegation winged its way home 
from the Soviet Caucusus in July, 1990, after winning Mikhael S. Gorbachev's 
approval for German unity, the mood was so high that one reporter in the press 
corps joked that we didn't need the plane to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has long since come back to earth. With a thud. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, I depart a very different country -- a troubled, worried land, whose 
people wrestle with ghosts of a turbulent past, who seem fixated more by the 
problems than the potential of their new unity and who visibly shrink from a 
future that demands more from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor who steered the Germans to unity is today equally unpopular on 
both sides of the old divide. The status of politicians as a group has fallen 
so low that the country's premier jelly bean maker, Haribo, decided to 
discontinue a line of candy shaped to the likeness of national leaders because 
of falling sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans are disgusted with their leaders, even sugar-coated. 
</P>
<P>
 For a people instinctively suspicious and wary of change, simply too much has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Soviet Bloc has become dangerously unstable, and neo-fascists such 
as ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky (dubbed the "Russian 
Hitler" by the German tabloid press) seem to appear from nowhere and rattle 
nuclear sabers. Foreigners cascade into the country seeking political asylum 
and a better life, unemployment is soaring and economists warn that the 
nation's days of affluence have peaked. Meanwhile, the dream of European unity 
-- long an anchor of German post-World War II identity -- is fading as the 20th 
Century nears a close. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative effect of all this has left Germany paralyzed by a bout of 
Kleinmut , a German word that means a failure of courage at the crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning over breakfast during the first heady days after the Berlin Wall 
collapsed, historian Michael Stuermer tempered his own excitement with a twinge 
of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only worry," he mused, "is that we Germans won't realize what a tremendous 
opportunity this is." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuermer knows his country well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the east, the prevailing mood gradually turned from unrestrained hope to 
disillusionment as unemployment grew and westerners began treating easterners 
-- ossies in the western slang -- as second-class citizens. At the same time, 
resentment grows in the west as living standards drop and government funds 
continue to flow eastward. The national weekly, Die Woche, recently headlined a 
cover story, "Can We Still Afford the East?" 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the east, in the shadow of the Polish border, Bonn is, quite 
literally, a world away. The distance is only accentuated by the dearth of 
easterners with any influence in the German capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kohl's 18-member Cabinet and the chairs of Bundestag's 36 committees, 
subcommittees and special commissions, easterners number a grand total of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 For the foreseeable future, the east will survive on western subsidies that 
will allow them to buy western goods shipped to their doorstep. Not 
surprisingly, the young and talented continue to go west. The Federal 
Statistics Office last November reported an alarming 21% drop in the number of 
15- to 25-year-olds in the east since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This array of domestic worries has added to Germany's reluctance to take on 
the international responsibilities of a large and wealthy democracy. More than 
three years after Germany regained its full sovereignty, there is neither the 
necessary two-thirds majority in Parliament nor much public enthusiasm to lift 
a constitutional restriction that would permit German military forces to 
participate fully with its allies in U.N. peacekeeping operations or in 
out-of-area activities with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions on the issue among Germans inevitably split into what I call the 
Helmut Kohl and author Guenter Grass factions. (Aware of the political dangers 
of isolation, Kohl has consistently pushed for a normal military German role, 
while Grass contends just the opposite -- a view summed up with his famous 
statement, "We can never get beyond Auschwitz and shouldn't even try.") At 
least in the debates I've listened to, the majority sentiment clearly seems to 
lie with Grass. 
</P>
<P>
 This present mood -- what a recent RAND Corp. study labeled "Germany's culture 
of reticence" -- leaves the region's biggest and richest nation as a minor 
player in events that affect its future. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure whether I'm relieved or alarmed that so many Germans seem content 
for things to stay just as they are. What I am sure of is that the country's 
mass circulation daily Bild-Zeitung fits somewhere into this national 
insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, its editors conjure up new, ingenious ways to stoke the national 
Angst -- usually in huge front-page headlines whose very size exude alarm: 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian Hitler: Nuke Germany!" 
</P>
<P>
 "North Sea: Poison Everywhere, Massive Catastrophe" 
</P>
<P>
 Or, on a slow news day: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ripped Open! Five Children Dead in Their Beds." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Bild noteworthy is the paper's enormous success. It sells well over 
4 million copies a day, making it Europe's largest-selling daily newspaper. I 
leave still mystified by the perverse chemistry between Bild and its readers. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it in the German character that draws readers in such numbers each 
morning to news presented in ways that would make most people want to crawl 
back under the covers? 
</P>
<P>
 The problems now swirling over the country are a windfall for Bild. They have 
also led Germans to take shelter as never before in their tightly controlled 
social order -- that carefully constructed haven of laws, ordinances and 
regulations that define the rhythm of German life -- from store hours, to the 
legally enforced afternoon "quiet time," to how far away from your neighbor's 
fence you can plant a shrub. 
</P>
<P>
 I came to understand this penchant for order as a kind of national security 
blanket. As long as everyone keeps to the rules, the country will be safe. Even 
apparently harmless violations of this code are somehow viewed as a threat to 
this security, as I discovered entering a supermarket with my German 
mother-in-law last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 After finding a crowd milling around the door marked Enter, I casually walked 
through the adjacent door marked Exit. As I turned, expecting my mother-in-law 
to follow, I saw instead a look of horror cross her face as she declared 
flatly: "That, I won't be a party to." And she wasn't. She waited, as did 
everyone else, at the Enter door until the bottle-neck had cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping to all the rules of German life is tough for foreigners and is often a 
source of friction and a barrier to integration, but the rise of xenophobia and 
physical attacks on foreigners that began after I arrived is of a completely 
different order. 
</P>
<P>
 The riots against foreigners in Hoyerswerda and Rostock, the fire-bombings of 
Turkish homes in Moelln and Solingen that together claimed eight lives, and the 
7,000 less-sensational incidents of right-wing attacks recorded by federal 
authorities since unification, serve as a bitter reminder that half a century 
after the Holocaust, racial hatred still percolates in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great disappointments of my years in Germany has been not just the 
failure of the country's moderate political right to move forcefully against 
the xenophobic strains in their midst, but its latent pandering to them -- 
apparently out of fear that it could be outflanked by the likes of the former 
Waffen SS Sgt. Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the extremist Republikaner.  
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 20 elections scheduled during this year, the tendency is likely to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, many foreign correspondents based in Germany, along with human 
rights groups and Jewish organizations, have devoted considerable energy 
investigating the hard-core German right and its potential threat. I always 
came up short in my search for real leaders, meaningful organization and 
sizable funding. It may be there, but I never found it. Instead I found 
something almost as disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Germany's new hate I discovered a generation of lost, 
neglected young people, many under 15, few over 20. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country still traumatized by the Third Reich, they had found the ultimate 
attention-getter: violence with a Nazi salute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a fast-food shop in Weimar that had become a kind of hangout for 
teen-age toughs, I found it hard to attach an ideology to their violence. The 
stories of their attacks made their violence seem more like recreation -- a 
sport in which the assaults against foreigners were ends in themselves rather 
than part of a grand goal to purify Germany. They wore no uniforms, paid no 
dues, and worshiped no Fuehrer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of extremist youth I met were sure that the silent majority was on their 
side, a confirmation of the damage of government inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the silent majority looks elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a reunified Germany confronts its huge new problems, it has been quick 
to help those outside its own borders. The country shelters more refugees from 
the war in former Yugoslavia than any nation outside the immediate zone of 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The groundswell of relief sent to the former Soviet Union to prevent 
starvation during the winter of 1990-91 was one of the largest efforts of its 
kind ever mounted from one country to another. And last January, the city of 
Berlin launched a campaign for Los Angeles earthquake victims that netted more 
than half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by boxes and movers, I received one of my last calls in my Berlin 
apartment from Klaus Pakusch, a 65-year-old pensioner who had just donated $300 
to the quake fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted them to know I cared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I said I would pass on the message.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; 2 BALTIC NATIONS LOOK WEST AND EAST FOR THEIR FORTUNES; 
ESTONIA AND LATVIA ARE RISING FROM THE SOVIET WRECKAGE, LEAVING RUSSIA AND 
LITHUANIA BEHIND.

 What would you expect from Europe's youngest prime minister -- a man who 
recruits Cabinet members from among his fraternity brothers? Who used to ride 
from village to town on a bicycle, collecting stories of Stalinist oppression 
and thumbing his nose at the KGB? Who relaxes to the music of Guns 'N Roses? 
</P>
<P>
 Radical reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Estonia, a country of forests and swamps about the size of West 
Virginia, Prime Minister Mart Laar, 33, and his team have raised their young 
country from the economic wreckage of the Soviet Union, putting a spotlight on 
the Baltic region, where Latvia is also pressing forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Estonian economy shrank 20% in 1992 and 2% in 1993, the 
International Monetary Fund has predicted 6% growth this year. That would make 
it the fastest-growing economy of any in Europe or the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 World Bank officials have told the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn, the Estonian 
capital, that "they would not be surprised to see 5% (annual growth) from this 
year to the year 2000," said Ingrid Kollist, the embassy's economic officer. 
"They're very bullish on Estonia." 
</P>
<P>
 Estonian officials say unemployment runs 2% nationally, and here in Tallinn -- 
a charming European village turned boom town -- it is virtually zero. The 
newspapers are full of help wanted ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of new businesses crop up annually, and Estonian exports doubled in 
value from 1991 to 1993, from 5 billion kroons to 10 billion ($725 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit goes to the cruelly conservative policies of the Laar 
government: Social programs have been butchered, while state-owned factories 
have been told to turn a profit or fold. That and conservative monetary 
policies have kept the Estonian kroon stable and held inflation to 33% for 
1993. In Russia, by comparison, annual inflation pushing 1,000% is the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look into history, we have done exactly what Germany did after World 
War II, only Estonia is doing it without the Marshall Plan," Laar said in an 
interview in Toompea Castle, the government seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The chubby-cheeked leader and his ministers developed their game plan in 
college, poring over economics textbooks at Estonia's elite Tartu University -- 
the school Estonians with political aspirations dream of attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Laar, a historian, still attends the occasional fraternity party at the 
Estonian Students Society. He grins boyishly as he recounts his not-so-distant 
college days: He seems to have spent half his time hanging out with underground 
rock musicians, the other half gathering oral histories about resistance to the 
Soviet occupation of Estonia in the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who in this country has the experience for today's problems? No one," 
remarked Juri Luik, Laar's 27-year-old foreign minister. "We at least gathered 
our experience from Western books, and we're now trying to implement those 
ideas," he said. And not without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Estonians say life is harder than ever. Average monthly salaries are 
about 1,200 kroons ($87), while senior citizens scrape by on monthly state 
pensions of 500 kroons ($36). Surveys suggest Estonians spend 40% of their 
income on food alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is balanced, but government salaries and pensions are so low that 
Tallinn's firemen frequently picket the Parliament. Approval ratings for Laar's 
government hover around 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, who make up a surly, subsidy-fattened lobby throughout the former 
Soviet Union, are particularly unhappy. Yet when farmers gathered earlier this 
month for an angry conference to demand more subsidies, Laar coolly suggested 
they package their products more attractively and hope Estonians will buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we are not very popular," Laar said in his office. "People complain 
that we don't like the elderly, we don't like children, we don't like sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the toughest moment for any government: when the economy zooms up but 
there's no money in people's pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Such nonchalance, according to 28-year-old Estonian Defense Minister Indrek 
Kannik, is the prerogative of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Younger people have their whole lives ahead of them," he said. "They are more 
willing to make unpopular decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Popular or not, Laar's program works. Two years ago, there were 2,000 private 
companies in Estonia. Today, estimates range from 40,000 to 60,000. Thirty 
percent of the population last year switched jobs -- usually leaving the state 
sector for the private. 
</P>
<P>
 No other former Soviet republic has enjoyed such success. In nearby Lithuania, 
for example, a largely Communist government elected in 1992 and the powerful 
farmers lobby have gummed up efforts at reform. Inflation in 1993 was 183%, 
while salaries are about half those in Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Ukraine, drifting politically, have only fitfully tried to wean 
inefficient state-run factories from government money. Former Russian Economics 
Minister Yegor T. Gaidar had advocated Estonian-style radical reform, but the 
Russian Parliament thwarted his efforts and engineered his downfall this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, among the former Soviet republics, only Estonia's neighbor Latvia is 
doing half so well. Its numbers don't look good, but they're better than the 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia's economy shrank by 40% over the past two years, mostly, according to 
Economics Minister Ojars Kehris, "in the unproductive agricultural and 
industrial sector." Kehris added that "many enterprises will go bankrupt in the 
near future, and that is normal and necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia's unemployment is 8%, and the government stands on a tenuous coalition 
of farmers and free marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, aware of an implicit comparison with Estonia's 
Wunderkind, laughed wryly when asked his age. "I'm 51, but I feel much 
younger," he said, and then defended his competence not by citing his 
distinguished law career -- Birkavs was president of Latvia's Lawyers Society, 
which in 1988 became the first freely elected lawyers society in the Soviet 
Union -- but with a long discussion of his passions for tennis and sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Birkavs has a commendable record managing his country's economy as well. 
Latvia's 1993 inflation was an acceptable 35%, while aggressive bank reforms 
have made the capital, Riga, a blossoming financial center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not just the Switzerland of the former Soviet Union. We are in a 
position to compete with Switzerland itself as a world financial center," 
Birkavs said. "Russians, Belarussians and other Soviets like to bank here, 
because they have old ties, and they don't have a language barrier since we 
speak Russian." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, Latvian banks held deposits of about 99 million lats ($174 
million); by January, 1994, that figure had quintupled to 492 million lats. 
"You have a wave of money flowing over this country," said Jonathan Bemis, 
economic officer for the U.S. Embassy in Riga. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the crest of that wave is Latvia's new currency -- the handily named 
lat -- introduced two years ago. The Estonian kroon, adopted at about the same 
time, was pegged to the German mark at 8 to 1 and has been one of Europe's 
steadiest currencies. But the Latvians -- out-free-marketing even the Estonians 
-- let their currency find its own value. The result has been astonishing. 
While the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian karbovanets have tumbled, the lat has 
steadily climbed. One lat was valued at $1.17 in January, 1993, and at $1.70 in 
January, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the lat gains about two U.S. cents against the dollar every month," 
said Economics Minister Kehris proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia is sandwiched between Estonia to the north and Lithuania to the south. 
Riga, a city of 900,000, is the largest Baltic port and the closest thing to a 
regional metropolis. Tallinn, a city and port half the size of Riga, looks 
quaint in comparison, while the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, is a sleepy, 
landlocked town. 
</P>
<P>
 Riga's size and location make it the commercial center of gravity. Foreign 
firms with an eye to doing business in Russia -- Kellogg's, for example, which 
is building a $22-million cereal factory -- choose Latvia and Riga as 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an attitude in the business world here that it is Latvia's future to 
act as a gateway to Russia, a Hong Kong, a stable platform for business with a 
large, troubled but economically interesting neighbor," said Bemis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg's aside, however, most headquarters so far are largely symbolic 
offices. Uldis Vitolins, director of a government agency charged with courting 
foreign capital, said 1993 brought a mere $50 million in foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Estonia is only now beginning to make noises about playing Hong Kong to the 
Soviet market. So far the Estonians have prided themselves on, in the words of 
President Lennart Meri, "cutting the colonial links" with the Soviet Union and 
forging new links with Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the $65 million in foreign investment Estonia enjoyed in 1993 came 
from Finland, while 80% of the tourists visiting Estonia last year were Finns. 
Estonian and Finnish are similar languages, and Estonians, who could tune in 
Finnish TV even in the pre-Gorbachev era, had a huge head start on glasnost.  
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Finnish TV, for example, Estonians understand that when it comes to 
selling, a pretty wrapper is crucial. For instance, Estonian yogurt, fancily 
and brightly decorated, would look at home on the shelves of an American 
grocery store; Latvian yogurt is wrapped in a faded label. 
</P>
<P>
 While local business magazines hail the Renaissance of Estonian design, 
Estonian products have poured into northwest Russia in the past six months. 
Russians who would never buy anything "Soviet" snatch them up, convinced by the 
fancy packaging that they are buying Finnish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an Estonian toothbrush and Estonian toothpaste," said George Shabad, 
24, a sales representative for the Baltic News Service who travels often 
between Moscow and Tallinn. "My suit jacket is Estonian, my shirt, my tie. 
Estonian products are cheap and good; Russian products are expensive and bad." 
</P>
<P>
 So who's ahead -- Estonia or Latvia? 
</P>
<P>
 Latvian Economics Minister Kehris parries the question by noting a free-trade 
agreement all three Baltic states signed last fall. The 200-page pact creates a 
single Baltic market of 8 million people and ultimately envisions open borders 
and a single visa regime. According to Kehris, the Baltics will rise and fall 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonians, for their part, prefer a different question: Who's ahead -- 
Estonia or Finland? 
</P>
<P>
 Most Estonians believe that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states under 
the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact sidetracked them from their rightful 
destiny as an economic superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had not been occupied, I think we would have displayed the same growth 
tendencies as those countries we were level with in the 1940s," said Deputy 
Chancellor Peeter Tohver. "Countries like Finland, Sweden, even Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one important economic indicator puts Latvia ahead. Riga will get the 
first McDonald's, tentatively scheduled to open in December. Tallinn's 
McDonald's should follow a month later. Winning the Race While Russia's economy 
sputters, Latvia and Estonia are moving ahead. *

 The European Union's 12 foreign ministers meet here today to try to complete 
negotiations with Norway on the terms of its entry to the union. The plan is to 
present the Norwegian entry application to the European Parliament on 
Wednesday, together with those of Austria, Finland and Sweden, whose terms of 
entry have already been agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving even tougher to resolve than the entry talks themselves is the issue 
of what would constitute a so-called "blocking minority" in union voting. 
Britain and Spain are insisting on the present formula by which two big nations 
and one small one can effectively combine to block new initiatives. The others 
insist that as the union grows, so too must the blocking minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the terms of entry must be approved by the European Parliament and 
subjected to referendums in all four countries, both issues must be resolved 
this week if the enlargement is to take effect as scheduled next Jan. 1.

 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds visits Washington this week, and will 
call on President Clinton on Thursday, St. Patrick's Day, at the White House 
for a dinner honoring Irish culture in the United States.

THE WEEK AHEAD: SANTIAGO; LATIN AIR SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chile's eighth International Air and Space Fair, billed as "the most complete 
and advanced show of aerospace technology" in South America, opens Sunday in 
Santiago.About 400 exhibitors from more than 30 countries are scheduled to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars of the show are expected to include Russian SU-27, SU-30 and MIG-29 
warplanes. U.S. and French companies will compete with demonstrations of 
executive planes, the Cessna Citation VI and the Dassault Falcon 900. 
</P>
<P>
 But South American countries have also become players in the production and 
sale of warplanes and civilian aircraft. Brazilian-made aircraft have cracked a 
number of overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who took office Friday, will officially open 
the fair.

DOING BUSINESS; TINY ISLAND ANGLING FOR OFFSHORE BANKING; MALAYSIA'S REMOTE 
LABUAN HAS NO NATURAL RESOURCES AND LITTLE INDUSTRY. BUT IT HAS LOTS OF 
AMBITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, a short geography quiz: You may have heard of Grand Cayman, Malta and 
even Guernsey. But can you find Nauru, Vanuatu and Labuan? And what do they all 
have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they are all fairly remote islands. But all six also are up-and-coming 
IOFCs, an acronym in the banking industry for international offshore financial 
centers. They may epitomize the term backwater, but they are attracting 
billions of dollars in investments and deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 The granddaddy of offshore banking was, of course, Switzerland, which provided 
overseas depositors with the first guarantees of secrecy and low taxes on their 
wealth. But Switzerland is highly regulated and more and more open about its 
banks, so depositors with money to park "offshore" have increasingly looked 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Labuan is the latest island to join the rush for offshore banks and companies. 
A flyspeck on most world maps, Labuan lies just off the northern coast of the 
island of Borneo, about 80 miles southwest of the city of Kota Kinabalu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malaysian government decided in 1989 to turn Labuan into an offshore 
financial center, enacting bank secrecy laws, making the island a duty-free 
port and imposing a corporate tax of just 3%, up to a maximum of $7,800, 
compared with the 40% corporate tax rate in the rest of Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ramli Othman, an official with the Malaysian Industrial 
Development Board, the government chose the island because it has no natural 
resources and little industry to provide jobs for its 50,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia wrested control of the island from the state of Sabah in 1984, and it 
is now ruled as a federal territory -- a little bit like the District of 
Columbia -- directly from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. So the 
government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed had a strong political reason 
for wanting to pump development dollars into the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, more cynical view of the government's motives, which is expressed by 
critics on Labuan, is that senior government officials bought up land on the 
island at bargain prices and now stand to make large profits. In a recent court 
case, for example, it was revealed that a former chief minister of Sabah, 
Harris Mohammed Salleh, claimed to be the owner of the island's only golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 A more unlikely spot for a financial center would be hard to imagine. The 
35-square-mile island is a 20-minute propeller plane flight from Kota Kinabalu, 
which is itself not exactly world renowned. 
</P>
<P>
 The island had a fleeting fame in the closing days of World War II as the site 
of a sharp battle between Japanese and Australian forces. The airport exists 
thanks to the Japanese occupation army, and there are large war memorials to 
Japanese and Australian soldiers on opposite sides of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before offshore banking came along, the island's main sources of income 
derived from its geography: as a port to ships serving the offshore oil 
industry in the waters off Borneo and as a somewhat tawdry rest-and-recreation 
spot for expatriates resident in Brunei, which is Islamic and allows no 
alcohol. The main town of Labuan has a large number of crowded discotheques. 
</P>
<P>
 The government reckons that its location may help Labuan catch on among 
foreign banks because it is just two hours behind the time in Tokyo and in the 
same time zone as Hong Kong and Singapore. The hope is that customers will 
prefer to deposit their cash in a bank in the same time zone as these major 
financial centers rather than in one halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The location of Labuan is ideal, in the heart of the Asia-Pacific region," 
said Mainor Awang, general manager of the Labuan Development Authority. After 
three years as an active offshore financial center, Labuan has attracted 16 
banks, he said, and about 250 companies have registered here. 
</P>
<P>
 The government hopes those numbers will swell following the completion of a 
huge financial park costing $148 million. The center will feature five 18-story 
buildings, two of them apartments and the remainder offices and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two five-star hotels are under construction nearby, and a 
$50-million marina project is on the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malaysian government is trying to be selective about which banks are given 
licenses to operate in Labuan because choosing which customers can use the 
island's facilities will be solely up to the banks. The belief is that 
prominent banks will weed out suspicious characters so that Labuan will not get 
the reputation as a repository for drug money that has afflicted some other 
offshore centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we confine ourselves to big banks that will not do something which will 
smear their name, that in itself is a protective measure," said Mohammed 
Ibrahim, the representative of Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank. According 
to Malaysian press reports, deposits in Labuan banks are now estimated at about 
$1.8 billion and they have loaned $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, most of Labuan's business has been in Malaysia rather than 
overseas. By offering lower tax rates, the government made it cheaper for 
foreign banks to loan money to domestic Malaysian companies, so foreign banks 
were given an incentive to set up offices in Labuan. Most of the offices are 
small, and management remains behind in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Ginsberg -- a Los Angeles accountant who publishes a newsletter called 
Offshore Outlook, which specializes in covering the world's 40 or so offshore 
banking centers -- said he believes Labuan has great potential because of its 
location but that it is still not competitive with some other centers. For 
example, Ginsberg said, 15,000 companies a year have been registering in the 
British Virgin Islands and Grand Cayman. The majority of these are based in 
Hong Kong but incorporate overseas to protect their offshore income from Hong 
Kong taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg said that while Labuan charges a maximum $7,800 corporate tax a year, 
it is at a disadvantage compared with the British Virgin Islands and Grand 
Cayman, which have no taxes at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg suggested that Labuan should rewrite its tax laws to compete with 
Grand Cayman and urged Malaysia to permit trading of actual goods in Labuan, 
which would allow companies to take advantage of the location as a warehousing 
center for cargo moving around the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Samoa, another Pacific island that has gone into offshore business, 
lets companies register for several years at one time and allows them to use 
Chinese characters -- a clear appeal to Hong Kong firms, Ginsberg noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Another paradox is that while Labuan was designated an offshore center in a 
bid to provide jobs for people on the island, nearly all of the people involved 
in the banking industry have been imported from faraway Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not very much benefit to the local people," said Zaini Mohammed Isa, 
an opposition politician. "Before, all the heads of government departments in 
Labuan were from Labuan or at least Sabah. Now they are all from West 
Malaysia." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the problem, government officials such as Awang of the 
Labuan Development Authority maintain that the local people "don't have the 
expertise" and that skilled workers are needed from the start. "We have to 
learn from somebody," Awang said, noting that he too is from Kuala Lumpur.

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; U.S.-INDIA RELATIONS TURN SOUR; BOTH ARE DEMOCRACIES WITH 
VALUES IN COMMON. U.S. INVESTMENT POURS IN. ON ONE LEVEL, TIES HAVE NEVER BEEN 
STRONGER. SO WHAT'S WRONG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One country is the world's most populous democracy, the other its wealthiest. 
Both cast off the yoke of the same colonial power but kept its language. One 
has the biggest free-market economy, the other is moving in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, have relations between India and the United States seemed so sour 
lately? 
</P>
<P>
 The top U.S. official for India, Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel, is 
due in New Delhi next week. "It's unlikely that the inventory of the protocol 
division of the Ministry of External Affairs includes a black carpet," snapped 
the Hindustan Times newspaper. "But there is still time to acquire one." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President K. R. Narayanan, who was his country's envoy to Washington in 
the early 1980s, is said to have observed that India and the United States are 
nations divided by the same political system. And Dennis Kux, a career Foreign 
Service officer, pointedly titled his new history of Indo-U.S. relations 
"Estranged Democracies." 
</P>
<P>
 Superficially, events over the past six months seem to bear them out. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Raphel -- a former diplomat in New Delhi, a friend of President 
Clinton's and the first head of the State Department's new Bureau for South 
Asian Affairs -- made some remarks on the sensitive issue of separatism in the 
northern Indian state of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 Kashmir joined India 47 years ago because of a maharaja's wish. When Raphel 
suggested that might not be enough to grant India perpetual title, Indian 
correspondents treated her off-the-record comment as tantamount to a U.S. 
statement putting India's territorial wholeness in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, the White House added fuel to an anti-American blaze already 
raging in Indian dailies. A form letter to a pro-secessionist Kashmiri group, 
bearing Clinton's signature, said, "I look forward to working with you and 
others to help bring peace to Kashmir." In another missive to a congressman 
about conflict in the Indian state of Punjab -- cradle of the Sikh minority and 
also home to a secession drive -- Clinton wrote of the need to safeguard "Sikh 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 A gleeful band of Sikhs who accuse India's Hindu majority of genocide of their 
people bestowed on Clinton the honorary title of nawab. But much of the Indian 
Establishment fumed at what they interpreted as Washington's trafficking with 
its enemies. The Press Trust of India said that a "virulent group of 
anti-Indian officials" had grabbed control of U.S. policy. The Pakistani high 
commissioner, Riaz Khokhar, noted with amused satisfaction that he was no 
longer the most unpopular person in Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outrage of journalists, politicians and participants in orchestrated 
protests on the broad streets near the U.S. Embassy is just one theme in the 
schizophrenic story of U.S.-Indian relations these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dig deeper, and it becomes clear that ties between this former Soviet proxy 
and Moscow's chief Cold War adversary have never been sounder or broader-based. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more open India, more than $1 billion in new U.S. investment was approved 
by the Indian government last year -- more than in all the other years since 
Indian independence combined. Two-way trade was around $7 billion, with India 
the net leader by about half a billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, India's president, Shankar Dayal Sharma, used the tried-and-true 
language of anti-colonialism to reject foreign "interference" but was 
chauffeured to an official function in a Chevrolet. And a leftist-proposed 
boycott of Coke and Pepsi this month fizzled before it began. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Indian diplomats are co-sponsoring U.N. resolutions on controlling 
weapons proliferation; last year the two navies held their first joint 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the sound and fury may be a last gasp of the anti-Americanism that was 
once rife in the Indian political and foreign policy Establishment. To many, 
the United States was the architect of Union Carbide's deadly plant in Bhopal 
and, most worrisome of all, an ally of archfoe Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 In larger terms, the collapse of the Soviet Union left India without its most 
influential friend on the diplomatic scene and tore the rudder off its foreign 
policy. It is still seeking a new course in the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Indian journalists blame their colleagues assigned to Washington or the 
foreign affairs beat for blowing largely harmless remarks out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't understand what they're writing about," said Subhash Chakravarti, 
diplomatic editor of the prestigious Times of India. India's leaders are said 
to be unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government at the top is more inclined to look at the opportunities 
rather than the problems," a high-ranking U.S. diplomat said. On the most 
important issue for Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's government, economic 
reform, U.S. support has been steadfast and tangible. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single Indian viewpoint, of course, but many Indians feel 
Americans don't pay enough heed to their sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country is a young one, really," one former ambassador said. "We feel it 
is still fragile. How would you feel if we said that California was a 'disputed 
territory' of the U.S.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the father of modern India, found 
Americans "immature" in their political thinking. He drew the conclusion after 
his first visit to the United States in the fall of 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 As author Kux recounts, the Cambridge-educated premier found talk at the White 
House less than stimulating -- a main topic of one dinner discussion between 
then-President Harry S. Truman and Vice President Alben Barkley concerned the 
merits of Kentucky bourbon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nehru's supercilious judgment is being heard in updated form today. "One 
explanation for what is happening is that the Clinton Administration is naive 
and commits blunders all over: Somalia, Bosnia, etc.," said Satish Kumar, a 
professor of diplomacy at the New Delhi university named for Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kumar doesn't feel that explains everything. "While we know that Clinton 
has made no adverse change as far as economic policy, on political and 
strategic issues there is a distinct feeling . . . that the Clinton 
Administration has taken a turn against India," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences also abide on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and alleged 
brutalities by Indian forces fighting insurgents in Kashmir. Raphel's remarks, 
Kumar said, could be "kite-flying" to test New Delhi's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their most charitable interpretation, Indians say Clinton Administration 
officials such as Raphel are proving inept at getting their message across. The 
image they are casting, intentionally or not, from across the ocean ends up 
affecting the real stuff of relations as Indians get irked and demand that 
their government do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be ill advised to underestimate the depth of public sentiment on this 
issue," Foreign Secretary Krishnan Srinivasan cautioned an American journalist. 
India's government can't afford to underestimate that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Home Affairs Minister S.B. Chavan told Parliament that the 
United States is looking out for its own interests in Kashmir and implied that 
all the talk about human rights from Washington is a smoke screen. His 
blistering remarks drew an expression of displeasure the next day from the top 
U.S. diplomat in Delhi, Charge d'Affaires Kenneth C. Brill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brill is highly regarded by Indians, but the fact that since March, 1993, he 
and not a full-fledged ambassador has represented the United States in New 
Delhi also gives pause to some. The nomination of former U.S. Rep. Stephen J. 
Solarz (D-N.Y.), known here as a "friend of India," was held up for months as 
the FBI conducted a background check. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, the embassy in New Delhi had not been asked to seek approval 
from the Indian government, as protocol requires, before Solarz's nomination 
can be made public, an embassy official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those seeking evidence that the two democracies are still estranged, the 
lack of a U.S. ambassador is simply more proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we don't mean an insult doesn't mean that the Indians don't 
perceive it as an insult," said Sen. Hank Brown (R-Colo.), who visited in 
December. "They do."

POSTSCRIPT; A SALVADORAN REBEL'S ODYSSEY FROM OUTLAW TO POLITICIAN; NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE NIDIA DIAZ HOPES TO CHANGE SOCIETY PEACEFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As she moves from town to town campaigning for a seat in the Salvadoran 
legislature, Nidia Diaz meets friendly crowds who remember her legendary 
toughness in the face of military torture. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also meets hecklers, people who sneer at her with disdain: " 
Guerrillera !" 
</P>
<P>
 "With pride, thank you," she responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 12 years of El Salvador's brutal civil war, Diaz was one of the 
best-known guerrilleras , women rebels. In 1985, it was Diaz's guerrilla 
faction that killed four U.S. Marines and nine civilians at a sidewalk cafe in 
San Salvador's Zona Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Comandante Diaz was shot five times in an ambush, captured and 
held by the Salvadoran military for more than six months. She was eventually 
released in exchange for the daughter of then-President Jose Napoleon Duarte, 
whom guerrillas had kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 And today she is a candidate for the National Assembly, one of hundreds of 
former guerrillas who are participating in historic elections taking place 
Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Under U.N.-brokered peace accords that formally ended the war in 1992, Marxist 
rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, who for years fought a 
series of U.S.-backed governments, agreed to put down their weapons and form a 
political party. 
</P>
<P>
 The former rebels will be testing their political strength at the polls for 
the first time, after more than a decade of rejecting elections as a farce. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as any Salvadoran, Diaz embodies the difficult transition from warrior 
to politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a case study of what it takes for a guerrilla commander -- a tough one 
like she was -- to be transformed into a successful, . . . practical, pragmatic 
political leader, concerned with the day-to-day problems of her constituency," 
said Michael Gucovsky, until recently deputy chief of the U.N. peacekeeping 
mission here. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has become much more willing to engage in give and take, and not see 
issues in black and white. . . . The future of El Salvador lies (with) leaders 
like her who have made this transition." 
</P>
<P>
 The faction once commanded by Diaz, the Revolutionary Party of Central 
American Workers, was one of five groups operating under the FMLN umbrella. All 
five factions are now legal political parties, each contributing to the FMLN's 
full slate of candidates for the national legislature and mayoral seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN has joined in coalition with the leftist Democratic Convergence 
political party to support legislator Ruben Zamora for president. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling Nationist Republican Alliance candidate is Armando Calderon Sol. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other guerrillas, Diaz, 41, has traded her combat fatigues in for 
civilian clothes. Although wartime scars on her arm are still visible, she now 
wears pumps and pearls. She registered for the election under her real name, 
Maria Marta Valladares, but is campaigning under her revolutionary nom de 
guerre , Nidia Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the personal level, this is my first experience being submitted to the 
will of the people," Diaz said in an interview at party headquarters. "The 
positions of responsibility that I have had before were always given to me, or 
I was elected to them, by a small segment of society -- militants of our party. 
The decision of a small group.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today I am subject to a popular consultation. You could say I am in a display 
window, awaiting approval or rejection. And the test that is coming is a 
difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the political right refuses to believe that Diaz and other former 
rebels are committed to democracy. They say their campaign is a charade. But 
the leftists press on, and as El Salvador struggles to rebuild after a war that 
cost about 75,000 lives, Diaz has come further than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorned for years by U.S. governments because of her comrades' role in the 
Zona Rosa murders, she more recently attended last year's July 4 party at the 
U.S. Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
 But change comes slowly in El Salvador. Continuing political violence has hit 
especially close to Diaz and her faction. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Velis and Mario Lopez, two senior FMLN leaders, were killed late 
last year during a spate of unsolved murders. The Velis case is believed to be 
a political hit, while the Lopez killing took place during a foiled robbery. 
Both belonged to Diaz's Revolutionary Workers party. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, on Feb. 24, Diaz narrowly escaped an apparent assassination attempt. 
Gunmen sprayed her car with automatic gunfire, wounding her bodyguard, but Diaz 
had been dropped off shortly before the attack. Because of the car's darkened 
windows, no one on the outside could have known whether she was in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore her lingering concerns, Diaz has not yet brought her 12-year-old 
son, Jose Alejandro, to El Salvador from his exile home in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz says her background is sufficiently diverse to prepare her for democratic 
politics. She was a poll-watcher in elections in 1972 and 1977 and over the 
years worked -- albeit clandestinely -- with women's groups, in human rights 
and organizing peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she says, the left's challenge is to become an effective political force 
that can continue to provoke change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first time we are going to participate in state institutions," she 
said. "It implies a much greater level of responsibility and coherence. A 
single decision can touch on so many other (issues)." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz first attracted international attention when she participated in the 
first round of peace talks in 1984 between Duarte and the FMLN in the northern 
town of La Palma. She was one of several guerrilla commanders who came down 
from the mountains to join the ultimately fruitless talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, on April 18, she was part of a guerrilla patrol that was 
strafed by government aircraft in San Vicente province. Several companions were 
killed, and she was shot in the arm, back and legs and taken prisoner by ground 
troops. Diaz says her principal captor was an American military adviser. In her 
1988 book, "Nunca Estuve Sola" ("I Was Never Alone"), she describes him as 
"bearded, blond with Ray Bans." 
</P>
<P>
 "The yankee, with more force, twisted my left arm backwards, and the pain made 
me react," she wrote. "I felt alive and impotent; I did not want to be there, I 
wanted to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the U.S. Embassy denied her captor was linked to the U.S. 
military, saying he was a private citizen on contract to the Salvadoran Army to 
repair infrared equipment. News reports later identified him as an American 
mercenary. 
</P>
<P>
 Her captors loaded the wounded Diaz into a helicopter and transported her to a 
military base. Her initial medical treatment was cursory, she wrote, and she 
was deprived of sleep and tortured. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after her capture, Diaz's faction carried out one of the war's most 
notorious massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 An urban commando opened fire on a strip of sidewalk cafes in San Salvador's 
Zona Rosa on June 19. Four off-duty, unarmed Marines were killed, along with 
nine civilians. Although Diaz was in jail, U.S. officials accused her of 
responsibility because of her senior position in the Revolutionary Workers 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was freed on Oct. 25, 1985, with 21 other political prisoners in a 
complex exchange for Duarte's daughter and 33 mayors and municipal officials, 
all of whom had been kidnaped by the FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, Diaz did political work in Cuba, Nicaragua and 
elsewhere. When serious peace talks began in 1990, she formed part of the 
rebels' delegation and eventually was one of 10 guerrilla commanders who signed 
the landmark peace accords on Jan. 16, 1992, which ended the long years of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by other rebel leaders, she returned to El Salvador after years of 
exile on Feb. 1, 1992, and slowly began a return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith that what we are going to achieve on March 20 (Election Day) 
will change the relation of forces in the national political system," Diaz 
said. "Although we may not win all levels of power, like the executive (branch) 
. . . we have a lot to gain as a new force."

MARKET SCENE; EMERALD LORDS VERSUS SQUATTERS: ROUND 2; IN A BRUTAL CORNER OF 
COLOMBIA, PLANS FOR A COMMODITY MARKET THREATEN TO REIGNITE THE WAR FOR CONTROL 
OF FABULOUS MINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, rival villages waged a brutal war here in Colombia's emerald 
zone for control of the world's largest mines. Enemies bombed each other out of 
their homes, butchered each other in cafes and dropped each other from planes. 
An estimated 3,500 people -- 5% of the local population -- were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then peace broke out. The exhausted, decimated towns buried their comrades and 
signed an accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met in the local priest's house, talked, shook hands and embraced," 
recalled Luis Murcia, a local emerald lord who lost a brother and two cousins 
in the fighting. "The next day thousands of people poured into the streets to 
celebrate, sing, dance and drink." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a proposal to revolutionize the emerald trade threatens to renew the 
violence. The handful of emerald lords who control much of the trade are 
backing the creation of the world's first commodity market, or bourse, for 
emeralds. They say it will bring prosperity and peace to the region; opponents 
say the market would allow the giant operators to corner the international 
trade, with no incentive to better the lives of impoverished miners who slog 
through knee-deep mud in search of the green gems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring the price of emeralds close to that of diamonds" for the 
benefit of the vast majority of miners, said Murcia, a squat, stocky man 
wearing a large emerald heart that dangled from a golden chain at the neck of 
his flowered shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 With a pistol in his holster, and backed by a small band of swaggering, 
heavily armed youths, Murcia enforces order over the mud streets and tin shacks 
of Cosquez, one of the mining villages at the center of the last emerald war. 
He is now in business with his former rivals, and they are enthusiastic 
supporters of the commodity exchange as a way to legitimize their sometimes 
clandestine, often brutal business. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange would be housed at a $50-million, four-building facility in 
Bogota and would create a legal system for emerald commerce. Currently, the few 
men who dominate emerald production conduct most of their sales on the black 
market to avoid paying taxes and to maximize profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's zone is the world's No. 1 producer of top-quality emeralds, experts 
here say. It also produces miners whose savagery rivals that of this country's 
more notorious drug traffickers and guerrillas. "The more you legalize the 
whole chain of the emerald trade, the less violent the zone will become," said 
Foreign Trade Secretary Juan Manuel Santos Calderon, who backs the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters here say that the market, scheduled to begin operations late this 
year or next year, will revolutionize a semi-clandestine business. They 
describe an ultramodern facility with an advanced communications system, a 
helicopter shuttle from Bogota's El Dorado airport and vaults brimming with 
emeralds for sale at the site or through branch offices in New York, Tokyo and 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the emerald trade are wary. In an irony that has not been lost 
here, one of Murcia's partners in the project and its key promoter is Victor 
Carranza, 58, a billionaire whose forces fought Murcia's brother, Carlos, in 
the last emerald war. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Murcia, killed during that struggle, had allied himself with the 
Medellin drug cartel in its bid to take over the emerald zone as a paramilitary 
base -- and as a source of gems that could be used in laundering drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 Carranza raised a private army of Uzi-wielding peasants and became a local 
hero by defeating the Medellin traffickers. He has been linked by prosecutors 
to right-wing paramilitary groups and the rival Cali drug cartel and was 
investigated in 1989 for the murders of 80 activists of the left-wing Patriotic 
Union movement. He has insisted he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some emerald traders now fear that the alliance among Carranza, Murcia and 
other once-irreconcilable foes will allow the emerald lords to monopolize the 
world market. They point to the tens of thousands of dollars that it will cost 
to participate in the exchange -- a fee within reach of the emerald lords, but 
way beyond the means of most others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emerald bourse is going to end up as a monopoly for those who administer 
it," said one emerald salesman, who predicted a surge of violence if 30,000 
emerald workers are left out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's government tried to gain control over the mayhem of the emerald 
zone by nationalizing the mines in 1946, but it could not overcome emerald 
armies determined to hang on to what is today a $1-billion-a-year business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the state retreated in 1973, pulling the police and army out of the 
zone, thousands have died in internecine wars for control of the so-called 
green gold. The emerald lords, with their private mining concessions and 
private armies, now run the territory. They administer justice at the point of 
a gun. Most people in the area live in wretched poverty while bare-chested 
teen-agers, pistols tucked into their jeans, wander the region, intimidating 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone is a caldron of violence. "There are still many blood vendettas, 
family disputes and fights for honor," said Javier Guerrero, a sociologist who 
has written on the problems of Colombian violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, an explosion caused by gases in the mining tunnels of Cosquez 
killed 11 prospectors. The local emerald company and the government responded 
by prohibiting all informal mining, effectively putting out of work tens of 
thousands of landless peasants and poor urban laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerald lords argue that the bourse will improve the lives of miners and 
bring lasting peace by creating an emerald cartel that will drive up prices for 
all producers, from the most humble to the bosses themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They seek to have all of Colombia's emeralds sold through the exchange and are 
trying to persuade Zambia, reputed to be the world's second-largest producer, 
to sell its emeralds there too. While production figures in the gem industry 
are treated with unusual secrecy, Bogota's bourse might thus gain control over 
the sale of most of the world's emerald production, determining supply,demand 
and price. Local producers, according to this scenario, would earn money that 
was unimaginable before. The emerald zone would be pacified with profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Quipama, outside the gates of Carranza's Teciminas mines, one of the 
world's largest, the poverty of thousands of prospectors raises doubts that 
such a revolution will be engineered. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at these mines, thousands stand knee-deep in a filthy, jet-black river 
digging for emeralds, unaware of the transformation about to hit their 
business. Some are small children, coated in mud and bent over heavy mining 
shovels. Some are illiterate women and old men, who have thrown away low-paying 
jobs to search for a miracle. Nearly all of them live in abject poverty, just 
out of sight of Carranza's small army of 400 heavily armed security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 On the slopes above Carranza's mines stands a field of wood and concrete 
shacks perched precariously on stilts. "Don't forget," said an emerald merchant 
standing nearby, "to ask why the vast majority of people here live in misery 
while the wealth ends up in the hands of one man."

ENVIRONMENT; LONDON COMES CLEAN IN POLL OF EUROPE'S TIDIEST CAPITALS; HERE'S 
THE DIRT: ROMANS SHOULD POOP-SCOOP MORE, AND AMSTERDAM NEEDS TO CRACK DOWN ON 
GRAFFITI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You could have fooled most Londoners when word got out that a survey of major 
European capitals showed theirs was the cleanest. 
</P>
<P>
 London residents have taken an almost perverse pride in describing their city 
as getting dirtier every year. But after years of being considered a capital of 
litter, particularly in the central tourist area, London was ranked above eight 
other European capitals in a cleanliness comparison of city centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted by the Tidy Britain Group, an anti-litter 
organization that sent pairs of observers to each city's main governmental, 
shopping, terminal and tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities ranked on a descending scale were London, Berne, Paris, Berlin, 
Amsterdam (largest city in the Netherlands, though The Hague is the capital), 
Rome, Brussels, Madrid and Athens, which the surveyors said came in a solid 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveyors attempted to measure the amount of litter, graffiti, vandalism 
and dog mess in an area of one-kilometer radius (about two-thirds of a mile) 
from four central points: a major government building, a busy shopping street, 
a major rail station and a popular central tourist spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's director, Elizabeth Allen, said: "Our surveyors found very little 
litter in central London. That may sound strange, but people sometimes judge on 
preconceptions rather than the actuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Secretary John Gummer was delighted with the results, declaring: 
"It is time we took the view which other cities have. We should praise our 
successes and celebrate that which we do well." 
</P>
<P>
 London was described in the survey as "very clean," while Berne, Switzerland, 
which won the cleanliness award two years ago, was called "generally very 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanest central shopping street was found to be Berne's Bahnhofplatz; the 
dirtiest, Boulevard Haussmann in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Rome, the Tidy Britain people reported: "The Romans have not yet learned to 
poop-scoop. It would be a much cleaner city if its citizens stopped smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Amsterdam was said to have the most prolific graffiti artists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the table, the surveyors found that Madrid was the 
dog-fouling capital of Europe, with canines defecating "anywhere and 
everywhere." But Madrid won the honors for the cleanest railroad station area. 
</P>
<P>
 And Athens (Greece currently holds the presidency of the European Union) was 
described as a grim, polluted city with a "virtual plague of cigarette butts." 
The Greeks are listed as the world's heaviest smokers after Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, despite its reputation for litter, Athens is one of the few 
capitals to have daily trash collection. But dog-ownership in the Greek capital 
has become fashionable, and the streets are increasingly fouled.  
</P>
<P>
 As an Athens official admitted: "Unlike Britain, we've never had an 
anti-litter campaign. It's a sad fact that Greeks are simply not as 
environmentally aware or as litter-trained as their European counterparts." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the Tidy Britain Group was impartial, Allen insisted: "Two years 
ago, our survey showed Berne in first place. I don't believe the study is 
biased. London, by comparison, is really clean."

NATIONAL AGENDA; POPULOUS INDIA NO CONTENDER WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTS; THE HUGE 
COUNTRY MUST OVERCOME HURDLES OF POVERTY, BUREAUCRACY AND POLITICS TO COMPETE 
EFFECTIVELY, CRITICS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 20,000-seat stadium was brand new, the weather dry and sunny, picture 
perfect for the National Games. On the eight-lane polyurethane track, India's 
fastest men pushed their feet against the blocks. "Take your marks, get set . . 
. ," the starter barked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then -- nothing but a dry click. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen times, officials lined the perspiring and increasingly frustrated 
runners up for the 100-meter race, and just as often, the starter's pistol 
refused to fire. While harried stewards searched for a new gun, longer-distance 
events were set off with a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 When another pistol was found, it was wide-striding Rajeev Balakrishnan, 22, 
who finished first, his finger triumphantly pointing at the sky. But the time 
clocked by the electrical engineering student from Iowa State University, 10.78 
seconds, was almost a half-second over the national record for the 100 set 21 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Is any more evidence needed that something is seriously the matter with Indian 
sports? "Why we have fallen so low is a basic question that every Indian is 
asking," said Narotam Puri, a celebrated New Delhi sports commentator and 
physician. "Everyone is crying himself hoarse, because . . . we have fallen on 
hard times."  
</P>
<P>
 These days sports are much more than physical recreation or strenuous 
entertainment. They are a widely accepted indicator of a country's development 
and state of public health, as well as an often manipulated vehicle for 
international and domestic political prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that reviewing the overall record is enough to make an Indian 
patriot or sports-addicted couch potato want to change the subject. At the 1992 
Barcelona Olympics, China, the world's most populous country, grabbed 54 
medals. India, the world's second-most populous country, won exactly -- none. 
</P>
<P>
 India's humbling experiences when it competes with the best and brightest in 
amateur athletics have been endless. In the past three Olympiads -- Barcelona, 
Seoul in 1988 and Los Angeles in 1984 -- individual Indian athletes didn't 
snare a single gold, silver or bronze. In fact, since Indian independence in 
1947, only one Indian has won a medal in an individual event (welterweight 
freestyle wrestler Khabasha Jadhav took the bronze in 1952). 
</P>
<P>
 All other medals have come in the national sport, field hockey, and India's 
fortunes there have collapsed since the introduction of artificial turf made 
speed and brawn more important than stickhandling. India's last Olympic medal 
in field hockey, a gold, came in 1980 at the boycott-depleted Moscow Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians are wont to compare their performance in everything from economics to 
high-tech weapons production with China, and so atrocious was Indian 
performance in the 1990 Asian games in Beijing that shamed Indian reporters 
took to turning their press credentials around to conceal their country. 
Indians won a solitary gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The ego-crushing nadir may have come this winter, when, at the South Asian 
Games, pipsqueak Nepal beat India in soccer -- a sport in which India once 
finished fourth at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughtful Indians see in their country's generalized debacle on the playing 
fields a reflection of many things they think are wrong or questionable in 
their society.  
</P>
<P>
 First, glory in sport has been supposed to serve the leadership, making it an 
affair of state. At the 1982 New Delhi Asian games, Chand Ram won the 
20-kilometer walking race. Before he could take a victory lap, he was 
frog-marched to the box of Rajiv Gandhi, then general secretary of the ruling 
Congress Party, and made to touch Gandhi's feet in obeisance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even today "what is being done is being done to please the politicians," 
tartly summarized the usually cheery Milkha Singh, 63, the "Flying Sikh" whose 
3-decade-old national records for the 200 and 400 meters have never been 
bested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indian officials are sitting between two stools" in sports, Puri said. "They 
didn't know whether to follow the socialist model where the state tried to 
control athletics, or the Western market system." The hybrid result has proven 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Since India is a democracy, it could not, like China, take children away from 
their families to hone their talents. But since sports is considered an affair 
of government, worthy of its own ministry, bureaucrats inexorably came to head 
India's sporting federations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bureaucracy has killed sports in this country," Shekhar Gupta, senior 
editor of India Today and a lifelong sports buff, complained. "All the budget 
gets eaten up by the Indian Sports Authority. It's run by IAS (Indian 
Administrative Service) officers who know as little about sports as I do about 
semiconductors." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gupta, it's people like the courtly Kanti Chodhary, 75, a member of the 
elite IAS, who epitomize the problem. The elderly civil servant has been chosen 
to head the Fencing Assn. of India, but acknowledges that the only blade he 
knows how to wield is a razor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including Puri, see India's mediocrity as a reflection of far deeper 
problems, especially low economic and social development. "The fact is, we are 
poor in sport. And we are poor in sport because we are a poor nation," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of millions of his compatriots don't get enough to eat, let alone have 
access to special nutrition or sports medicine specialists, Puri notes, and 
it's also questionable whether the vegetarian diet mandated by Hinduism 
produces champions. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also troubled by the ethos of his country, where a Vince Lombardi would 
hardly feel welcome. "Our sacred books tell us to do our duty and not to worry 
about results," Puri said. "Indian athletes generally lack the desire to be a 
world beater. And our coaches don't have the skills to put it into them." 
</P>
<P>
 There are Indians who note that cricket, now the reigning passion, is played 
by millions of youngsters and that India does field good teams. Likewise, 
Indians fare well in other sports of somewhat blue-blooded pedigree, including 
tennis, golf and billiards. That undoubtedly drains some talent. But a homebred 
Olympic champion is all it would take for people to become interested in other 
kinds of sport, Puri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision of a better future, some hope, is now rising on the dun-colored 
Deccan plateau outside the city of Pune. In a 300-day building blitzkrieg, 
workers erected the Shri Shiv Chhatrapati Sports City, including a flood-lit 
stadium with synthetic track, a velodrome, an Olympic-sized pool and a 
Wimbledon-style tennis court with galleries. A 1,000-apartment "Sports Village" 
to house athletes went up in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be our training grounds for future champions," brashly 
predicts Suresh Kalmadi, a former fighter pilot turned member of India's 
Parliament and president of the Amateur Athletics Federation of India. The 
project was Kalmadi's brainchild and that of the powerful chief minister of 
Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar. 
</P>
<P>
 And the stadium is only the beginning. Kalmadi foresees massive investment by 
private firms for the first time in the history of Indian athletics. He also 
wants to take advantage of the demise of the Soviet Union by putting some of 
its underemployed athletes under 10-year contract to supplement homebred 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maharashtra state government plowed more than $13 million into building 
the 200-acre sports complex. The Indian government chipped in $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With sweating women still carrying pails of dirt and broken rocks to the site 
to finish work on the gymnasium, the National Games, the third such 
extravaganza in India's history, opened here in January.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But while nearly 5,000 athletes took part in the 10-day meet, only a single 
national record was broken, in the women's 200-meter backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmadi points to the fact that the National Games marked the first time 
private sponsors were allowed to help bankroll the event -- in return for 
commercial consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 There lies the decisive break with India's past, Kalmadi says. Once powerful 
sponsors are involved, they will keep the federations "on their toes" and 
insist that the rupees they spend produce champions, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage private companies to foot more of the bill for sports 
development, the Indian government has devised a scheme to make company 
contributions tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalmadi promises no miracles by the time the next summer Olympiad rolls around 
in Atlanta in 1996. "The gap between other countries and our country is 
widening," he said. "Forget the international level. In the next 10 years, 
let's talk about reaching the Asian level." 
</P>
<P>
 In America, as well as countries with monolithic state-run sports programs 
like China, sports are often a stepping stone to a job, even to prosperity. In 
India, that is rarely the case -- another factor discouraging participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, those athletes who do win secure positions often seem to lose 
their hunger to excel. P.T. Usha, acknowledged as India's top sportswoman, is 
an example of the promise and problems of Indian sports. She trained as a 
teen-ager by running barefoot on the beach. The Kerala woman was fourth in the 
400-meter hurdles at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, missing a medal by a 
hundredth of a second. She never bettered that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being coached to focus on Seoul in 1988, Usha's talent was 
squandered to soothe Indians' bruised egos. At the 1985 Asian Track and Field 
Championships, she was entered in nearly every race within her range, and won 
five golds and a bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Usha has given birth to a son, now nearly 2. And she is dreaming 
of a comeback. She intends to begin racing competitively in June or July in the 
400 meters, with her eye on the Asian games in Hiroshima in October.

SMOKING BANNED BY O.C.-BASED TACO BELL CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Taco Bell Corp. said Monday that it will ban smoking at its company-owned 
restaurants and that most of its franchisees are expected to follow suit, 
giving the Mexican-style fast-food chain the largest number of smoke-free 
outlets in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company said it will snuff out cigarettes, cigars and pipes 
at its 3,300 company locations nationwide on March 28 and that at least 1,000 
additional sites owned by franchisees will also ban smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's action follows similar steps taken by other fast-food chains, 
including No. 1 McDonald's Inc., as the effects of second-hand smoke -- 
especially on children -- are being scrutinized more closely at local and 
federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Surgeon Gen. Joycelyn Elders on Monday praised Taco Bell, McDonald's and 
other smoke-free chains that cater to youths. "I'm very grateful that many of 
our fast-food restaurants are taking this stand for our children, who cannot 
decide their own environment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, (D-Los Angeles), who is sponsoring federal legislation 
to ban smoking in public places, said that Taco Bell's decision "shows a real 
sense of corporate responsibility for the health of customers, especially 
children, who should not to be forced to breathe in someone else's smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's action follows a trend that has been growing for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the California Restaurant Assn. called for legislation to ban 
smoking in all restaurants. Two years ago, the Carl's Jr. and Chuck E. Cheese 
chains banned smoking in company-owned eateries. And Arby's and Dairy Queen 
announced plans earlier this year to eliminate smoking at company-owned units. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's Corp., bowing to pressure from consumer groups, said three weeks 
ago that it would ban smoking at 1,400 company outlets. About 2,200 franchise 
units were already smoke-free, bringing the company's total nonsmoking units to 
3,600 of its 9,100 restaurants nationwide. No other franchisees have yet 
adopted the company's policy, a spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's decision, therefore, affects more sites immediately. The 
company-owned locations consist of 3,100 full-service eateries and 200 
limited-menu outlets called Taco Bell Express. All but 400 of the company's 
1,400 franchise restaurants have indicated that they will probably adopt a 
smoking ban, spokeswoman Janis Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Texas attorney general sued Taco Bell, McDonald's and three 
other major chains, alleging that they endangered the health of patrons -- 
particularly children -- by exposing them to second-hand smoke. It was unclear 
Monday what effect Taco Bell's action would have on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the company's decision was not an effort to settle the suit. "This 
is something we've looked at a long time and something our customers want," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed a 12-month nationwide customer survey conducted by an 
independent firm, Smith said. The statistics showed that 70% of Taco Bell 
customers who smoked and 84% of customers who didn't favored smoke-free 
fast-food establishments. In addition, the survey found that 71% of Taco Bell's 
customers are nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders say that the number of smoke-free restaurants will continue 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think smoking bans will have virtually no effect on fast-food restaurants," 
said Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco. "You wait in line, you eat, you go. And the drive-through business 
will be completely unaffected." 
</P>
<P>
 Full-service restaurants, on the other hand, suffer when smoking is not 
allowed, Mueller said. "At a restaurant where customers sit at a table for an 
hour or two, it really detracts from a smoker's pleasure not to be able to 
smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tobacco industry doesn't think that fast-food chains can ignore 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell's decision potentially alienates up to 30% or more of its customer 
base," said Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, the trade 
association for the cigarette industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of any business that can afford to do that," he said. "There 
has been a concentrated effort by anti-smoking groups to pressure chain 
restaurants to ban smoking. It's not fair to their customers, who will go to 
restaurants that welcome smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza Hut, for instance, is "on the cusp" between fast-food and sit-down 
family restaurants, spokesman Rob Doughty said. Customers stay in fast-food 
eateries an average of 15 minutes, but they stay in Pizza Hut an average of 45 
minutes, he said. Three studies showed that a no-smoking policy would hurt the 
company's business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies are fighting back. Philip Morris U.S.A., the nation's 
biggest cigarette maker, and a small number of restaurant owners are pushing a 
ballot initiative in California to invalidate ordinances that have been adopted 
by more than 100 cities, including Los Angeles, to ban smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weight of official studies is against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency officially branded secondary 
tobacco smoke a human carcinogen, concluding that it causes 20% of all lung 
cancers in the United States not attributed directly to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's finding sparked a spate of workplace smoking bans by employers 
who feared a rash of lawsuits by employees and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-hand smoke, for instance, can trigger asthma attacks in children who 
suffer from that respiratory ailment, said Marian O'Sullivan, a health educator 
with the American Lung Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan applauded Taco Bell's decision. "Kids love Taco Bell, so it's 
wonderful that the restaurants now will be smoke-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Other fast-food chains are considering smoking bans. Burger King, for 
instance, is tracking consumer complaints through a toll-free telephone line 
but hasn't seen a "clear consensus from customers," spokesman Michael Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky Fried Chicken has been conducting surveys as Taco Bell did and 
expects to have results within a month, spokeswoman Jean Litterst said. KFC, 
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are all owned by Pepsico Inc. in Purchase, N.Y., but 
set their policies separately. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wendy's International Inc., executives are concerned about related issues. 
The company isn't sure it wants to turn its employees into enforcers, and it 
doesn't want to get into a fight with franchisees who don't want to go along 
with a smoking ban, spokesman Mike Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the market gets closer and closer to deciding that a ban is what they 
want, we'll obviously start moving" toward that, Jenkins said.

8 OFFICIALS PLEAD GUILTY IN HONDA BRIBERY CASE; COURTS: FIVE ARE FROM O.C. FIVE 
MORE EX-EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING LAGUNA HILLS MAN, CHARGED IN KICKBACK SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight former executives of American Honda Motor Co., including five Orange 
County residents, have pleaded guilty in connection with a $10-million bribery 
and kickback scheme spanning 14 years, federal prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other former Honda executives, including a senior vice president from 
Laguna Hills who allegedly received $5 million in illegal cash, cars and a baby 
grand piano, were charged Monday with accepting kickbacks in return for 
providing preferential treatment to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 former executives face up to 35 years in prison on fraud-related 
charges in connection with awarding dealerships and determining which dealers 
got the company's most popular models, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Michael J. Connolly in Concord, N.H., where the investigation began. Efforts to 
reach the defendants for comment were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Honda is outraged and saddened by the criminal activities," said 
Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of the company. "These illicit acts 
represent a betrayal of trust that harmed the company and defrauded American 
Honda of millions of dollars. . . . The U.S. attorney has acknowledged that 
American Honda is a victim of fraud in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents arrested Laguna Hills resident Stanley James Cardiges, 48, at 
his Nellie Gail subdivision home on Friday and confiscated evidence, including 
furniture and financial records, said Steve Katzman, assistant U.S. attorney in 
Santa Ana. Cardiges worked for American Honda from 1977 to April 22, 1992, most 
recently as a senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Monday in Santa Ana, U.S. District Judge Ronald W. Rose set bail 
for Cardiges at $200,000. Cardiges, who was charged with racketeering, mail 
fraud and conspiracy, faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on all 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers made public Monday allege that Cardiges took about $5 million in 
illegal kickbacks from dealers in return for special consideration. Katzman 
said court records allege that dealers gave Cardiges three Rolex watches, 10 
$1,000 suits and cars that were driven by his family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that dealers also gave Cardiges a baby grand piano and 
$24,000 worth of furniture, and that Cardiges used cash from dealers to finance 
Worldwide Dive Inc., a company he founded in 1991 to sell sportswear to diving 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal charges made public on Monday and the eight guilty pleas followed 
a yearlong federal investigation sparked by a 1991 civil lawsuit in which a New 
Hampshire dealer alleged that the company failed to deliver his allocation of 
Acuras. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation subsequently spread to 26 states, including California, 
Connolly said, where investigators reviewed Honda's relationships with half a 
dozen Honda and Acura dealerships from Chula Vista to Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme involved 30 to 40 of American Honda's 550 dealers and took place 
from 1979 to 1992, Connolly said. Federal court documents suggest that the 
kickback schemes reached into San Diego County and the Sacramento area, but not 
into Orange or Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators allege that between 1979 and 1992, some of the 
defendants took an estimated $10 million in bribes, including payments of 
between $100,000 to $750,000 from people seeking new Honda and Acura 
dealerships. The indictment also alleges that some of the executives took cash 
and expensive gifts from dealers in return for increasing allotments of the 
most popular Honda and Acura models. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal investigation by Honda uncovered some schemes designed to defraud 
the company, Elliott said, but the incidents were viewed as "isolated 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 13 executives worked out of American Honda's Torrance 
headquarters. The rest, the company said, worked in regional offices across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other former executives indicted on Monday were Dennis R. Josleyn of 
Penn Valley, Calif.; David L. Pedersen of Roswell, Ga.; John W. Billmyer of 
Raleigh, N.C.; and Damien C. Budnick of Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said that agents with warrants to seize furniture, gifts and records 
arrested Cardiges at his Laguna Hills home on Friday. The four other executives 
were arrested or surrendered on Monday, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight who pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy were Robert N. 
Rivers of Irvine; Mark L. Benson of Corona del Mar; Thomas A. Caulfield and 
Robert A. Mazzitelli, both of Foothill Ranch; Edward A. Temple of Newport 
Beach; Hugh P. Cooper of Wilmington, N.C.; Frederick Meis Jr. of Coppell, Tex.; 
and Roger Novelly of Medford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Connolly would not say whether the federal investigation 
will be broadened to include other automobile companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been focused on American Honda," Connolly said. "Since it's an 
ongoing investigation, I can't tell you whether or not it will eventually 
expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott of American Honda said that the company, the U.S. distributor for 
Japan's Honda Motor Co. Ltd., will take "aggressive legal action" against those 
who are found to have defrauded the company. Honda is also developing a 
"financial disclosure policy" that will be applied to all senior executives, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana, said the payment 
of bribes "hasn't been all that common in the industry in the last 15 to 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rumors about American Honda have been going on since at least the early 
1980s, but it just isn't the sort of thing you'd expect to hear from Ford or 
Chevrolet dealers," said Peterson, whose company offers consulting services to 
auto makers, importers and dealers. "It seems to stem from having a hot brand 
and not enough cars to supply all your dealers. Having a Honda dealership in 
the late 1970s and 1980s was a license to mint money." 
</P>
<P>
 With new-car sales still slumping after four years of recession, there is 
little incentive now for dealers to pay bribes to get franchises or to secure 
more cars for their lots, said Jeremy Anwyl, an auto dealership marketing 
consultant in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The conduct described in the Honda indictments was "part of the industry a 
long time ago," he said. "It isn't much of an issue any more."

GUNMAN KILLS 3, SELF AT PLANT IN SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL and DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 A worker fired by a Santa Fe Springs electronics company killed three former 
co-workers and wounded two others Monday before fatally shooting himself, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic-stricken workers of Extron Electronics dropped to the floor or ran 
screaming from the building as the gunman yelled, "Get down!" in Vietnamese and 
began firing, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman -- identified late Monday night as Tuan Nguyen, 29, of Huntington 
Beach -- raced from one side of the plant to the other, killing two men and a 
woman, said Fidel Gonzales, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who had been dismissed last month for "unsatisfactory performance," 
then turned his .38-caliber pistol on himself, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the three dead employees as Thu Theresa Pham of Santa 
Ana, Son (Sonny) Van Truong of Pomona and Chin Van Nguyen, 27, who also goes by 
the name Christopher Arthur Nuell, of Garden Grove. Authorities said the two 
Nguyens apparently were not related. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturing plant, at 13540 Larwin Circle, produces video interfaces -- 
devices that connect computers to video screens. Access to the building is 
controlled by door locks that can be opened only by punching a secret 
five-digit code. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Extron initially expressed puzzlement over the motive for the 
rampage, denying that the gunman had ever worked for them. And they had said 
they were uncertain how an intruder could have entered the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators learned that Nguyen was fired 2 1/2 weeks ago after working 
at Extron for less than three months, Gonzales said. He had apparently 
expressed no anger at the time he was fired, Gonzales added. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began shortly after 1 p.m. when Nguyen jumped out of his car and 
hurried into the plant. Witnesses said he left his older-model Nissan in the 
middle of the parking lot with its engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen ran into an equipment test area in the northeast corner of the plant 
and shot one man twice in the head. He then raced into an assembly area at the 
northwest corner and fatally wounded another man, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then ran to the southwest side of the building where he gunned down the 
woman and then shot himself in the head. Deputies said he was still clutching 
the pistol when they found his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of a nearby business said they heard four or five shots before doors 
to the plant flew open and 50 Extron workers scrambled out, knocking over 
chairs and equipment as they fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The two wounded victims escaped with their co-workers. One of them, Ygoc Hoa 
Pham, 26 was listed in stable condition at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center with a 
bullet wound in his buttocks. The other, Hai Thi Tran, was reportedly shot in 
the upper right arm and right hand. She was treated and released from Norwalk 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleeing workers said the gunman may have stopped to reload his pistol at least 
once during the bloody rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Sebastian Anthony, said he ducked under a workbench as the first 
victim was gunned down. That man was taken by helicopter to the Norwalk 
hospital, where he died, according to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-worker Yara Godoy, 22, of La Mirada said Nguyen entered a rear door to the 
plant as she walked behind him. She said he was wearing a baseball cap and blue 
jeans and resembled another worker, so she had no reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he knew the security code," she said. "He looked like he knew 
what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Godoy said she immediately heard three popping sounds when the man 
disappeared inside. Before she could punch in the door's entry codes herself, 
it burst open and co-workers ran out, screaming to her to run for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I did," Godoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampage stunned other workers in the tidy business park. Hours after the 
shooting, a parking lot shared by employees of several firms remained cordoned 
off by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Extron, a 7-year-old company, is one of a dozen companies in the 20-year-old 
manufacturing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Springs, about 12 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, is mostly 
a patchwork of industrial parks and heavy industry left over from an oil boom 
that began about 70 years ago. The city has 16,000 residents, but the 
population swells to more than 90,000 during the workday as employees arrive at 
more than 3,500 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's shootings sent shock through the city. Curious onlookers -- including 
children on bicycles -- flooded to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials likened Monday's incident to one in the city last year, when a 
disgruntled county employee barged into a children's services office and shot 
her former supervisor in the face. No one died in that shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts of violence by disgruntled current or former employees have been 
increasing since the mid-1980s, said Joseph A. Kinney, executive director of 
the National Safe Workplace Institute in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney said such acts were virtually unheard of until August, 1986, when the 
first of a nationwide series of deadly post office shootings occurred in 
Edmund, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 By Kinney's count, about 100 people across the country were murdered last year 
by disgruntled workers, up from about 70 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney, co-author of a study of 125 workplace murders, said these acts of 
violence are especially common in California. He attributed that in part to the 
severity of California's recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health reported last year 
that 7,603 Americans were victims of homicide on the job during the 1980s. The 
most common victims were taxi drivers, police officers and retail workers, 
particularly those working alone and at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the California Department of Industrial Relations' latest figures 
show that homicides accounted for a quarter of the 551 work-related deaths in 
the state in 1992.

LEGISLATURE OKS QUAKE BONDS; GOVERNMENT: NEARLY $4 BILLION IS APPROVED FOR JUNE 
7 BALLOT, INCLUDING $2 BILLION FOR RECOVERY AND HIGHWAY SEISMIC SAFETY. OTHER 
MEASURES WOULD AID SCHOOLS, COLLEGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Legislature overcame weeks of delay Monday and sent to Gov. Pete Wilson 
nearly $4 billion worth of bond issues, including $2 billion to help finance 
Northridge earthquake recovery costs as well as highway seismic safety 
improvements statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman said the governor will sign the bond package today, 
authorizing the measures to go before California voters on June 7. Besides the 
quake-related bonds, the package contains $1 billion for public schools and 
$900 million for construction at campuses of the University of California, the 
California State University system and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation also appeared to head off a threatened North vs. South fight 
by giving Southern California more money to fix its quake-threatened highway 
bridges than what had been contained in an earlier proposal, which heavily 
favored toll bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area. Under the new agreement, 
Southern California stands to receive up to 60% of the retrofit bond funds, 
said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly voted overwhelming approval to the package and sent it to the 
Senate, where it briefly ran into unexpected objections from Republicans and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, the $2-billion bond issue for quake recovery and seismic 
safety improvements of highways statewide was approved on a 54-11 vote, the 
exact two-thirds required. The Senate later sent it to Wilson on a 27-11 
margin, again the precise one needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1 billion for public schools was approved 63 to 5 by the Assembly and 30 
to 5 by the Senate. The $900 million for higher education construction was 
passed 58 to 7 by the Assembly and 33 to 2 by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The total bonds approved Monday will bring to $6 billion the amount of 
borrowing facing voters June 7. The amount includes $2 billion in park bonds 
that qualified earlier by initiative. The voters dealt with a record $5.57 
billion worth of bonds in November, 1992, and defeated most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also passed Monday was a newly crafted bill that would allow construction to 
start quickly on highway retrofit projects by eliminating certain permit and 
contracting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging the Senate to speedily enact legislation enabling the state to pay 
its share of Northridge earthquake costs, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) 
complained that California's response has been "devastatingly slow." 
</P>
<P>
 "At least show that we can act in a prompt, if not swift, fashion," Roberti 
pleaded in urging passage of the Northridge recovery bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state deliberated for two months after the quake, Congress and 
President Clinton rushed nearly $10 billion in federal disaster aid to 
California shortly after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in the Legislature favored temporarily raising the sales tax by a 
quarter of a cent on the dollar to finance recovery costs. Similar legislation 
was enacted in 1989 after the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson, who is running for reelection, ruled out higher taxes and insisted 
on a bond issue, whose higher costs in interest would be spread out over the 
next two decades. He argued that a tax increase would impede California's 
recovery from the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In Senate debate, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a contender for governor, 
argued that a quarter-cent sales tax increase "will not break the state's 
economy. . . . This (earthquake bond issue) will make our indebtedness all the 
greater and is a tax on future generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), who voted against the bonds, said 
cutting the state budget across the board 10% was an alternative "nobody wants 
to talk about. . . . We could get $5 billion that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and leaders of the two houses last week agreed on a compromise that 
included no election year tax increase. The chief bond issue would earmark 
$1.05 billion for Northridge recovery and another $1 billion to retrofit 
bridges statewide that are at seismic risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The North-South flap erupted late last week when an initial draft of the 
compromise worked out with the governor earmarked about $650 million of the 
retrofit bond issue for toll bridges in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Katz said Monday that compromise amendments were worked out during 
the weekend that would allocate the bond issue retrofit funds to regions of 
California in proportion to the number of bridges that need shoring up. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that under the agreement, Southern California would fare better than 
the initial compromise because it has more at-risk bridges than the north. Katz 
said the Bay Area toll bridges, rather than getting the biggest share of funds, 
would get about 40% under the amended bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a Southern California perspective, this is a much better measure than 
the last," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiating chiefly on financing the state's response to the Northridge 
quake, the governor and legislative leaders also agreed on the $1-billion bond 
issue for new construction of school buildings and remodeling projects aimed at 
helping to house the state's burgeoning schoolchildren population. The money 
also could be used for seismic safety improvements.

TAIWAN ARMS DEALS OPEN DOORS TO CIVILIAN CONTRACTS; TRADE: COLD WAR WEAPONS 
SALES WERE OFTEN LINKED TO IDEOLOGY. NOW THEY ARE YOKED TO JOBS AND EXPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When former President George Bush announced during his 1992 reelection 
campaign that he was permitting the sale of F-16 warplanes to Taiwan, he 
justified it as a way of enhancing Taiwan's security. The fact that the 
$6-billion deal kept General Dynamics factories running in Texas didn't hurt 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sale had a third, less obvious purpose: American officials and trade 
representatives hoped that the military deal would give U.S. firms the inside 
track in landing some big commercial contracts in Taiwan, including the 
multimillion-dollar job of building a nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't get a nuclear contract, it would be a bitter pill," David N. 
Laux, president of the U.S.-Republic of China (Taiwan) Trade Council, observed 
in the wake of the sale of the jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 France, which had itself sold Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan, also had its eye 
on civilian contracts, including its own bid for the nuclear plant. But Laux 
said that the Americans figured: "Let the French have the high-speed rail 
contract. We want the nuclear project." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. and French maneuvering for contracts in Taiwan illustrates one of the 
most important but often overlooked points about arms sales in the new era of 
post-Cold War economic competition: For countries such as the United States and 
France, arms exports are economically important not only in their own right but 
also as a lever for landing purely civilian contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, arms sales were usually linked to ideology; the United 
States sold arms to countries that would help in the struggle against the 
Soviet Union and communism. Occasionally, Western allies competed with one 
another for arms sales, but such clashes were moderated by the broader concerns 
of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Now arms deals, still a tool of foreign policy, are increasingly linked to 
commerce and civilian exports. The nation that sells the guns has the chance to 
sell the butter too: to build the dams, lay the subway rails and fire up the 
nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 These connections influence both the selling and the buying nations in arms 
deals. Exporting nations offer high-tech weaponry partly in hopes of winning 
commercial business, or they throw in commercial contracts to land an arms 
deal. Purchasing nations dangle the prospect of civilian contracts to get good 
deals on the weapons systems they want to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The linkages between arms and commerce can be found throughout the world. In 
the Middle East, for example, President Clinton recently intervened with King 
Fahd to make sure that Saudi Arabia bought commercial aircraft from the United 
States, its main protector and arms supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southeast Asia, the Russian government not long ago offered to accept up to 
$1 billion worth of Malaysian palm oil, a commodity increasingly hard to sell 
in the diet-conscious markets of the United States and Western Europe, if 
Malaysia would buy Russian MIG-29 jet fighters. The deal has not yet gone 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the connection between arms sales and commerce more evident than in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 With about $87 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, Taiwan is one of the 
world's wealthiest governments. And with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, 
the world's largest, poised on the mainland nearby, Taiwan believes that it has 
a continuing need for advanced weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of this decade, Taiwan unveiled an eye-catching $300-billion, 
six-year public works program. The shopping list included $7.1 billion for a 
nuclear plant; $13 billion for a highway; $11.9 billion for a high-speed 
railroad, and two mass-transit systems worth $7.4 billion and $6.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, observed Laux, "the biggest single infrastructure program in the 
world." American companies were interested, and the Commerce Department quickly 
began lobbying in Washington to win active support from the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of $300 billion in contracts attracted interest from other companies 
as well -- particularly in Western Europe, where Taiwan had long been treated 
as an American preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses go where the money is," noted a French business executive in 
Taiwan. "And the money is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's big spending program began to spur foreign policy changes in a number 
of European capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 France had kept Taiwan at arm's length since 1964, when President Charles de 
Gaulle established diplomatic relations with Beijing. But three years ago, 
France altered course by dispatching a Cabinet-level minister to Taiwan at the 
head of a large trade delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other European countries soon dispatched their own high-level officials to 
Taiwan and subtly signaled a new willingness to do business. Even former 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- who while in office had courted 
Beijing with a vigor from which her successor, John Major, has retreated -- 
joined the parade to Taiwan, talking as if the British government had always 
encouraged trade with the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not fall into the mistake of thinking that it is America that trades 
with Taiwan, or Europe that trades with Asia," Thatcher said last year. "The 
truth is that it is American companies that trade with Taiwanese companies, and 
European companies that trade with Asian companies." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the French government opened the way for arms sales to Taiwan, and by 
the following year it was offering its top-of-the-line Mirage jets to the 
Nationalist regime. At the same time, French companies were lining up for 
commercial contracts in Taiwan's new infrastructure program. 
</P>
<P>
 The French firm Matra embarked upon a project to build a subway system in the 
capital city, Taipei, and the French nuclear manufacturer Framatome began 
laying the groundwork to win the contract for Taiwan's fourth nuclear plant. 
Legislators from Taiwan began traveling to France to scout out Framatome's 
facilities and management. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Paris, they really hoped that the military sales would lead to big 
commercial contracts," explained one French official. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Taiwan's Nationalist government say there has never been any 
direct linkage between arms deals and the infrastructure contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that the French, as well as American businesses, are 
interested in our six-year development program," said Foreign Minister 
Frederick Chien in an interview. "There's nothing wrong with that. . . . All 
companies can participate in the bidding. We don't favor any one firm over 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, the United States was scrambling to keep up with France and other 
European countries in improving its ties with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge American trade delegation visited Taipei at the beginning of the year. 
That summer, Bush gave his approval for the sale of 150 F-16s to Taiwan, which 
had been seeking the high-tech jet fighters for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, late that year, then-U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills 
became the first American Cabinet official to visit Taiwan since the United 
States broke off diplomatic relations at the beginning of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 These moves were strongly supported by private American companies, 
particularly by the three U.S. firms -- Westinghouse, General Electric and 
Combustion Engineering -- that have spent the last several years trying to win 
the contract to build Taiwan's fourth nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
 GE since has dropped out of the competition, but Westinghouse and Combustion 
Engineering submitted formal bids at the beginning of this year. So did 
Framatome, the French firm. The contract will probably be awarded later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of American nuclear firms maintain that the Taiwan contract is 
especially valuable because there are so few other opportunities to build 
nuclear plants elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only game in town right now," said Bob Gross, the Westinghouse 
representative in Taipei. "From an American industry point of view, it's 
important for this to go forward while there is still an active (nuclear) 
industry in the United States. . . . When the jobs go, they go for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse estimates the nuclear contract is worth 20,000 man-years of jobs 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, France recently turned around and gave up the diplomatic advantage 
it had gained in Taiwan several years ago by being the first nation to offer 
advanced warplanes to the Nationalist government. 
</P>
<P>
 In early January, France promised in a joint communique with China "that in 
the future, it will refrain from authorizing French businesses to participate 
in the arming of Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did France reverse course? Because officials in Beijing had learned so 
well the lessons taught by Taiwan about the links between arms sales and 
commerce that they were able to wield their own considerable commercial clout 
to good advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 After France sold the Mirage jets to Taipei, China clamped down on French 
companies, prohibiting French firms, for example, from bidding for the right to 
build a subway system for Guangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, French companies with more potential business at stake in China than 
in Taiwan -- such as Alcatel, which makes telecommunications equipment -- 
successfully lobbied the new conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur for a change in Taiwan policy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, the same country that led the way in the flood of new arms 
sales to Taiwan has now promised to stop doing so. "This whole (recent) French 
exercise was calculated to be able to get commercial business from the 
mainland," said Chien, Taiwan's foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
 China may now try to use the French agreement as a wedge to persuade other 
Western governments, including the United States, to curb their arms sales to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann was recently on assignment in Taiwan.

SEPULVEDA VA HOSPITAL TO BE TORN DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that angered many Los Angeles-area veterans, U.S. Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown announced Monday that the quake-damaged Sepulveda 
VA hospital will be demolished and replaced with a $65-million outpatient care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 431-bed federal hospital has been closed since the Jan. 17 temblor wrecked 
operating rooms, knocked out heat and water supplies and littered corridors 
with broken glass, forcing the evacuation of 331 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in Los Angeles, Brown said he decided not to rebuild 
Sepulveda because the VA must cut costs as it enters the era of managed health 
care, and because there are more than enough beds to absorb evacuated Sepulveda 
patients at the big West Los Angeles VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those evacuated from Sepulveda have been at the West Los Angeles 
facility, which has 1,157 inpatient beds, since the quake and will stay there, 
Brown said. He added that even with the Sepulveda patients, there are nearly 
200 empty beds at West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials had been considering for two months whether to rebuild the 
39-year-old Sepulveda hospital, the centerpiece of a sprawling medical complex 
in North Hills that employs 1,700 and features well-regarded programs in 
geriatric research and medical education. The cost of reconstruction was 
estimated at $188 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the VA will spend $50 million to tear down the hospital and repair 
other structures. It will spend another $65 million to build the outpatient 
center, which is expected to open by February, 1996, and will expand existing 
ambulatory care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said a 120-bed nursing home will reopen within six to eight weeks, but a 
psychiatric ward will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local veterans reacted angrily to Brown's plan, saying it may jeopardize 
medical care for people who fought America's wars and will badly inconvenience 
their families, especially those from the San Fernando Valley who will have to 
drive an extra 15 miles over congested roads to reach West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are upset because they've taken something away from them again," 
said Terry Tracy, the American Legion spokesman in Los Angeles. "Sepulveda was 
kind of their place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 "Down at the grass-roots level, we're going to have some people hollering like 
hell," said Jerry Williams, of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. "They have this 
(hospital) close by, and now it's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for another veterans group said Brown's plan will benefit 
veterans by allowing more of them, especially poor veterans with no 
service-connected disabilities, to receive care. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably going to take better care of a bunch of new veterans than 
they would have if they just built another bed tower," said Dave Gorman, deputy 
national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 21 members of Congress from the Los Angeles area signed a letter 
urging Brown to rebuild the hospital, saying that "because of the large 
geographic area, distance, travel time and dense urban population, the other VA 
facilities in Los Angeles do not have the inpatient capacity to adequately 
serve" local veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Closure of the hospital, they said, also could damage Sepulveda's research 
programs and its academic affiliations with the UCLA School of Medicine. Last 
year, 364 medical residents and interns trained at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing details of the outpatient program from Brown in telephone 
calls Monday, several congressman said they believe the plan makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose district includes the 
hospital, said he agreed with Brown that it would be foolish to rebuild the 
hospital given the number of unoccupied beds at West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra travel time for Valley-area families, he said, does not represent 
"an undue burden." 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent closure of Sepulveda's six-story hospital would mark only the 
second time since 1965 that a VA hospital anywhere in the United States has 
been shuttered. Politically powerful veterans groups and their allies in 
Congress traditionally have been able to pressure the VA not to cut services. 
</P>
<P>
 A VA spokesman said that while blueprints are not final, the Sepulveda 
outpatient center is likely to resemble the one in Downtown Los Angeles. That 
clinic features an emergency room, dental services and programs to treat 
substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown acknowledged that demolishing the hospital will strain doctor-patient 
relationships at Sepulveda. Instead of physicians being able to hospitalize and 
treat patients there, they will have to send them to West Los Angeles, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of quality, we'll lose nothing," he said. "But in terms of a close 
relationship that our physicians want to maintain with their patients, we're 
losing something there." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that Sepulveda doctors, nurses and other staffers "did not accept 
this news very well" when he briefed them Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have grown to be very fond of their patients and they want to be able to 
maintain that close, intimate relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that of Sepulveda's 1,700 employees, 1,000 will be kept in North 
Hills and 400 to 500 others will be transferred to West Los Angeles. The 
remainder will be offered jobs at other VA facilities throughout the country. 
None will be laid off.

FIRMS TO PAY $40 MILLION IN '91 RIVER SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the state's biggest environmental settlement, Southern Pacific and three 
other companies have agreed to pay a total of $40 million in compensation for 
the 1991 train derailment near Dunsmuir that poisoned 42 miles of the Upper 
Sacramento River, state and railroad officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to the settlement, none of the companies admitted any wrongdoing 
in the massive spill of metam sodium, an herbicide that killed virtually all 
aquatic life downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement announced by Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and Southern Pacific, 
most of the money will go to reimburse the state for its cleanup costs and pay 
for continuing work to restore the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission was to obtain fair compensation for the extensive environmental 
damage caused by the spill," Lungren said. "This will help complete restoration 
of the damaged areas, aiding what Mother Nature herself has already 
accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 The July, 1991, derailment drew worldwide attention when a tank car carrying 
the weed killer plunged into the pristine Upper Sacramento River. The car 
ruptured, pouring 19,000 gallons of metam sodium into the river, which was 
renowned for its wild trout. 
</P>
<P>
 The toxic plume traveled down the river, killing almost everything in its path 
until it reached Shasta Lake, where the poison dissipated. At least 700 
residents became ill as a noxious cloud of fumes passed through the river 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill caused devastating losses to the tourist industry in the region. It 
also highlighted the continuing problems of the railroad industry in hauling 
toxic materials over long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the disaster, the Upper Sacramento has recovered more quickly than state 
biologists expected and the popular river will be reopened in April for trout 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Fish and Game Department biologists said between 60 and 75 species 
have been slow to make a comeback, including sculpin, a small bottom-dwelling 
fish that was once the most abundant fish in the river. Also slow to recover 
have been the Pacific giant salamander, crayfish and more than 40 species of 
freshwater clams and snails. In some areas close to the spill, as many as a 
third of the trees along the river have died or are dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we have seen a rather rapid recovery for many of the species but 
there are certain organisms we're still very concerned about," said Fish and 
Game biologist Steve Turek. "The ecosystem is not back to what it was prior to 
the spill." 
</P>
<P>
 State experts said it will take up to 50 years for the ecosystem, including 
mature trees, to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement -- which works out to nearly $1 million for every mile of river 
damaged -- will provide $5 million to carry out further river restoration and 
monitoring of the ecosystem. Another $14 million will go for the long-term 
enhancement of the river and acquisition of additional habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also includes $3 million for the creation of an emergency fund 
that the Department of Fish and Game can use to respond immediately to 
environmental disasters. Another $2 million in damages will go to the 
department's fish and game preservation fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, state and federal governments will collect $1 million in 
penalties and $13 million to repay the costs of responding to the spill. The 
agreement includes $2 million paid earlier by Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Lungren said the agreement -- which must be ratified by a 
federal judge -- is the largest settlement of an environmental case in the 
state's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said: "The Upper Sacramento is a state treasure and I'm 
pleased to see California and Southern Pacific come to mutual terms for the 
benefit of the river and its communities. It is important . . . that we put 
this incident behind us by fully restoring this natural jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific, which announced its willingness to settle the case at the 
outset, will bear most of the cost, paying $32 million. GATX, the company that 
owned the rail car, will pay $5 million. J. M. Huber Co, which leased the car 
from GATX, will pay $1 million. AMVAC, the maker of metam sodium, will pay $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action earlier, Southern Pacific agreed to pay $14 million to 
settle the claims of residents and businesses in the area -- bringing its total 
payout to $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office noted that AMVAC has agreed to post labels with 
information about metam sodium on all tank cars carrying its herbicide to 
provide information to emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Utilities Commission also is considering giving some sort of hazard 
designation to the winding stretch of railroad where the spill occurred and 
other treacherous stretches of the state's rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 State biologists who have been working on the recovery and lawsuit said the 
agreement will prevent years of time-consuming litigation and allow them to 
focus their efforts on the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, the best thing about the settlement is it frees us up 
to do biology, which we're all very pleased about," said Craig Martz, a Fish 
and Game plant ecologist. "But the end of the litigation doesn't mean that the 
recovery is complete. It's going to take some of these resources quite a while 
to come back."

HUBBELL QUITS; TOP JUSTICE AIDE, CLINTON FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Webster Hubbell, the third-ranking Justice Department official and a close 
friend of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, resigned Monday amid 
allegations that he cost his former Little Rock law firm as much as $1 million 
in unbilled time and questionable expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell said in a statement that an investigation into his billing practices 
by his former partners at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm had become a burdensome 
distraction and that he did not want to do further damage to the Administration 
by remaining in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Hubbell leaves a gaping hole at Justice, which has not yet 
filled the spot vacated by the departure last month of the department's 
second-ranking official, Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann, who quit in a 
personality clash with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubbell resignation also intensifies the growing cost to the Clintons of 
the Whitewater controversy, and it leaves an impression of an Administration in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could not have come at a worse time for him and for the Administration," 
said a senior White House adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell described the matters under dispute with his former firm as "private 
issues" relating to "compensation and reimbursement" that have nothing to do 
with Whitewater or the President and First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that at the conclusion of these discussions all outstanding 
matters will be resolved satisfactorily," Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose firm internal investigation "came to a very acute head" over the last 
several days, according to knowledgeable sources. Hubbell's former partners 
confronted him with how much money they believed he owed them and said that 
they could not settle the matter amicably, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell decided Sunday to resign, knowing that the dispute with Rose would 
spill over into the public arena, embarrass the Clintons and limit his 
effectiveness at Justice, a senior White House official said. "He did the 
honorable thing," the aide said. "He didn't want to ensnare the President and 
the First Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous calls to attorneys at the Rose firm went unanswered Monday. The 
firm's outside counsel, Walter B. Stuart of the Houston firm, Vinson & Elkins, 
did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, Mrs. Clinton and the late Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, 
who apparently committed suicide last July, all were senior partners and close 
friends at Rose before coming to Washington with Clinton's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell's resignation followed the forced resignation of White House Counsel 
Bernard Nussbaum on March 5. Nussbaum quit after disclosures that he had met 
with federal regulators looking into the Clintons' role in the Whitewater case. 
Nussbaum, too, was a close friend of the First Lady's, having worked with her 
20 years ago on the House Judiciary Committee considering the impeachment of 
former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is looking into allegations that the 
President may have benefited improperly from his association with James B. 
McDougal, owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan and partner with 
the Clintons in an Ozark real estate development firm known as Whitewater 
Development Corp. The inquiry also encompasses the role played by Mrs. Clinton 
and her firm in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter of resignation to the President, Hubbell wrote that dealing with 
"public speculation about me and my former law firm" would consume increasing 
amounts of his time and would limit his effectiveness in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Boston for a political appearance, Clinton told reporters that 
Hubbell made "the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he praised Hubbell as a "good personal friend" and a lawyer who is 
"widely esteemed" by those who know him, Clinton appeared to leave himself 
considerable maneuvering room in case the facts prove otherwise. "I haven't 
talked to him since this whole issue came up," Clinton said. He repeated 
several times that he had "no knowledge of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell "strongly feels that he will be vindicated but it will take some time 
for him to do it and that he shouldn't be working at a public job while he's 
doing that," Clinton said. "I think he's right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose firm has been investigating Hubbell's billing practices since last 
year, when it discovered what it considered discrepancies in the hourly 
billings and expense accounts of the former senior partner. The internal review 
heated up last month when the monetary scale of the dispute became clear and 
when Fiske announced that he would investigate a broad range of activities at 
the Rose firm when Hubbell, Foster and Mrs. Clinton were essentially in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The matters under scrutiny internally at Rose involved the business interests 
of Hubbell's father-in-law and brother-in-law, Seth Ward Sr. and Seth Ward Jr., 
as well as Hubbell's work for federal bank regulatory agencies, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp. The firm is trying to 
determine whether Hubbell properly accounted for personal expenses paid out of 
firm funds and whether there was any impropriety involved in litigation costs 
borne by the firm in matters Hubbell handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell took on an unsuccessful copyright infringement suit that a parking 
meter manufacturing company owned by the Wards filed against a competitor, 
according to White House and Justice Department sources. Hubbell assumed the 
case on a contingency basis, an unusual arrangement for a large corporate law 
firm, meaning that if he lost the case his firm would bear the expenses of the 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell lost the case but did not reveal the contingency fee deal to his 
partners until after he joined the Administration, the sources said. As a 
result, Rose will get none of the $500,000 it would have received from the 
Wards if it had been able to bill on an hourly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the firm was stuck with as much as $500,000 in additional costs 
related to the case, including fees paid to expert witnesses, outside copyright 
specialists, travel, copying and various other expenses generated during what 
was a major lawsuit, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the RTC is conducting a full-scale audit of more than $1.2 million 
billed to the agency by the Rose firm since 1989 to see whether the charges 
were justified. Hubbell solicited the regulatory business and supervised many 
of the 22 bank cases handled by the firm, including one against the former 
auditors of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a thoughtful weekend, I believe that my continued service will not be 
as effective as it has been; that the distractions on me at this time will 
interfere with my service to the country and the President's agenda; and that 
my family, although totally supportive, is being harmed," Hubbell said in a 
statement released by the Justice Department. Hubbell and his wife, Suzanna, 
have four children ranging in age from 12 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also unfortunate that private issues between me and my firm have been 
cast, by some, as being part of a broad political net called Whitewater," he 
added. "These private issues have nothing to do with Whitewater, Madison 
Guaranty, the McDougals or the President and First Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell's dispute with Rose is only tangentially related to Whitewater, a 
Justice Department official contended, though it was Whitewater and the 
presence of reporters looking into it in Little Rock that prompted dissidents 
at the law firm to make their move against their former colleague, according to 
a source close to Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the current climate, some members of the firm reached back to prior cases 
and in the course of that there were some isolated matters involving the 
Resolution Trust Corp. that they queried Webb about," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the dispute has nothing to do with Whitewater, it's Whitewater 
that created the climate, that gave the dissidents in the firm the opportunity 
to go after Hubbell, and preoccupation with Whitewater increases the pressure 
on Hubbell to get this dispute off the government's back," a source close to 
Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said that Hubbell had asked the firm to conciliate the matter, 
but the firm refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell was the first Clinton Administration official to join the Justice 
Department at the very beginning of Clinton's term and ran the department for 
weeks while the White House stumbled through the process of naming an attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell had broad responsibilities as the No. 3 official. He oversaw the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Civil Rights, Environment and 
Natural Resources, Civil, Antitrust and Tax divisions. He also was responsible 
for the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Bureau of Prisons, the Community 
Relations Service and the Office of Legal Counsel, which serves as the attorney 
general's legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that Hubbell met Sunday with friends, including Mickey 
Kantor, who is U.S. trade representative, to review the dispute and what to do 
about it. Hubbell apparently decided after Sunday's session to quit but wanted 
to keep at arm's length from the President and First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor on Sunday informed White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty, 
who told the President of Hubbell's impending action. Hubbell called Mrs. 
Clinton on Monday to tell her of his decision, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver, Mrs. Clinton said of Hubbell: "Personally, as a friend, I am 
thinking a lot about him and his family and wishing him well." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief press appearance in mid-afternoon to announce Hubbell's 
resignation, Reno said: "There are no words capable of fully conveying to you 
my deep respect and admiration for Webb Hubbell or how sad this event makes me. 
He has been a tireless crusader for doing justice, for doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no list of potential replacements for Hubbell, a Justice Department 
official said, noting that Hubbell could remain on the job for as long as 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Robert L. Jackson and David Lauter in Washington and 
special correspondent Kristina Lindgren in Denver contributed to this story.

AILING EURO DISNEY GIVEN SWEEPING BAILOUT PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Euro Disney, the money-losing resort that has become the most popular paid 
tourist destination in Europe, was rescued Monday by a sweeping financial 
package that will bring important concessions from lenders and its American 
parent, the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the announcement, Euro Disney Chairman Philippe Bourguignon 
opened the company's annual meeting at the park, using the news to mollify 
several hundred unhappy stockholders seated in the vast arena of Buffalo Bill's 
Wild West Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great relief to all of us," said Bourguignon, standing in front of 
the replica of an Old West mountain. "This will allow us to start off again on 
a solid basis. We can proceed with our operations now and do it calmly." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally hailed the rescue package as an important transatlantic 
compromise, which will help the 2-year-old park survive the current European 
recession and the management decisions that some believe contributed to its 
rocky start. It still must be approved by each of the creditor banks and Euro 
Disney's stockholders, though that is considered a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who was forced to invest even more 
deeply in the park to ensure its survival, said the "fair and economically 
sensible restructuring" will "ensure that this resort . . . will operate on a 
sound financial basis. We are extremely confident in the park and its future." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will pump $1.03 billion into the company through an issue of new 
stock. Walt Disney, which owns 49% of the venture, will make a $500-million 
infusion by taking the same share of the new stock issue. Disney's stock 
dropped on the news, falling $1.125 to $45.875 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, although some Wall Street analysts welcomed the deal because Euro 
Disney's troubles have been such a huge, time-consuming headache for Disney 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from most of the new stock, which will increase the outstanding 
shares from 170 million to 800 million, will repay Euro Disney's bank loans, 
cutting the current debt in half, to about $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the Walt Disney Co. also will eliminate its royalties and 
management fees for five years, reinstating them later at a reduced, still 
unspecified, rate. For their part, the 60 creditor banks have agreed to forgive 
18 months of interest charges and defer all payments on principal for the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine Nodet, a securities analyst at ING Bourse in Paris, said the 
restructuring "is a good deal for the lenders, and it will make sure that the 
park survives." He added, however, that the sale of so many new shares will 
significantly dilute the current stockholders' share of any future profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The park itself has been a success with visitors, drawing 19 million people 
since its April, 1992, opening, despite early suggestions that the inclement 
weather of Northern Europe would hurt attendance. Euro Disney's own surveys 
indicate that 80% of the guests leave the park satisfied with their visit, and 
90% say they will return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is not a serious element and, frankly, I don't want to hear 
anything more about it," Bourguignon told stockholders at the park on Monday. A 
bigger problem, he said, is the unwillingness of Europeans to come to Euro 
Disney except during school vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Euro Disney's financial difficulties have stemmed from the deep recession 
in Europe that struck soon after the park opened, the strength of the French 
franc against other European currencies and high interest rates. The sluggish 
real estate market has made it impossible for the company to carry out its 
original plans to quickly begin selling off its hotels. And those hotels, with 
a 55% occupancy rate, have suffered because visitors are staying for shorter 
periods than had originally been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a Euro Disney cheerleader, Eisner even had harsh words for the park's 
financial performance in Disney's latest annual report, calling it "dreadful" 
and rating "barely a D" on Disney's report card. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors led to speculation that Euro Disney might even close this 
spring. Disney said in December that it would stop funding Euro Disney's losses 
at the end of March unless a restructuring agreement could be worked out with 
creditor banks, and Eisner was quoted as saying that the resort, which has been 
losing about $1 million a day, could be shut. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many observers saw Eisner's threat as a negotiating ploy with the 
banks because pulling the plug on the park would have seriously hurt the 
image-sensitive company's global stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Euro Disney has introduced lower, off-season entry fees, 
cut hotel room rates and slashed prices of goods and food inside the park. It 
also has trimmed 900 jobs, most of them in administration. And the company has 
begun to expand its marketing efforts in Europe, forging links with travel 
agencies and devising strategies to bring in more children, who now account for 
just one in four visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney stockholders on Monday generally welcomed the financial rescue 
plan, and most praised Bourguignon, who took over as chairman last year. But 
some stockholders harbored deep anger with the company, whose share price has 
fallen on the French bourse from a high of nearly $30 at the park's much-touted 
opening to about $6 today. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, we trusted Walt Disney (Co.)," said Guy Jacquet, a Parisian 
who owns several thousand shares and belongs to a group of dissident 
stockholders. "But we were ripped off. Everything has been badly done here 
since the beginning. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Investor anger seemed to center on a feeling that stockholders had not been 
kept properly informed of the company's negotiations with the Walt Disney Co. 
and its creditor banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also complained that Walt Disney was able to acquire its 49% interest in 
Euro Disney for $1.60 a share while the opening price to ordinary investors had 
been 10 times that. Company officers noted, however, that the favorable share 
price for Walt Disney had been declared clearly at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney shares fell 2.95 francs to close at 33.85, less than half the 
price they traded at when the company went public in 1989 and far below the 
high of 164.30 francs in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-simmering tensions between Euro Disney's American roots and its 
European investors also surfaced during the annual meeting. Some investors 
complained that a rigid, myopic American management style, at least initially, 
had contributed to the park's troubles.

COLUMN ONE; S. AFRICA'S ELECTORAL COLLEGES; VOTER-EDUCATION GROUPS ARE TRYING 
TO HELP MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIMERS LEARN TO MARK A BALLOT OR OVERCOME CONFUSION 
AND FEAR. THE STAKES ARE HIGH -- ANY TAINT ON THE APRIL ELECTIONS COULD SPELL 
TROUBLE.

<P>
 Democracy clearly is a bit daunting to the workers on the afternoon shift at 
the giant Impala Platinum Ltd. refinery here. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen men sit in a small sports pavilion, listening patiently as Vincent 
Ngcobo explains their rights and responsibilities when South Africa goes to the 
polls next month for the first election in which blacks will be able to vote 
after 340 years of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 These men are black. Their questions are to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ngcobo keeps referring to the national election and the new National 
Assembly, does that mean they must vote for President Frederik W. de Klerk's 
National Party? Should they mark an X on the ballot for the party they want -- 
or against the party they don't like? Does an X, which many illiterate people 
use for a signature, mean they can be identified later? 
</P>
<P>
 "Your vote is secret," Ngcobo, a trainer for one of scores of non-governmental 
voter-education groups, assures them in English, Zulu, Xhosa and Sotho. 
</P>
<P>
 Elphus Mokoena, a 29-year-old machinist, is convinced. He plans to drive four 
hours to vote in his home village. "If I don't vote, maybe my party will only 
lose by one vote," he says later. 
</P>
<P>
 With the April 26-28 vote fast approaching, a fierce election fever has swept 
the land. Although headlines focus on South Africa's continuing violence and on 
the daily campaigning by De Klerk and his chief rival, African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela, the critical challenge lies behind the scenes 
in scores of voter-education programs like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 About 22.5 million South Africans will be eligible to vote -- up to 18 million 
for the first time. And nearly half of those newly enfranchised blacks are 
functionally illiterate. But with a long and confusing ballot offering a choice 
of 26 national and provincial parties, concern is growing that many voters will 
be too scared to vote or will inadvertently spoil their paper ballots, 
undermining the legitimacy of this country's most momentous day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mock elections at factories, shopping malls, sports stadiums, farms and mines 
around the country suggest that more than 2 million ballots may be spoiled, 
most from poor, rural, uneducated blacks who would be expected to back the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mock elections and workshops show 15% to 20% spoiled ballots," warned 
Jesse Maluleke, election coordinator for COSATU, the nation's largest labor 
federation. "And that's frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We don't have much time left. And there hasn't been much progress 
in voter literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 The most extensive poll ever done in South Africa, based on 8,004 interviews, 
also produced unsettling results. In mock elections, one in 10 blacks 
accidentally invalidated a ballot. That number rose to 28% in rural regions. 
And not all mistakes came from illiterate voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people simply wrote, 'I don't know how to vote' " on the ballots, said 
Susan Booysen, who directed the poll for the Matla Trust, the largest of the 
country's scores of voter-education groups. "The confusion level is very, very 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was conducted before last month's decision by the ANC and the 
government, later ratified by the Parliament, that each voter will get two 
ballots in order to pick separate parties for the national and provincial 
assemblies. The change came after months of teaching voters to use one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can really expect a lot more confusion when people are issued with two 
ballots," Booysen predicted. The mock elections, for example, now show that 
many people think the second ballot is for their second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch to two ballots also has caused a logistics nightmare. Millions of 
printed pamphlets, posters, comic books and other voter-education materials, 
some printed in the country's 11 major languages, were suddenly out of date. 
</P>
<P>
 A "How to Vote" video, shown on TV, in churches and in union halls, had to be 
quickly redone. So did sections of a 13-part TV series called "Khululeka," the 
Zulu word for freedom, that had been in production for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest problems is the uncertainty" of recent political 
developments, said Barry Gilder, head of the Independent Forum for Electoral 
Education, an umbrella group of 40 non-governmental organizations running voter 
programs. "The date, the details of the election, the use of two ballots -- all 
these are causing problems." 
</P>
<P>
 So is overcoming the legacy of the ruthless apartheid-era bureaucracy, which 
left millions of blacks without proper identification documents. Hundreds of 
thousands of people have lined up for voter IDs in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the huge national ballot. With 17 parties listed, it will be 
longer than this newspaper page. Anyone with $20,000 and a signed application 
could register, and several newly formed parties had little more than that. 
There's KISS -- The Keep It Straight and Simple party -- for example, and 
SOCCER, the Sports Organization for Collective Contributions and Equal Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The list is too long," complained the Rev. Sam Xontana, a Matla Trust 
organizer in Klerksdorp in the western Transvaal. "It confuses people." 
</P>
<P>
 A lottery selected how the national parties will be listed. Mandela's ANC is 
No. 12. But it follows, all in a row, a series of little-known parties with 
similar sounding names: the Africa Muslim Party, the African Christian 
Democratic Party, the African Democratic Movement and, until recently, the 
African Moderate Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC formally protested that the previously unheard-of AMC had to change 
its name to avoid a mix-up. It did change -- to the African Moderate Congress 
Party, or AMCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Election specialists warn of other problems. The new South Africa will have 
nine provinces instead of the current four. Each province will have its own new 
capital, legislature and government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explaining the difference between regional and national governments is very 
hard when you have to first tell people how to do an X," said Michael Goldberg, 
a program officer with Project Vote, based in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them, the ballots will list each party's name, initials and symbol as 
well as a color photo of its standard-bearer. Any mark that shows a voter's 
clear intention -- an X, a check, even a circle around the picture -- will be 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters who are illiterate, blind or in need of other assistance may ask an 
election official for help in marking the ballot. "But that's a problem too," 
Goldberg said. "We've been telling everyone this is a secret ballot." 
</P>
<P>
 More ominous are regular reports of deliberate intimidation and 
disinformation. De Klerk's campaign rallies have been disrupted repeatedly by 
chanting, spitting, stone-throwing mobs of ANC supporters. At least eight ANC 
offices have been bombed or torched. 
</P>
<P>
 And millions of black voters remain inaccessible to voter-education groups and 
campaigners alike, particularly those who live on farms run by right-wing 
whites and in and around the KwaZulu homeland controlled by Zulu Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party is boycotting the election, and political 
violence between his more militant followers and local ANC members has claimed 
thousands of lives in recent years. They include 15 young ANC election workers 
who were massacred Feb. 19 in southern Natal province after they had put up 
posters for a voter workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of free canvassing will be a factor, and may be a crucial factor," 
in any determination of whether the elections are free and fair, warned Judge 
Johann Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, which is the 
official election watchdog and will certify the final results. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriegler said that access and intimidation worry him far more than ruined 
ballots. "The experience in many other countries, such as Angola, shows the 
percentage of spoiled ballots is often far lower than many people, particularly 
Westerners, expect. . . . The fact that someone is illiterate doesn't mean 
someone is stupid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, voting here won't be simple. It entails 12 steps, including producing 
valid identity documents and getting them stamped. Voters will also have their 
hands marked with ultraviolet-sensitive ink, so no one can vote twice, before 
they can mark the sacred X on the two ballot papers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to know how much is being spent for voter education, but 
estimates reach at least $40 million, not including free air time on state-run 
radio and TV. Most funding comes from governments in the United States, Canada 
and Western Europe. The U.S. Agency for International Development alone has 
earmarked $35 million for election-related assistance, including $20 million 
for voter education. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonanza has sparked a feeding frenzy among potential recipients, according 
to the head of one non-governmental group who asked not to be identified. "It's 
a very avaricious scene," she said. "Everybody wants a piece of the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the money is well spent. Many scheduled workshops, street theater 
performances and other election events, especially in the squalid squatter 
camps and slum townships where most blacks live, run into problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matla Trust, for example, recently announced a workshop and mock election 
in Tswelelang, a rural township with dirt roads and no running water 150 miles 
southwest of Johannesburg. A popular local minister had promised to publicize 
the occasion at his Sunday service and to book a local sports stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fiasco," trainer Dolos Luka, 35, said angrily after arriving with a 
reporter at the locked church and empty stadium. "The priest did nothing." He 
shrugged. "This happens a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the country is awash in TV and radio spots, billboards, newspaper ads 
and graffiti promoting the election. Thousands of minivans used as taxis play 
voter-education tapes; appliance stores screen voter videos on their TVs, and 
theater groups perform educational skits. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual groups is Prophets of the City, a popular black rap 
band that has begun free "Rapping for Democracy" performances at township high 
schools, where many students are over 18 and thus eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 wide-eyed students at Thomas Mofolo High School in Soweto giggled, 
cheered and danced recently in the blazing midday sun when lead singer Dion 
(Ready D) Daniels, in baggy pants and unlaced boots, took the microphone and 
the music thumped and scratched from giant speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vote for hope, it's no joke," he sang. "Show you care for humanity. We can't 
live in a divided society! 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think if you don't vote, you're protected. Because some sucker will 
still get elected! So vote for peace, vote for hope. Yo baby, yo baby, yo baby, 
YO!"

 It is loafing time in the vast Central Valley, and about 2,000 birds are 
spending the twilight hours lounging at Swan Lake, a glassy pearl of fresh 
water and wispy cattails that was bone dry two winters ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks dabble and quack, their afternoon overture joined by a choir of 
squawking gulls and honking geese. Amid the din, elegant white pelicans preen 
silently on the pond's sand island, and a chorus of blackbirds spirals upward, 
their hundreds of wings a dark cloud that blots out the sun before the birds 
glide back to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 After two decades of a disquieting hush at North America's marshes and 
prairies, the sights and sounds of Swan Lake are a symphony of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1970s, biologists have worried about vanishing waterfowl, 
warning that the flocks of wild ducks and other birds that had seemed an 
indelible part of the continent's landscape were dwindling. The decline in 
migratory birds, mainly the result of persistent drought and filling of 
fresh-water wetlands, has long posed one of North America's most insidious 
ecological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the first time, Western waterfowl are making a comeback. Populations 
of ducks and other birds have begun to slowly rebound in the Pacific Flyway, 
the broad band of Western sky from the Arctic Ocean to Mexico traversed by 20% 
of North America's migratory birds, according to research by the U.S. and 
Canadian governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautiously optimistic waterfowl experts give half the credit -- as they did 
half the blame -- to Mother Nature and half to human influences. A decade-long 
drought in key nesting areas of western Canada ended last year and a 
multimillion-dollar effort was launched in the mid-1980s to rebuild North 
American marshes where the birds breed and feed, such as Swan Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "In just one season, as remarkable as it may sound, the birds seem to have 
responded. That's the impression everyone has," said Chris Unkle, California 
wetlands director at the Nature Conservancy, an international conservation 
group. "We've definitely turned the tide. We're going to see some dramatic 
improvements in the overall health of the flyway in the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The most encouraging signs emerged in January, when a mid-winter survey showed 
that populations of ducks, geese and swans in the Pacific Flyway were 5% higher 
than their average for the previous 10 years, according to the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. In California, about 380,000 more ducks, geese, swans and 
coots -- an 11% increase -- were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 While 5% is only a slight gain, the 1994 bird counts signaled a turnaround 
that confirms the hunches of biologists and refuge managers like Gary Zahm, who 
oversees California's largest remaining complex of freshwater wetlands. "I 
think," said Zahm as he watched flocks of ducks feeding in the sprawling San 
Luis National Wildlife Refuge, "that we are poised on a major recovery this 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen hundred miles away, the optimism is echoed by a Canadian counterpart, 
government biologist Bruce Turner, who enthusiastically recites last summer's 
numbers of breeding ducks in southern Alberta -- pintails up 258%, shovelers 
75%, wigeons 17%. Even better, he says, this year's nesting sites "are the best 
I've seen for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The promising bird counts come eight years and $138 million after a large 
public and private wetlands revival began in California, and five years after 
former President Bush pledged to Ducks Unlimited that "recovery, restoration 
and renewal" of the resource is "our moral imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, everyone agrees that a recovery is slow and precarious, and 
although some of the patient's vital signs are improving, waterfowl experts 
warn against prematurely shutting off the life support -- the money and water 
to restore wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell if we are on our way back," cautioned Lew Oring, 
director of ecology and conservation biology at the University of Nevada at 
Reno. "As far as the ducks are concerned, it is a very long and complicated 
road and at best we will have some species that recover and some that will 
never recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Even under the best conditions, North America's ducks and other species 
probably will never again reach the healthy numbers of the 1970s because so 
many of their breeding and wintering sites have been drained or developed. 
Federal and state biologists counted 5.6 million ducks, geese and swans in the 
Pacific Flyway in January, substantially better than the record low of 4.3 
million in 1989, but still 19% below their long-term average of 7 million birds 
from 1955 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics also point out that while the Far Western flyway is faring better, 
the rest of the continent is not. "A miraculous recovery has not occurred," 
warned George Hochbaum, a Canadian Wildlife Service biologist in Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, duck hatching at key locations in central Canada and the Midwestern 
United States declined again last summer, a disappointment that leaves longtime 
Manitoba nature photographer Jack Barrie tempted to pack away his cameras in 
disgust. "In some areas," he said, "it isn't even worth going out anymore to 
take pictures." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just after the turn of the century, ornithologist Frank Chapman visited Los 
Banos, describing the heart of California as "green marshes and shining ponds . 
. . fairly twinkling with flitting wings." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never," he exulted in 1908, "seen birds more abundant." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, perhaps 60 million birds migrated to California's wetlands each 
winter, knitting a feathery blanket in the sky that captured the imaginations 
of poets and photographers, authors and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Central Valley evokes few lyrical responses. Its skies are much 
emptier, attracting about 2.5 million birds each winter, and most of its "green 
marshes and shining ponds" long ago were converted to crops and aqueducts. 
</P>
<P>
 When allowed to flow naturally, runoff of the Sierra Nevada emptied into a 
giant trough that is the Central Valley, and spun a web of rivers and marshes 
that provided shelter and food for waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, not a single bend or crook of the rivers remains natural; every 
movement is commanded by dams and channels that funnel irrigation water to 
rural crops and city faucets. About 95% of California's original 4 million 
acres of wetlands have been drained and now sustain the lives of 30 million 
people instead of 60 million birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't have a wetland in California unless someone writes a check 
and opens up a floodgate and gets the water delivered," said Brad Bortner, 
migratory bird specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's western 
regional office in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterfowl felt the strain of the water diversions. Declines in North American 
wild duck populations started in the late 1970s and early '80s. Especially hard 
hit were pintails, a duck with zigzagging flock patterns once plentiful in 
California; its population has plummeted by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists say that ensuring Central Valley wetlands are in good shape is of 
international importance because 60% of the Pacific Flyway's birds winter 
there. If the wintering grounds are in poor condition, birds cannot find enough 
protein and fat to survive the journey home. 
</P>
<P>
 But California alone did not cause the decline. The dry condition of the 
Canadian prairies, where many Pacific Flyway birds are born each summer, played 
a major role. 
</P>
<P>
 "That local population of birds there in California is really doing well," 
said Hochbaum. "But what happens in the hinterlands tells the story of how 
those populations will respond over time, whether they will go up or whether 
they will go down." 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, most of the breeding grounds in the prairie potholes of Canada 
and the northern United States were parched from a record-long drought. At the 
same time, grain prices skyrocketed, giving landowners an economic incentive to 
rapidly convert the dry land into wheat fields. 
</P>
<P>
 When grain prices stabilized and the drought ended, the scene started to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last summer, there were ponds everywhere, in places where there had never 
been water before," said Turner, who specializes in Pacific Flyway populations 
for the Canadian Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the birds responded immediately. In southern Alberta, the number of 
breeding pintails reported in 1993 was almost triple that of the previous year, 
according to the Canadian Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring looks equally promising, Turner said, since winter storms dropped 
plentiful snow on western Canada. Birds probably will find plenty of spring 
ponds when they return north to breed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now all we need," Turner said, "is all these birds coming back (from 
California) in good shape." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For years, Swan Lake was a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
 A rancher who owned the land had turned more than 5,000 acres of marsh, 
including the small pond, into a barren flat by diverting water so his cattle 
could graze. Ultimately, he went bankrupt, and in 1992, he sold the property 
for $1,000 an acre to the U.S. government, which restored Swan Lake's natural 
state by letting the water flow back in. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Zahm would not have believed the transformation if he had not witnessed 
it himself. Within a month, hundreds of waterfowl began feeding and resting at 
the new pond. Within a year, cattails, a major source of shelter and food for 
birds, reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the birds fly over it and see it, this is like paradise to them," said 
Zahm, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's project leader at the San Luis 
refuge complex in Los Banos. "It's like their ancestors used to see the whole 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
 To rebuild the pond, the federal agency provided little more than a bulldozer 
that created a new inlet and a supply of fresh water diverted from Shasta Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can almost add water and get instant bird use," Zahm said. "The Central 
Valley has lost so many of its wetlands that if you produce them anywhere near 
the area, the birds react to it right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny Swan Lake is just one example of the thousands of acres of wetlands 
rebuilt since the mid-1980s in the Central Valley, the region identified by the 
U.S. government as its top priority for restoring wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, federal and state governments, environmentalists and duck hunting 
clubs in an ambitious project called the Central Valley Habitat Joint Venture 
have spent $138 million to create, improve and preserve wetlands. So far, they 
have restored water to 27,000 acres of dried up land, enhanced 100,000 acres of 
existing wetlands and purchased another 107,000 acres of wetlands from farmers 
and other private property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cumulatively," Oring said, "these wetlands restorations and the curtailment 
of additional losses is bound to keep a whole host of wetlands species from 
going extinct or having serious population crashes." 
</P>
<P>
 Resurrection of the flyway means scrounging not just for money but for water 
-- California's most precious commodity. In that regard, helping waterfowl has 
not been painless for California's farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted by Congress two years ago, the Central Valley Project Improvement Act 
diverted large amounts of water from crops and provided it to wildlife and 
fish. Under the act, Central Valley wetlands were allocated three times more 
federally managed water last year than in 1992, and the amount will increase 
10% every year for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have the water to do it, it's not that much of an issue. But given our 
(water) deficit situation in California, particularly the longterm projections, 
farmers are very concerned," said Mary-Ann Warmerdam, the California Farm 
Bureau's director of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the first hint that restoration dollars and more plentiful 
water have helped came in August, when refuge managers noticed that more 
pintails and green-winged teals were arriving from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ducks, other migratory waterfowl seem to be doing much 
better, especially sandhill cranes, which at three feet tall are one of North 
America's largest birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been phenomenal," said Charlie Stenvall, manager of the Merced 
National Wildlife Refuge. "I see it on a day-to-day basis and there is no 
comparison. Normally we would expect to see 3,000 cranes foraging on the 
refuge. But this year we had 9,000 or 10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Such reports, however, can be deceiving, since resuscitating an injured 
population takes many years. A decade of successful breeding seasons probably 
will have to pass before biologists will feel confident enough to declare the 
crisis over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am speaking optimistically and prematurely when I say we are seeing a 
recovery," said Glenn Olson, western regional representative of the National 
Audubon Society. "I hope it's not just wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Even hunters -- who like to cast a positive spin on the government's bird 
counts because their shooting limits have dropped from 35 ducks allowed per day 
in the 1950s to four last year -- warn that the crisis is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are looking up," said Bob McLandress, research biologist with the 
California Waterfowl Assn., an organization mainly of duck hunting clubs. "But 
unfortunately, we are still at the whim of nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterfowl biologists, who have tried to unravel mysterious fluctuations in 
migratory bird populations for years, warn that throwing money and water at the 
problem is not the whole cure. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding the complexities of nursing the Pacific Flyway back to good 
health takes a bird's-eye view: 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, a Pacific Flyway duck is born in the freshwater ponds of Alberta, 
the Yukon or Alaska. Then, every fall, it heeds its mysterious internal voice 
and flies about 2,000 miles south to warmer climes in California and Mexico. In 
March, it wings back home, repeating the treacherous flight in the opposite 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, each bird encounters any number of man-made and natural 
dangers, from quirky weather in the Arctic to deadly selenium poisoning in 
California. For its species to flourish, it has to do more than survive the 
trek -- it must arrive fit and fat enough to breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no miracle cure," said Hochbaum, who is experimenting in Manitoba 
with creating the right breeding conditions for waterfowl. "We've created all 
kinds of ponds up here, and we now have more ponds than ducks. But water 
doesn't make ducks, and dollars don't make ducks. Only ducks make ducks." A 
Bird's-Eye View 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Flyway is the vast corridor of sky across western North America 
that stretches from the Arctic Ocean to Mexico. About 20% of the continent's 
migratory birds use this path for their annual flight, breeding in the northern 
prairies every summer, flying south every fall and returning every spring. The 
ponds and lakes of California's Central Valley are their most popular winter 
retreat, attracting 60% of the flyway's ducks, geese and other waterfowl.

 Migratory waterfowl in the Pacific Flyway have reached their most encouraging 
numbers in years, according to an annual mid-winter survey conducted last 
month. Most species, however, still have a long way to go to reach the healthy 
populations of decades ago. Every January, migratory birds -- mostly ducks, 
geese, swans and coots -- are counted by federal and state biologists in 
aircraft and on the ground. 05,07,11,11,11,11 1955-1992 1994 1992 1985 Average

DAMAGED SEPULVEDA VA HOSPITAL TO BE RAZED; HEALTH CARE: WASHINGTON OFFICIALS 
DECIDE AGAINST REBUILDING. OUTPATIENT CLINIC WILL REPLACE THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that angered many Los Angeles-area veterans, U. S. Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown announced Monday that the quake-damaged Sepulveda 
VA hospital will be demolished and replaced with a $65-million outpatient care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 431-bed federal hospital has been closed since the Jan. 17 temblor wrecked 
operating rooms, knocked out heat and water supplies and littered corridors 
with broken glass, forcing the evacuation of 331 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in Los Angeles, Brown said he decided not to rebuild 
Sepulveda because the VA must cut costs as it enters the era of managed health 
care, and because there are more than enough beds to absorb evacuated Sepulveda 
patients at the big West Los Angeles VA hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those evacuated from Sepulveda have been at the West Los Angeles 
facility, which has 1,157 inpatient beds, since the quake and will stay there, 
Brown said. He added that even with the Sepulveda patients, there are nearly 
200 empty beds at West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 VA officials in Washington had been considering for the past two months 
whether to rebuild the 39-year-old Sepulveda hospital, the centerpiece of a 
sprawling medical complex in North Hills that employs more than 1,700 and 
features well-regarded programs in geriatric research and medical education. 
The cost of full reconstruction was estimated at $188 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the VA will spend $50 million to tear down the ruined hospital, 
known as Building 3, and repair other structures. It will spend $65 million to 
erect the outpatient center, which is expected to open by February, 1996, and 
will expand ambulatory care programs at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said a 120-bed nursing home at Sepulveda will reopen within six to eight 
weeks. The complex's psychiatric ward will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local veterans reacted angrily to Brown's announcement, saying it may 
jeopardize medical care for people who fought America's wars and will badly 
inconvenience their families, especially those from the San Fernando Valley who 
will be forced to drive an extra 15 miles over congested roads to reach West 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are upset because they've taken something away from them again," 
said Terry Tracy, a spokesman for the American Legion in Los Angeles. 
"Sepulveda was kind of their place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 "Down at the grass-roots level, we're going to have some people hollering like 
hell," said Jerry Williams, California service director for the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. "They have this (hospital) close by, and now it's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for another veterans group said Brown's plan will benefit 
veterans by allowing more of them, especially poor veterans with no 
service-connected disabilities, to receive care. Under federal law, the VA must 
give preference to veterans with service-connected problems, regardless of 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're probably going to take better care of a bunch of new veterans than 
they would have if they just built another bed tower," said Dave Gorman, deputy 
national legislative director for the Disabled American Veterans in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 21 members of Congress from the Los Angeles area signed a letter 
urging Brown to rebuild the hospital, saying that "because of the large 
geographic area, distance, travel time and dense urban population, the other VA 
facilities in Los Angeles do not have the inpatient capacity to adequately 
serve" local veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Closure of the hospital, the members of Congress said, also could damage 
Sepulveda's research programs as well as its academic affiliations with the 
UCLA School of Medicine and other medical training institutions. Last year, 364 
medical residents and interns trained at Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 But after hearing details of the outpatient program from Brown in morning 
telephone calls Monday, several congressman said they believe the secretary's 
proposal makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), whose district includes the 
hospital, said he agreed with Brown that it would be foolish to rebuild the 
hospital given the number of unoccupied beds at the West Los Angeles facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra travel time for Valley-area families, he said, does not represent 
"an undue burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said his proposal is "clearly in the best interests of veterans" and 
will help the VA -- which operates 170 hospitals and 300 clinics nationwide -- 
to continue delivering quality medical care at no cost to veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent closure of Sepulveda's six-story hospital would mark only the 
second time since 1965 that a VA hospital has been shuttered anywhere in the 
United States. Politically powerful veterans groups and their allies in 
Congress traditionally have been able to pressure the VA not to cut services. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the VA's plans to build an outpatient center will not reduce 
Sepulveda's ambulatory care, research or medical training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 VA spokesman Dave Bayard said later that although blueprints have not been 
finalized, the Sepulveda outpatient center is likely to resemble the one in 
Downtown Los Angeles. That clinic features dental services, a pharmacy, an 
emergency room and programs to treat veterans with substance abuse problems and 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown acknowledged that demolishing the hospital will place a strain on 
doctor-patient relationships at Sepulveda, where more than 3,800 surgeries were 
performed in the 1992-93 fiscal year. Instead of physicians being able to 
hospitalize and treat patients in Sepulveda, they will have to transfer them 
into the care of others in West Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of quality, we'll lose nothing," he said. "But in terms of a close 
relationship that our physicians want to maintain with their patients, we're 
losing something there." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said that Sepulveda doctors, nurses and other staffers "did not 
accept this news very well" when he briefed them Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think part of it is based upon the way they have been conducting business 
for many, many years," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have grown to be very fond of their patients, and they want to be able 
to maintain that close, intimate relationship. Obviously, with a change in 
mission, the way we do business will also have to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that of the medical center's 1,700 employees, about 1,000 will be 
kept in North Hills and 400 to 500 others will be transferred to West Los 
Angeles. The remainder will be offered jobs at other VA facilities throughout 
the country. He said none will be laid off.

GSA LEADER ASKS AGENCY TO REVIEW HIS TRAVEL EXPENSES; GOVERNMENT: EX-O.C. 
BUSINESSMAN ROGER JOHNSON VISITED HIS LAGUNA HOME ON FIVE OF NINE OFFICIAL 
TRIPS TO THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Former Orange County businessman Roger Johnson, who now heads the General 
Services Administration, has asked the agency's inspector general to examine 
his travel records after questions were raised about detours he made to his 
Laguna Beach home during official visits to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson visited his home on five of the nine official trips he scheduled 
during his first seven months in office, the Wall Street Journal reported in 
its Monday edition. According to the GSA, the total cost of the trips was at 
least $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after the home visits came to light, Johnson asked for the internal 
review and vowed to reimburse the government for any expenses deemed 
questionable, a GSA spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he (went) to the region, a lot of these trips mixed personal and 
business as he was trying to wrap up things back home," said GSA spokesman Hap 
Connors. "The inspector general is considered an independent arbiter of these 
things . . . and will take the subjective (viewpoint) out of it," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Shaffer, a spokeswoman for GSA Inspector General William R. Barton, said 
Johnson visited Barton last Thursday to request the review, which would 
probably be completed in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, former chief executive of Western Digital Corp., was one of only a 
few Republicans named to high-level posts in the Clinton Administration. He 
gained considerable political leverage when he broke ranks with the Republican 
Party to endorse Clinton's presidential bid, although he has maintained that 
his political party affiliation was not the basis for his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a central player in the Administration's pledge to "reinvent" 
government by eliminating waste and trimming costs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trips West was prompted when Johnson's wife, Janice, called to say 
she was evacuating their home during last fall's devastating fires. "I ran out 
to get a plane," the Journal reported Johnson saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Johnson has since moved to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson denied that he ever intended to misuse tax-supported travel funds and 
said that he paid for part of the trips, including an airline ticket to Utah, 
where he owns another residence.

 "He was told beforehand that he was in compliance with federal regulations by 
our travel and budget people," Connors said. "Quite frankly, he's asking for 
the review as a matter of appearance -- just so there would be no further 
questions. Mr. Johnson has stated that he will reimburse all questionable 
items." 
</P>
<P>
 As a presidential appointee, Johnson is eligible for per diem pay when 
traveling on official business, Connors said. The payments vary according to 
regions of the country, but the ones in question for Johnson range from $30 a 
day for the Utah trip to $38 a day for the California visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journal said it obtained Johnson's travel vouchers through a Freedom of 
Information Act request. The Times could not obtain those records Monday.

 The GSA manages the government's vast real estate holdings and does much of 
its purchasing. It also oversees construction of new buildings, such as the 
proposed Santa Ana federal courthouse.

YOUNG SCRIBES MAKE WAVES IN JOURNALISM; COMMUNICATION: WRITERS FOR A VENTURA 
MIDDLE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER DISCOVER THAT THEIR ARTICLES CAN TRIGGER EXPLOSIVE 
REACTIONS. AND THEIR ADVISER IS GETTING ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AS A DIPLOMAT.

 Tired of writing boring articles about teachers and school officials, 
eighth-grade student Paul Houston decided he wanted to do a story for the 
Anacapa Middle School newspaper that would truly interest his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 So he penned a column defending the MTV show "Beavis and Butt-head." Although 
Paul hoped his column might inspire responses from classmates, he hadn't 
considered another group of potential readers: parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the article, parents called the Anacapa principal to complain that 
Paul's column implied that the school supports the controversial TV show. Some 
even threatened to take the matter to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the parents would see it," Paul said. "I just wrote what I 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul and the rest of the staff of the Anacapa Title Waves have been making 
waves among parents and school officials since the first issue came out last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school launched the newspaper to give students different kinds of 
writing experience, officials said the students are also getting lessons in 
some of the finer points of journalism, including the issues of censorship, 
privacy and fairness. And newspaper adviser Sharon Mittelholtz is becoming a 
quick study in the art of diplomacy between her muckrakers-in-training and the 
powers that be. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same November issue that carried Paul's column, eighth-grader Jennifer 
Woodman had an article that quoted students calling the school cafeteria 
lunches "greasy" and "gross." That did not make the lunchroom manager happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the seemingly innocent personal ads in the back of the newspaper have 
stirred trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 When the newspaper published a personal message that called for a boy named 
Matt to "dump" his girlfriend -- who was named in the article -- because "she's 
not good enough for you," the girl's parents phoned to complain. Now the 
newspaper staff screens personal ads more carefully and omits all last names. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to other complaints, Mittelholtz has had to do some quick damage 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 After she was told that Anacapa cafeteria manager Billie Hayes was distraught 
over the article criticizing the lunchroom fare, Mittelholtz made a quick trip 
across campus to assure Hayes that not all students shared the views of those 
quoted in Jennifer's article. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittelholtz managed to smooth things over with the cafeteria staff by 
publishing follow-up interviews with Hayes and other school food-service 
workers pointing out that Anacapa has one of the most varied cafeteria menus in 
the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to teach history," said Mittelholtz, an English and history 
teacher who is making her first foray into teaching journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittelholtz has become more cautious about what she will publish. 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming issue, due out at the end of this month, two reporters have 
written articles denouncing a school proposal to get rid of all student 
lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mittelholtz showed one of the articles to Anacapa Principal Charlotte 
McElroy, the principal promptly visited the journalism class to explain the 
school's reasons for the locker proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The students who wrote the articles condemning the proposal say they now 
understand the school's position better: Last year, the school had bomb 
threats, which proved false, warning about incendiary devices left in the 
lockers. And the 42-year-old locker stalls are falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But some newspaper staff members still oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mittelholtz is concerned that if she prints their criticism, she risks 
offending her boss, McElroy. "There's things that are worth battling over and 
this isn't one of them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such attention from the principal has caused some frustration from the 
newspaper's writers: After his "Beavis and Butt-head" column was published, 
Paul wrote an article condemning censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear of reprisals has not silenced the newspaper staff or led 
Mittelholtz to shy away from all potentially controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent edition, reporter Chris Muirhead defends a video game 
called "Mortal Kombat," which is so violent that some parents have complained 
to local video arcades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted people to know about it and I wanted them to have their own 
opinions," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Title Waves articles are contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper also has an occasional fashion page with photographs of some of 
Anacapa's trendiest dressers, standard news articles on school activities and 
student poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular features is a coupon approved by the principal that 
entitles the bearer to a night free of homework in a particular class, such as 
math. "They sell better with the coupons," said Joan Kim, an eighth-grade 
student who is one of two co-editors this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Title Waves staffers say one of the best things about their newspaper is that 
its writers know what subjects interest their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as seventh-grader Amrit Chima, who was on the Title Waves staff last 
semester, put it: "They don't want to hear about the national economy."

SPEAKER BROWN DEBUTS AS POLITICAL TALK SHOW MODERATOR; MEDIA: ASSEMBLY LEADER 
GETS A 13-WEEK TRIAL RUN TO TEST TV WATERS AS THE HOST OF A SACRAMENTO MORNING 
PROGRAM. HIS FIRST PRODUCTION FEATURES A LIVELY DEBATE ON THE 'THREE STRIKES' 
ISSUE. 
</P>

<P>
 For 30 years, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has wowed his fellow lawmakers 
with his glib tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the flamboyant San Francisco Democrat is testing whether his political 
charisma translates into successful television, and in doing so he is colliding 
head-on into stars of TV's morning galaxy such as Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee 
Gifford, Vicki Lawrence and Sesame Street's Big Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's niche: playing the role of populist talk show host fighting "for the 
little guy." 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 a.m. Monday, the "Willie Brown" show began a 13-week trial run on 
KCRA-TV, the NBC affiliate in Sacramento. The taped debut of the 
five-day-a-week program featured a fast-paced debate on the "three strikes and 
you're out" anti-crime initiative, which Brown opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get ready to be enlightened, provoked and moved into action," Brown told 
viewers. And for the most part, the veteran politician kept the proceedings 
lively, egging on the participants to mix it up, though at times the show 
bogged down on the relative merits of competing anti-crime proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old Speaker, who is a half-owner of the show, hopes to share in 
long-range profits if the 30-minute program takes off and goes into 
syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 The Willie Brown show was the idea of station owner Jon Kelly, who late last 
year approached the Speaker about making the leap into TV. Brown is not a 
stranger to the entertainment field, owning an Oakland radio station, having a 
bit part in the motion picture "The Godfather, Part III" and hobnobbing with 
Hollywood film personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who represents an overwhelmingly Democratic district and does not have 
to worry about reelection, took up the challenge. He agreed to host a daily 
public affairs show such as the "McLaughlin Group" but "not quite as dry," 
according to Val Nicholas, the show's creative consultant. Half a dozen shows 
were taped in advance of Monday's debut, one of which was pre-screened two 
weeks ago for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas helped devise a format in which Brown sits at a long table flanked by 
several guests, usually on opposing sides of an issue. Brown serves as a 
moderator. At times, he is animated and asks questions. The next moment, he can 
be serious and somber. He tries to withhold his own opinion until the program's 
"last word" section. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the show, Brown pops up from his seat and stands next to a TV 
monitor, as a citizen questions the guests. To make Brown feel at home, KCRA 
had a replica of an Assembly chamber desk put on the set as a prop for him to 
lean against. Some future shows may air live, according to a Brown spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the program hit the airwaves, Brown told a reporter, "There's not much 
that intimidates me but I'm really nervous." Two weeks ago, the station showed 
the press a program on political corruption and Brown appeared rattled and 
breathless. He umpired a debate between Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and Donald Heller, a lawyer who represented 
a top Capitol lobbyist convicted of political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday's offering, the Speaker was much more relaxed and in command. 
Brown's guests included Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter Polly's 
kidnaping and murder fueled the "three strikes" debate; Mike Reynolds, who 
championed the anti-crime initiative, and Margaret Pena of the American Civil 
Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said her group opposes the death penalty, even for Richard Allen Davis, 
who was arrested for Polly Klaas' murder. That prompted Marc Klaas to grimace 
and assail the ACLU for dragging out death penalty appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Brown acted as if he was a noncombatant in the Capitol's 
political struggles. The Speaker criticized the "three strikes" initiative, 
saying it should not be on the ballot "because it was written by politicians 
for political purposes." While he voted against a bill similar to the 
initiative, politician Brown favored several alternative "three strikes" 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the first show aired, Brown's potential as a host was hailed by 
Van Gordon Sauter, Fox TV executive and husband of Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie has an energy level and directness that makes him a very engaging 
television talent," said Sauter, who viewed an early pilot of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes up out of the screen and whether one relishes him or finds him 
abominable, he nonetheless commands your attention and that is the first step 
to success in the business. He also has about him a certain mischievousness 
that leads you to believe that something is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows that Brown has taped include segments with former presidential 
candidate Jesse Jackson, Sacramento County Sheriff Glenn Craig on kids and 
guns, and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan 
Nelson on immigration issues. Brown hopes to woo Gov. Pete Wilson to his set a 
few blocks from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the show could pave the way for a new career for the veteran 
legislator and lawyer, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection in 
1996 to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even if the program fails with the public, broadcaster Brown is 
making his presence known in the Capitol. As the Assembly adjourned Monday, 
presiding officer Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) cracked that the chamber would 
reconvene Thursday, "right after the Speaker's TV show."

EX-INSPECTOR OF A-PLANT, EDISON SETTLE LAWSUIT; COURTS: THE FORMER NUCLEAR 
REGULATORY COMMISSION EMPLOYEE CLAIMS SHE CONTRACTED CANCER WHILE WORKING AT 
SAN ONOFRE REACTOR. THE POWER COMPANY DENIES ANY LIABILITY BUT AGREES TO A 
MONETARY PAYMENT.

<P>
 On the eve of a retrial, the operators of the San Onofre nuclear power plant 
reached a monetary settlement Monday with a former inspector who claims she got 
cancer from leaking radiation at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint statement, both sides said the unpredictability of a second jury 
trial and the declining health of 44-year-old Rung C. Tang made a settlement 
advantageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pledged not to reveal how much money Southern California Edison agreed to 
pay Tang and her heirs in exchange for her dropping her negligence lawsuit 
against Edison. Before the first trial, which ended with a federal court jury 
deadlocked 7 to 2 in favor of Tang, her attorneys had offered to drop the suit 
for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Tang's attorneys, Suzelle Smith, from the Los Angeles firm of Howarth & 
Smith, said Tang is "delighted with the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is still recovering from her bone marrow transplant and a second trial 
would have been very taxing on her," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rosenblum, an Edison vice president, said the company decided to 
settle because of the "unique aspects" of the case. Still, the company remains 
confident that Tang's chronic myelogenous leukemia was not caused by exposure 
at San Onofre and that the plant is safe for workers and surrounding 
communities, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way is this settlement an admission of responsibility for Ms. Tang's 
illness," Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders in the anti-nuclear movement hailed the settlement as a victory 
and predicted further cancer lawsuits against the nation's 109 nuclear plants 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's marvelous that somebody has finally been able to stand up to 
them," said Dr. John W. Gofman, founder of the San Francisco-based Committee 
for Nuclear Responsibility. "The nuclear industry doesn't back down easily and 
so they must have known they had a big problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 James Riccio, co-author of a nationwide report scalding the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission for alleged laxity in overseeing the nuclear industry, said the Tang 
settlement, while not as definitive as a jury verdict, "shows that science is 
beginning to catch up to the nuclear industry." 
</P>
<P>
 As more is known about the dangers of low-level doses of radiation, more 
lawsuits will be filed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the nuclear industry matures, more cancers are going to occur," said 
Riccio, a staff member with the Washington-based group Public Citizen. Edison 
"says it is not admitting liability, but a settlement is certainly a tacit 
admission that the other side had a very strong case." 
</P>
<P>
 Tang's suit was the first time a nuclear worker had sued a plant on grounds 
that he or she had contracted cancer. As such, the case was closely watched by 
the industry, governmental regulators and the anti-nuclear movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang worked as a Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspector at San Onofre during 
a period in 1985 and 1986 in which the plant was plagued with defective fuel 
rods and "fuel fleas," microscopic particles of radiation that seeped into 
supposedly safe areas of the plant. Edison is the operator and majority owner 
of the plant, which is on the coast north of Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's partner, Don Howarth, said the law firm has been contacted by a dozen 
San Onofre employees about filing similar lawsuits. He said no decision has 
been made on taking any of the cases but that nothing in the Tang settlement 
would prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of Tang's suit ended Feb. 8 with a majority of jurors believing that 
Edison's sloppiness had allowed Tang to receive an unsafe dose of radiation, 
assertions that the company vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors interviewed after the trial expressed anger at Edison and admiration 
for the plaintiff's star witness, Dr. Harry Demopoulos, a New York pathologist 
and cancer causation specialist who testified that Tang's leukemia was the 
direct result of her San Onofre exposure. Edison had countered with testimony 
by a UCLA professor, Dr. Robert Gale. 
</P>
<P>
 Between trials, Edison officials took reporters on tours of San Onofre, 
talking freely about Tang and her years at the plant. Included in the tour was 
a stop beneath a water pipe where Tang alleged that she had been splashed with 
radioactive water. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison had also sought to block Tang's attorneys from discussing the case out 
of court. News organizations had geared up to fight the request for a gag 
order, which was to have been heard today by Federal Magistrate Rudi Brewster 
before jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang was one of the first women hired as a Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
inspector. A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she left 
the NRC after her tour at San Onofre to join her sister's insurance agency in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Her leukemia was diagnosed in late 1992 and she remains bedridden. Radiation 
treatments caused her to lose her hair. Doctors have given her a 50% chance of 
living five years.

STREAMLINED FEMA QUAKE ASSISTANCE SEEN; AID: CRITICIZED FOR EXCESSIVE RED TAPE 
IN PAST DISASTERS, THE FEDERAL AGENCY HAS PUT ON A NEW FACE. A RECENT AGREEMENT 
INCREASES THE STATE'S ROLE IN APPROVING NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE REBUILDING 
PROJECTS.

<P>
 It took only a few seconds in 1989 for the strains of the Loma Prieta 
earthquake to wreak destruction on a historic portion of Stanford University's 
main library. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take eight years or longer to repair the damage. Mired in disputes 
between state and federal officials, the graceful building that dates to 1919 
is not expected to be open to students before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenarios such as this concern California authorities as they begin to rebuild 
Southern California after the Northridge earthquake. They hope that such 
conflicts will not be replayed as the Los Angeles area shifts its attention 
from the shocks of the temblor to long-term restoration of public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The record after disasters such as the Loma Prieta quake and southern 
Florida's Hurricane Andrew is not promising. Many projects were stalled by 
mounds of paperwork, public debate over reconstruction and disputes over the 
design and costs of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This phase we're going into has not been an entirely positive one in terms of 
past experience," said Richard Andrews, director of California's Office of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Andrews remains wary, there are encouraging signs that the agency 
that oversees disaster efforts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has 
put on a new face. FEMA Director James Lee Witt, who inherited numerous 
drawn-out controversies when he took over the agency last year, has taken steps 
to alleviate some longstanding problems and streamline the process to avoid 
delays in rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he recently concluded an agreement with California that gives the 
state greater responsibility in reviewing and approving projects that improve 
damaged buildings beyond their pre-quake conditions. And he vowed to a 
congressional subcommittee that FEMA will spend most of the $4.7 billion 
appropriated to it to assist in quake recovery efforts before the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford library wing is illustrative of both California's frustrations 
with FEMA and the newfound optimism. After more than four years of wrangling 
over the costs of repairs, FEMA and university officials last month reached an 
agreement. Disputes involving several other damaged buildings on the campus are 
also close to being concluded, said Valery Veronin, Stanford's acting director 
of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witt has made a big difference and we have noticed positive changes all the 
way through the FEMA organization," Veronin said. "Before, they were talking 
about returning buildings to their pre-earthquake conditions; now they're 
talking mitigation, and that's a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake in Los Angeles is the timetable for restoring hundreds of public 
buildings such as the Van Nuys City Hall complex, which sustained an estimated 
$7 million in damage; the Barnsdall Park and Recreation Center, with an 
estimated $2 million in damage; the Greek Theater, which officials estimate 
will cost at least $250,000 to fix, and the 62-year-old Los Angeles Coliseum, 
with a price tag estimated at $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $4.7 billion appropriated to FEMA for the earthquake recovery effort, 
$2.8 billion has been promised to help local governments repair damaged 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said that after the Loma Prieta quake, "FEMA essentially became a 
design engineering firm which attempted to redesign all of our proposed 
projects. There was a tendency to constantly seek the cheapest solution -- even 
if it was not in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard W. Krimm, FEMA's associate director in charge of response and 
recovery, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to be practical and also have the buildings meet whatever the 
current codes are," he said. "With so many disasters, we have to be fiscally 
responsible in administering the program." 
</P>
<P>
 But FEMA officials also concede that operations in the past have not run as 
smoothly as they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing before a House Appropriations subcommittee reviewing FEMA's 
1995 budget request, lawmakers voiced concern about the agency's performance in 
a catastrophe once is it no longer the stuff of the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 California Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) told Witt that "after the crisis had 
disappeared from the mind's eye," there is a danger that long-term rebuilding 
projects will "fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carrie P. Meek (D-Fla.) complained to Witt that after Hurricane Andrew 
there seemed to be a "lack of consistency in the decision-making process within 
FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 Meek, in a later interview, described a maddening process in which hundreds of 
cleanup and rebuilding projects were given the green light by one set of FEMA 
officials, only to be halted by another group of bureaucrats -- with demands 
that money already expended be returned to FEMA. Meeks and other Florida 
officials said that Witt has begun to clear up these conflicts in recent days. 
Witt plans to travel to Florida shortly in an effort to wrap them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some initial steps taken to resolve these issues," said Toni 
Riordan, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Community Affairs. But, 
she added, "we have 18 months of unfairness and unhappiness to resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite FEMA's new efforts under Witt, California officials say the agency 
has still failed to pay out 41% of the $431 million promised to the Bay Area to 
repair public facilities damaged by the Loma Prieta quake, although FEMA 
disputes the figure. San Francisco's elegant City Hall is still braced with 
scaffolding because state officials and FEMA have not been able to agree on the 
cost of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 State and city officials estimate that the price tag will be at least $120 
million. FEMA, relying on assessments from its engineers, so far has agreed to 
pay about $4 million. Krimm contends that the delays stem from the city's 
desire to rebuild with costly state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't oppose that, but we have to look at the taxpayers' dollars 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, the multimillion-dollar rebuilding project at the west wing of 
the Green Library ran into similar snags. FEMA engineers produced an estimate 
for restoring the building that was far lower than that arrived at by the state 
and university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "FEMA proposed a design that Santa Clara County building inspectors refused to 
approve," said state emergency chief Andrews. "They said: 'We won't give you a 
permit to open if it's built like that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Veronin said that university officials submitted a claim for $20 
million in repairs; FEMA, she said, insisted that the building could be 
repaired for $11 million. After four years, the disaster agency agreed last 
month to repair costs of $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said he is committed to preventing Northridge repairs from "dragging 
on for years and years" and that Witt, an old friend, shares that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials say they are hopeful that FEMA has adopted a new 
direction under Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received about $75 million from FEMA on repair projects expected 
to total $400 million, said Bob Canfield, a city emergency preparedness 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover its bases, Los Angeles has hired a consulting firm familiar with FEMA 
procedures to help the city maximize its claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get an awful lot of money, so when these issues come up, we 
want to be prepared," Canfield said.

U.S. MOVES TO BOLSTER MOSCOW TIES; DIPLOMACY: CHRISTOPHER VISITS RUSSIAN 
COUNTERPART ON WAY HOME FROM ASIA. HE PUSHES FOR COOPERATION ON GLOBAL 
PROBLEMS.

 Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei 
V. Kozyrev on Monday to smooth over recent strains in the ties between the two 
countries, urging closer cooperation on problems such as Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, in a quip that reflected the touchiness of the relationship between 
Washington and Moscow, Kozyrev told the secretary of state, "We've worked out a 
way to communicate more clearly than (through) CNN," U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Christopher told the Russian foreign minister of his time as 
chairman of the Los Angeles law firm O'Melveny & Myers, when he kept a card on 
his desk saying, "Most of the partners, most of the time, care more about being 
consulted than how it comes out." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher stopped for more than three hours in Russia's far eastern port 
city as he was flying home from an 11-day tour of Asia. He had first invited 
Kozyrev to Washington, but the Russian foreign minister asked to meet in Russia 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia's plainly wanting to assert its significance as a power," observed one 
senior Administration official after Christopher's meeting with the foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior official said Christopher did not want to challenge Russia's new 
assertiveness but was eager to maintain a good relationship with Kozyrev "so we 
can get out on the table, and be candid about, the differences we see." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Kozyrev complained that the United States was taking Russia 
for granted. "Relations between a superpower and a regional power or between a 
senior partner and a junior partner are not acceptable to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials, meanwhile, were surprised and irked by Kozyrev's 
recent trip to the Middle East. While in Tunis, Tunisia, Kozyrev announced that 
Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, was willing to 
return to the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 That announcement attracted considerable publicity and underscored Russia's 
renewed interest in playing a greater role in the Middle East. But American 
officials felt it was misleading, because Kozyrev neglected to address the 
critical issue of exactly when and how the PLO would return to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship (between the United States and Russia) can't afford to have 
people spring surprises on each other," one Christopher aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official told reporters that during the Vladivostok 
meeting, Christopher briefed Kozyrev on the "fairly complex time sequence" 
involved in resuming Middle East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're on the same wavelength now," the senior U.S. official said, 
strongly implying that this was not the case while Kozyrev was meeting with the 
PLO. "We'll work in close harmony to try to get the parties back to the table. 
It's a situation in which we (the United States and Russia) might have 
benefited from some earlier consultations." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also warned that the Clinton Administration policy of seeking a 
strategic partnership with Russia is now increasingly being challenged in the 
U.S. Congress. While testifying on Capitol Hill last month, Christopher was 
repeatedly asked about the rise of more conservative forces in Russia and about 
Moscow's more assertive, nationalistic foreign policy. Clinton too has recently 
said he is "concerned" about the direction of political changes in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vladivostok session was clearly aimed at overcoming these recent 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to minimize the impact of Kozyrev's complaint that Russia is receiving 
"junior partner" treatment, Christopher, 68, told a news conference, "I'm 
senior in terms of chronology, but we're full and equal partners in every other 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The most persistent of the problems between the United States and Russia 
involves Bosnia, where Russia recently launched an important new diplomatic 
initiative by sending peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo without consulting in 
advance with the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher knows he needs to enlist Russia's help to persuade the Bosnian 
Serbs to give up territory. "Both of us feel an urgent need to bring that 
conflict to an end," he said of Bosnia.

 The British government rebuffed a call for talks with the Irish Republican 
Army, which is believed to be behind three mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport 
in the past week. After false bomb warnings shut Heathrow and London's other 
major airport, Gatwick, the IRA issued a statement proclaiming its "positive 
and flexible attitude toward the peace process" and demanding concessions from 
Britain. However, a spokesman for British Prime Minister John Major said, "It 
is deeply offensive to people in Ireland and Britain that the IRA should claim 
to be interested in peace while continuing to kill in cold blood and to mount 
acts of terrorism."

legislative elections that also set the stage for a presidential vote in May. 
Economist Ernesto Samper was chosen to be the Liberal Party's presidential 
candidate. His main opponent will be Andres Pastrana, the son of a former 
president who represents the Conservative Party and a coalition of smaller 
parties.

URBAN MASH UNIT BRINGS AID TO NEEDY; DENVER INSTALLATION IS THE FIRST TIME SUCH 
A FIELD HOSPITAL HAS BEEN OPENED TO U.S. CIVILIANS OUTSIDE A DISASTER AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The gunshots heard nightly around the cluster of olive drab military tents 
aren't the sounds of battlefield skirmishes. They are blasts from drive-by 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 But some relief has come to this decaying neighborhood in the shadows of 
Denver's skyscrapers, where a MASH unit is busy caring for the homeless and the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Guard's two-week mission represents the first time that a field 
hospital of this scale has been opened to U.S. civilians outside a disaster 
area. Officials expect to treat 200 to 300 needy patients a day, offering 
dental and vision care and basic outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until now, most of the 147th Combat Support Hospital unit's training has 
been simulated. About 20 guard units across the country have conducted 
real-life training operations, but all have been overseas, mostly in Central 
and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing medical missions overseas for years," said Capt. Joe Rice, 
the project coordinator. "Last year Congress passed authorization for a pilot 
program and that's why we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Simulated training has led to deficiencies and inadequate staffing among the 
National Guard troops and reservists who accounted for more than half the 
medical experts serving during the Persian Gulf War, according to the General 
Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "During Desert Storm there was a shortage of personnel available to treat 
noncombat needs such as dental or gynecological services," said Mark Gebicke, a 
military operations expert with the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, dental care is the most sought-after service provided by the temporary 
MASH unit here. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Weiderspan, 45, limped into the compound on a severely swollen leg. 
But it wasn't her that leg that drove her here; it was her aching teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a wad of bloody gauze packed on the left side of her mouth, 
Weiderspan said, "I was trying to take them out myself, like I did the two on 
the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 As dentist Daniel Savistske, 41, helped her from the dental chair, Weiderspan 
smiled and said, "That didn't hurt at all. Thank you and bless you so much." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're welcome," Savistske said. Later, he shook his head. "I've been pulling 
a lot of teeth; you'd think it was the Third World." 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop for Weiderspan: the optometrist's tent. Because of diabetes, 
Weiderspan's eyesight has deteriorated so much that her two-year-old 
prescription glasses are now useless. She made an appointment to return in 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiderspan, who trades housekeeping and cooking for a place to sleep, also 
hadn't been taking her diabetes medication for the past month because she 
couldn't afford it. The field pharmacists gave her a supply of donated 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the patients at the clinic, which opened last week, are homeless or 
truly needy. Chisandra Burden, 42, who is putting herself through graduate 
school, heard about the service on television and came seeking relief for a 
painful tooth. "I'm paying taxes, I'm not homeless," Burden said. "But I'm 
struggling to make enough to survive and finish school, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice estimated the average cost of treatments at the clinic at $42 per 
patient, contrasted with $92 at a county hospital and $142 at a private 
hospital or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 National Guard administrators said that the success of this pilot project and 
its cost effectiveness is likely to spawn similar training missions in at least 
35 other states later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The military medical mission comes at the time when President Clinton's 
proposal to provide health insurance for every American is under attack and 
many alternatives are being debated. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in Colorado to promote the President's 
health care reform plan, swept through the MASH unit Monday shaking hands with 
patients and National Guard troops. She wished a happy birthday to 4-year-old 
Gabrielle Thorne of Denver, whose presents included two shots in the thigh and 
an oral polio vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton praised the Guard and its project. "I've seen many Guard units 
respond to disasters here in this country, but I've never seen them provide 
services like this. . . . It's a common sense solution to a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the dire health care needs of the two dozen or so clinic patients 
Monday afternoon reflected those of the needy elsewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are groundbreakers," she told the doctors, nurses and medics on hand. "I 
hope this will become a model across the country."

HOUSE SEEKS TO MAKE A POINT WITH TV DEBATES, OXFORD-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, C-SPAN insomniacs, get a good grip on your remote controls. Beginning 
Wednesday, you will see something unusual on the floor of the U.S. House of 
Representatives: an authentic Oxford-style debate, unsullied by cheap sound 
bites, in which politicians attempt to discuss the most pressing issues of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 "As hard as it may be for some people to believe it, many members of Congress 
are as disappointed with the general level of debate around here as the viewing 
public is," a House leadership aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, the first of three to be broadcast live on the third Wednesday of 
every month after the House has adjourned for the day, will give both sides a 
chance to present the philosophical positions that underlie the mumbo jumbo of 
legislative floor tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Floor arguments over legislation generally do not reach those broader issues, 
explained Rep. Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, a member of the GOP leadership 
who is helping to organize the debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often our floor debates are about the technical aspects of legislation," 
Walker said. "The public tunes in and hears people talking not about the issues 
but about Section 401C of a particular bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the rules of the Oxford University Political Union, each four-member 
team will make an opening statement that will be followed by individual 
arguments and cross-examination by the other side. Guided by a moderator, the 
debate will volley back and forth until the closing statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute debates are the second step that Democratic and Republican 
leaders have taken to improve the image of Congress that millions of viewers 
see courtesy of the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, taken last month, was a bipartisan agreement to prohibit C-SPAN's 
cameras from showing how empty the House chamber usually is during Special 
Orders, the period at the end of each legislative day when lawmakers can make 
speeches about issues of their choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 C-SPAN devotees may be watching those after-hour discourses, but few members 
of Congress are. The leadership thought that the practice of panning the 
chamber to reveal row after row of empty seats was giving viewers the 
"misimpression that nobody around here does any work," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they prove popular, the formal Oxford-style debates could end up polishing 
Congress' tarnished public image, analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be an effort to have Congress try to present itself to the public in 
a way that is ennobling, rather than demeaning," said Thomas E. Mann, director 
of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that legislative rules often "preclude serious debates from happening" 
on the House floor, Mann added that the Oxford-style format should "let the 
public see that it's not all special interests and getting elected, that 
matters of high interest and principle" are also a part of the legislative 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's debate is on health care, a topic chosen by the Democrats who won 
the first toss of the coin. Debaters on the Democratic side will be Majority 
Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, Pete 
Stark of Oakland and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. For the Republicans, 
arguments will be made by Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Bill Thomas 
of Bakersfield, Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans will choose the subject of the second debate, which Walker said, 
will either be welfare or crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the third debate are not final, although it is expected to mix 
Democrats and Republicans on two bipartisan teams to discuss a foreign policy 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be quite different from what we normally do in Congress," Waxman 
said. "I never saw myself as a great debater," he added, "but we have an 
historic opportunity to enact health care reform and the public should hear 
what the broader issues are."

NEWS ANALYSIS; AT G-7, U.S. SEEKS RECRUITS FOR CULT OF CLINTONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For President Clinton, bringing the world to the Rust Belt to talk about jobs 
Monday represented a risky gambit to transplant his liberal Democratic domestic 
agenda into the rarefied air of the international economic arena. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Clinton sought to turn over an entire summit of Western 
industrialized nations to a debate on one specific economic problem that is 
normally the preserve of domestic politics -- joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, he sought to lecture America's European allies on the need to 
embrace change in their ossified social safety nets -- and to accept something 
much closer to U.S.-style labor policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here because we have something to learn from each other and hopefully 
something to teach each other" about labor policies, Clinton told the foreign 
leaders in his most professorial tone Monday. "We can't just fall into 
dogmatism or ideology." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Clinton and his senior advisers have turned this week's 
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations into a celebration of 
Clintonomics, touting the same theme of good jobs at good wages that powered 
his 1992 presidential campaign. And the session may also offer a model for the 
way the Clinton Administration seeks to shape and focus the economic debate 
among the global powers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The message from the Administration to Europe and Japan was clear -- there 
should be a "convergence" among industrialized nations on their approaches to 
labor policies. 
</P>
<P>
 That convergence, U.S. officials said, should come somewhere between the 
rigid, worker-protection policies common in Europe and the freewheeling U.S. 
policies of the 1980s that led to rapid job growth but growing inequality. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so coincidently, Clinton's labor policies -- calling for a sharp increase 
in federal investments in training and apprenticeship programs -- fall right 
between those extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the gamble for Clinton is that America's allies may resent his efforts to 
reassert U.S. dominance over the direction of international economic affairs. 
They may see Washington's emphasis on coordinating labor policies among the 
major powers as a new form of meddling in their domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, during the opening session of the conference, chief White House 
economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson gave a long analysis of the problems facing 
European nations as they try to find a way to catch up with America in the pace 
of job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's sophisticated apprenticeship and training system won praise from 
Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and other 
U.S. officials. But the focus was clearly on Clinton's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, U.S. officials repeatedly stressed the need for European leaders 
to understand that they and their nations should not resist the onslaught of 
productivity gains from technological advances that eliminate jobs in the short 
run; productivity improvements, they asserted, ultimately create more jobs than 
they destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials denied that they were trying to hold up Clinton 
policies as the model for the world. "I don't think it's a question of us 
lecturing them," insisted Robert Rubin, chairman of the President's National 
Economic Council. "It's a question of learning from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledge that the summit is a purely American 
show, proposed by Clinton and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to highlight the 
growing interdependence between domestic and international economic issues -- a 
message aimed as much at U.S. voters as it was at the foreign leaders. "This 
was a U.S. idea all the way," said Assistant Labor Secretary Doug Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to emphasize the domestic angle, the conference was the first G-7 summit 
attended not only by the U.S. Treasury secretary but by the domestic-oriented 
secretaries of commerce and labor and the chairwoman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insisted Monday that while they were initially concerned that 
the Europeans and Japanese would think that the United States was trying to 
meddle in their domestic labor policies, the foreign leaders have expressed 
enthusiasm for U.S. efforts to open an international dialogue on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worried a lot beforehand about the potential for resentment, but we 
haven't seen any of that," said W. Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the 
National Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Administration officials added that recession and high unemployment in 
Europe have forced leaders there to acknowledge the failings of costly European 
social welfare systems, which protect workers with rich unemployment benefits, 
thus giving them little incentive to go back to work and giving corporations 
even fewer incentives to hire costly new workers.

ISRAELI PEACE GROUP SAYS SETTLERS SHOULD COME HOME; MIDEAST: REPORT OFFERS A 
PHASED PLAN. IT WOULD LEAVE NO JEWS IN OCCUPIED LANDS AFTER FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's leading peace group urged Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday to 
bring home 30,000 Jewish settlers from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to 
avert widespread bloodshed during the Palestinian self-government there and to 
remove all settlers in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that Israel's 144 West Bank and Gaza settlements are both a target for 
Palestinian radicals and a source of Jewish extremists, Peace Now said their 
continued presence, "fostering violence and bloodshed between settlers and 
Palestinians," endangers peace prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 As Israel turns over control of Gaza, the West Bank district of Jericho and 
eventually all the West Bank to a Palestinian administration, there will be 
more clashes, the group said, asserting that "there is no possibility for 
coexistence between the two populations, especially not under Palestinian 
rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace Now leader Tzaly Reshef warned: "Real agreement with the Palestinians 
cannot be achieved without removal of the settlers. If the government wants 
this agreement to work, it has to be courageous and evacuate the settlers." 
</P>
<P>
 With a phase-by-phase plan for the settlers' removal from the most volatile 
areas first, Peace Now is seeking to prove to Rabin, who opposes any immediate 
evacuation, that the problem can be solved and that he stands to lose more by 
delaying than by acting soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hebron massacre showed that the government cannot put off the question of 
settlements until the final negotiations with the Palestinians -- it must deal 
with this issue now or see everything collapse," said Galia Golan of Peace Now. 
</P>
<P>
 The group called for the immediate removal of 450 Israelis who have settled in 
four neighborhoods of Hebron, where a settler massacred about 30 Palestinians 
as they prayed last month. Fearing revenge attacks on Israelis, the army has 
imposed a curfew on the city of 70,000 for more than two weeks, allowing 
Palestinians out for only two hours every three days to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army cannot keep tens of thousands of people locked in their homes 
indefinitely to protect these settlers," said Amiram Goldblum, an author of the 
Peace Now report. "This is not sustainable; it's not viable. . . . The only 
solution is evacuating those settlers -- for their own safety." 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of ministers already favor this, Israeli political sources say. But 
Rabin continues to resist, believing it would reopen the agreement signed with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization on self-government that left all 
settlements in place for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreign Minister Shimon Peres hinted at new flexibility Monday. "If 
communities have to be moved, it is an Israeli decision, not part of the 
negotiations with the Palestinians," Peres said. 
</P>
<P>
 More controversial, however, would be the next phase in Peace Now's plan -- 
closure of 52 settlements close to Palestinian villages and reachable only on 
roads through Palestinian towns. Most of their 26,000 residents are religiously 
and ideologically motivated in their desire to settle the entire biblical Land 
of Israel; they will resist moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace Now, which has opposed the settler movement since the group was founded 
in 1978, advocates either the settlers' immediate evacuation or a shortening of 
the time in which an agreement will be reached with the Palestinians on these 
settlements' future. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace Now also proposed the immediate evacuation of the 4,500 Israeli settlers 
from the Gaza Strip, although the agreement with the PLO allows them to remain 
for the five-year interim period of autonomy.

 Another category of settlements, not near Palestinian towns and reachable on 
well-guarded roads, could be left until later, Peace Now said, but the 50,000 
residents, who moved there largely for a better lifestyle, should be encouraged 
to return to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the government crackdown on Jewish extremist groups, police arrested two 
more ultranationalist leaders Monday with the intent of detaining them for 
three months. They also searched the Jerusalem and West Bank homes of other 
activists for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But police said they were waiting for precise instructions from the attorney 
general on how to proceed with the Cabinet decision outlawing two groups, Kach 
and Kahane Chai, as "terrorist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, the government survived three 
no-confidence votes Monday after members of the opposition Likud Party 
condemned the decision to ban the groups rather than charge their leaders with 
crimes and bring them to trial.

U.S. MILITARY PLANE CRASHES OFF KENYA; 1 KILLED, 10 MISSING

 An American AC-130 aerial gunship crashed into the Indian Ocean off Kenya on 
Monday, killing one crewman and leaving 10 missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other crew members were plucked from the water by rescuers, said Army 
Col. Steve Rausch.Kenyan divers and fishing boats, as well as several U.S. 
aircraft, were continuing the search. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane had taken off from Mombasa, Kenya, and was on its way to Somalia "to 
conduct a routine mission" in support of U.S. forces there, said a Pentagon 
spokesman, Cmdr. Joe Gradisher, in Washington. There were no indications that 
the plane went down due to hostile fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rausch said the crash would be investigated but that it appears to have 
resulted from a malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The AC-130 is a heavily armed version of the four-engine C-130 cargo plane, 
one of the workhorses of the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 Four AC-130s have been operating since June from Kenya's port city of Mombasa. 
Kenya borders Somalia to the southwest and has long served as a base for both 
U.S. military and humanitarian efforts aimed at Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Rausch said two 60-millimeter mortar shells exploded 
Monday evening near Mogadishu's seaport, where 320 U.S. soldiers were awaiting 
shipment to Mombasa. Neither shell caused any injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. withdrawal from Somalia is due to be completed by the end of the 
month.

COLLISION IGNITES OIL TANKER IN TURKISH STRAIT; 15 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters fought an oil tanker fire in Istanbul's Bosporus Strait on Monday 
after a late-night collision with a freighter killed at least 15 seamen and 
choked one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen other crew members from the two ships were missing, and there seemed 
little hope of finding survivors from the inferno that ripped through the 
tanker Nassia and the Shipbroker, a cargo ship, Sunday night.Both flew the 
Cypriot flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was the worst in the Bosporus since a 1979 collision when an oil 
tanker exploded, killing 43 seamen. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the 19-mile strait will stay closed to shipping until all 
hazards from the collision have been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey, worried about environmental risks, unveiled new safety rules for the 
strait in January and will enforce them beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ankara wants to ensure that expanded exports of oil and gas from the former 
Soviet Union reach Europe via projected pipelines across Turkey to the 
Mediterranean, not through the Bosporus.

BOP IS NO MORE, AS SOUTH AFRICA TAKES CONTROL OF 'INDEPENDENT' BLACK HOMELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The land of Bop is no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Republic of Bophuthatswana, a fictional country that was granted 
independence by South Africa's apartheid-era rulers in 1977 and recognized by 
no one else, has been effectively reclaimed by Pretoria after last week's 
violent mass protests and an abortive invasion by a ragtag army of white 
vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 Until South Africa's first elections with universal suffrage are held next 
month, Tjaart van der Walt, South Africa's resident ambassador in Mmabatho, 
will serve as interim administrator of Bop, as the Tswana tribal homeland was 
usually called. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad fact was that, humanely speaking, the loss of life and property in 
the homeland could have been prevented," Van Der Walt told a meeting with civil 
servants Monday in Mmabatho, the capital. "But we are here to pick up the 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of the change, the Independent Electoral Commission, which is in 
charge of the elections, launched "Operation Access" on Mmabatho's streets to 
issue voter identification cards, start voter education programs and designate 
polling sites for the newly enfranchised population. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Mangope, Bop's unpopular former president, was deposed by the 
multi-party Transitional Executive Council on Sunday after he reneged on an 
agreement to allow free campaigning by opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangope made his first public appearance Monday in Kimberley, safely 
outside Bop's former borders, to proclaim he is still "legally and 
constitutionally" president. He said he is considering suing the South African 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no right whatsoever to oust me," he complained at a meeting with 
white right-wing leaders and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Gatsha 
Buthelezi, who still plans to boycott the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, the remains of the now badly fractured Freedom Alliance, expressed 
outrage at the "un-Christian, double-crossing betrayal of Mangope by the South 
African government." Buthelezi added that his supporters will "fight to the 
last man" to resist a government dominated by Nelson Mandela's African National 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC officials, officially banned and routinely jailed or harassed in Bop 
during Mangope's despotic rule, quickly flooded in to campaign. Mandela, the 
ANC's president, will hold his first rally in Mmabatho today, after visits by 
his former wife, Winnie, and other ANC leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bop, at least 24 people were killed and more than 140 wounded before South 
African troops moved in Saturday to stop street battles, looting and arson by 
both civilians and Bop security forces as part of an uprising by anti-Mangope 
protesters. Damages are estimated in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, Hernus Kriel, the government minister of law and 
order, revoked a sweeping order he announced Saturday that named 52 cities and 
towns as "unrest areas" subject to extrajudicial restrictions, including the 
banning of rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 At a supposedly prohibited campaign rally in Wesselton, Mandela complained 
that Kriel had not consulted him, President Frederik W. de Klerk or the head of 
the country's Independent Electoral Commission before issuing the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of confusion and lack of consultation among members of the 
government is frightening," Mandela said.

SOVIETS WARNED AMES OF CIA'S COMPUTER TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Soviets warned spy suspect Aldrich H. Ames in 1989 to be careful in his 
use of CIA computers not long after the agency began a secret computer-based 
program to trap any double agents inside the CIA, prosecutors and former 
high-ranking CIA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning to Ames, in a nine-page letter he received from his Soviet 
handlers in the summer of 1989, is cited by CIA and FBI officials as a reason 
to believe that there may have been someone else inside the CIA supplying 
highly sensitive information to the Russians, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A former top CIA official, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed that the 
agency's operations directorate had instituted a computerized entrapment 
program in 1987 after a number of American-paid Soviet agents were lost in the 
previous two years, suggesting that information was coming from someone inside 
the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning to Ames is not the only lead that a joint CIA-FBI 
counterintelligence investigation is pursuing as a result of the review of 
documents found in his possession, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A June, 1993, search of Ames' office discovered several top secret agency 
documents referring to Russian intelligence matters that had nothing to do with 
his job. These documents were cited last week by sources as another reason 
investigators believe Ames may have had accomplices in the CIA.

AGING MACHINE GETS IN GEAR FOR 'ROSTY'; POLITICS: THE POWERFUL HOUSE PANEL 
CHAIRMAN HEADS INTO A CHICAGO PRIMARY TODAY TOO CLOSE TO CALL. A RIVAL SAYS 
VOTERS ARE READY FOR A CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The remnants of the once all-powerful Chicago Democratic organization prepared 
to mobilize today in a final effort to win the party primary for Dan 
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-way contest is considered too close to call. On election eve, polls 
indicated one-fifth of potential voters were still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old "Rosty" normally would be a shoo-in, but his reelection 
chances are endangered by unresolved allegations that he misused public funds 
in the House post office scandal. A federal prosecutor says a two-year-old 
investigation is now in its "final stages." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and congressional Democratic leaders have taken the rare 
step of intervening in a party primary to endorse Rostenkowski, claiming that 
his skills are essential to passage of health care and welfare reform bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's major challenger, State Sen. John Cullerton, predicts an 
anti-incumbent mood will carry him to an upset victory. "People are ready for a 
change," he contends. "If he (Rostenkowski) is indicted, he will lose all his 
power. Let's decide who has the best future." 
</P>
<P>
 Former alderman Dick Simpson, who pulled 43% of the vote in 1992 in his 
one-on-one race against Rostenkowski, is considered to be trailing the leaders, 
with two other minor candidates bringing up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Banks, the boss of the 36th ward on the Northwest side that includes a 
large slice of Rostenkowski's 5th District, said he would assign more than 
1,000 precinct workers from his ward to get out the vote for Rostenkowski, 
sending some to the western suburbs. Other regular Democratic leaders were 
expected to add hundreds more to the small army of volunteers to bring party 
stalwarts to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the toughest race in the city, but we think we can swing it," said 
Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who has served 35 years in Congress and reigned over the 
influential Ways and Means committee ever since 1981, has brought home federal 
largess in recent days. The Fire Department's rescue squad received a surplus 
Army helicopter. The city also got a $4-million Social Security building and a 
Job Corps Center to train 500 youngsters a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski bristled at the suggestion that he was trying to swing the 
election with delivery of pork barrel projects, saying that if he made a 
mistake it was in not saying more about what he had done for the city and the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "You almost get as red as a Mott's tomato when you talk about yourself," he 
grumbled at one event. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some defections by ward leaders, Rostenkowski has the backing of the 
regular Democratic organizations and Mayor Richard M. Daley. Even Republican 
Gov. Jim Edgar came about as close as he could to an endorsement last week by 
declaring that Rostenkowski had been "helpful" to the state by his connections 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The battleground is a slice of Chicago's North Side, starting with high-rises 
on the lakefront and stretching across miles of bungalows to the DuPage County 
line west of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Its residents are overwhelmingly whites of European background, with about 13% 
Latinos and 6% Asians. Many of the neighborhoods, particularly the western 
suburbs, were added to Rostenkowski's turf as a result of redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
 The drumbeat of stories about investigations into the trading of postage 
stamps for cash, putting "ghost" employees on the payroll and buying costly 
gifts for friends with public funds clearly has tarnished Rostenkowski's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to vote for him this time -- no, no, no," said a Chicago 
business woman who asked not to be named. "The post office stuff turned me 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 But another voter, Dave Moss of suburban Schiller Park, said: "I'm 
disheartened, but he has done good for us -- he keeps everything stable. I'll 
probably vote for Rostenkowski." 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout was expected to be light despite forecasts for a mild spring day, with 
temperatures in the mid-40s. Voter registration in Chicago overall has hit a 
74-year-low.

TB FOUND IN PERUVIAN REMAINS PREDATES ARRIVAL OF EUROPEANS

 Discovery of tuberculosis in the 1,000-year-old body of a woman in Peru 
provides strong evidence that a disease lethal to thousands of Native Americans 
was in the Western Hemisphere before Columbus and was not a plague brought by 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Minnesota team said that genetic examination of specimens 
taken from the lung and lymph nodes of the naturally mummified body shows 
unmistakable evidence of infection by tuberculosis.A report on the study is to 
be published today in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the woman, who was about 40 when she died, was one of 650 
unearthed by a University of Chicago team in 1990 from a burial area near the 
town of Ilo in southern Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Arthur C. Aufderheide, leader of the Minnesota team, said the genetic 
study of the lung and lymph specimens provides final evidence that tuberculosis 
was not introduced into the Americas by Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been thought that tuberculosis became epidemic among Native Americans 
only after contact with Europeans," Aufderheide said. "It was thought that the 
Native Americans had no immunity to TB and that this led to the epidemics." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the finding shows TB existed in pre-Columbian America, Minnesota team 
member Wilmar L. Salo said, the harsh treatment of the Native Americans 
contributed to the American epidemics of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 TB is a "herd disease" that can be spread easily among malnourished people 
crowded together. Some actions by Europeans forced these conditions on the 
Native Americans, leading to a rapid spread of TB, Aufderheide said. Thousands 
of Indians died of the disease.

PACKWOOD SAYS HE'LL TURN OVER DIARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) conceded defeat in a legal fight over his diaries 
Monday, agreeing to turn them over to the Senate Ethics Committee for its 
investigation into allegations of sexual and official misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood released a statement saying he was ending a challenge to a U.S. 
District Court order that he provide the panel with the diaries, tapes and 
transcripts it subpoenaed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist earlier this month rejected 
Packwood's request to postpone transfer of the diaries to the committee pending 
a hearing before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals hearing was 
scheduled for May, but by then the diaries would have been in the hands of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's statement on Monday said, " . . . it frightens me to think that the 
private thoughts, hopes, dreams and despairs of all our citizens can now be 
seized by the government. I now look forward to a resolution of this matter 
before the Ethics Committee."

WHITEWATER 'MYSTERY WOMAN' LEAVES MUCH UNANSWERED; INQUIRY: FORMER REAL ESTATE 
PARTNER OF CLINTONS, SUSAN MCDOUGAL, DECLARES INNOCENCE, ACCUSES GOP OF 
PERSECUTION. SHE DOESN'T DISCUSS PIVOTAL LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan McDougal, the former real estate partner of then-Gov. Bill Clinton and 
his wife, Monday broke the long silence that has made her the "mystery woman of 
Whitewater." But in a sometimes emotional press conference, she shed little 
light on that mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to answer questions about the critical transactions that have plunged 
the White House into controversy, McDougal instead declared her innocence and 
accused the Republicans of persecuting her and her former husband, Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan executive James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that Jim McDougal did not ever knowingly violate any laws -- and 
neither have I," she said, her voice quivering at times as she read a brief 
statement from handwritten notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Left unanswered, despite repeated questions from reporters, was whether 
Clinton played a role in helping her obtain a $300,000 loan in 1986 from the 
Small Business Administration-backed investment fund of former judge David 
Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, who goes to trial on federal fraud charges later this month, has said 
that he made the loan, intended for minority and disadvantaged borrowers, at 
the specific request of the governor. James McDougal and the White House have 
denied that Clinton played such a role. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unanswered was why she borrowed the money and what she did with it. James 
McDougal has acknowledged spending about $110,000 of the Hale loan to purchase 
land in the name of Whitewater Development Corp., the Clinton-McDougal 
partnership that in 1978 bought 230 acres of raw land on the White River to 
develop an Ozark Mountain resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her attorney, Bobby McDaniel of Jonesboro, Susan McDougal said that 
she would not discuss those transactions or answer any questions about the 
Clintons who, the attorney said, she regards as her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In her own statement, read as she clutched a white tissue and fought back 
tears, McDougal blamed Clinton's political critics for resurrecting 
investigative attention on the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Saving & Loan in 
which she and her former husband were the major stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have suffered enough," she declared. "This can only be judged persecution. 
. . . I want it to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, three years after the McDougals were forced out of the S&L by federal 
regulators, James McDougal and two of Susan McDougal's brothers were indicted 
on multiple federal counts of fraud. All three were acquitted after a brief 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday she said that the jury verdict should have ended the controversy, 
but that Clinton's election had renewed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is wrong," she said. Then, stepping from the podium, she turned the 
press conference over to McDaniel, who spent the next 45 minutes deflecting 
questions about the controversial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel did acknowledge that he had met once with Special Counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. to offer assurances of future cooperation but not to negotiate 
immunity from prosecution, as has been reported by some media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 While pledging that Susan McDougal would cooperate fully with Fiske's office, 
McDaniel said that he would advise her not to testify about any financial 
matters related to Madison or Whitewater until she was allowed access to 
financial records presumably held now by the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel also acknowledged that the McDougals' Whitewater records were all 
delivered to the governor's mansion in a box at some time in 1991, before or 
possibly around the time that Clinton declared his candidacy for President. The 
attorney said that Clinton personally requested the records and that Susan 
McDougal had one of her brothers deliver the box to the Clinton residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She expected to get them back in a relatively short period of time," McDaniel 
said, but Susan and James McDougal said they have not seen those documents 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel called Susan McDougal "the first job-loss casualty of Whitewater," 
saying that a flood of press inquiries had made it impossible for her to keep 
her job in the Nashville area. However, he declined to identify the firm or to 
describe the nature of her work, citing her concerns about protecting her 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some efforts by reporters to involve Susan McDougal in the 
question-and-answer session, McDaniel fielded all inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 When one reporter asked if she could comment on Mrs. Clinton's and the Rose 
Law Firm's representation of Madison Guaranty, McDougal sat silently shredding 
her tissue as McDaniel launched a staunch defense of the law firm's integrity.

BOORDA PICKED AS NOMINEE FOR TOP NAVY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday nominated Adm. Jeremy Michael Boorda, commander of 
the allied air armada enforcing the allied ultimatum in Bosnia, to become chief 
of naval operations, replacing retiring Adm. Frank B. Kelso II as the Navy's 
top uniformed officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, 60, is stepping down April 30, two months ahead of schedule, as part of 
a negotiated agreement in which Defense Secretary William J. Perry issued a 
statement that effectively cleared the admiral in the Tailhook sex harassment 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda, 55, is a respected 39-year veteran who joined the service as an 
enlisted man and rose to become commander of all allied forces in southern 
Europe. He is a close associate of Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials are hoping that the change of command at the top will 
finally put an end to the Tailhook scandal, which began at a 1991 convention of 
Navy and Marine Corps pilots in Las Vegas and has resulted in disciplinary 
actions for dozens of high-ranking and middle-level officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda, a former destroyer officer, is known for his interest in personnel 
issues and his skills in dealing with the Washington bureaucracy. He can appear 
tough, as he did during the days leading up to the deadline the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization set last month for the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb artillery 
from the area around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was under Boorda's direction that U.S. warplanes downed four Serb fighters 
that had violated the no-fly zone over Bosnia on Feb. 28 -- the first time in 
NATO's 44-year history that its forces have fired a shot in combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, a former submarine officer, initially had been cleared of any direct 
involvement in the Tailhook incident, during which dozens of women allegedly 
were molested or assaulted by Navy and Marine aviators. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, however, Kelso appeared likely to face a new round of questioning 
after a Navy judge accused him lying and of attempting to manipulate the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Defense Department officials disagreed, they said the Navy would be 
better off if Kelso left earlier than scheduled. Perry proposed Boorda for the 
job within hours of Kelso's announcement.

ANGRY CLINTON LASHES OUT AT GOP CRITICS; PRESIDENCY: HE CHARGES REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS WITH SABOTAGING HONEST DEBATE OVER SERIOUS PROBLEMS. REMARKS SHOW 
FRUSTRATION OVER WHITEWATER ATTACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton lashed out at Republican critics Monday night, charging that 
they are sabotaging the nation's need for honest debate at a time when it needs 
a "genuine conflict of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Using language that was among the angriest and most partisan of his 
presidency, Clinton told some 900 people at a $1,000-per-plate Democratic 
fund-raising dinner that the country has serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why . . . are we confronted in this Administration with an opposition party 
that just stands up and says, 'no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,' " Clinton 
demanded, punctuating each negative with a fist pounded against his lectern, 
his voice rising in apparent anger and emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a Democratic governor, and they had the White House, I constantly 
sought them out, engaged them in debate, offered to work with them on issues 
from education to welfare reform to crime to you name it," Clinton said. "I 
never did them the way they are doing us in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong, and it is not good for the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks reflected the deep frustration within his White House over 
the way a seemingly incessant stream of allegations surrounding the Whitewater 
controversy and related matters have blocked Clinton's ability to communicate 
his Administration's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 His words recalled some of the bitterest moments of his presidential campaign 
-- a clear indication of the stress that the events of the last several weeks 
have put on him, particularly Monday's resignation of his old friend, Webster 
Hubbell, the associate attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans, Clinton said, were "committed to the politics of personal 
destruction" and had mounted an "overridingly negative, intensely personal, 
totally political, devoid-of-principle attack (that is) not good for the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's language fit into a pattern in which Democrats loyal to him -- 
including his wife, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- have begun jabbing 
back at Republican opponents. Those counterattacks, in turn, followed 
complaints from some in Clinton's inner circle that the Democrats were doing 
too little to take Clinton's critics head on. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before him on the program here, David Wilhelm, Clinton's hand-picked 
Democratic party chairman, also attacked the Republicans, repeating charges he 
made over the weekend at a party conference that the GOP focus on Whitewater 
resulted from their inability to counter Clinton's arguments on issues such as 
crime and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry joked about the 
role of New York's Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato in leading the charge 
against Clinton in the Senate. D'Amato was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics 
Committee two years ago after allegations that he misused his office. The 
Ethics Committee report on its investigation of those allegations has remained 
sealed at D'Amato's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry said he was amused that the Republicans had chosen "Al D'Amato as their 
spokesman on ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Bob Packwood was busy," he said, referring to the Oregon Republican 
who is under investigation on charges of sexual harassment. Such personal 
comments by a senator about two other members of the Senate are rare -- at 
least in public.

WHITEWATER DOGS FIRST LADY ON ROAD; POLITICS: MRS. CLINTON STUMPS FOR HEALTH 
CARE REFORM OUT WEST BUT SHE CANNOT AVOID REMINDERS ABOUT THE CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and KRISTINA LINDGREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton resumed her campaign for health care reform 
Monday, but even this far from Washington, the First Lady could not escape 
jarring reminders of the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a day of public appearances, she told reporters that she refuses 
to let the controversy detract from her mission to overhaul the nation's 
$1-trillion health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk as long or as hard as it takes to get health care reform passed in 
this country," Mrs. Clinton said after emerging from a tour of a Colorado Army 
National Guard health clinic for the needy and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters about her comments over the weekend that she and the 
President are prepared to pay back taxes on their Whitewater real estate 
investment, which reportedly cost them almost $69,000, Mrs. Clinton smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodness knows what you all would be saying if we had made money on it," she 
quipped. "We made a bad investment, we lost money and that's really all there 
is to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, as she addressed several thousand University of Colorado 
students at a campaign-style rally in nearby Boulder, an airplane passed 
overhead trailing a banner that read: "Reveal Your S & L Income!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the university's Dalton Trumbo Fountain area, not more than 
100 feet in front of the First Lady, two young men held high a six-foot-long 
banner that asked: "What Did Vince Foster Know?" -- a reference to the late 
White House attorney and former law partner of Mrs. Clinton who apparently 
committed suicide last year and whose death is now part of the Whitewater 
investigation. On the banner, red drops resembling blood appeared to drip from 
Foster's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sign in the sea of young faces that Mrs. Clinton acknowledged was one 
promoting a single-payer health system, in which the government collects taxes 
to pay for insurance coverage for all. Mrs. Clinton praised such advocates for 
their honesty in proposing a new tax but said that approach was one the 
President has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the First Lady focused on a new, simplified message in 
selling the President's massive health reform plan, whose development she 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently reacting to recent polls and focus groups showing that much of the 
public is confused -- and perhaps intimidated -- by the complexities of the 
plan, the First Lady doggedly adhered to broad themes and goals, even when 
asked questions that had no short or simple answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she stressed both in Boulder and in her appearance at a "Colorado 
Health Care Summit" here that universal coverage is what she and the President 
care most about. 
</P>
<P>
 "When told about the principles in the President's health care plan, the 
people are for it," the First Lady told reporters later. 
</P>
<P>
 At the health summit, she signaled, perhaps more strongly than either she or 
the President has before, their willingness to go along with legislation that 
seeks less than total reform -- if it promises universal coverage at some 
specified date. 
</P>
<P>
 When a questioner asked whether she and the President would settle for 
incremental reform, Mrs. Clinton replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are asking me if we're willing to look at different ways of reaching 
the President's goal, the answer is, 'yes.' But if you are asking me if the 
President would be willing to sign a bill that did something but did not put us 
on a track to guaranteed health coverage for everybody, the answer is, 'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her response drew sustained applause from an audience of several thousand 
people at the city's Boettcher Concert Hall. They also gave Mrs. Clinton a 
long, standing ovation when she entered the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, at least in public, Mrs. Clinton appeared energized and 
upbeat, speaking passionately about the need for health reform. But some who 
saw her in private said she appeared fatigued.

SWING HEALTH REFORM VOTE FEELS HEAT; LEGISLATION: HOUSE DEMOCRAT SLATTERY GETS 
A VIVID PICTURE OF FORCES ORGANIZED FOR AND AGAINST CLINTON PROPOSAL. HE SEES 
OPPOSITION GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery scanned the crowd of about 100 assembled for the 
Lions Club convention here and posed a question: "How many of you believe that 
everybody should contribute something to our health care delivery system in 
this country?" 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the audience immediately raised a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, however, came a more telling moment: "How many of you favor either an 
employer mandate or an employee mandate to pay for it? How many of you would 
favor a payroll tax, in effect like Social Security, to pay for part of this 
health care?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not one hand was raised. Instead, the group of his Kansas constituents turned 
combative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would control it?" one man shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government would get it!" another answered. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of the meeting last weekend was not lost on the congressman, who is 
keenly aware that he holds enormous leverage in the fight over President 
Clinton's health care plan. "Six months ago, it seemed that people were far 
more receptive" to the inevitable trade-offs of health care reform, he said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Slattery is an influential force among moderate Democrats in the House and is 
one of a handful of swing votes on the Energy and Commerce Committee. A day in 
Kansas with him provided a vivid picture of how the forces in hundreds of 
congressional districts are influencing the health care battle on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that people have begun to understand the components of the Clinton plan 
and to absorb what the critics have to say about it, Slattery believes that 
mistrust is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country has responded to this barrage of anti-government advertising," he 
said. "A lot of people are convinced that, if the government gets involved any 
further, the outcome is going to be worse than what we have now." 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, the proposal is meeting some of its stiffest resistance in the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
panel's subcommittee on health and the environment, has abandoned his effort to 
pass the bill at that level. The legislation is being considered, instead, by 
the full committee -- an extraordinary step. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman described Slattery as "a bellwether for the committee, the kind of vote 
that's going to be essential if we're going to get a bill out of committee." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a constructive member and a thoughtful person," Waxman added. "He has a 
lot of concerns that other members are expressing as well. It's got to be on 
his mind how his votes on health care are going to be reflected back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Slattery's vote on health care is likely to be his last major decision -- and 
his most important one -- as a congressman. After six terms, he is giving up 
his House seat to run for governor and is favored to become the Democratic 
nominee in the August primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old lawmaker bears a passing resemblance to the late Robert F. 
Kennedy and favors cowboy boots with his pin-striped suits. With roots in the 
farming community of Good Intent, Kan., he espouses a fiscal conservatism that 
has made him a favorite in a congressional district that generally votes 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 The health care debate in Washington has diverted a good deal of Slattery's 
energy from his gubernatorial race. His calendar is jammed with meetings on the 
issue -- sometimes with national organizations, and sometimes with their Kansas 
affiliates. Various groups with an interest in the health reform also are 
spending heavily to advertise in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Slattery's staff was startled when dozens of elderly people 
stormed an annual open house at his district office intent on winning his 
support for coverage of long-term care. The outpouring was generated by a 
newspaper ad, paid for by the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't too happy (but) an open house is an open house," said Deborah Dion 
of Families USA, an organization that supports the Clinton plan and which 
called a news conference outside Slattery's office to publicize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 If Slattery's comments are any indication of how he will vote, it is unlikely 
that those organizations will be completely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 He is openly skeptical of the affordability of the benefits package Clinton 
has proposed -- particularly in such costly areas as long-term care and 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I favor us shaping a very cautious benefits package so that we know how much 
it's going to cost, we know that it is affordable," he told the Lions. "One of 
the principles that I am deeply committed to -- and I will not compromise on -- 
is that I do not want to see us borrow one dime from our kids and grandkids to 
pay for our current health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the benefits package is scaled back, he said, Congress might have to 
sacrifice Clinton's central goal of universal coverage, aiming instead for a 
narrower bill that makes health insurance more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments anger groups that support the Clinton plan. "We are not going to 
settle for universal access and a package that doesn't include the benefits we 
need," said Kelly Jennings, field representative of the Kansas Assn. of Public 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Business interests also grumble about the response they have gotten from 
Slattery. Members of the Kansas chapter of the National Federation of 
Independent Business, which staunchly opposes much of Clinton's plan, met with 
the lawmaker last week to plead with him to oppose the proposal to require 
employers to pay 80% of their workers' health insurance costs. The federation 
contends that the employer mandate could cost Kansas as many as 155,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came to the issue of the mandate, he indicated he didn't have a 
better idea of how to make universal coverage available to people," said Hal 
Hudson, who heads the Kansas chapter.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: LESLIE'S POOLMART LOSES $1.88 MILLION IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leslie's Poolmart, a Chatsworth-based retailer of swimming pool supplies, said 
its loss widened to $1.88 million in the fourth quarter, compared with the 
$1.73 million the company lost in the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 grew 15% to $13.5 million, from $11.7 
million a year earlier. The company attributed the sales gain to changes in its 
marketing, merchandising and purchasing strategies, which also resulted in 
higher expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, Leslie's posted a profit of $3.04 million, up 41% from a 
profit of $2.15 million in 1992. Sales last year increased 25% to $120 million, 
from $96.3 million in 1992.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: H & H OIL TOOL REPORTS REBOUND IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 H & H Oil Tool Co., a Santa Paula firm that rents drilling equipment to oil 
and gas companies, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $579,000, rebounding 
from a loss of $827,000 in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 rose 8% to $5.88 million, from 
$5.44 million a year earlier. The company attributed the financial turnaround 
to strong prices for natural gas, which resulted in increased drilling, 
production and work-over activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest quarterly results boosted the company's 1993 profit to $1.55 
million. In 1992, the company lost $1.76 million, due to the write-off of its 
environmental project. Revenue in 1993 increased 9% to $21.7 million, from 
$19.9 million in 1992.

AMWEST IS FOCUS OF INSURANCE REFORM BATTLE; LITIGATION: SURETY BOND FIRM, WITH 
EX-GOV. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN PLAYING A ROLE, GOES BEFORE THE STATE SUPREME COURT 
IN BID TO WIN EXEMPTION FROM PROPOSITION 103. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than five years of legal wrangling, an obscure company is taking 
center stage in the high-stakes battle over insurance reform in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since voters passed Proposition 103 in 1988, auto and property insurance 
heavyweights such as 20th Century and State Farm have been the most visible 
challengers of the measure that sought to rebate 20% in premiums to 
policyholders. Meanwhile, the Proposition 103 case of Amwest Insurance Group 
Inc., which deals in the esoteric world of surety bonds, got little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, the California Supreme Court agreed to hear the Woodland Hills 
company's suit, which seeks to exempt the surety business from Proposition 103. 
Amwest has become the litmus test for the 120 or so firms in the state that 
write surety bonds, although it may be a year before the court reaches a 
decision in the Amwest case. 
</P>
<P>
 Amwest's case has even taken on political overtones. Former Gov. George 
Deukmejian, a Republican who appointed five of the seven Supreme Court justices 
and is now a lawyer in private practice, is working for Surety Co. of the 
Pacific (SCP), based in Northridge. In January, Deukmejian filed a letter on 
behalf of SCP, which is an "amicus," or friend of Amwest, before the court 
agreed to hear the Amwest case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is starting to pick up momentum like a snowball in terms of 
notoriety," said Larry Rothstein, an attorney for Amwest. "I think it's going 
to be one of the most watched cases in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard H. Savage, who founded Amwest and now runs the company with his son 
John, is a bit wary of the notoriety. He estimates that the case has so far 
cost Amwest about $200,000 in legal fees. But the 74-year-old company chairman 
put the legal case simply: "It's economic survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Surety insurance is when a contractor buys bonds from a company like Amwest as 
a guarantee that a contract -- whether to paint a post office or build an 
office complex -- will be completed. Amwest generally charges a premium of 1.5% 
to 2.5% of the bond amount. If the contractor can't finish the job, the surety 
company has to either give the contractor more money or hire another one. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Department of Insurance, the Proposition 103 initiative could 
require those surety companies operating in California to refund retroactively 
up to $100 million in premiums to customers. Amwest, which did about 28% of its 
business in the state in 1993, questions that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 John Savage, Amwest's president, figures that the maximum surety industry 
rebate is $60 million. As for Amwest, "we don't want to write a million-dollar 
check," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the exact liability, the Savages claim that their bottom line would 
be seriously affected. Once losses and expenses are added up, the company's 
profit margin is only 4 cents for every $1 of premiums. "If you're going to 
reduce gross income by 20%, we'll be losing money," Richard Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 With their 40% ownership of Amwest's stock, the Savage family also has a 
personal interest in the outcome of their Proposition 103 case. At a recent 
price of $14 a share, their Amwest stake is worth about $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the crux of Amwest's lawsuit has been that surety 
companies should not be liable to pay anything in the first place. Surety 
firms, the plaintiffs argue, should have been exempted from the initiative like 
other forms of business insurance such as workers' compensation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 With Amwest and four other surety firms lobbying, the Legislature passed a 
bill in 1990 amending Proposition 103 to exclude surety from its provisions. 
Voter Revolt, the consumer group that sponsored the initiative, stepped into 
the case and countersued Amwest. The amendment, the group argued, was 
unconstitutional as it did not "further the purposes" of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In January, an appeals court agreed with Voter Revolt and struck down the 1990 
surety amendment. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to review that decision and, 
according to legal experts, the key issue will be whether the Legislature has 
the constitutional authority to tinker with an initiative that has already 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (state) Supreme Court reverses the lower court . . . within a year, 
all of 103 will be repealed," predicted Voter Revolt's Harvey Rosenfield, chief 
author of the measure. Saying it is outraged by Deukmejian's involvement in the 
case, Voter Revolt is considering "options" to ensure an impartial review. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Savage went into business quite late in life after surviving fights of 
a different sort. A radar controller in the South Pacific during World War II, 
he went on to work in law enforcement, fighting crime with the Palo Alto police 
force, California Highway Patrol and Justice Department's narcotics force. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded Amwest in 1975 as a bail bond agency, a field he was familiar with 
from his law enforcement days. But he soon diversified into other forms of 
surety bonds, notably those required by contractors working for government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, after several years of rapid growth, Amwest was writing premiums of 
$36 million, while profits had climbed to $3.6 million, up from $258,000 in 
1980. The company, which went public in 1985, was well on the way to opening 
offices in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those heady days, growth has slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Amwest grossed $57.7 million in premiums and made a profit of $3.8 
million, including its investment income. In the extremely fragmented surety 
market in California, it is an undisputed leader. According to the A. M. Best 
rating company, it was the third biggest surety firm in the state in 1992 with 
a market share of 5.3%, trailing only Reliance and Fireman's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, SCP wrote $6.8 million in premiums in 1992 in California, its 
only market, giving it a market share of 2.2%. The company mainly writes bonds 
that contractors need so they can be licensed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure rolling back insurance rates was passed by a narrow margin in 
November, 1988, Amwest wasted no time in challenging it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We filed suit the day after the election," John Savage recalled. "We knew the 
bill had a pretty good chance of passing and the lawsuit was prepared months in 
advance." 
</P>
<P>
 According to some observers, it was a typically bold step. "If Amwest hadn't 
done it, it's problematical any (surety firm) would have done it, at least not 
that early," said Gerry Desmond, a lobbyist for the Assn. of California Surety 
Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 As the current case makes its way through the Supreme Court, Amwest claims 
that it is trying to steer clear of the political fray. Both Savages stressed 
that they want the case decided "on a rational basis" and that it was Surety 
Co. that brought Deukmejian on board -- SCP's chairman, William Erwin, was a 
leading contributor to the former governor's campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Surety Co. wants to employ their own counsel, there's nothing we can do 
about it," Richard Savage said. "We had no input at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Amwest is still happy to serve as point man, however controversial the 
case may get. "It has to do with being in control of your fate," John Savage 
said. "We control the actual litigation with our attorneys. We know the points 
we want to get heard are being heard." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only downside," he added, "is we end up paying more money" to lawyers.

MARRIOTT GETS NEW OWNER; FORECLOSURE SURPRISES INDUSTRY; FINANCES: CIGNA 
INSURANCE TAKES OVER WOODLAND HILLS LUXURY HOTEL, VIEWED AS ANCHOR IN AREA 
HOSPITALITY FIELD, AFTER FORMER OWNER DEFAULTS ON PAYMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 The 463-room Warner Center Marriott Hotel has been taken over by its mortgage 
lender after the previous owner defaulted on a $412,500 payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that title to the 17-story hotel was transferred to 
Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Cigna Corp., on Jan. 5. 
Cigna installed a new management team at the hotel Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut General, based in Bloomfield, Conn., issued a $47-million 
construction loan in 1985 to Warner Center Marriott Hotel Limited Partnership, 
the company that developed the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Cigna said, "The property was sold in an uncontested 
foreclosure on Nov. 17, 1993." The new owner signed a contract with 
Pittsburgh-based Interstate Hotels Corp. to manage the hotel, which retained 
the Marriott name. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the foreclosure came as a surprise to hotel industry officials in the 
San Fernando Valley. The Marriott, in Woodland Hills, was seen as the anchor of 
the hospitality field in the West Valley, with one of the highest occupancy 
rates among luxury hotels in the area. Room rates ranged from $150 to $190 per 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their occupancy rate was very good. The company was just over-encumbered. 
Simply put, there were too many debts," said Irwin Woldman, who follows the 
hotel market for Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate Service in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Conner, spokesman for the Marriott Corp. -- the general partner that 
defaulted on the loan -- downplayed the significance of the foreclosure, saying 
that Marriott Corp. never owned the hotel outright. Instead, the owner was a 
limited partnership of which Marriott was the general partner, and Marriott 
controlled the majority interest in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an unusual situation. In the 1980s, Marriott began managing hotels 
on behalf of a variety of owners that used the Marriott name. The majority of 
our hotels are not owned by Marriott," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the partnership defaulted on the loans because the Warner Marriott was 
overly leveraged, but declined to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its strategy, Marriott would bring investors into a limited partnership 
to develop a hotel and Marriott would manage it. Marriott also allowed hotel 
franchisees to use the company name and logo, for a fee, which is what  
</P>
<P>
 the Warner Center Marriott is doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The differences were that in a franchise operation, the franchisee would pay 
us to use the Marriott name, but the management operator was not Marriott and 
the employees were not Marriott employees. In a (Marriott) management 
situation, the employees are Marriott employees," Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Warner Center Marriott, the Marriott Corp. was the general 
partner in the partnership and Marriott International Inc., a subsidiary, 
managed the hotel. The Warner Center Marriott cost $65 million to build and 
opened in March, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the foreclosure, the hotel had a long-term ground lease with landowner 
Warner Properties III, a partnership between the Voit Cos. and Copley Real 
Estate Advisors. Warner Properties developed the Warner Center Plaza and nearby 
Warner Center Business Park. Voit is Warner Center's largest developer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Cigna statement, the company will maintain "the underlying 
land on a long-term lease agreement." Cigna will also make "appropriate capital 
investments in the property," but has "not yet developed a long-term operating 
strategy," it added. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some confusion over whether Interstate Hotels, the company hired by 
Cigna to manage the hotel, owns an interest in the Warner Center Marriott. 
Interstate Hotels spokesman Tom Loftus insisted that the company only signed a 
contract to manage the hotel for Cigna and did not buy an interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Cigna statement said Interstate Hotels "purchased a minority 
interest" in the Marriott. Interstate manages 31 of the 50 franchised Marriott 
hotels in the United States. In total, the company manages 79 hotels in the 
United States, including nine in California and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Interstate manages the Bel Age and Mondrian hotels in West Hollywood 
and the Radisson Manhattan Beach.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CHASE MANHATTAN FILES SUIT AGAINST CITADEL HOLDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale-based parent of troubled Fidelity Federal 
Bank, said Chase Manhattan Bank of New York has filed a lawsuit against it in 
an attempt to block a plan by Citadel to restructure Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel wants to dispose of nearly $482 million in assets, mainly troubled 
real estate holdings.At the same time, Citadel would sell Fidelity to another 
financial institution or group of equity investors, who would then recapitalize 
the savings and loan. Citadel, with assets of about $4.4 billion, says the 
restructuring needs to be done by mid-year, when it is likely to run out of 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chase Manhattan, in a lawsuit filed March 4, says Citadel's plan violates 
a 1990 loan agreement between the two institutions. Chase Manhattan is one of 
four lenders under Fidelity's $60-million subordinated loan agreement. Chase 
officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel, which last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $37.5 million and a 
loss of $67.2 million for 1993, said that Chase's lawsuit is without merit and 
that it does not have to prepay debt that it owed to Chase and other banks.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pollution Research and Control Corp., a Glendale maker of air-pollution 
monitoring devices, said it has tentatively agreed with a London-based medical 
firm to supply its technology for a new application: diagnosing and determining 
treatment for asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed agreement, Pollution Research would sell its technology and 
equipment to the British firm, which it would not name. The British company 
would then repackage the equipment and market the instruments to hospitals and 
doctors. Pollution Research said the new instruments would be a cost-effective, 
non-invasive alternative to diagnosing the degree of inflammation in asthma 
patients.

MICKEY'S MAGS; DISNEY PARLAYS ITS MARKETING STRENGTH, FAMILY FRANCHISE INTO 
PUBLISHING VENTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of the Walt Disney Co. and theme parks, Mickey Mouse and big box-office 
movies come to mind. But the Burbank-based entertainment giant is also a 
budding magazine publisher, and despite the long odds against new publications, 
Disney is using its marketing savvy and financial muscle to keep growing its 
4-year-old magazine group. 
</P>
<P>
 With two start-up publications, Disney has turned to themes that it knows how 
to exploit perhaps better than anyone: kids and families. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first magazine, the digest-sized Disney Adventures for kids, was launched 
in 1990 and has soared to nearly 1 million in circulation. Family Fun, acquired 
by Disney in 1991, now has a 615,000 circulation of mostly baby-boomer parents. 
Its third magazine, Discover, a slick science publication that Disney acquired 
in 1991 from now-defunct Family Media Inc., has a circulation of 1.03 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Disney is planning its fourth publication, Family PC, in a joint venture 
with New York-based Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., a major computer-magazine 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, magazines are still a minuscule part of Disney's $8.5 billion in 
revenue. Disney Magazine Publishing has only 130 employees and is so small that 
analysts who follow Disney say they can't -- or don't bother to -- estimate its 
revenues or profits. Disney doesn't break out such figures publicly, but based 
on total circulation and subscription and advertising rates, annual magazine 
revenues probably don't exceed $90 million. That's about as much as one hit 
Disney movie might reap in domestic ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of Disney, we're a gnat," said John Skipper, the former US magazine 
publisher and Spin magazine president who was recruited in 1990 as a Disney Co. 
vice president and head of the magazine group. "Actually," he added with a 
laugh, "we might be a fly by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gnat or fly, it's becoming clear that in magazines, Disney has found yet 
another way to cash in on its franchise. The monthly Disney Adventures 
unabashedly plugs Disney movies and TV shows, and an upcoming cover is themed 
around Disney's NHL hockey team, the Mighty Ducks. Next to features on hiking 
in Glacier National Park and other family getaways, Family Fun runs ads for 
Disney resorts. The Disney Channel on cable TV has had "Discover" science 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such self-promotion has engendered harsh critiques. But even critics admit 
that Disney does it no more blatantly than some others in the cutthroat 
magazine business these days. Disney Adventures "a little bit crosses the line" 
because it's hard to distinguish editorial from ads, said Samir Husni, head of 
the magazine program at the University of Mississippi and publisher of the 
Guide to New Consumer Magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't go as far as magazines based on GI Joe and Barbie dolls, and 
Disney Adventures also mixes education with the entertainment, Husni said. 
Disney Adventures, with its hodgepodge of comics, snippets on teen-age idols 
and features on subjects ranging from snakes to Chelsea Clinton's favorite 
food, "is a nice complement to the film and television business." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Disney is concerned, magazines aren't merely promotional tools, they 
are to become profit-generators. Take Discover, which was sold by founder Time 
Inc. to Family Media in 1987. The monthly magazine was profitable under Family 
Media, Skipper said, and he liked the way it made technology accessible to 
non-scientists. But he also observed that the magazine had a tired look and 
lackluster ad sales. 
</P>
<P>
 After Disney acquired Discover for an undisclosed price, Skipper overhauled 
its design, hired a new business staff, banned tobacco advertising and limited 
direct-mail ads -- previously Discover's mainstay. The result: Discover now 
attracts big national advertisers such as computer-chip maker Intel Corp., 
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. The magazine's 1993 ad 
revenue zoomed 42% to $13.1 million from $9.2 million in 1992, according to 
Publishers Information Bureau Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 More problematic in terms of ads is Disney Adventures. Skipper said he's still 
having a hard time convincing potential advertisers that they can reach kids 
through a medium other than television. Nonetheless, he expects Disney 
Adventures magazine to turn the profit corner this year, which would be a rare 
feat for such a young publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Adventures was conceived more than four years ago when Michael Lynton, 
then director of business development for Disney's consumer products division, 
took note of Topolino, a kids magazine in Italy. Topolino, which means "Mickey 
Mouse" in Italian, consisted mostly of comics but was a raging success. It had 
been put out by an Italian publisher for many years under license from Disney, 
and Disney had just taken the license back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton proposed starting a similar publication here, but with fewer comics and 
more features. At first, it was seen as a way to promote the Disney Channel's 
afternoon cable TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept quickly broadened to encompass sports, celebrities and films 
-- even those from other movie studios. Similar to strategies employed at 
Sports Illustrated for Kids and the new Nickelodeon magazine, Lynton's bet was 
that kids would forsake video games and pick up a magazine if it had ready-made 
brand identification and didn't read like a textbook. The editor of Disney 
Adventures, Tommi Lewis, said she stays in touch with her young readers by 
"talking" to some of them on the America Online computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports Illustrated for Kids, Nickelodeon and Disney Adventures don't look 
like school. They're exciting, fun and cool," said Lynn Lehmkuhl, former 
publisher of Disney Adventures who is now publisher at Nickelodeon magazine. 
"It took companies who had experience communicating and connecting with kids in 
a commercial way." 
</P>
<P>
 Family Fun, published 10 times a year by Disney, is also expected to become 
profitable later this year and is "our best ad success," Skipper said. Some 
issues have had an impressive 100-plus pages of ads from such companies as 
Quaker Oats Co., consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co. and Apple 
Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Started by former U. S. News & World Report executive Jake Winebaum and 
acquired by Disney after its second issue, Family Fun veers from the old 
formula of aiming at new mothers by focusing on activities for families with 
kids age 3 to 12. "That magazine talks to me in a way that publications like 
Parenting and Parents do not," said Tony Silber, executive editor at Folio, a 
Stamford, Conn.-based magazine for the magazine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, survival in the magazine business is no easy task. Of the 789 magazines 
started last year, half will die within a year, Husni said. After four years, 
fewer than one-third will survive. The costs can be daunting: Operating budgets 
for each of Disney's publications likely run well in excess of $10 million a 
year and may be closer to $25 million, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many magazines competing in a soft ad market, publishers must rely 
increasingly on subscriptions and newsstand sales. To try to boost newsstand 
sales, Skipper said Disney pays a premium to place Disney Adventures in the 
"expensive real estate" of magazine racks next to supermarket checkout 
counters. Annual subscriptions are $19.95 for Disney Adventures, $14.95 for 
Family Fun and $29.95 for Discover. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton, now head of the Disney publishing division, which also includes books 
and art publishing, argued that most new magazines fail because they are 
"underfinanced, not terribly well thought out or don't build on an existing 
franchise. With Disney, we had those things pretty well licked." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has "a good circulation story," said Jacqueline Leo, editor in chief of 
Family Circle magazine, published by the New York Times Co. "The question is 
always renewals. It takes about five years to see if they've really got 
something there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Disney is forging ahead with plans to start Family PC in 
September. The new magazine, with Winebaum as publisher, is aimed at the 15 
million families with kids and home computers. Skipper said the idea is 
generating interest from potential advertisers, including computer and software 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper added that he plans to start or acquire more magazines themed around 
kids, families or technology. Ideas in the works, according to Folio magazine, 
include a kids' version of Discover and a Family Fun spinoff themed around 
consumer electronics and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Disney, more challenges lie ahead as new competitors mine the same 
markets that Disney has staked out. About a year ago, Rolling Stone Publisher 
Jann S. Wenner started Family Life, which, like Disney's Family Fun, is aimed 
at boomers with kids and is also enjoying fast circulation growth. Wenner Media 
Inc. Senior Vice President Kent Brownridge maintained that "our magazine has 
more of a full range of activities. . . . Theirs is more restricted to fun 
things to do, like trips to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 And Family PC will have a rival even before its first issue hits the 
newsstands. Home PC, published by CMP Publications in Manhasset, N. Y., is 
being launched in May. A decade ago, home computing magazines were tried and 
failed, but many say it's an idea whose time has finally come. Before long, 
"there will be a lot more," Home PC Editor in Chief Ellen Pearlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Husni: "Once one publication breaks ground, then there are more copycats 
than you can ever imagine."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: WEYERHAEUSER TO MOVE PLANT TO CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser Co.'s box manufacturing operation has outgrown its Santa Paula 
plant and will be relocated to Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the new location, 20 to 30 workers will be added to the present payroll of 
120, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 All current employees are expected to remain with the company when the move is 
made in mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser plans to upgrade and expand a box-making plant it has agreed to 
purchase from International Paper Co. The facility on Pleasant Valley Road has 
250,000 square feet and will be expanded by 30,000 square feet, Weyerhaeuser 
Marketing Director Nancy Arend said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our corrugated box business has been expanding and, in Santa Paula, we were 
landlocked, with little room for expansion," she said. She added that 
production is expected to increase 35% to 50% as soon as the relocation is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula plant, which opened in 1963, is one of 37 box factories 
operated by Weyerhaeuser. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not disclose the price it agreed to pay for the Camarillo 
plant and its 10-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser is already well-established in Camarillo. Its Pardee Construction 
Co. unit developed Mission Oaks, a master-planned community near the site being 
purchased by the timber giant.

RIGHT START INC. REPORTS LOSS IN 9-MONTH EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Right Start Inc. reported earnings of $155,000 for the third quarter ended 
Feb. 23, up from $146,000 for the same period in 1993. However, the company 
reported a loss of $186,000 for the first nine months, compared to earnings of 
$640,000 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues increased 27% to $10.9 million for the third quarter, up from $8.5 
million for the same period last year. Revenues for the year-to-date period 
were reported at $40.5 million, up from $28.3 million for the same period in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials attributed the year-to-date loss to the second quarter 1994 
write-off of the Weebok Catalog, discontinued because of weak sales. The Right 
Start Inc., based in Westlake Village, is a catalogue merchant offering 
products for children up to age 12. Its catalogues include The Right Start

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: MICOM SIGNS DEAL WITH MEXICAN ELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Micom Communications Inc., a Simi Valley producer of corporate communications 
systems, hopes to gain important benefits from the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, thanks to a deal just signed with Mexico's largest distributor of 
electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement with Mexico City-based MPS should increase Micom's revenues in 
that country by well over $1 million this year alone, according to Micom 
spokesman Richard Borden. 
</P>
<P>
 He said MPS, which sells its computer-related products through 6,000 dealers 
throughout Mexico, will become Micom's chief distributor in that country, 
although the Ventura County firm will continue to do business through other 
Mexican sales agencies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Micom's president, Gil Cabral, said: "With the recent passing of NAFTA and 
other Latin American free trade agreements, we see the Mexican market 
positioned for high growth." 
</P>
<P>
 In the little more than three years since its networking systems were 
introduced, the Simi Valley firm has sold more than 35,000 units of the 
devices, called NetRunner and Marathon, Borden reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems are designed to save customers money by sending voice, fax and 
data-processing communications over a single telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Micom has 375 employees worldwide, 300 of them at its plant on Los Angeles 
Avenue. The company expects to increase its payroll by 10% this year, mainly in 
marketing and product development, Borden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Micom is a subsidiary of MB Communications Inc. of Lawrence, Pa.

FREEDOM, IN SO MANY 'WORDS'; DANCE: THE 70-MEMBER HUNGARIAN STATE FOLK ENSEMBLE 
ENJOYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ITS IDEAS, AS WELL AS SONGS AND MOVEMENTS, TO 
COSTA MESA IN MODERN AND TRADITIONAL FORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Make no mistake: The fall of Soviet communism brought changes, including new 
artistic freedoms that have allowed a Hungarian choreographer to present a 
dance with an anti-government message. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, "Dance Words," created by Sandor Timar for his Hungarian State 
Folk Ensemble, was outlawed by the Communist government after only four 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now," Timar said recently, "we can do it whenever we want to." The 
70-member song and dance troupe will do "Dance Words" and other pieces here 
tonight under the sponsorship of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the company's other numbers, "Dance Words" is derived from traditional 
native steps and dances, most of them hundreds of years old, Timar said through 
an interpreter, on the phone from an early stop on the troupe's three-month 
American tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The vocal accompaniment, however, departs from the norm: Dancers, somewhat 
like rap singers, shout words of protest written by Hungarian poet Laszlo Nagy. 
Nagy's poem is about youths "looking for their place in the world" and decries 
"the Communist regime," Timar said. He recited Nagy's lines: "Let us go where 
we are needed . . . where we are happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, young people across Hungary have been happy to frequent 
nightclub-like "dance houses" where a resurgence in folk song and dance 
continues today, Timar said. He noted that the tanchez, or dance house 
movement, gave rise to "Dance Words," which is performed in costumes resembling 
street clothes and is accompanied by the gardon, an instrument shaped like a 
cello but struck rather than bowed. 
</P>
<P>
 While his and other folk troupes worldwide aim primarily to preserve ancient 
folklore, Timar said his use of a modern concept reflects his conviction that 
ideas ultimately are more important than the means by which they are expressed. 
"The message is what matters. The main thing is what I want to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of communism hasn't been entirely positive, Timar continued. 
While the Hungarian government's financial support of his troupe has not 
decreased, he said, inflation -- this year at 20% -- has increased everything 
from costume costs to salaries to touring expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All that has not forced a reduction in tour dates, however. The balance of the 
cost, Timar said, is made up largely by Columbia Artists Management Inc., which 
sponsors the troupe's tours, and by private Hungarian foundations. In any case, 
Timar said he opts for democracy, and believes the current state of economic 
affairs is temporary, the result of a transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the present hardships are due to the last four decades of 
communism," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeland" is the overarching theme of Tuesday's program, designed 
specifically for this tour, the group's fifth trek from Budapest to North 
America. The program is called "Elindultam Szep Hazambol" ("I Am Leaving My 
Nice Country"), after a song said to have been sung by Bela Bartok as he left 
his beloved native land for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a world problem for thousands of years -- people leaving their 
homelands -- and it is something everyone can understand," Timar said. 
"Nowadays, for example, people are escaping from the former Yugoslavia, if they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Philharmonic Society presents the Hungarian State Folk 
Ensemble tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town 
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $13-$35 (student, military and senior rush: $7 for 
unsold seats, one hour prior to curtain). (714) 556-2787. The troupe performs 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700

THIS WRITER'S LIFE STILL FULL OF CHUCKLES; VETERAN WRITER-DIRECTOR HAL KANTER 
TO OPEN 'LAUGHING MATTERS' IN WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Some of the best comedy we'll ever enjoy isn't the hard stuff concocted by 
pros; it's those impromptu moments when a spirit ignites -- usually among 
family or friends -- and a series of remembrances or eccentricities or outrages 
balloon into each other until everyone is crippled with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments are nearly impossible to replicate -- like trying to seize 
character in a snapshot. But veteran writer-director Hal Kanter will give it 
his best in a new work called "Laughing Matters," opening Wednesday at the 
Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Brill, Hank Garrett, Jackie Kahane and Freddie Sherman are in the cast. 
The first three are "knowns," as they like to say in the biz. Freddie Sherman 
is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter, who will be making his first professional onstage appearance, is 
somewhere in between. His name has rolled up through so many TV and movie 
credits over the years that it occupies its own small chink in the collective 
unconscious. If his face -- a 30s, William Powell-ish sophisticated kind of 
face -- isn't familiar to the public, anyone who's been around the film and TV 
industry for any length of time will know it for all the industry functions 
he's emceed, and all the shows he's worked on, from radio days to the annual 
Oscars ceremony -- to which he has contributed for the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Do we have to mention my age?" he said one recent afternoon. "I know it's 
foolish to be coy. Let's just say I'm over 70." Old enough to have known and 
written for the original Sunshine Boys (they were the vaudevillians and sketch 
artists Smith & Dale). Old enough to have cut his teeth on one of the zaniest 
shows in the history of Broadway, 1938's "Hellzapoppin' " -- whose big-time 
pandemonium has miraculously survived transfer to the screen. 
</P>

 At age 20, Kanter was at home with the show's anarchic energies. "It had no 
story at all," he recalled. "It was just a series of blackouts, crossovers and 
specialty acts. The only theme was that there was no theme at all. I 
contributed a few topical jokes for each show. The other stuff I wrote, well, 
that didn't show up until they did their other shows and didn't tell me about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter's voice was free of rancor. He'd learned an early lesson: the 
entertainment industry can inspire bitterness and use it to scald the 
embittered ("the stories now are for 24-year-olds; ageism is a hard thing to 
deal with"). But he hasn't forgotten what brought him to Hollywood and kept him 
there: "An enchantment with the whole process of making movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The list of Kanter's credits is voluminous. It begins with his gig as a Boy 
Scout troop correspondent to the Miami Herald at age 11. At 12 he went into a 
semi-retirement that lasted six years. Then he was a gag cartoonist for various 
magazines. In Hollywood, he joined a reception line to tell Eddie Cantor that 
he could improve the writing on Cantor's radio show. Unfortunately, he first 
relayed the message to a stranger standing next to him, who turned out to be 
Cantor's head writer, who was kind enough to get him work anyway -- on the Jack 
Oakie show. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kaye, Ed Wynn, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Jack Paar, George Gobel, Carol 
Burnett, Norman Lear and James Stewart are only a few entries on Kanter's list. 
So is Elvis Presley. Kanter wrote "Blue Hawaii" and then directed the King in 
another Kanter script, "Loving You." Most improbably, he wrote "The Rose 
Tattoo," a straight drama for which Anna Magnani won an Academy Award. Co-star 
Burt Lancaster then hired him to lighten up the grim proceedings on "Vera 
Cruz." 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy writing drama, but early on I discovered that comedy makes you more 
money," Kanter said. "Why I'm so prolific, I don't know. It's been suggested 
that I've always wanted to impress my father, who was a real estate salesman in 
Florida who moved to Long Island and started up the Classic Comics series. But 
I don't think that's true. He was a literate, witty man, a great storyteller. I 
know he was proud of my success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was the culture shock of moving from Savannah, Ga., where I was 
born, to New York -- from the Deep South to the shallow North. I hated New 
York. When I vowed to get rid of my geechee Southern accent, I swore I wouldn't 
sound like a New Yorker either. I made sure nobody would ever be able to tell 
where I was from. I do know that outside of my family, I was influenced by 
writers like Robert Benchley, Mark Twain, H. Allen Smith and S. J. Perelman. 
They gave me a sense of play and surprise with language, like the line, 'I've 
been in bed all week with a terrible haircut.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Laughing Matters" came about when Kanter and his veteran Westwood Playhouse 
cast were supposed to do a show for the University of Judaism. One member 
turned out to be a no-show. During the backstage wait, reminiscences were 
exchanged, show-biz horror stories related. But instead of keening lament, the 
atmosphere quickly grew, according to Kanter, "hysterically funny." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to capture those moments when something just takes off, but 
these guys had so many stories to tell that it seemed more refreshing than 
anything you could set out to write. I'm just shaping the material. The show 
isn't like anything you'll see on TV. And it doesn't have dirty language. It's 
something you could bring children to. And, if you want, leave them there."

<P>
AND THE BEST ACTOR IS?; TYRIN TURNER SAYS HE WILL TAKE HOME THE AWARD, IF NOT 
THE OSCAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N. F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tyrin Turner announces that he "gave the best performance of 1993," he's 
so confident it's hard to disagree with him. While he doesn't have to compete 
head to head with the likes of Tom Hanks or Anthony Hopkins -- at least not 
this year -- he does face serious competition in Jeff Bridges and Matthew 
Modine for the Independent Spirit Awards' best actor trophy. Nonetheless, 
Turner, star of "Menace II Society," insists he'll take home the award -- the 
Oscar of independent films -- Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, two days 
before the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner has chosen to be interviewed at his manager's Underworld Productions' 
office -- a fitting name, since "Menace" received critical acclaim for its 
gritty, uncompromising view of South Central's gangster community. Turner's 
Caine was the movie's pivotal character. Audiences were gripped as they watched 
his twisting descent from observer to hardened murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Hughes, who with his twin, Albert, directed "Menace," says, "He was 
Caine before the screenplay (by Tyger Williams) was written. I saw him in Janet 
Jackson's 'Rhythm Nation' video and on 'America's Most Wanted' (in a 
re-enactment) where he played a Blood, and I was blown away. There was 
something about him I can't describe. But he was just it , what we wanted for 
our movie. People could identify with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Turner, 21, could identify with Caine. The South Central native says 
he "never participated in drug dealing or gang banging, but I knew people like 
that. I could relate to him. Growing up in that environment helped me out 
(playing him)." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hughes says: "Tyrin is the only guy I know in the industry who doesn't do 
drugs, doesn't drink alcohol, doesn't shoot. He's from that neighborhood and 
has run with those people. He's fought, but he's real clean-cut and somewhat 
naive. I don't know how he lasted that long (and stayed so straight)." 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old Turner always wanted to act. "I was always putting on a show. 
I was funny as a child. I would watch TV and say, 'I can do that,' but I just 
didn't know how." 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, his aspirations led him to a workshop where his talent and confidence 
paid off. His acting teacher discovered he was a natural. "She fell in love 
with me right there," he says, "She said 'this kid's got potential.' I got my 
agent from a showcase there." 
</P>
<P>
 TV appearances followed, with guest roles on "Jake and the Fat Man," "In 
Living Color" and "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper." 
</P>
<P>
 He returns to the small screen playing Lark Voohries' ("Saved by the Bell") 
boyfriend in the "CBS Schoolbreak Special: What About Your Friends?," which 
will air in the fall. This time around, in a departure from Caine, he plays a 
nice guy. But television isn't where his real interests lie. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not me," Turner says emphatically. "I'm spoiled. I've been on the big 
screen, seen my face there wide. But I'm not sure I won't be doing some 
guest-starring. I don't want to be contradicting myself when you see me in a TV 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of critics' adoring responses to Turner's "Menace" turn -- 
Roger Ebert said, "His performance was filled with life and conviction" -- his 
agent, Chuck James, insists that big things are about to happen for him: 
"Nothing official on paper yet, though." 
</P>
<P>
 With only the "CBS Schoolbreak Special" as a definite, Turner remains 
cavalier. "I just want to do a variety of stuff," he says. "Right now I'm not 
just trying to stick to the 'black thing,' which is cool because I still want 
to do the work for my people, but . . . I want to show my range." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes offers another explanation: "It's been hard for him to get work after 
'Menace.' I think other black filmmakers don't want to use leads who other 
black directors have used. It's been a tradition among black filmmakers. I'm 
not sure what the problem has been with white filmmakers. He's real good at 
doing physical acting -- crying, bloodletting -- he can do all that at the drop 
of a hat." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has real raw talent," Hughes insists. "It's a star quality. I don't like 
to say that, normally it's b.s., but people will see what I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Turner is focused on Saturday. "I deserve this," he says of 
the Spirit Award. "I didn't get nominated for an Oscar. I didn't get nominated 
for an Image award. I was overlooked." Despite his certainty that he'll win, he 
hasn't prepared an acceptance speech. "I just want to go up there and whatever 
comes out, I'm gonna say it."

ARK. TOWN GUNNING FOR JAMES GANG; MOVIES: THE CITIZENS OF VAN BUREN CLAIM THAT 
THE PRODUCERS OF 'FRANK AND JESSE' STIFFED THEM. 'NOBODY IS GOING TO BE 
SHABBILY TREATED,' ITS CO-PRODUCER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as the people of Van Buren, Ark., are concerned, the outlaws Frank and 
Jesse James should never have ridden again.  
</P>
<P>
 Calls to Hollywood from disgruntled citizens of this historic town complain 
they were run roughshod over by the producers of the Western "Frank and Jesse," 
starring Rob Lowe and Bill Paxton.  
</P>
<P>
 Bills are still unpaid or partially paid. Some contracts have not been 
honored. And, some say what's worse, the small-town spirit of cooperation and 
trust has been violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a big deal if this were big, bad Los Angeles, they said, but a crushing 
experience for those who once were excited at the prospect of seeing Van Buren 
(pop. 7,000) set-dressed back to the late 1800s -- not to mention having a few 
movie stars around. Van Buren actually stands in for Northfield, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have very gracious feelings right now," said Marjorie Armstrong, 
president of the Van Buren Chamber of Commerce, who said she is taking all the 
heat from local merchants left holding the bag when independent Lone Rider 
Prods., producers Elliott Kastner and Cassian Elwes (Kastner's stepson) and 
co-producer Lowe departed the scene in late January, leaving Trimark Pictures, 
the movie's distributor, to try to make good on the unpaid claims.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, L.A. can stay in L.A. and not rip off Arkansans," 
said Cecilia Foye, who said that her family's business, Advance Protection 
Services, has been offered, like many others owed money, about 50 cents on the 
dollar for an outstanding bill of $2,000 for providing security on the set in 
Van Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking nothing if we don't get paid (in full)," said Joy Daily, 
whose car leasing company, Lewis Co. Inc., is owed around $19,000.  
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the way it was when "Biloxi Blues" or "The Blue and the Grey" were 
shot there, Armstrong recalled. Those were the not-so-long-ago days when the 
visiting production company paid in good faith and on time, when the local crew 
hired weren't told the first day of filming their per diem would be less than 
first offered. And, when it came to shooting on picturesque Main Street, 
chockablock with antiques stores and quaint cafes, the production company would 
do the honorable thing by verbally agreeing to donate a few thousand dollars to 
community projects at the request of retail shop and restaurant owners who 
otherwise would be paid some compensation for loss of business when closed for 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not so Lone Rider. Because the low-budget picture ($3.5 million) went a 
reported $1.5 million in the red, 23 businesses, 11 individuals and assorted 
others from Fayetteville, Ft. Smith and Van Buren have filed complaints with 
the Arkansas Motion Picture Development Office. Inclement weather forced the 
production to go over schedule and caused many unexpected problems, like how 
the dirt brought in to cover the paved main drag turned hard as cement during 
sleet storms and delayed filming. (Larry Gordon, the dirt purveyor, also claims 
to be out about $14,000.)  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've had a film company come through that does not 
seem to care," said film office director William Buck, whose department 
actively solicits location filming in the state. On average, two movies or 
miniseries shoot a year in Arkansas, adding about $2 million to the state's 
economy -- a pittance by California standards but nothing to sneeze at in a 
state where the annual per capita income hovers around $10,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck said that some of the problems stemmed from confusion for who to go after 
for payment after Lone Rider closed its Arkansas production office, especially 
since this was an independent picture made by one company and distributed by 
another.  
</P>
<P>
 For several weeks, he said, Elwes wouldn't return calls and, when finally 
reached, claimed that the final bills were Trimark's responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elwes, brother of actor Cary Elwes, told The Times that "things don't always 
go as smoothly as planned" and that "nobody is going to be shabbily treated in 
this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me reiterate that Trimark has acknowledged the responsibility toward this 
picture," he said. "Frank and Jesse" is due to be released later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimark, in fact, has hired an accountant to go over unpaid claims and settle 
up, both Trimark and some of those owed confirmed. Some also say they'll have 
to take half payment because suing to recover the rest wouldn't be worth the 
expense. Cami Winikoff, director of production at Trimark, responded by 
promising that "no one would be left high and dry . . . there is every 
intention in paying the people of Arkansas." 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond monetary concerns, there are hurt feelings and a sense of betrayal. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce's Armstrong is almost as distressed that she was 
thrown off the set the days filming took place inside the beloved King Opera 
House, a local landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places, 
where she later discovered that nails had been driven into the lobby's wood 
paneled walls and carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, this has left a very bad taste in almost everybody's mouth," 
she said.

UCI GRAD RETURNS HOME TO DANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homecoming, the theme of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble's program here 
tonight, has special meaning to troupe member Katalin Gyulai. As a teen-ager, 
she emigrated with her parents from Hungary to Irvine, but went back to Hungary 
after graduating with a bachelor's degree in economics from UC Irvine in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved back because I prefer living in Hungary," said the 27-year-old 
dancer, who served as interpreter for artistic director Sandor Timar during a 
recent interview. "I didn't really feel at home in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her parents, Peter and Katherine, left Hungary because they didn't 
like the former Communist regime (they still live in Irvine) but added that 
life in post-Communist Hungary has its own drawbacks, particularly with an 
inflation rate that sits at 20% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, she said she is "really glad to see more things to buy" in 
Hungary, such as kiwi and stylish clothing. "And now we can travel anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that the country has to correct a lot of things that the government 
ruined in the last few decades. It will take a long time, but I'm patient." ZAN

COMMENTARY; ON THE DUMPING OF A '90210' ROLE MODEL; WHEN ANDREA GETS PREGNANT 
ON IN 'BEVERLY HILLS,' SHE MARRIES AND DROPS OUT OF SCHOOL, IT SENDS OUT THE 
NEGATIVE MESSAGE THAT EVEN BOLD, BRIGHT WOMEN ARE WITHOUT POWER OVER THEIR OWN 
FATE. 
</P>

<P>
 The teen-age soap opera "Beverly Hills, 90210" has committed many sins, both 
artistic and conceptual, in its four seasons on television, but they have 
rarely been serious enough to make me worry about my two daughters' sometime 
addiction to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas, however, the scriptwriters took their young characters, 
now freshmen at the fictitious California University, into dangerous territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreshadowing was all too obvious. Andrea, the editor of the high school 
paper, the valedictorian, the only person in the Class of 1993 who was admitted 
to Yale (although she couldn't afford to go), met a new man, Jesse, a law 
student who actually went to Yale. At about the same time, she had a 
conversation with a middle-aged woman that went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Woman: "So, Andrea, what are you studying?" 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea: "I'm in premed. I want to be a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman (smiling brightly at the man at her side): "I wanted to be a doctor when 
I was your age. But I married a doctor instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea: "That will never happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 On the spot I predicted that Andrea would get pregnant, get married and drop 
out of school. Everyone in my family scoffed. Andrea? The only really smart and 
ambitious young woman on the show? She would never do that! 
</P>
<P>
 In recent episodes it had become apparent that Gabrielle Carteris, the 30ish 
actress who plays Andrea, was in fact pregnant -- she wore dark tops covered by 
blazers, and the camera never showed her mid-section. The writers would have to 
find a way to remove her from the action for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, I have turned out to be right. Andrea got pregnant, struggled briefly 
with the idea of having an abortion and, a couple of weeks ago, elected instead 
to marry Jesse and have the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she will go back to school later, and because this is Hollywood 
(well, Beverly Hills), I am sure she will. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that this young couple will have no visible means of support. 
(Andrea is the only character on the show who isn't wealthy, and Jesse is 
working his way through school by tending bar.) 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that daycare is in very short supply and of very poor quality in 
most places. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the time, energy and level of organization that are required 
to go through university, medical school, internship and residency while 
looking after a child are beyond the reach of most ordinary mortals. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I foresaw it, I am appalled by this turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't mind if a different female character failed to use a condom and 
became pregnant or HIV-positive. More than 1 million American teen-agers -- one 
in nine girls aged 15 to 19 -- get pregnant each year, and the number of women 
with HIV is on the rise. The young people who watch "Beverly Hills" ought to be 
thinking about such subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 I can even excuse the way the writers handled the abortion question. The 
treatment was hopelessly superficial and sentimental -- but where this complex 
and emotional issue is concerned, it's impossible to satisfy everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But I bitterly resent that Andrea has been singled out to carry this plot 
line. She of all the young women on the show has the potential to go places -- 
the brains and the drive to become a doctor or anything else she desires. I 
liked the fact that she was out there in prime time showing girls what they 
could do if they set their minds to it. She was the character I would have my 
daughters take as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now all of that is over. Andrea is no longer someone to emulate. If she 
becomes a doctor -- or even returns to school -- it will be because she is a 
Saturday morning cartoon character who can fall off steep cliffs and walk away 
unscathed. In real life, a girl in her predicament would probably never achieve 
her goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea and her fans deserve better. Symbols have immense power, and having 
positive role models is crucial for all of us. To set our sights high and 
follow our dreams, we need to know that something is possible, that others have 
been there before. 
</P>
<P>
 Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) have given us a giant 
boost up, but we also need to see examples closer to home -- women who are 
school principals, presidents of companies, lawyers, scientists -- in both 
their adult and their incipient forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week Andrea was showing the millions of girls who identify with her what 
their futures could be. If the producers of "Beverly Hills" had let her stay in 
character, they would have written her out of the script by giving her a 
scholarship to Yale or sending her to France as an exchange student. Instead, 
they have chosen to foreclose her options, slapping her young female audience 
in the face and telling them forcefully that, even in the '90s, they must still 
seek their identities vicariously, through their men. Their place is still in 
the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers' decision shows a complete lack of imagination, and it carries a 
very negative message: that even the boldest and brightest young women are 
totally bound by their circumstances, without power over their own fate. 
</P>
<P>
 This choice is both an insult and an injury. The people who make their ratings 
and their money off of teen-agers have a responsibility to this young and 
vulnerable audience. If they would do them the courtesy of treating them 
seriously, thoughtfully and respectfully, and if they would make the effort to 
enlarge their vision of the world and themselves, all of society would reap the 
benefits.

TIPS FOR CARE-GIVERS

<P>
 The rigors of care-giving can be stressful. The job is a tough one that 
involves many tasks, responsibilities and long hours.If you are caring for an 
aging parent, experts suggest keeping several things in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't try to do it alone. The responsibility for an aging parent is best met 
as a shared responsibility with other family members. If no other family 
members are available, ask for help from friends, consider hiring a paid helper 
or look into community resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your prior relationship with your parent was painful and non-productive, 
now is the time to work through the old issues and create a new relationship 
based on love, understanding and self-acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your parent's needs and wishes should be considered and be a part of any 
planning on his or her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your needs are just as important as your parent's. Don't feel guilty about 
taking care of yourself. If you neglect yourself consistently, you will end up 
angry and helpless and may become ill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stress and tension are a normal part of care-giving. If conflict increases 
or becomes chronic, however, you may need to seek some counseling. Community 
Resources 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the resources available to care-givers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alzheimer's Assn.: (714) 283-1111 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange Caregiver Resource Center: (714) 680-0122  
</P>
<P>
 * Orange Outreach: (714) 771-1990 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior Information & Referral -- County of Orange: (714) 567-7500

SOUTHERN COMFORT; SUPPORTERS OF THE ASSISTANCE LEAGUE OF SANTA ANA FEEL AT HOME 
IN 'SPLENDOR' OF DIXIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Old South rose again Saturday when the Assistance League of Santa Ana 
staged "An Evening of Southern Splendor" at the Tara-like estate of John and 
Donna Crean. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dixieland band, Southern fare and sweet magnolia blossoms all contributed to 
the themed spirit of the gala, which attracted 280 guests to the Colonial 
mansion in Santa Ana Heights. The $100-per-person gala was expected to net 
$30,000 for the league. Heart of Dixie 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment guests stepped from their cars and walked up to the mansion's 
towering white columns and massive front doors, they were reminded of the 
South's glory days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our cue from the house; we went Southern with everything," said 
Barbara Metzger, event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dixieland band greeted guests with lively Southern music on the front porch. 
Inside the home, bouquets of magnolia blossoms adorned tables draped in white 
cloths. Janet Folcke of Conroy's Flowers in Tustin designed the all-white 
centerpieces and towering floral arrangements on the buffet table. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the night party-goers visited the buffet to stock up on Southern 
specialties. The fare, prepared by Maxwell's Catering, included chef-carved 
Cajun filet mignon, whipped potato souffle, corn pudding, homemade pecan torte 
and Georgia peach trifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Barbara and I walked up to the front of the house we were immediately 
reminded of 'Gone With the Wind,' " said Taffy Adams, gala co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 To carry out the theme, the Creans' private theater showed "Gone With the 
Wind" throughout the evening -- that is, when a few enterprising sports fans 
didn't switch channels to the UCLA basketball game. Southern Belle 
</P>
<P>
 The belle of the ball was honorary chairwoman Zee Allred, who was saluted by 
the assistance league for her community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed," said Allred, dressed in a fiery red pantsuit for the 
occasion. "What did I do? No more than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Allred has been active in the group for more than 20 years, serving 
as co-chairwoman of the league's thrift shop, buyer for the gift shop and 
volunteering in Operation Schoolbell, which provides clothes to needy children 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always been very involved," Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistance League of Santa Ana supports and operates a variety of 
philanthropies that benefit children, including the Katherine Irvine Day 
School, a preschool for children whose parents cannot afford quality day-care; 
Operation Prop (Pupil Recognition Opportunity Program), which offers 
scholarships to qualifying high school graduates; Operation Schoolbell, a 
children's dental center and a thrift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attending were: Kathe Griswold, league president; Shae Gazzaniga, 
auctioneer; Jon Brown, who entertained on piano; Ken and Mary Bryant, league 
president-elect; Eldrid Allen, Bill and Barbara Annan, Nancy Asper, Jo Ellen 
Benson, Roger and Janice Bowers, Eva Callahan, Mike and Sandy Capizzi, Stanley 
and Kathie Cohen, Marsha Corzine, Michael and Drinda Freriks, Lynn Galt, Mary 
Ellen Gausewitz, Linda Illingworth, Betty Koines, Millie Mathews, Margie Quinn, 
Judy Rand, John and Daphne Sheffield, David and Nancy Smith, Lee and Wendee 
Smith and Bea Webb. KATHRYN BOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles may be a melting pot, but it's definitely divided itself into 
fashion turfs and tribes.At the Crenshaw District's Fifth Street Dick's, high 
stylists in ethnic wear and soft leather bob their heads to the sounds of cool 
jazz and cappuccino machines. Mrs. Gooch's in Beverly Hills houses expensively 
attired health-concious types, incognito in dark glasses. Who wants to be 
recognized while considering the fiber content in yam chips? Venice's Gold's 
Gym habitues take their passion to gargantuan extremes -- extra-loose, 
parachute-like clothes are the only answer for bulging biceps, quads and lats. 
Downtown, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, ultra-serious, back-pack-toting 
art students in fringed jackets and leggings ponder the work of Roy 
Lichtenstein. MICHELE SEIPP

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLACES; WHERE THE DESIGNERS DO THEIR THING; GREGORY POE:

 Only a very small piece of the fashion pie is glamorous. Models, runway shows 
and stores are pretty, and you can be, too, once you buy that new outfit. The 
rest of it, the bulk of it, is much like dressing rooms -- ugly, sparsely 
furnished and poorly lit. Still, many people are quite willing to drive to the 
unlandscaped areas of town to toil in an office permeated with the acrid smell 
of fabric dye. They want to hear the cacophony of sewing machines and slowly 
melt in the tropical heat of a hundred steamers. We took a peek into the 
working conditions at four Los Angeles studios -- from Carole Little's huge 
complex to Gregory Poe's wee garret. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clothes: Very forward menswear. The tight-fitting, zipper-front vests are 
a big item, possibly because the vests' backs are made of a girdle-like fabric 
(spandex is as kind to spare tires as it is to saddlebags). Jackets and pants 
in knit fabrics and sheer shirts are other staples. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Label: Dutch Courage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Plant: A second-story, one-room space with loft located in a multibusiness 
industrial building in Vernon. The all-purpose room is cluttered with racks, 
desks and sewing machines. An 8-foot mountain of fabric samples threatens to 
topple any second. Despite its unglamorous address, Poe insists the building 
has a good-luck reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dress Code: Whatever you roll into when you roll out of bed. Eccentric 
hairstyles are not discouraged: Poe is bald except for a tiny porcine tail 
sprouting from the back of the head.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities: None that are readily discernible, although the crowded studio / 
sample room / office has a certain boho charm. Poe lists his patient sample 
maker, Ellia Ruiz, as one of the big pluses. "She keeps me from making 
five-legged pants."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Cheese: Poe and Brad Hickman, the company president, are partners. 
Both are irreverent, witty and slightly driven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Output: 30,000 pieces annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entry-Level Postion: "Well, I'd love someone to give me a hand," says Poe.

</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clothes: Contemporary office clothes, sportswear, large sizes and junior 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Labels: Carole Little 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Plant: The world headquarters of the Carole Little empire is nestled among 
nondescript two- and three-story warehouses just south of downtown Los Angeles. 
No signs advertise its existence. But the flocks of well-dressed young women 
who converge on it weekday mornings hint at the business within. Offices with 
glass-block walls and small cubicles filled with black office furniture house 
the design teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dress Code: No wardrobe slackers here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities: The facility is an oasis in the middle of industrial dreariness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Cheese: Little limos to the office to oversee her multiple design 
teams and numerous pattern rooms. She seems slightly scattered, trying to keep 
so many balls in the air, but her staff insists she is a tireless worker and an 
endless source of creative energy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Output: More than 18 million garments produced annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entry-Level Positions: People with design training are hired as taggers, which 
involves preparing collections for market shows. Those with no design skills 
are sent to shipping, a spokesperson says.

working conditions at four Los Angeles studios -- from Carole Little's huge 
complex to Gregory Poe's wee garret. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clothes: Each season brings a new design direction. Standouts for spring 
and summer include long tea dresses and mandarin-influenced jackets and vests. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Labels: Sue Wong and Sue Wong Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Plant: Wong's business is located in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, 
just north of the garment district and a little south of seedy. Her work space 
occupies two upper floors of a bright pink building -- an early warning to all 
who enter that this is a design studio like no other. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices are in an open loft decorated like an art gallery. Wong has 
decorated the walls with the artwork of friends and painted her collection of 
'50s furniture in homage to famous artists. Among them are a kidney-shaped 
Kandinsky reception table, Matisse end tables and a Mondrian conference table. 
The company's production manager is also a floral designer who fills the place 
with huge arrangements. Together, these elements make Wong's studio look like 
an art gallery moments before an opening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dress Code: Arty, part fashion groupie and part art crowd -- black clothes 
with statement-making jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities: Wong's staff is a virtual garment industry United Nations. She 
employs representatives from Switzerland, the Philippines, Mexico, Germany, 
China, El Salvador, Thailand and Japan. Her shipping room is uncommonly clean, 
spacious and orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Cheese: Sue Wong graduated from Los Angeles Trade Technical College 25 
years ago (Carole Little was in the same graduating class) and has had her own 
fashion business for the last nine years. She seems to relish the role of 
sole-creative-force-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Output: Sue Wong has two divisions, sportswear and dresses. Each is shipped 
five times a year, and may include as many as 10,000 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entry-Level Position: "Once in a while I've taken on a student for draping and 
sketching," Wong says.

</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clothes: Exquisite knitwear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Label: French Rags. 
</P>
<P>
 French sells two collections a year through her stores in West Los Angeles and 
Santa Fe, N.M., and via road shows staged like Tupperware parties. Customers 
can custom-order any style in any color combination -- "about 800 possible 
combinations in any given season," says French. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Plant: A complex of knitting rooms and offices above the Sepulveda 
Boulevard retail store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dress Code: Very casual. Not exactly sweats, but comfy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities: Windows that open. "I need incredible light, preferably on all four 
sides," says French. "It makes people miserable to work without sunlight, and 
work should be a pleasant experience." 
</P>
<P>
 French's insistence on a harmonious environment has ensured her a loyal staff 
over the past 16 years. One of the designer's longtime sewers quit so her three 
daughters could work for French while she stayed home with her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Cheese: French (a native of England) is enthusiastic, warm and 
approachable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Output: 36,000 garments a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entry-Level Position: A background in knitting is essential to run the huge 
machines or work in the office, French says as she surveys her workrooms. 
"These are not menial jobs, these people are creative."
