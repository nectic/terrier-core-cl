 Opera and film might not seem as if they belong together. They are, 
respectively, our most exclusive and most democratic art forms. One was born 
from an aural impulse; the other, visual. One has the ability to capture the 
inner world through music; the other to photograph the outer world. One tends 
to operate on psychological time; the other's orientation is more narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet try to keep them apart, so infatuated are the two media with each other. 
The relationship began almost with the birth of film -- amazingly, a number of 
silent films were made of operas, while movies began influencing operas and 
opera staging early in the century -- and it has continued, however gingerly or 
clumsily, ever since. Today, however, the traffic in both directions between 
sound stage and opera stage is practically a clogged freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers film opera and also direct it on stage. Opera directors put film on 
the stage and make movies. Composers write operas about film stars and turn 
films into opera. Opera stars appear in movies; movie stars make occasional 
guest appearances on the lyric stage. Opera is used in movie soundtracks, which 
attracts new audiences to recorded opera, and sometimes even the opera house. A 
burgeoning video market for filmed opera is starting to replace, not just 
supplement, audio recordings for experiencing opera at home. Even the opera 
house itself has become increasingly informal and unintimidating, essentially 
more movie theater-like, with diminished dress codes and the use of 
supertitles, adapted from the subtitles of foreign films. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few examples of what has been going on lately: Herbert Ross, the 
Hollywood director of "Turning Point" and "Steel Magnolias," was responsible 
for the production last fall of "La Boheme" opening this Los Angeles Music 
Center Opera season; the ever outrageous Ken Russell directed Strauss' "Salome" 
in Bonn, Germany, basing his production on the film version he once made of the 
Oscar Wilde play; and the director of German art films, Werner Herzog, created 
a new production of Wagner's "Der Fliegende Hollander" ("The Flying Dutchman,") 
for the Bastille Opera in Paris. Meanwhile, Dominick Argento recently unveiled 
his latest opera, "The Dream of Valentino," in Washington. (Its final 
performance is today; next season it moves to Dallas and also will be broadcast 
on PBS.) 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the most-hyped opera occasions in New York thus far this season have 
been the world premiere of Ezra Laderman's "Marilyn," a literal soap opera 
about Marilyn Monroe; a production of Philip Glass' latest opera, "Orphee," 
which is a musical setting of the screenplay, complete, from Jean Cocteau's 
1950 film; and the first American screening of a restored version of a silent 
film of Richard Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier," for which Strauss wrote a special 
orchestral score and which the American Symphony Orchestra played as 
accompaniment to the projected film. 
</P>
<P>
 And now at the neighborhood cineplexes. One of the more talked-about scenes in 
a current film happens to be that of Tom Hanks, in "Philadelphia," swooning to 
the voice of Maria Callas singing an aria from "Andrea Chenier." Meanwhile, 
Martin Scorsese opened his "The Age of Innocence" . . . where else but at the 
opera? 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of thing has been going on for a long time. The glamorous soprano 
Grace Moore was breaking down operatic barriers as early as 1934, thanks to her 
popular film "One Night of Love" (which, incidentally, was directed by a 
composer, Victor Schertzinger, who also wrote the title song). In the '50s, the 
Russians were filming "Prince Igor" as if it were "Ben-Hur." One of that era's 
greatest Italian filmmakers, Luchino Visconti ("Death in Venice," "The 
Leopard," "The Damned"), was also equally famous as an opera director, and is 
especially remembered for his productions with Maria Callas at La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of factors have come together now to make the interaction between 
the opera and film worlds much livelier than ever before. One is the growth of 
the home video market. Another is the abatement of European art films, which 
has sent such directors as Herzog and Lina Wertmuller (who directed a 
controversial "Carmen" in Naples a few years ago) looking for other work. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, of course, can predict where all this operatic cinema and cinematic 
opera will lead. But film inevitably will continue to assert greater and 
greater impact upon how opera will be made, staged and experienced; movies are 
too powerful a force in our culture not to. The influence opera will exert on 
the movies will likely be far less critical, but it may not be negligible. More 
important is the question of whether the consequences, in both directions, will 
be artistically rewarding or regressive, since there is tremendous potential 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what passes for artistic interaction between opera and movies is, of 
course, nothing but glitz, each media viewing the other enviously. Opera, so 
expensive and always on the lookout for new money, can always use some 
Hollywood attention; Hollywood has the money and glamour but every so often 
likes to justify itself with a modicum of the class and elegance that opera can 
bring to it. When opera is used as soundtrack, for instance, it is often just a 
classier means to the same sentimental ends that typical Hollywood 
schlockmeister composers produce, only better done. Such opera composers as 
Puccini or Giordano (who wrote "Andrea Chenier") were special masters at 
melodramatic sentimentality, and they had no small impact on generations of 
film composers. Better still, they are in public domain -- so the appearance of 
their scores on current celluloid may have little to say about the actual 
merging of opera and film. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here there can be surprising repercussions. One of the most 
celebrated uses of operatic music in film was Francis Ford Coppola's employment 
of Wagner's "The Ride of the Valkyries" in "Apocalypse Now" as arresting 
accompaniment for the helicopter strafing of Vietnam. The scene is shocking 
thanks to the music's puissance alone, notwithstanding what it represents in 
wartime context, given the Nazis' appropriation of Wagner. But the music here 
works especially well because it is the actual music Robert Duvall is listening 
to while piloting his warship. (Similarly, Callas' singing in "Philadelphia" 
becomes foreground, with Tom Hanks listening, and responding, to it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a new production of Wagner's "Die Walkure," staged by Lyric Opera of 
Chicago this season, director August Everding has credited this scene from 
"Apocalypse Now" as an inspiration for his own opera house staging of "The Ride 
of the Valkyries," which includes aerial versions of Wotan warrior-daughters 
lobbing comets as they leap on trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
 But just because a Coppola might use opera music effectively in film doesn't 
necessarily translate to film directors automatically having something to offer 
on stage. In fact, given the contrary demands of film and opera, just the 
opposite can easily be the case, as evidenced by Coppola's own cautious 
operatic debut staging Gottfried von Einem's "The Visit of the Old Lady" in San 
Francisco in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 What film directors do seem to offer is the ability to bring narrative 
techniques to the stage, which can be popular with an audience wanting easy 
accessibility, even if it is at the price of what opera does best, which is to 
allow characters time for reflection. The history of opera is not exactly as 
noted for wonderfully plotted librettos as it is for memorable characters and 
for profound insight gained into the human condition. But the necessity of 
narrative and of visual sophistication cannot be overlooked as more and more 
live opera productions at major houses are designed with an eye for 
distribution on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more successful filmmakers turned opera director turned video 
director is Liliana Cavani, a current favorite of conductor Riccardo Muti at La 
Scala. Although she once, in a forgotten 1977 film, "Beyond Good and Evil," 
depicted German philosopher Nietzsche dreaming a nightmare ballet between Good 
and Evil, she has been far more conventional on the La Scala opera stage. In an 
award-winning video she directs of her production "La Traviata," recently 
released by Sony, she offers an elegant and clearheaded period drama that looks 
just right, in a "Masterpiece Theatre" sort of way, on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite also holds, however, when a filmmaker decides to bring 
wide-screen spectacle to the opera stage, as Franco Zeffirelli has famously 
done at the Metropolitan Opera. Zeffirelli's productions, as Patrick Smith 
notes in a recent Opera News editorial, have become a New York tourist 
attractions on a par with such Broadway extravaganzas as "Miss Saigon." The 
sets, like those of a '50s Hollywood biblical epic, are the attraction at the 
expense of all else. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally an ambitious filmmaker will actually accomplish something truly 
cinematically adventurous and rich on stage, which in turn will look just awful 
on video. In his one occasion of staging opera, Russian director Andrei 
Tarkovsky offered a magnificent vision of a decaying post-apocalyptic Russia in 
his interpretation of "Boris Godunov" that continues the themes of his late 
films, like "The Sacrifice." Unfortunately that production -- created for 
Covent Garden a decade ago, when the filmmaker was exiled from his homeland as 
a dissident artist, and later brought to post-Perestroika St. Petersburg after 
Tarkovsky's death -- has not been well served at all on video. In a new London 
release, directed for television by Humphrey Burton, practically none of the 
full stage picture or the director's alarming vision survives intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area where success is rare is the true opera film. Several attempts 
have been made to film opera on a cinematic scale -- with outdoor locales, big 
battle scenes, sound effects, screen actors lip-syncing prerecorded opera 
singers, the works. A few of the more sensitively and imaginatively done ones 
have been popular, most notably Ingmar Bergman's lyric and musical "The Magic 
Flute." (Bergman is another film director who works periodically on the opera 
stage.) But it always requires a rare cinematic poetry to overcome the hazards 
of cinematic detail, which, along with the dubbing, so often make filmed opera 
look simply foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what really spoils most attempts at making such opera films are the 
sound effects: The enhanced sonic reality is often more magic-destroying than 
any picture, or any off-putting close-up of a singer's quavering epiglottis. 
And so, perhaps it is not as surprising as it might first seem that the most 
interesting and the most radical influence film has had on opera has been from 
silents -- an influence that continues unabated to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual silent films of operas, whether something like Ernst Lubitsch's 
"Carmen" or the "Rosenkavalier" adaptation that extends the plot, were little 
more than historical curiosities. But if they work at all, it is because 
silents can more readily adapt to musical time than can talkies, which are 
paced by theatrical dialogue. The camera can take its time to get long, long 
reaction shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Silent films, one needs always remember, were never silent. They were always 
shown with live musical accompaniment, and frequently shot to live musical 
accompaniment, with musicians on the set providing mood music. (Strauss even 
played his "Rosenkavalier" score on the piano during shooting of the film.) 
</P>
<P>
 The balletic movement, the leisurely time frame, the mime of silents can, in 
fact, be seen as an important influence on two of the most venturesome American 
opera directors: Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has closely studied the timing of Charlie Chaplin, in particular, and 
Chaplin reputedly had been an admirer of Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellars has been increasingly using film or video on stage. In a new video 
production of Kurt Weill's "Seven Deadly Sins," taped last year in Lyons with 
Teresa Stratas (though not yet seen in this country), Sellars continually 
jump-cuts between film and stage footage. Sellars has also gone so far as to 
attempt a silent film, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez," starring Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, though without much critical success. 
</P>
<P>
 And two of the most creative opera films ever made are also directly inspired 
by silents. Speaking on an alternate soundtrack of a recent Criterion laser 
disc release of Michael Powell's gorgeous 1951 film, "The Tales of Hoffmann," 
none other than Martin Scorsese describes how Powell shot the film as if it 
were a silent, using the music to control the speed of each shot, but Scorsese 
also emphasizes just how thoroughly he has studied the film and the important 
impact it has had on his own work -- "Raging Bull" in particular. Powell, whose 
previous film had been "The Red Shoes," also relied much upon dance to create a 
fanciful world that cinematically extends the stage rather than replaces it 
with the screen. In a more avant-garde manner, Hans Jurgen Syberberg did much 
the same thing with a highly stylized, Brechtian version of "Parsifal," made a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Silents have even had impact on operas being written. One of the most 
successful new American operas of recent seasons, William Bolcom's "McTeague," 
premiered in Chicago last year, was inspired not just by Frank Norris' book, 
but by "Greed," Erich von Stroheim's film of it. As evidence of this, film 
director Robert Altman, who directed the opera production and collaborated on 
the libretto, made a recent documentary shown on PBS that intercut scenes from 
the film with the staging, showing not only their similarities but that there 
were moments when the opera could be credibly played in sync with the silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a bold approach is being taken even further still by Philip Glass. 
Following "Orphee," Glass is currently setting another Cocteau screenplay, that 
for his most famous film, "Beauty and the Beast." But this time he is writing 
the opera to be performed along with film. While the film is projected (without 
its original soundtrack), singers and an instrumental ensemble will perform a 
concert opera in synchronization to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meant as an opera that Glass can tour with his ensemble, without any of the 
hassle of transporting a production, and also meant to capitalize on the 
ever-powerful combination of film and live music, Glass is proposing something 
that is neither opera film nor filmed opera. Rather it is to be a complete 
merging of the two into a single experience. Look for it at your local concert 
hall next year as we enter the postmodern future of opera -- virtual opera, 
silent and sung.

THE GREAT L.A. NOVEL SET IN VERMONT; POOL, BY AJAY SAHGAL (ATLANTIC MONTHLY 
PRESS: $20; 210 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Lindquist, Mark Lindquist, author of Sad Movies and Carnival Desires, 
lives in Seattle. He is a Democratic candidate for the Washington State 
Legislature. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pool" is one of the most authentic Los Angeles novels you are likely to read 
and the beauty of it is that not a single moment is set in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Emery Roberts, a twentysomething movie star, has walked off the set of "Sun 
City," a $40 million dollar buddy cop thriller, and gone to Vermont. The reader 
has no idea why. Emery, the narrator, also has no idea why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool" could have been subtitled "Portrait of an Unexamined Life or Why One 
Should Avoid Hanging Out with Young Actors." Pointedly anti-plot and with 
ciphers for characters, "Pool" is nonetheless compelling thanks to Sahgal's 
spare, cryptic prose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool" is "Waiting for Godot" for a generation whose gods are celluloid. Like 
"Godot," "Pool" is funny, sad, and filled with shocks of recognition, 
particularly for those who have ever felt lost in the modern Sodom known as 
Hollywood. "I can't go on. I must go on. I can't keep writing screenplays. I 
must keep writing screenplays." 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont Emery joins other Hollywood expatriates who are holed up at a 
farmhouse: a screenwriter, a fired CAA agent, and the "Sun City" producer's 
alcoholic daughter and useless son. Along with Emery is Danny, a USC film 
school grad, the "next Phil Joanou," who films Emery's every move on videotape. 
Emery is oblivious to Danny and his omnipresent camera in much the same way 
that normal people in, say, Seattle, are oblivious to rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessarily lacking the physical details of L.A. (no Santa Ana winds, no sweet 
eucalyptic wetness in the air, no wild-eyed coyotes to run over in a Range 
Rover,) "Pool" proves that L.A. is merely a transportable state of mind. L.A. 
is convincingly, disturbingly, brought to life in the Vermont countryside. 
There's all the vernacular, banter, celebrity fixation, and barely repressed 
anger endemic to Los Angeles. And it is not limited to the expatriates. When 
Emery visits the local bars, townie girls fawn senselessly over him and their 
boyfriends want to kill him. When the group needs money, they have a garage 
sale and there are plenty of local buyers for emery's used Yamamato blazer, and 
his unread copy of "Ulysses" (for the musical version with a score by Michael 
Bolton). 
</P>
<P>
 Only one character in the novel seems to have a goal of any kind: the 
screenwriter. He is building a pool in the backyard. And it is not just a goal, 
but an obsession. Though this is ostensibly motivated by the snapping turtles 
that roam the nearby lake in menacing packs, there is clearly more at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Building the pool is the screenwriter's raison d'etre. He envisions a cool, 
turtle-less place, a thing of beauty. What he creates, mostly, is a big hole 
filled with mud. And then the snapping turtles invade. (This is one of the 
smartest funniest metaphors for a screenwriter's life that I have ever read.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool" is chock full of wickedly funny bits that will be especially 
appreciated by industry insiders. Characters make deadpan references to movies 
with hilarious titles and plot lines that are all the funnier because the 
joke-movies are no more absurd than, say, "Encino Man," "Problem Child," "Stop, 
or My Mom Will Shoot," or any number of other wildly profitable movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool" has plenty of set pieces that scriptwriters are paid to fill pages 
with: a brawl, a roman candle fight, a car crash, and the big production number 
when an entire movie crew invades the farm house. What's interesting is that 
these scenes read like parodies of what one would expect. The idiot-proof drama 
that makes these paint-by-number scenes popular with studio executives seems to 
be intentionally filtered out. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters in "Pool" are so disconnected from what is genuine that they 
feel nothing. There is not much to be felt in a cliche. There is not much to be 
felt when nothing is valued. This valuelessness that kills the possible joy of 
these characters lives even creeps into the sex scenes. They've arrived young 
to what self involvement and constant indulgence invariably lead to: emptiness, 
burn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, in the end, wins. Emery becomes resigned to his fate, and his fate 
is to fly first class, have beautiful strange girls beg to sleep with him, and 
make millions of dollars, without ever understanding anything about any of it. 
If this does not sound especially hellish, it will after you read this scarily 
convincing portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Emery's most redeeming quality is that he is mercifully free of the 
self-involved self-help posturing that substitute in Los Angeles for living an 
examined life. Even that requires more self-examination than Emery can muster. 
He does, however, perform Public Service Announcements for "Rock Against Fur." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Hamill, after hanging around drunks and actresses for too many years, 
came to a realization. Hamill recognized, as he put it, that he had been 
performing rather than living his life. He stopped drinking. This saved him. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters in Sahgal's novel are light years away from this kind of 
realization, and probably incapable of the kind of action that might save them. 
Sahgal wisely knows what about this is sad, funny, and, at moments, even 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool" will not be a bestseller. It may, however, be destined for cult-classic 
status in Los Angeles.

THE PATRON SAINT OF BIBLIOPHILES; TONY CIMA DIDN'T JUST COLLECT BOOKS. HE 
DEPENDED ON THEM, EVEN IF THEY ALMOST KILLED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GRISWOLD, Jerry Griswold teaches at San Diego State University and is 
the author of Audacious Kids: Coming of Age in America's Classic Children's 
Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a 5.2 earthquake struck San Diego on July 13, 1986, Anthony Cima was 
trapped for 11 hours under his collection of books. The story made the news. 
</P>
<P>
 The 87-year-old man lived in a downtown residential hotel in a 12-by-12-foot 
room stacked to the ceiling with 10,000 books. That only left a small space in 
the center where he could lie down to sleep or where he could sit up and have a 
cup of coffee while he read. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake struck early Sunday morning. By evening, when Cima's neighbors 
hadn't seen him, they knocked and tried to open the door, but books had wedged 
it closed. It took firefighters 20 minutes to open the door and another 20 
minutes just to find Cima's foot. To rescue him, firefighters threw many of his 
books out a second-floor window. Below, Zuhair Zaya and his employees at 
Barney's Liquor Store, remembering the old gentleman, respectfully placed the 
volumes in shopping carts and temporarily stored them in their back room. Cima 
was rushed to UC San Diego Medical Center that night in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard about Tony Cima the next day, on an evening television program, when 
his condition was improving. It was said he woke up and asked for a glass of 
orange juice and a book. That struck a sympathetic nerve with me. Here was 
another book-lover, now in a hospital room, no longer surrounded by his usual 
companions. The next morning I went out to buy him a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahrenbrock's Book House is the downtown bookstore near Cima's hotel, so 
that's where I went. Owner Chuck Valverde knew Cima. He told me that the 
87-year-old widower actually had some 20,000 books (10,000 in his hotel room 
and another 10,000 in rented storage space) and that he purchased these with 
his veteran's pension and Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He buys all kinds of books," Valverde told me, "fiction, nonfiction, 
histories, condensed books. He rarely pays over a dollar for any one book. And 
he's sharp. I don't think he's ever bought a duplicate. He has a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 His plan, Valverde said, was to donate his collection to the town of Cima, a 
place 150 miles northeast of San Bernardino that coincidentally shared his 
name. He had heard that the bookmobile from Needles only visited this Mojave 
Desert community once a week. He felt that was a shame. Cima wanted to build a 
library there. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering Cima's request when he regained consciousness, I bought him a 
paperback (Gerald Donaldson's "Books: Their History, Art, Power, Glory, Infamy 
and Suffering") and took it to the hospital and left it for him. Because I 
wasn't a blood relative, I wasn't permitted to see him. I did, however, get to 
visit with him one afternoon several weeks later, when he was still 
recuperating at the Veterans Administration Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a small, frail man with thinning white hair, a freckled face and 
wonderful blue eyes. Alert and gracious, he welcomed me and started talking 
about his hopes of getting better so he could visit the Public Library again. 
And he told me about his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of an Italian immigrant, Cima was a steelworker in Pennsylvania when 
he bought his first set of books -- the 51 volumes of the Harvard Classics. He 
read them twice. Later, he managed a chain of movie theaters in Pennsylvania. 
Later still, he founded a small publishing firm, the Cima Publishing Co., which 
brought out such titles as "The Writings of the Fathers of the Church." In 
1960, he retired and moved to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He told me he had four children who were still living, as well as 17 
grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. "They live all over the country," 
Cima said as he fumbled with the folds of a paper puzzle he had created to 
amuse himself. "We don't see each other much. They have their own lives. Thanks 
for the book," he said, changing the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cima stayed in the Veterans Hospital a few weeks longer and then, in 
early September, against his doctor's advice, he left and returned to his hotel 
room. He had to do something about the 4,000 books still in his room. The San 
Diego Housing Division had ordered him to immediately remove them because the 
weight of the books was a safety hazard; later, senior housing inspector Bill 
Lyon granted Cima a month's extension. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, librarians in Needles indicated that (despite Tony's 
hopes) there was no real need to build a library in the community of Cima since 
the size of the town (permanent population between 4 and 12) really did not 
warrant it. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning of Cima's troubles with the Housing Division, the manager of San 
Diego's Interstate Self Storage, Red Kaster, stepped forward and offered to 
store Cima's books for free. Kaster even recruited 25 volunteers to move the 
books to the storage facility. Another firm, Fidelco Communications Corp. in 
San Ysidro, donated 100 boxes to cart the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Tony I would take him in my car to come out and sit with the books 
anytime he wanted," Kastner told journalists, "we will even furnish a chair." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony got cold feet in late September and, at the last moment, called the 
move off. "Tony said he has a chance to sell the whole collection," Kastner 
reported at the time, "but I think he loves those books so much he hates to see 
them go." Really, he had no choice, so in October, the books were moved to the 
donated space. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, on Nov. 19, 1986, Tony Cima was found dead in his hotel 
room. The firefighters, summoned again by neighbors, were the first to enter 
the room and find his decomposed body. According to the coroner, he had been 
dead for several days. Some of those same people -- among them Fire Capt. Larry 
Williamson and firefighters Ralph Haynes and John Handley -- were among the 
volunteers a few weeks later when Cima's 10 tons of books were moved from the 
storage space to a city library facility. Tony's books were given to the

WAITING FOR THE WOODS; THE EMILY CARR OMNIBUS, INTRODUCTION BY DORIS SHADBOLT

 Emily Carr (1871-1945), Canadian painter and writer, was that most beloved and 
mythologized American type: a frontier character. Pioneer artist, harbinger of 
the advanced American style not yet called Abstract Expressionism in her time, 
she was also a mighty grouch, given to sulks and breakdowns and, by contrast, 
to fits of coy girlishness and pantheistic enthusiasm. She lives on, the 
compleat if problematical feminist model, in the delectable self-portraits that 
pepper the pages of this collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of these book-length sections were published in her lifetime, foundation 
for a slowly growing reputation. First to see print, in 1941, was Klee Wyck, a 
collection of moody stories recalling Garr's youthful rambles among the Indian 
villages of the Northwest seacoast, sketch pad at hand and memory at its 
freshest (the title means "laughing one," her name in tribal language). It came 
out when she was 70, just starting to enjoy a bit of acclaim. Three more 
collections and "Hundreds and Thousands: The Journals of an Artist appear here 
for the first time, assembled after her death. These include memoirs of her 
childhood and her later, painful learning days in the art capitals of London 
and Paris. There are crotchety tales of the birds and animals whose company she 
preferred to humans -- a vulture, a crow and a peacock, multiple sheepdogs, a 
rat and a monkey named Woo. And finally there are moving passages of 
self-analysis and aesthetic questioning recalling summers when she camped in a 
falling-down van called "the Elephant," painting, trying to paint, failing to 
paint and painting again the obsessive theme of her middle years, "the deep 
sacred beauty of Canada's still woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr was born in 1871 in the nostalgia-infected British colonial outpost of 
Victoria on Vancouver Island, then a "little town drowned in silent 
loneliness." Her father, the archetypal Scot-Presbyterian patriarch, was a 
purveyor of English foodstuffs and foreign cigars to a clientele some of whom 
lived in log cabins. Out of homesickness, he planted cowslips and primroses 
around the edges of his cowpasture and trimmed his hedgerows straight. Emily, 
his youngest, was his "pet." A current feminist notion repeated in Doris 
Shadbolt's sympathetic introduction is that Emily suffered at his hands and 
grew to despise him. However, no such flat declaration is made in these pages. 
Instead, Carr vents whatever retrospective anger she preserved in a few stabs 
of ironic description of a proud old man in conflict with a proud old man in 
conflict with a willful daughter. Indeed, in her own old age Carr wrote she had 
become "like Father . . . Father's straightness." Much more to the point, and 
well to remember, she knows he recognized her talent for art and kept, all his 
life, her drawing of a dog in a childish hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, both parents died early leaving Emily in the care of a truly 
disciplinarian older sister. At 16, she fled by ship to San Francisco and 
enrolled herself in art school, setting a course for her future. When, a few 
years later, she trekked the remote coasts and islands of British Columbia, she 
forged her own kind of emphatic bond with the near-forgotten, decaying 
artifacts of Northwest tribal culture. Her special interest became the totem 
poles she would draw and paint for years, with gradually refining skill. These 
somber scenes, filled even with a kind of supernatural gloom, stayed in her 
mind's eye and provide the mood of Klee Wyck. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Carr would have remained a mere recorder of ethnological curiosities 
had she not set out to enlarge her artistic vocabulary in Europe. This time, 
however, the obstruction she met was internal. On the threshold of so many new 
possibilities for radical action and thinking, she broke down twice, and though 
in her convalesences she was able to take in the basic principles of 
Post-Impressionist and pre-Modernist art, she returned as she had gone, 
essentially a provincial loner. Discouraged, embittered, full of self-pity and 
rancor toward others, she gave up painting for some 15 years and was only, one 
might say, salvaged by luck. By the late 1920s, the interest of mainstream 
Western culture had drifted in her direction. Museums became interested in 
"primitive" cultures; her "Indian" paintings were mentioned in the East, 
summoned there for exhibition, and soon, powerful men with connections to the 
art and media worlds came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point in her life was meeting a group of progressive Toronto 
landscapists who helped her refocus her painting energies on her "relationship 
to the Infinite." That concept dear to 19th-Century transcendentalism would, in 
a complex process of cultural mutation, infuse the early Modernist movement. Of 
that period of tremulous liberation, Carr would write -- in words that almost 
literally echo and foreshadow those of Georgia O'Keeffe and Joan Mitchell -- "I 
went no more to the far villages, but to the deep quiet woods near home where I 
sat staring, staring, staring -- half lost, learning a new language or rather 
the same language in a different dialect. So still were the big woods where I 
sat, sound might not yet have been born. Slowly, slowly I began to put feeble 
scratchings and smudges of paint onto my paper, returning home disheartened, 
wondering, waiting for the woods to say something to me personally. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Carr died in 1945, she was considered Canada's most famous painter 
-- of female gender. But her work is still practically unknown in the United 
States. It has not had a significant showing in a state-side gallery or museum 
(one canvas was included in a show of Expressionist Landscapes at the IBM 
Gallery in New York in 1988). Paula Blanchard's engrossing biography, which 
came out that same year, contained only a few reproductions and the book at 
hand has none, even though Shadbolt is the author also of a study of her art. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it has to be said the present volume is far from user-friendly. It is 
sadly unannotated, lacks introductions to the separate texts, and, 
irritatingly, has neither an index nor a master list of titles to guide a 
reader between notebook references and relevant stories. Perhaps a next edition 
will provide these.

A MAN AND HIS EDGE; MARK ROTHKO: A BIOGRAPHY, BY JAMES E.B. BRESLIN (UNIVERSITY 
OF CHICAGO PRESS: $39.95; 712 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A.M. Homes, Amy Homes' last book was In a Country of Mothers (Knopf). She 
frequently writes for Art Forum magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 25, 1970, Mark Rothko was found dead in his New York studio, a pool of 
blood spreading out on the floor beneath him, his wrists slashed. Sixty-seven 
years old, he had been in declining health for several years, was separated 
from his second wife and living alone. Violent deaths create mythologies of 
their own and unfortunately the dramatic way in which Rothko died has perhaps 
exerted a larger influence over the way in which his work is viewed than the 
far less dramatic way in which he lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Markus Rothkowitz in Dvinsk, Russia, the boy immigrated with his mother 
and brothers to Portland, Ore., when Markus was 10, following the path of his 
father who had made the journey three years earlier -- and who died just months 
after the family arrived. Markus then left Portland for Yale and soon abandoned 
the academic life for that of a struggling young artist in New York City, 
adopting the moniker Mark Rothko. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a portraitist of the human soul. Subverting the ideology of the 
Surrealists and the ethos of the Luminists, Rothko invented an entirely new 
vocabulary for American painting. His self-contained, soft-edged rectangles of 
color redefined modern American art and made him one of the most significant 
Abstract Expressionists. Now, his life and his death are the subject of James 
E.B. Breslin's lengthy, if thorough, biography. 
</P>
<P>
 In Breslin's view, Rothko never recovered from the combined losses of his 
native country and his father: "Most of all, he resented his enforced 
migration. He 'was never able to forgive,' he angrily declared, his 
'transplantation to a land where he never felt entirely at home.' " Mark Rothko 
was an outsider who perceived himself as persecuted because of his Jewishness, 
and because of his strong opinions, compromised by the greed and ego of others. 
He was an outsider who wanted in, and once inside, found no comfort, found 
instead that there was no inside: "Rothko wanted to be understood; he wanted to 
recognized , to be seen in the deepest sense. Yet recognition entailed its own 
dangers: if he were understood, then he was no longer an outsider -- he lost 
his edge." 
</P>
<P>
 A man who constantly needed to be in control, Rothko asserted himself with 
nearly obsessive fervor over the environments and circumstances under which his 
work would be viewed. Declining to appear in the 1952 Whitney Annual, Rothko 
cited his "deep sense of responsibility for the life my pictures will lead out 
in the world." And when Elaine de Kooning wrote an article about his work, 
Rothko went over it word by word, rewriting it with her. About the experience 
De Kooning said: "Mark really wanted not only to control his paintings, but he 
wanted to control what was said about his paintings." Rothko worried that if 
not displayed under the right conditions his work would be demoted to the level 
of decoration, while simultaneously he was petrified that he would be revealed 
to be a fraud instead of a great painter. In 1959 upon his acceptance of a 
commission to create paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant in New York, 
Rothko declared, "I accepted this assignment with strictly malicious 
intentions. I hope to ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats 
in that room." Rothko worked on the murals for two years and then after taking 
his wife to the restaurant one night, withdrew the paintings and returned the 
money he'd been paid, saying, "Anybody who will eat that kind of food for those 
kind of prices will never look at a painting of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Rothko's personality was a complicated one; anxious, depressed, 
consumed with himself, filled with enormous self-doubt and a need for approval, 
Rothko was also an intensely private person. One of the least autobiographical 
painters of his generation, it could be said that his life's work was dedicated 
to freeing himself from the existing limits of representation and 
interpretation. Mark Rothko' mature works are elegant if brutal reflections of 
those parts of the self that are so rarely revealed or fully articulated. In 
their radiant veils of color the paintings give full expression to the extremes 
of man's existence, reflecting the tragic ecstasy of the human experience, the 
melancholia of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silence is so accurate," Rothko once said, and perhaps he was right. 
Breslin's 683-page biography raises numerous questions not just about the life 
of Mark Rothko but about the nature of biography, especially as it relates to 
modern art. There has been much discussion about why there are so few 
biographies of modern artists; yet writing these biographies has become an 
increasingly complicated endeavor. Within Mark Rothko's lifetime, the practice 
of art writing was already growing from the small group of artists and critics, 
as described by Breslin, into an interdisciplinary community taking on 
increasingly complex explorations of theoretical positions filtering through 
various sociological, economic, and political states as well the semiotic, 
psychoanalytical, and deconstructionist positions. Ideally, Breslin's position 
outside the progression of contemporary discourse should have been liberating, 
giving him the freedom to explore Rothko's life and work in ways which the 
structure of current criticism would make difficult. But in attempting to 
document the life of a man whose work focused on transcending the 
conventionalized limits of representation, James E.B. Breslin, a professor of 
English at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of two 
previous volumes, "From Modern to Contemporary: American Poetry 1945-1965," and 
"William Carlos Williams: An American Artist," has extended beyond his reach. 
Subjecting an artist such as Mark Rothko to the kind of investigation and 
language he abhorred, binding him to the mundane details of a regular life 
might be of value it to clarify or enhance our understanding of his work. 
Ultimately, despite Breslin's intensive effort -- the book is well researched 
and thick with documentation (nearly 1,500 footnotes) -- his weighty tome is 
less a biography and more an exhausting if repetitious report. In the end, 
Breslin seems unable to evoke Rothko's powerful and compelling personality, the 
majesty of his paintings, and/or the social and cultural climate in which he 
lived.

RICHARD EDER: TIME A IN BOTTLE; THE FERMATA, BY NICHOLSON BAKER (RANDOM HOUSE:

 Poor Achilles. He never could catch that tortoise, not because he was slow or 
the tortoise speedy but because Zeno wouldn't let him. In the famous paradox, 
the tortoise gets a 10-meter start, say, and by the time Achilles runs the 10 
meters, the tortoise has crept 10 centimeters; when Achilles goes the 10 
centimeters, the tortoise has done a millimeter, and so on. But the rules are 
stacked. Achilles doesn't catch up in the first stage, lasting a few seconds, 
but he would do it in the next stage if it lasted even one second instead of 
only a few hundredths of one. Zeno arranges tinier and tinier distances in 
tinier and tinier intervals that rapidly approach stasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson Baker is becoming his own Zeno, and approaching an equivalent 
stasis. His is a clever, a comic and a genial spirit. In "The Mezzanine" and 
"Room Temperature" he devised an enticing micro-literature. The first -- a 
lunchtime walk in a department store -- and the second -- a morning spent 
holding his baby -- explored whole worlds of tactile and temporal associations 
through two kinds of dailiness. The reader suspends belief, and perhaps the 
author did too; and both are rewarded. It is as if by musing on the nail in the 
general's horseshoe and squinting across it toward the horizon, Baker had 
evoked an entire war. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think that Baker's command of sensation's nuances, and his ability 
to perch far-fetched yet oddly reasonable structures atop them, would work 
particularly well with the highly sensory, not to say sensational, subject of 
sex. Yet his last book, "Vox," sagged despite some brilliant variations in its 
story of a man and woman having phone sex. "The Fermata," narrated by a man who 
possesses the power to stop time and uses it to undress women, is a greater 
letdown. Although it has brio and speculative ingenuity, Baker works them with 
a mildly ill feverishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno Stryne is a permanent temp in a succession of Boston offices. It's not 
that he's dumb, quite the contrary, but his energies go into his peculiar gift. 
When he was a child he brought a transformer to school and found that by 
switching it on he could switch time off for everyone but himself. He used the 
interval to take off his clothes, go up to his much-loved teacher, investigate 
her bodily parts and dab her navel with blue chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 He has used his developing talent -- he steadily simplifies the machinery for 
switching off time until simply snapping his fingers will do it -- to strip 
hundreds of women, fondle some of them and play ludicrously elaborate sexual 
tricks with a few. He draws the line at actual intercourse because that would 
be rape. He usually rearranges whatever he has disarranged so that when he 
starts time up again, his target, though sometimes hot and bothered, has no 
sense that anything has been done to her. He argues that he is doing good as 
well as having fun because he pays tribute to female body parts, even if they 
sag or are oddly shaped and thus unused to admiration. He has his code though 
he admits it has a few holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would condemn in the strongest terms anyone else who did what I have done," 
he tells us. "But the thing is, I did it, I did it, and I know myself. I know 
that I mean no harm, I mean well." An outrageous argument, to say the least; 
especially as we read of the various extremes that he goes to. 
</P>
<P>
 Arno stops time in a subway, attaches a vibrating device to a woman passenger 
and then, alternately restarting time so the device can work and stopping it 
each time the woman tries to investigate what is happening, brings her to 
orgasm. He achieves a similar effect on a beach by writing a pornographic story 
on his portable typewriter, stopping time to slip it into the sand beside a 
sunbathing woman, restarting, watching her arousal as she reads it and then, in 
a complex series of temporal starts and stops, hiding in her house for a twin 
round of masturbation of whose simultaneity only he is aware. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangements for what he punningly calls "chronanism" become ever more 
elaborate. Placed inside a magnetic resonance chamber, he practices it on a 
woman doctor who is measuring the carpal tunnel damage to his wrist caused by 
his temp typing and his single-handed sex life. Spotting an attractive fellow 
driver on the Massachusetts Turnpike he stops time and traffic, hikes an hour 
to the nearest town, buys a tape recorder, tapes another pornographic story, 
gets into the woman's car and slips the cassette into her player to replace her 
Suzanne Vega. He restarts everything, and follows her car, fantasizing a 
further adventure of even more absurd complication. Instead, she tosses the 
cassette out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, thank goodness, a comic chink (after all that work) opens in the 
cabinet of this consciously comic, preemptively discriminating and 
suffocatingly creepy Caligari. Does Baker perceive him as such? It is unclear. 
True, "The Fermata" -- the musical term for a note held beyond its prescribed 
value -- tells Arno's story largely in retrospect with a framing-device that 
offers the possibility of some chastening perspective. At the start, after a 
time-stopping peek at a fellow-worker, Arno falls in love with her. He writes 
out his past adventures, which become most of the book. Then he confesses to 
her before taking things farther. It is to be a real relationship instead of 
Arno's time-gimmick -- except that she quickly warms to the gimmick and finds a 
way to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fermata" is frequently funny; sometimes in the Monty Pythonesque 
elaboration of Arno's stratagems, sometimes in the microscopic parsing of his 
sensations. It is not enough to counteract the chill. Never mind Catherine 
MacKinnon; the book is enough to blow the fuses on Kant and his categorical 
imperative. (Treat others as ends and never as means.) Arno's account may 
satirize today's voyeuristic culture; the trouble is, he acts too comfortable 
in the telling, whether in the mode of skillful erotica, crude pornographic 
parody or loopy confessional. What is stickier, beneath the apparent comfort 
there is a hint of unease as if this kind of outrageousness were not quite in 
Baker's line of belief but an experiment gone faintly whiffy. 
</P>
<P>
 To see the world in a drop of water, you need to choose your drop. In some 
drops all you can see is your own eye. "The Mezzanine" stretched its net across 
the tide of daily trivia whose small hopes and despairs constitute the wetlands 
of our lives. "Room Temperature" did something similar with the mingled awe and 
tedium of parenthood. The sexual feelings that Baker explores in "Vox" and "The 
Fermata" arise less from real sex than from his characters' masturbatory 
fantasies. His microscope reveals the color-dots of a printed picture, not the 
mysterious forms of a living cell.

By WILLIAM H. GASS, William H. Gass is a novelist and critic and the director 
of the International Writers Center at Washington University in St. Louis. His 
novel The Tunnel is due out next year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 2 last year, an Algerian journalist, poet, and novelist, Tahar Djaout, 
died of wounds he received when he was shot in the head near his home on the 
outskirts of Algiers by Muslim terrorists who objected to the attitude his 
newspaper took toward their fundamentalism. Humanely, any crime of this kind is 
reprehensible, but culturally the loss is also considerable because Tahar 
Djaout, 39 when he died, was an accomplished writer whose novels, written in 
French, had received both prizes and acclaim. His murder got his ghost a brief 
and passing paragraph in several American newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we fanatics, we followers, we faithful, we patriots, we partisans: Death 
is what we do best. We bear the body, beset the life, cause the corpse. The 
residue is huge: a heap wider than a wasteland, higher than a hill. Yet what 
have we made when we've made it? One more small circle of grief around a pile 
of sightless eyes. So many sick and shot and starved. So many women raped and 
widowed. So many children maimed and left alive to weep because they weren't 
among the fortunate who grew into their death like weeds into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, what call has Salman Rushdie -- yes, a worthy man, immensely 
talented yet only a writer, and a citizen of another country, after all -- what 
call has he on our attention, when an entire world seems surfeited with 
suffering and we've lost count of even those still strong enough to scream? 
What scale can weigh his years of imprisonment within the hug of security 
police, where we must imagine his spirit being cautioned to skulk through the 
hallways of his own head? There is no way we can share these fears of a hidden 
gun held at the heart, as in a cruel game, to go off at a time unnumbered on 
any dial. What is one man's career supposed to mean to us, so safely situated, 
or his desire to be known for the excellence of his work, rather than be 
notorious for the odd malice of his fate? What claim can any of this have on 
ears as continually beset as ours, where we hear howling everywhere, as if we 
each sat at the mouth of Hell itself, and read or watched -- were fed -- the 
news? 
</P>
<P>
 Sense is what we are supposed to make. Meaning is for Man to manage, making 
mind out of all this "never matter." We ought always to have the gift of 
consciousness on our conscience. Who else can feel the warmth of someone's 
pleasure in a finger's touch? Hear a voice rise like a slow bird from the 
meadow of the page? 
</P>
<P>
 So when by threats or sophistries or betrayal's rewards, our liberty of 
thought and expression is constrained, our openness of action and free field of 
dreams impeded; when an unpleasant opinion, a vulgar expression, a disturbing 
incident, a troubling idea, a satiric skit, a peal of laughter, a hoot of 
derision, is foreclosed because this or that is not a laughing matter, is 
sacred as a cow may be, or king, or caste, or race, or flag, or god, or mother; 
when dirt's words are bottled up like bugs chloroformed in jars; when only the 
difference of local sameness is embraced, rather than difference itself; when 
the fascism of the left and the fascism of the right clasp underhands; then . . 
. then what? Shall we toddle back to bed like chastened children, goblin-cowed; 
shall we fail to render those in danger aid, though their plight is a plight of 
principle, and not merely -- not merely -- a neighbor's need? Shall we allow 
the very bases of all good life and all fine art to be besmirched, even 
removed, by sullen fanatics, by bewildered fools, by those who will surely lose 
their seat near god if they can't keep the rest of us away from the table? 
</P>
<P>
 The fatwa was pronounced against us all. It commanded the murder of a mouth, 
yet issued from the mouth of a murderer. Although the act called for anger from 
us, an anger honest and righteous to stand against this fabricated and 
expedient pretense which fueled ignorant and distant mobs, the time for that 
feeling went pallidly past, and now the only object of anger ought to be 
ourselves for our slow, our wan, response, for our characteristic feeling of 
futility, our fears, too, consequential as they may have been, since the 
question of the reality of the risk is irrelevant to principle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if we believe no man is an island, even if we are all part of the 
main, there are so many in want, in danger, who have been, by their leaders and 
circumstances, betrayed; there are simply so many multitudes in pain; what can 
we say to ourselves on one man's behalf, or on the behalf of readers and 
writers, as if they were sufferers, too, though most read only the papers, sign 
petitions, apply salves to their conscience, sit in meetings, pound an innocent 
table? 
</P>
<P>
 Only this, I think: there is a bond between us, readers and writers, an 
ancient tie, as old as writing is, if not as old as speech itself, a pact, a 
promise which the act of setting down sentences in a moving way implicitly 
solidifies; that what we shall say shall be as true to things and to our own 
heart as we can manage with our skills to make them; and that what we read 
shall be free and unforced and uttered out of the deepest respect for the 
humanity all language represents, whatever its content otherwise; and that this 
covenant (broken, tragically, every day which history has been there to mark) 
is the model for all exchange of thought and need and feeling, and that this 
community -- the community of unveiled countenance and free speech -- must be 
sustained, if we are to continue, either in the harsh and unforgiving condition 
of survival, or in terms of every genuine enterprise of the moral spirit -- in 
short, so we can say, though we may be here by genetic accident or a god's 
decree, that we deserve to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Our papers report that on account of the fatwa -- out of a hatred which would 
numb the tongue before its undoubted excision -- editors, translators, readers, 
writers like Tahar Djaout, have been threatened, assaulted, wounded, murdered; 
but their victimizers cared nothing for their victims, not in the state of hate 
they represent; they care not a sweet plump fig for Salman Rushdie or his work 
or what it may say to them or to anyone, not in the condition of ignorance and 
fear which they embody; they seek an excuse to silence the mind, to blind the 
eyes, to stopper the free flow of feeling. Fundamentalists will not rest, for 
to rest, like a cyclist, is to fall; to rest may be to realize that their light 
comes from a far away star, that their mode of life has been dead for a long 
time, and the world, in which they are busy killing and constraining, is 
already a bier into which they, with their miseries, have been born. Five Years 
Later 
</P>
<P>
 "On February 14,1989, the religious leader of one country issued a death edict 
against a citizen of another country. Five years later Salman Rushdie is still 
a man with no fixed address. The novel that provoked the death sentence, 'The 
Satanic Verses,' continues to be available in bookstores and libraries through 
out the United States and many other countries. But Rushdie is in hiding, still 
writing nearly every day, making public appearances on occasion -- but 
effectively under threat, marked as with an incandescent X on his chest and 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpt from a flyer that bookstores across the nation are giving away to 
comemmorate the anniversary of Rushdie's hiding. The beautifully printed 
statement written by Don DeLillo -- which will surely make it a collector's 
item -- is provided by the Rushdie Defense Committee USA, a coalition of 
organizations that campaigns for the rescinding of the Iranian decree calling 
for the death of Rushdie and of all those associated with his novel.

FIVE-RING COVERAGE; CBS SHOWS MAJOR EVENTS DURING PRIME TIME; TNT ALSO HAS THE 
DAYTIME COVERED

<TEXT>
<P>
 If it seems like only two years ago that we were setting our schedules, or our 
VCRs, for Winter Olympic viewing, that's because it was in February, 1992, that 
athletes from throughout the world gathered in France's Savoy region for the 
XVI Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the International Olympic Committee's decision to move the 
Winter Games out of the same calendar year as the Summer Games, we had to wait 
only two years instead of the usual four for the next sequel, the XVII Winter 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was inspired by U.S. television network executives, who complained 
they did not have the financial wherewithal to bid for two Olympics in the same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in this particular case, the winners are the athletes, who had to train 
for only an additional 48 months before competing in another Games. Many say 
they would have retired if their next opportunity had not come until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, rule revisions in figure skating have allowed other well-known names 
from past Olympics to return. CBS, which paid $295 million for the broadcast 
rights, hopes that familiarity breeds ratings for its prime-time coverage. TNT 
will air daytime coverage of selected events. 
</P>
<P>
 Following is a glance at the major stories CBS will be following in each sport 
(for broadcast times, see schedule Page 7) : Figure Skating 
</P>
<P>
 Katarina Witt. Brian Boitano. Viktor Petrenko. Torvill and Dean. Gordeeva and 
Grinkov. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme was going to revolve around former gold medalists who took advantage 
of a new rule that allowed them to renounce their professional past and return 
to serious competition. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before figure skating hit the front pages with stories of bodyguards, 
hit men, strange estranged husbands and jealous rivals as someone tried to ice 
America's ice princess, Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 All they got was her knee, which, while damaged enough to prevent her from 
defending her national championship last month, appeared at press time to have 
sufficiently recovered for her to skate in Norway. Less certain was whether 
Tonya Harding, who inherited the national championship, would be implicated in 
the assault and, if so, whether it would cost her the Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Kerrigan-Harding affair seems certain to overshadow the other 
women competitors, including Germany's Witt, a two-time gold medalist returning 
for one more chance for glory, Ukranian orphan Oksana Baiul, who won the world 
championship last year at age 15, and France's back-flipping former gymnast, 
Surya Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's competition, all the drama will be on the ice. The last two 
Olympic champions, the United States' Boitano from 1988 and Ukraine's Petrenko 
from 1992, take on four-time world champion Kurt Browning of Canada and a 
couple of upstarts, Scott Davis of the United States and Elvis Stojko of 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairs competition seems a lock for the 1988 gold medalists, Russians 
Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov. But Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean 
of Great Britain, who won the dance gold medal in 1984 with their memorable 
"Bolero," have not adjusted as well in their comeback and appear vulnerable to 
a couple of Russian teams, who had to move into separate rinks on separate 
continents after a married partner from one team started waltzing off the ice 
with a member of the other team. Figure skating action, it's fan-tastic! 
Speedskating 
</P>
<P>
 Can Bonnie Blair do it again? Can Dan Jansen do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who has won three gold medals and a bronze in the last two Games, can 
become the most decorated U.S. woman Olympian with a medal in Norway. That does 
not figure to be much of a hurdle for her as she is entered in three events and 
figures to be favored in two. 
</P>
<P>
 More compelling is the challenge awaiting her teammate, Kristen Talbot, who 
earned a berth on the Olympic team and, two days later, donated bone marrow as 
a potential life-saving gift for her brother, who was diagnosed in December 
with aplastic anemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot would consider her Games successful if she finishes in the top 15. But 
she says her most inspirational battle cry is reserved for her brother. "Go 
white count!" 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' best hope on the short track again is Cathy Turner, who 
gave up her singing career -- "Sexy, Kinky Tomboy" was her most successful 
single -- to win a gold medal and a silver in 1992. She took a break from 
competition last year, becoming the first speedskater to tour with the Ice 
Capades. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning Jansen was to skate in the 500 meters in the 1988 Winter Games, 
he learned that his sister, Jane, had died after a long bout with leukemia. In 
one of the most heartbreaking chapters of U.S. Olympic history, he skated that 
afternoon and fell, then returned days later in another event and fell again. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Olympics four years later in Albertville, again as a medal 
contender, he finished fourth in one race and 26th in another. Instead of 
giving up, he persevered and since has established himself as the sport's 
fastest man, a prohibitive favorite to win the 500 and among the favorites in 
the 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he is more mature now, having gained a new perspective on life by the 
birth eight months ago of his first child, a daughter named Jane. Alpine Skiing 
</P>
<P>
 After winning gold medals in the slalom and giant slalom in 1988, Italy's 
Alberto Tomba, the self-proclaimed "messiah of skiing," was so confident of 
duplicating the feat four years later that he renamed the site of the Games 
"Alberto-ville." 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, make one concession to age. "I used to have a wild time with 
three women until 5 a.m.," he said. "In the Olympic village, I will live it up 
with five women until 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he had it right the first time because he repeated only in the giant 
slalom, settling for silver in the slalom. Or perhaps he has it right now that 
he is committed to one woman, a former Miss Italy. He, for a change, is making 
no predictions, but he is among the favorites in the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. skiers can match neither the talent nor the flamboyance of Tomba, 
although Picabo (Peek-a-boo) Street comes close in the latter category. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents are former hippies who helped found the small village of Triumph, 
Idaho, where their daughter was known as "Little Girl" until she was 3-years 
old. Her parents finally gave her the name of a nearby trout stream, which was 
named for a Native American word meaning "shiny waters." 
</P>
<P>
 A silver medalist in the combined event in last year's World Championships, 
she likes her name except when she orders pizza. "I just say my name is Jane," 
she says. Nordic Skiing 
</P>
<P>
 For Norwegians, the glamour of alpine skiing's "White Circus" is for the 
dilettantes of Austria and Switzerland. Real skiing is cross-country, the 
longer and more demanding the course the better. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Norwegians have become intrigued by their new alpine stars, 
the Flying Vikings. But their hero is Vegard Ulvang, who won three gold medals 
and a silver in 1992 in cross-country skiing but is even more admired as an 
explorer and adventurer whose goal is to climb the highest peaks and traverse 
the longest rivers on each continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy touched Ulvang last year, when his brother disappeared in a snow storm 
while skiing. Ulvang joined in the official search, then conducted one of his 
own, in a futile attempt to find his brother before rejoining the ski team. 
"There is nothing more I can do," he says. "I have to confront the situation." 
Luge-Bobsled 
</P>
<P>
 Confronting the situation. That is what Duncan Kennedy was doing in a bar in 
Oberhof, Germany, earlier this winter, when neo-Nazi skinheads began chasing 
one of his black teammates on the U.S. luge team, Robert Pipkins. Kennedy stood 
up to the thugs, allowing Pipkins to escape out a back door. For his bravery, 
Kennedy suffered cuts and bruises but won admirers from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 If he wins a medal, it will be the first ever for the United States in luge. 
That would be a great achievement for someone who became interested in the 
sport while serving as a gofer for ABC during the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake 
Placid., N.Y. A better bet for a medal, however, is Wendel Suckow, who last 
year became the United States' first luge world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year also was a good one for Brian Shimer, a Floridian who was the 
world's leading bobsled driver. He has not had as much success this year, but 
believes he will be accustomed to the new sled designed by stock car driver 
Geoff Bodine in time for the Games. Ice Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 The country split into numerous fragments, and most of their top players 
became professionals in North America, but the Russians, who formed the nucleus 
of the former Soviet Union's Olympic dynasty, continue winning. It will not 
take a "Miracle on Ice" for the United States to beat them, but it would be a 
significant upset. The young Americans are so rough and tumble that the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. is considering signing them up.

 RAISING THE DEAD: A Doctor's Encounter with His Own Mortality by Richard 
Selzer (Viking: $17.50; 118 pp.). "How can it be," writes Richard Selzer, "that 
a lifetime of treating the sick has not prepared him at all for the role of the 
patient?" In 1991, Selzer, a surgeon, was diagnosed with Legionnaire's disease 
and went into a coma. On the 23rd day of the coma, he died for 10 minutes, came 
back to life, lived through a brief period of dementia in which he inhabited 
St. Ronan's monastery in 13th Century Ireland (the food was terrible), and made 
his way up the Nile to Molokai on a sailing ship to meet Father Damien and the 
lepers. Upon returning home, Selzer asked to read his chart, only to find that 
it had been lost. The doctor wrote his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the very beginning, Selzer gives us two examples of writing about illness: 
the novelist Fanny D'Arblay, writing in the early 1800s about her mastectomy, 
performed without anesthesia, and John Donne, meditating in the early 1600s on 
his own acute illness ("an epidemic fever that swept London in 1623 and 1624"). 
While D'Arblay wrings the literary most from her account, writes Selzer, Donne 
muses patiently on "the philosophic divine and the meaning of affliction." This 
patient aligns himself with Donne, while writing the most beautiful, profound, 
literary account of what it means to be two beings at once: the traveling soul 
and the patient rooted to the table, the earth, the body. Both are willful. 
Selzer wonders if separating the two is no more than a literary device. Who 
cares! "I, the author, am also there standing, or rather hovering bodiless . . 
. able to reach down if I wish and touch him, the one lying there on the 
stretcher who seems to me a small bird perched on an arrow that has been shot 
from the bow and is flying somewhere. If ever the man wakes up and can speak 
for himself, I shall have to change pronouns." You will not forget the 
metaphors Selzer uses: a coma is like being " embedded , the way a fly trapped 
in a chunk of amber must apprehend its plight," or the tulips someone brings: 
"seven bald witches lunging for his thoughts." And it remains a meditation, 
with no great lessons brought back from the land of the dead. Or perhaps Selzer 
has heeded the voice of what his mother called "the shushing angel," who leaves 
her mark on our upper lips, having warned "the newborn babies not to reveal the 
secrets of life before birth."

ADJUSTED EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Cupid Inc." (by Amy Wallace, Jan. 16), about Jeffrey Ullman, omitted any 
mention of the high-pressure tactics that Great Expectations uses on 
prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
 My "informational" appointment with a "counselor" a few years ago was anything 
but pleasant. It was a nightmare hour of arm-twisting, guilt trips and sleaze 
spent with a predator working on commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, I met my wife through friends.

<P>
 Ullman and Great Expectations have sent me those direct-mail questionnaires, 
too. Several hundred thousand single Angelenos like me cannot purchase his 
services because we are gay or lesbian. The Great Expectations forms provide no 
place to indicate that one is searching for a soul mate of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I've returned Great Expectations postcards after writing in the 
margins that I am gay, no one from Ullman's service has ever responded to my 
queries. Surely a man who boasts that he's "going to marry America" should 
realize that he's missing out on at least 10% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess one can have great expectations of his service so long as one is 
heterosexual and does not expect the whole truth.

 Wallace's article brought to mind our own experiences when we served, briefly, 
as the advertising agency for Great Expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 After browbeating my staff until one member actually broke into tears, Ullman 
telephoned my partner and me, sneering: "I have some good news and some bad 
news for you. First, you people are no longer the advertising agency for Great 
Expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 "And what," my partner inquired, "is the bad news?"

 As a friend of Ullman, I felt that your article was both fair and accurate. As 
a personal profile, however, it didn't mention that he is one of the most 
generous human beings around. Ullman truly cares about his friends, and he is 
one person I wouldn't hesitate to call for help -- anytime, no matter what the 
circumstances. 
</P>

 I hope that your cover story about Ullman will discourage singles from joining 
Great Expectations and wasting their money in support of this pompous 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 I joined Great Expectations in Orange County and was told that the 
organization is "very selective" about the "quality single people" it allows to 
be members. After having seen some of the members, I believe that the only 
screening done is to verify that each applicant's check won't bounce.

</P>
<P>
 I joined Great Expectations in 1988 and chose my husband three months later. 
We married in 1989 and have blended five children from our previous marriages 
into a very successful union -- not an easy thing to do. We, like thousands of 
other happy "success-story" couples, stand behind both the concept of Great 
Expectations and its gutsy founder, Jeffrey Ullman. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now national director of success stories for Great Expectations in Encino, 
but I'm writing of my own volition to say that Wallace's article was biased. I 
was especially put off by the label "Love God From Hell." Ullman is far from 
mean-spirited. Sometimes tactless, but aren't we all? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really necessary to bring in all the negativity regarding his family? 
All families have some skeletons in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 I found it odd that most people quoted in the article were from the past. I 
wish Wallace had taken the time to incorporate some of the thousands of success 
stories from all over the country. Interviews of current associates and 
employees would have provided plenty of positives to give the article balance.

 MARBLE SKIN by Slavenka Drakulic. (Norton: $20; 188 pp.) Drakulic breaks so 
many taboos in this little novel that you can hear the stained glass shattering 
all the way from Zagreb.In the process of making a statue from marble called 
"My Mother's Body," Drakulic chisels out a memory of a cold elegant woman 
raising a child whom she treats more as an exotic and messy accessory than a 
girl. This is a mother you hide things from, especially anything to do with the 
body, like blood or desire or fear. In an apartment filled with clean linen, 
perfumes and old lamps, Drakulic watches her mother, lusts after her mother, 
through keyholes and doorways with many men, and learns that even though 
swooning looks like dying, it's actually passion. Sure enough, one of the men 
stays, leaves his camel's-hair coat "smelling of smoke and fog," and his things 
amid their creams and bottles in the bathroom. Drakulic hammers and chisels and 
carves out another memory: The man in her bedroom with his hands on her. After 
this goes on for a while, Drakulic writes: "The body is made of blood. The body 
is her trailing after me, mopping up the traces of blood I scatter as I pass. . 
. . I couldn't subtract myself from myself, because his presence was my only 
signpost towards my bodily essence." Much later, after she has told her mother, 
after her mother has stayed with the man another eight years, after her mother 
has tried to kill herself twice, Drakulic reaches some epiphany of forgiveness. 
But after all the flesh and blood, it's a paltry, symbolic thing.

 MEMORIES WITH TREES by Ilse Tielsch, translated by David Scrase. (Ariadne 
Press: $12.50; 109 pp.) There is no way to resist a book that begins: "The 
juice pear trees blossomed in May, just as they had always blossomed."Even if 
you grew up in the densest, most urban environment, there are trees somewhere 
in your memory. This little novel is an exercise in memory, that of Anna, who 
was sent during World War II to her Aunt Walburga's farm, which meant to safety 
and sanity and routine like the juice pear trees. She returns many years later, 
on her way somewhere else, and remembers her childhood on Aunt Walburga's farm 
as if it were a film that she cannot "project herself into." She cannot shake 
the feeling that she "had not been there." It is also, of course, the memory of 
the author, who fled from Czechoslovakia to Austria in 1945. Tielsch is a poet 
and novelist, and this memoir is a graceful combination of the two arts. She 
repeats phrases, like "juice pear trees," or the word "foreign" the way a child 
would sound these phrases out, or the way an adult tries to make sense of them 
and put them in a context, or most graphically, the way a deaf person forms 
them with his or her hands. Often words and phrases are set in capital letters, 
like THE WAR IS OVER or ENEMIES. Words that just don't mean the same thing at 
different times in different places. At any rate, it is very useful to have 
Aunt Walburga's farm in your memory, IN CASE you need to go there sometime.

 HAUNTED: Tales of the Grotesque by Joyce Carol Oates. (Dutton: $23; 320 pp.) I 
wasn't in the least bit scared, not of old Mrs. Minton, or Florence Parr's 
dolls, or of Mr. Starr, the murderer who stalks his own daughter.I was a little 
nervous about Jocko, the evil 2-year-old ("He tugged the bedclothes rudely away 
from her, exposing her so hastily she pulled up one of the straps of her 
nightgown to hide her flat slack bruised breast that had never recovered from 
Jocko's furious sucking . . . she tried to kick him loose but . . . he was too 
strong and too mean.") who persuades his mother to knife to death the father 
that "wanted me vacuum-sucked out of you." But by the time I got around to 
Babydoll, the perfect wife whose husband gathers his business associates to 
watch him introduce rats into his helpmeet, I was frightened. In other words, 
they build, these stories, and they seem to move from the horrible to the 
grotesque. One cannot shake the picture of Joyce Carol Oates, sitting in some 
big stone manse in Princeton, experimenting with writing, trying different 
styles, characters and contexts in a way that, dare I say it? lacks heart. It 
doesn't mean they aren't entertaining or "well-written." They're just a little 
slick.

 MARRIED In the Movies edited by Kyle Roderick (Collins Publishers San 
Francisco: $14.95; 80 pp.). They say love is blind, but some of the most 
visually arresting moments in movie history are wedding scenes -- a point 
well-made in this celebration of seven decades of cinematic "I do's."From the 
macabre ("The Bride of Frankenstein") to the misty-eyed (above, Bette Davis in 
"The Old Maid"), this collection of black-and-white movie stills escorts 
readers down the aisle with many of the silver screen's best-loved, and 
best-loving, stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some photos have the warm, fuzzy and familiar appeal of your favorite 
Christmas songs: e.g., Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart in the 
1940 classic "The Philadelphia Story." Others are more deliciously offbeat -- 
Beverly D'Angelo as a pregnant, floating bride in an LSD hallucination scene 
from 1979's "Hair"; Lucille Ball, pre-"I Love Lucy," and Esther Williams, 
pre-bathing-suit era, vying for the affections of Van Johnson in "Easy to Wed"; 
and Hayley Mills, looking very post-Pollyanna and deeply apprehensive as she 
ties the knot with Hywel Bennett in "The Family Way." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Roderick's text (picture captions laced with a few anecdotes) is minimal 
and his photo collection less than complete: Where is bride-to-be Bo Derek 
getting to the church on time at the start of "10"? Or martyred mother Barbara 
Stanwyck pathetically forced, in the unforgettable "Stella Dallas," to view her 
daughter's high-society wedding from behind a gate? But this little picture 
book remains a nifty catch for those who love love, not to mention the movies.

 PERFECT HUSBANDS (& Other Fairy Tales): Demystifying Marriage, Men and Romance 
by Regina Barreca. (Harmony Books: $20; 288 pp.) This, quite frankly, is why 
some people have a horror of self-help books.You turn to them, hoping against 
hope that there will be a gentle wisdom offered, a little humor to lift you out 
of your despair, a support group on paper. You ignore dumb covers, unappealing 
subtitles, and trite interchange between sitcom couples. Sometimes the 
situations are disturbingly familiar. But this woman, professor of English and 
feminist theory, delivers the kind of Uncle Morty shtick you see on late night 
television with stand up comedians: "I was raised to sing along at weddings to 
Tony Bennett's "Take My Hand, I'm a Stranger in Paradise," wondering whether 
Paradise was a suburb in New Jersey where newlyweds were headed and whether it 
was a good neighborhood." Hahaha. AND IT DOESN'T LET UP. In between the jokes 
are ideas like; don't expect your husband to do everything for you, don't 
expect marriage to save your life, men are afraid of being trapped in 
domesticity, men are afraid of intimacy. Once in a while she quotes really 
helpful authors like Deborah Tannen ("You Just Don't Understand: Women & Men In 
Conversation," Ballantine), and the contrast between their sincere offerings 
and Barreca's shtick stops the reader short. The moral is, if you want to be 
entertained and diverted, rent a video, like "Night of the Living Dead."

MURDEROUS CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Moscow had more murders than Los Angeles in 1993, despite the fact that for 
about 70 years the penalty for firearms possession has been up to five years' 
imprisonment ("Moscow PD Blues," by Diane K. Shah, Jan. 16). There, as here, 
Draconian gun-control laws have proven to be absolute, abject failures. 
</P>
<P>
 While the evidence shows that an overwhelming police presence will severely 
curtail crime (the recent Los Angeles earthquake aftermath and the communist 
era in the former Soviet Union serve as examples), such armed profiles are 
basically undesirable and quite expensive to maintain. Both Los Angeles and 
Moscow, and other places as well, need to resolve the moral and social problems 
that lead to crime and violence.

 Regarding your article on "Babylon 5" in TV Times (Jan. 23-29): In the final 
paragraph of the story you give the false impression that the series' landmark 
special effects are created on an Apple Macintosh computer when, in fact, 
Foundation Imaging's Emmy Award-winning work was only possible thanks to 
Commodore Amiga computers equipped with NewTek Video Toasters. In large part, 
"Babylon 5" owes its existence to Ron Thornton and his team proving that 
high-quality visual effects can be produced by low-cost desktop systems like 
Amiga.

 Matthew T. Gabbert, Lawndale Two Was Better Than One 
</P>
<P>
 When it was "John and Leeza" (NBC), it was a good show because it was 
one-on-one and they both sat in their seats and interviewed one person at a 
time. It was comfortable and enjoyable. Now that it is "Leeza" it is the same 
old talk-show host going into the audience, asking stupid questions and doing 
the same old insidious interviews with people who want to air their dirty 
laundry for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
 And so good luck to Leeza, but I won't be watching.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1990 Three Men and a Little Lady (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) drags along 
memories of the 1987 hit "Three Men and a Baby," but no one figures out 
anything amusing for Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson to do. This 
time out the guys are worrying that the mother (Nancy Travis) of the baby she 
initially abandoned will marry a snobbish Englishman (Christopher Cazenove) who 
doesn't like children. 
</P>
<P>
 Predator 2 (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.) is a lively but derivative 1990 sequel to 
the 1987 hit original. This time the jungle is urban -- L.A. in 1997 -- rather 
than strife-torn Central America. Arnold Schwarzenegger took on the gigantic 
alien the first time around, now it's Danny Glover's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Point Break (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is a beautiful but dumb 1991 
thriller starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-Ohio State Rose Bowl quarterback turned 
FBI agent, who goes underground to infiltrate the surfer subculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Heckerling's Look Who's Talking (KABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a comedy about 
unwed motherhood and potential step-fatherhood, with Kirstie Alley and John 
Travolta, tapped an unexpected box-office vein in 1989. It's a sweet, but 
unexceptional entertainment, whose major gimmick-Bruce Willis as a wisecracking 
baby voice-is milked endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg is all sass and flash as an undercover cop in Fatal Beauty 
(KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a rickety, ultra-bloody star vehicle that allows 
Goldberg to strut her stuff and also socks over a strong anti-drug message. 
Whoopi is fun, but the 1987 film self-destructs, succumbing to hypocrisy in 
trying to preach against drugs while exploiting violence to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Schwarzenegger manages not to take himself too seriously, but that's 
about the only redeeming virtue of the ultra-violent, ultra-complicated 1986 
Raw Deal (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.). He plays a rural North Carolina sheriff who 
is able to infiltrate the Mafia in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically the only guilt-free way to laugh about ill-fated plane flights is 
to watch the 1980 parody Airplane! (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.). Robert Hays plays 
a pilot afraid to fly but who chases his stewardess ex-girlfriend (Julie 
Haggerty) on a flight that appears doomed when the crew is food-poisoned. 
Hilarity ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's Saturday night double feature offers two strong historical dramas 
concerning miscarriages of justice: the Australian Breaker Morant (at 9 p.m.) 
and The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez (at 11 p.m.)

BERGEN AND SEYMOUR: DEADLY DUO FOR CBS' COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ENDRST, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Jane Seymour and Candice Bergen have anything in common, it's the love of a 
grateful network. 
</P>
<P>
 All you had to do was watch CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer 
fussing and bussing with both stars at a recent television press party in 
Pasadena to see that. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, while recognizing Seymour, 43, and Bergen, 47, as two of the 
network's three most important female stars (Angela Lansbury being the other), 
haven't always been as enthusiastic. At least when it comes to Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have so many critics been so quick to dismiss a series so completely 
embraced by the public as her "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 So forgive Seymour if she sounded just a little bit more than proud, just a 
shade dramatic, when she showed up for the star-laden CBS party in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dr. Michaela "Mike" Quinn first ventured out into the barren programming 
patch known as Saturday night in January, 1993, it looked as though she would 
be laughed off the prime-time landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics ridiculed the politically correct posturing of Seymour's pioneer 
practitioner raising three orphans ("I'm not a lady; I'm a doctor!"), and 
dismissed the drama as a '90s rehash of "Little House on the Prairie." But the 
public saw things differently. Much differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its second season, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" turned out to be a 
monster hit. Not only did the show crush its competition, improving CBS' 
ratings in the 8-9 p.m. time slot by 132 percent, it has been making the 
network (which produces the program) a small fortune overseas. ("Dr. Quinn" has 
been sold in 63 countries so far). 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour says her belief in the show never wavered. "When I read it, it clicked 
with me," says the actress, also known for her romantic roles in glossy, 
made-for-TV movies and the occasional miniseries. "I identify with people 
living in the middle of America," the British-born Seymour says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a family and I care about what my kids see on TV. I care about what I 
see on TV, and I love watching things that are about the human condition. To me 
there is nothing more compelling in book form, film form, drama form -- any 
kind of form -- than dealing with the emotional responses that human beings 
have to the traumas of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour continues without hardly catching her breath: "The character is the 
kind of woman that I think a lot of women would really like to be. She's 
bright, and she's vulnerable, and she's feminine, but she's strong, and she's 
spunky, yet she's fallible, and you know she's sexy and romantic. ..." 
</P>
<P>
 The joy of parenting hasn't been quite as smooth for the tenacious TV 
newswoman on "Murphy Brown," at least according to its star, who chatted with 
reporters just a few feet from Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone who followed the last presidential election knows, former Vice 
President Dan Quayle made Murphy Brown's baby the center of his so-called 
family values debate. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Quayle's comments about single-parent families generated lots of 
copy and gave the sitcom a ratings boost, Bergen says the baby may have 
ultimately thrown the show out of whack. In retrospect, says Bergen, "I look 
upon it very much as a Rod Serling episode in 'Murphy Brown.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the strength of 'Murphy Brown' has always been the topicality and the 
bullpen and 'F.Y.I.,' " she says. "It was great to have the year of pregnancy, 
but then you have the baby. And just like in real life, it's like, 'Oh. Now you 
have to adjust to the baby.' I think basically people didn't want to see as 
much of the baby as they did and wanted us to get back to where our strength 
was, and I'm thrilled because it's what I've always loved best about the show." 
</P>
<P>
 So say all but goodby to on-screen motherhood for Murphy. With two years left 
on her contract, though, Bergen would like to get some more Motown -- Murphy 
style -- back into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy singing horribly so much," Bergen says of her notoriously 
out-of-pitch performances.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T. Haymon (the S is for Sylvia) is an excellent English novelist still too 
little known by American readers. But she lifts crime writing to the level of 
literature, never more eloquently than in BEAUTIFUL DEATH (St. Martin's: 
$19.95, 222 pp.) , the seventh in a series featuring Ben Jurnet, a police 
inspector in the east of England. 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam, the woman Jurnet has pursued and loved through earlier books, is 
killed by a car bomb at his front door. Throughout much of the book Jurnet is 
distraught with grief, wondering about "the continuing irrelevance of drawing 
breath," in one of Haymon's uncommonly fine turns of phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, crying himself to sleep, "Jurnet briefly gave himself up to a hatred of 
all gods, Christian, Jewish, Moslem, the lot." But the policeman side of him 
takes over and a near-murderous wish for revenge sets him on a trail that leads 
to Ireland and more explosives and considerable peril for Jurnet and a 
handicapped young Israeli woman who worked with Miriam. (More of her in 
subsequent volumes, one suspects.) 
</P>
<P>
 Haymon gets inside Jurney's soul and handles his introspection wonderfully 
well, but she is also an expert yarn-spinner and the action gains speed like a 
plane lifting off. The villain's confession is psychologically interesting, 
although it is very long, a tidying of threads -- always a peril when all 
manner of puzzlements have to be answered at once. No matter: it is a superior 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Another supremely expert yarn-spinner is Miami's Edna Buchanan. Many a woman 
on city-side must envy Buchanan's genius at translating her life as a Pulitzer 
Prize-winning crime reporter into best-selling fiction. MIAMI, IT'S MURDER 
(Hyperion: $21.95, 244 pp.) carries forward the adventures of Britt Montero, a 
Cuban-American reporter on a Miami daily. 
</P>
<P>
 A candidate for governor was an undisclosed suspect in a very old unsolved 
child murder. An old cop who specialized in unsolved crimes, and was a crime 
beat mentor to Montero, has been put out to pasture. A serial killer whose MO 
is flavored with Santeria, the voodoo-like reinterpretation of Catholicism, is 
on the loose and dubbed the Downtown Rapist, imperiling Montero in a taut 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as in the work of such other Miami novelists as John Katzenbach, Carl 
Hiaasen and Paul Levine, the city itself -- in all its steamy and violent 
contradictions of wealth, race and nationality -- is itself a character. No 
one, I think, evokes it better than Buchanan. And no one catches any better the 
atmosphere of a metropolitan newspaper's city room, with all its steamy 
contradictions (including a nasty, competitive woman boss). 
</P>
<P>
 Her book is notably active, suspenseful, rife with the unexpected, and above 
all rich in texture. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a fine month for the yarn-spinners, in fact. Sam Llewellyn is another of 
them, his novels frequently involving the sea and sailing. CLAWHAMMER (Pocket 
Books: $20, 373 pp.) is more land-centered than most, but also one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
 His protagonist, George Devis, explorer, sailor, ornithologist ("Best Guide to 
British Birds") is in Ethiopia visiting his sister and her country-singing 
husband, who've abandoned the bright lights to help a Third World village. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister and husband are murdered, apparently by a local warlord, but the 
reverberations follow Devis to England and then the United States. The 
curiosities include an urn of radioactive flour and a tape-recording giving the 
details of a plot the singer was investigating. An international press tycoon 
and several members of a severe sect called Christ's Brethren further enliven 
the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Devis does take refuge on a boat off the New England coast, but finds as 
always that there are no safe harbors anywhere. Llewellyn invents and describes 
action very well indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another lawyer has joined the ranks of novelists. Michael C. Eberhardt, a 
criminal defense attorney who lives in Lancaster, Calif., has written BODY OF A 
CRIME (Dutton: $19.95, 364 pp.) inspired by a murder trial in which no body had 
been found. (The defendant Eberhardt represented was acquitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 Eberhardt has concocted an elaborate no-body scenario -- a heiress missing and 
presumed dead, a professional athlete indicted. She's found alive and in 
hiding, but then murdered, the athlete remaining the prime suspect. The defense 
attorney, Sean Barrett, sets out to find the truth and does, not without 
strenuous difficulties. The courtroom finale is worthy of Perry Mason, with a 
twist that Mason might or might not have approved. It's a lively first effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another California lawyer breaking into print is Blair Hoffman. He is a 
former deputy attorney general now a staff attorney for the state Supreme Court 
in San Francisco. The setting for MURDER FOR THE PROSECUTION (Carroll & Graf: 
$18.95, 220 pp.) is the attorney general's office (write about what you know; 
always good advice), where one of the deputies, set to argue a death penalty 
case, is gunned down in her office by a tagged weapon from the evidence locker, 
thus suggesting it was an inside job. 
</P>
<P>
 More deaths follow and the office appears to be a wormy nest of jealousies and 
concealments. Hoffman's prose is on the stiff side, and his characters tend to 
sound alike, but these are start-up problems and his confident command of the 
scene and his plotting suggest that he has promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lyon's FALSE PRETENSES (Mysterious Press: $18.95, 233 pp.) is like an 
amalgam of all the Southern California private eye stories that ever were. His 
Jacob Asch is your not very successful investigator, always a sucker for 
justice, a blonde/redhead/brunette with a lament, or any gent with a retainer 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He trots off on a wild goose chase with the latter and returns to find a fresh 
corpse in his office, followed all too soon by two nasty detectives in the 
Raymond Chandler-Ross MacDonald tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Kijewski, sometime English teacher and bartender, won a best first 
private-eye novel competition with "Katwalk" in 1989. It featured a woman 
investigator named Kat Colorado, who returns for the fifth time in WILD KAT 
(Doubleday: $19.95, 309 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 Chapters are prefaced by amusing questions and answers from a lovelorn column 
written by a pal of Kat's, and vaguely related to the story, a nice touch. Kat 
herself is one of the toughest and toughest-talking of the new breed of female 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski is as tough-minded and just as resilient in a 
physical crisis, but retains a roundness and a depth of feeling that Kat seems 
to be losing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Colorado is one of Kijewski's most elaborate. A woman about to blow 
the whistle on a manufacturer of defective heart valves is murdered, setting 
off a lethal chain of events and an all-points pursuit of Kat by agents (mostly 
dimwitted) of the bad person or persons. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of violence and the culprits are successively revealed as in a 
set of nesting Russian dolls. But the suspicion arises that Kijewski might 
profit from a new protagonist. Kat's snarling tongue has grown to be not so 
much unattractive as unpersuasive. A kind of creative weariness overhangs the 
book, despite some good minor characterizations and moments when compassion 
threatens to break out.

THREE ON THE TOWN: A CLUNKER MENTALITY; TIME TO BREAK DOWN AND REPLACE A FINE 
FOUR-WHEELED FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old carcass, with mileage piling up like the national debt, begins to 
falter. The steering jitters. The lights flutter. If the bird doo can be 
cleaned up at all, paint comes off with it. And the only way to stop the 
windshield wipers is to sling one end of a rubber band around the wiper control 
and the other end around the flasher button. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time like this, what do you say to yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 A) I want to buy a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 B) I have to buy a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 My answer is B. Give me a tattoo. A root canal. But please don't make me buy a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends are astonished when I confess this; buying a car is something I'm 
supposed to rejoice in, a happy rite of passage, like getting married or moving 
into a new home. But for someone who finds a new hairstyle unsettling, new-car 
trauma can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 My present car dates to the first Reagan Administration. It is acclimated; it 
is fearless. In this car-mad city, it is so chewed up, so down-market that its 
message is: "I'm above all this." It's Jerry Brown's Plymouth in a Beamer 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside are traces of spilled coffee and that faint, ineradicable whiff of 
scared, carsick dogs on their way to the vet. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside has been thoroughly bulletproofed. The taillight covers have been 
cracked by runaway shopping carts. The hatchback is bent from heroic service, 
hauling a whole fence's worth of lumber or an Edwardian mahogany sideboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors are thoroughly banged and pranged -- nothing really ugly, merely 
chipped and worn in the line of duty. So I can park next to any behemoth that 
has decided to ignore the word COMPACT painted on the concrete below. 
</P>
<P>
 Mine is a leper-mobile on freeways full of pretty cars. Their drivers give me 
wide, terrified berth. Valets pretend they don't see me and must be summoned 
with the wave of a greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't have air conditioning or tinted glass or power anything. No one 
seems to want to steal it. Yet I have been reluctant to give up the liberation 
from worry for a car that may turn me into one of those fussy, flinching, 
fretting owners who install rude alarms, glower at adjacent parkers and stand 
at the carwash, pointing out motes of dirt to the poor man with the cleaning 
rag. Can I bear to go through it again -- the inevitable dread of that first 
ding, when a brand-new car loses its virginity, that first step down the 
slippery slope to jalopy-hood? 
</P>
<P>
 Once I was resigned to the change, I studied. I refused to be one of the 
seduced who walks into a showroom in ignorant bedazzlement and drives home in a 
red two-door convertible. Car facts filled my head like that annoying 
Disneyland tune "It's a Small World (After All)." I compared torque and braking 
distances. I knew city and freeway MPGs, model by model, automatic vs. stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "You," said a friend whose son sold cars for a time, "are what they call in 
the trade a propeller-head." But what was the first question that every single 
car salesman asked when I went in for a test drive? "Do you know what color you 
want?" (Why don't they learn to ask some gender-neutral questions, like "What 
kind of car do you have now?" or "Where did you hear about our cars?") 
</P>
<P>
 Oh gosh, I would say, smiling. "I really don't know about that. But what I 
would like to know is how the multi-link suspension system compares to the 
double wishbone . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually the only thing I learned from the salesroom boys was that they are 
about the only people left who actually write thank-you notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks into this project, I'm still agonizing. A sofa on radials? A 
four-wheel-drive quake-escape vehicle? It may come down to the car that fits in 
my abnormally small garage. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least now I know what color I want.

PALM LATITUDES: URBAN ART; PICTURE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't see it," the thirtysomething man in the crew-neck mutters, staring at 
the drawing on the Long Beach gallery wall. "Look harder, deeper , " his friend 
implores. "You get it?" Apparently not; the man shakes his head in disgust and 
walks away, stopping briefly to admire a David Hockney print. Sure, this is 
modern art, too, but at least it doesn't force you to question your very 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-generated "holusions" are cropping up at malls and galleries all over 
the country. They've become a litmus test for the mall-rat pack -- a challenge 
of perception or artistic depth or color coordination or something.  
</P>
<P>
 The holusion prints were created in 1992 by Texas-based NVision Grafix, which 
says it has sold 500,000 prints worldwide, most going for about $45. Each one 
starts with a three-dimensional scene -- a leaping dolphin, as above, for 
instance, or an F-117 Stealth fighter -- which is then masked in a sea of 16 
million computer-generated dots. 
</P>
<P>
 It's left to the insightful eye to rediscover the picture within the picture. 
Relax, pretend you're falling asleep at the wheel, someone urges. No, 
concentrate harder. Don't focus -- cross your eyes and soak it in. Stare at a 
single spot -- don't blink! Watch the reflection from your watch. Don't wear a 
white shirt; it'll screw up the reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be just as complicated as it sounds. Just ask Robyn DeJesus, 14, whose 
dad is holding her firmly in his grip in front of a dinosaur print at an area Z 
Gallerie, urging her on. No matter what she tries, a wall of daunting dots and 
meaningless squiggly lines stares back; it just isn't there. "He kept saying, 
'It's neat, it's neat,' so I wanted to see it," she says, "but it's just really 
frustrating." 
</P>

anything there," she declares. "Everyone here's on drugs." Eric Lichtblau

SMALL LIVES UNDER SIEGE; DOLLY, BY ANITA BROOKNER (RANDOM HOUSE: $22; 256 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Heeger, Heeger is a frequent contributer to the Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compared to the action-packed, plot-driven competition, Anita Brookner's 
novels are pokey sleepers. They don't hinge on big events. Their characters 
aren't terribly heroic. Their stories are largely vehicles for an examination 
of human longing and connection. But Brookner's portraits of small lives under 
siege have a way of lingering in your mind long after the plot-twisters are 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is certainly true of "Dolly," her latest novel, which unfolds in the 
leisurely tone of a reminiscence -- one family member musing about another: "I 
thought of her as the aunt rather than as my aunt," recalls the narrator, Jane 
Manning, "for anything more intimate would have implied appropriation, or 
attachment. Attachment came later, in a form that was wistful, almost painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly blows onto the Manning family stage with all the power of a hurricane. 
She's not a person so much as an electric charge, and her young niece wisely 
decides to get out of her way. The alternative, which Jane's eager mother Etty 
chooses, is to cater to Dolly -- and be flattened. 
</P>
<P>
 "You live in the middle of nowhere," Dolly complains during a teatime visit to 
the Mannings with her husband, Etty's brother. She fidgets and checks her 
watch, refusing to taste the delicacies served in her honor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is then that Jane, noting her aunt's stylish, scented fur, "carnivorous" 
teeth and impatience to leave for somewhere more exciting, feels her "first 
misgivings about the impermeability" of her parents' world. In Dolly's view, 
only those as passionate and pleasure-hungry as herself are worth knowing, and 
the stodgy Mannings don't cut it. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she never lingers with them long (though they are handy for 
cadging money), but the book's pervaded by her presence. Volatile, unbearable, 
charming, she is the focus of Jane's narrative, the vehicle for the larger 
study of a family's history. World conflict, poverty, restless, unhappy women, 
deserting husbands, pampered siblings: the Mannings' destinies were forged by 
these in varying combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane, whose parents' domestic peace bloomed in response to their contentious 
childhoods, grows up amid sweetness, contentment and respect. Dolly, whom war 
and want robbed of opportunity and affection, hungers for power, position and 
love, none of which she ever hangs onto long. 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of Dolly and Jane dramatize one of the novel's central questions: 
Which is more desirable, a stable, albeit timid existence rooted in the 
predictable, or a life of longing and potential passion? 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner--whose earlier novel "Hotel du Lac" won Britain's coveted Booker 
Prize--has visited this territory before. What makes "Dolly" so absorbing is 
its evolutionary quality, the march of years that deepens Jane's understanding 
and gives her life dimension while reducing Dolly to childlike dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 When they meet, Dolly's at the top of her form, or just past it, and Jane, the 
unformed child, is very much in awe of her. As time passes, Jane develops- 
-acquiring money, a career, a life--while Dolly's powers diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent her youth pursuing male attention, she can't sustain it as she 
ages. Her last affair ends badly. When her boyfriend, the sly, rather coarse 
owner of a limo service, dumps her, her spark dies. She loses the "rapturous 
pleading for pleasure, which so appealed to men" and becomes just another 
gray-haired English woman in flat shoes and a cloth coat, her face pale with 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jane, Dolly's transformation embodies the fate of a generation of women 
who depended on men for their sense of self. Still, it isn't feminism or female 
solidarity that finally forges a kinship between the two. They are, after all, 
the only family either has--the survivors, Dolly and the woman she at last 
deigns to call "my niece." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pleasures of Brookner's novels is their ability to reel you in, not 
in anticipation of the next event but with the allure of living characters. 
Even peripheral people are accorded her minute attention. Hugo, Dolly's 
somewhat dissolute but dashing husband, is described as "adept at putting a 
woman at her ease with the sort of flattering badinage which means very 
little... If he had lived," Jane reports, "I would have pictured him at the 
bridge table, a cigarette smouldering in a glass ashtray at his left hand, his 
eyes watering with the smoke...the amiable smile still on his lips." 
</P>
<P>
 Her own father, by contrast, she characterizes as slim and taciturn, a man of 
real courtesy and calm whose face "softened when he looked at my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mannings' relationship, in fact, is one of the delights of "Dolly," as is 
the child's-eye view of grown-up life that comes to us via Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 As a narrator, Jane's a mixed blessing. Keen and quick in her observations of 
others, she's a lot slower with herself, as when she fails to explain her 
passive, silent suffering at Dolly's hands after her parents die. At times her 
reticence about her own feelings makes her appear terminally wan, almost 
characterless. She prompts the desire familiar to the veteran Brookner reader 
to throttle her until her eyes pop while screaming, "Do something! Defend 
yourself!" 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, "Dolly" is an interesting, compelling read that 
takes us deep into the territory of the heart, with all its rocky roads and 
shimmering possibilities.

A DOSE OF PEYOTE; BLUEFEATHER FELLINI, BY MAX EVANS (UNIVERSITY PRESS OF 
COLORADO: $19.95; 333 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Moulson, Peter Moulson is a writer and publisher who lives in 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Max Evans has received mixed critical acclaim for his many published works. 
His classic Western "The Rounders" was made into a movie starring Henry Fonda 
and Glenn Ford. A southwestern native and Albuquerque resident, he has recently 
been awarded the New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' latest is certainly a novel of broader scope, with developed literary 
devices and fuller characterization than in the past, yet it is still popular 
and light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bluefeather Fellini" breaks out of the Western formula somewhat by expanding 
the horizon to the Second World War battlefields of Europe. There is the usual 
cast of crusty prospectors, stereotyped baddies and beautiful women who help 
the hero along until they are either melodramatically bumped off, or 
regretfully dumped because they couldn't match up to his need for perfection. 
Hard-working, honest New Mexican farmers and a selection of officers and 
privates make up the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel's hero, Bluefeather Fellini, is half Taos Indian and half Italian, 
born in the northern New Mexico-southern Colorado area where most of the action 
takes place. The fact that Fellini is part Native American makes him subject to 
the racism of some locals. Fortunately he is protected by a rambunctious 
Guiding Spirit, akin to the magic-realism characters of Latin American and 
Chicano fiction. His Native American heritage -- the significance of which the 
narrator never misses an opportunity to remind us of -- also enables him to be 
very strong and wise, and apparently supernaturally handsome and attractive to 
women. Despite his rudimentary formal education, Bluefeather has picked up a 
taste for Balzac and Dostoevsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained at the hand of a foul-mouthed prospector, Bluefeather learns about 
mining and about a secret cache of gold. This creates a dilemma for the young 
man, as his Native American mother believed that "it was unnatural to scar the 
earth's beauty for wealth -- wealth that always vanished in the end." His 
affinity for peace and for things natural, though, are balanced by the fighting 
skills that his Italian father taught him. It is the lure of gold -- "the 
aphrodisiac of power and greed" -- that wins out as he pursues "his peculiar 
and particular madness with the earth-blessed rocks." Always with an eye on 
raising the capital necessary to track down the reputed mother lode, 
Bluefeather Fellini moves from town to town, learning more about the 
prospecting business, and picking up gambling and fighting skills that will 
help him out in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The southwestern landscape through which he travels is described in loving 
detail, as is the life of Taos' famous art colony of the 1930s and '40s; Mabel 
Dodge Luhan and various artists of the period make their appearances at a 
cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
 Bluefeather's women are irritating, vacillating between the roles of sex 
goddesses and Joan of Arc, falling deeply in love with Blue, then tragically 
exiting the scene. The female characters are superficial vehicles who seem to 
be there solely to provide some titillation, and to show off Bluefeather's 
clearly entrancing sexual prowess and compare it to the dramatic landscape in 
which he moves. "I love that damned woman as much as I can, but I love that 
mountain there, too," he complains.Just when a scene gets tender the narrative 
comes to an embarrassing, grinding halt. "They loved. Later she slept. After a 
short time, Bluefeather got up and stepped away, as quietly as the Indian he 
was, into the timber." It is long-standing cliches such as this that have given 
contemporary Santa Fe its current veneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Elements of classic farce support the storyline, and help to balance the 
creaking coincidences of tragedy that are always stalking Bluefeather. Max 
Evans' homage to the late filmmaker Federico Fellini's sense of the ridiculous 
in human nature is clear throughout, especially in the scene of Blue's swift 
and entertaining revenge as he laces the coffee of a band of murderous thieves 
with an overdose of peyote. The almost magical characters of Dr. Merphyn 
Godchuck and his remarkably young-looking aunt Tulip Everhaven are well drawn 
and heartily funny. 
</P>
<P>
 As war spreads across Europe, Bluefeather joins the infantry and is there at 
the D-Day landing in Normandy. He fights his way inland -- here the scenes are 
harrowing and terrifyingly realistic -- through the shrapnel and body parts of 
horrific trench warfare. It is a matured Bluefeather who returns to New Mexico, 
where gold appears to be less of a draw for him than in his early days. Losing 
most of his money bankrolling a herbal remedy scam, Bluefeather appears to lean 
toward his mother's view of the important things of life as created by the 
Great Spirit, until lust and dreams of wealth once again cloud his vision, and 
his innate direction seems lost -- suggesting another series of adventures in a 
follow-up novel.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: BULLIES, BASEBALL CAPS AND BLACK HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE CURLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Everybody knows on any given day you can read in the newspaper about how 
wretched and gross we are, or hear lectures at fine universities about how 
wretched and gross we are, or read books of social criticism about how wretched 
and gross we are," says Bruce Brooks in the preface to Boys Will Be (Henry 
Holt, $14.95; ages 11 and up). "This book," the author adds, "is a rare chance 
for boys to read about themselves without being cursed or slammed down. A 
chance for a few pages, for boys to unfasten the load of society's 
self-righteous anger." 
</P>
<P>
 A noble endeavor, and so rare! In this collection of 12 brief and humorous 
essays, Brooks -- author of the award-winning young adult novel "The Moves Make 
the Man" -- does boys a real service. A savvy English teacher, for example, 
might pick up this book and use one or two of the essays to provoke a more 
pertinent discussion than one on, say, George Eliot's "Silas Marner." 
</P>
<P>
 My favorites for lively and relevant roundtable material would be "Bullies" 
(what they are and what you can legally do with them), "Caps" (why headgear is 
as necessary to an American boy's life as are comics, video games and oversized 
pants), "Ten Things You Cannot Expect Your Mother to Understand" 
(self-explanatory, and could easily be expanded to a book of its own), or 
"Arthur Ashe" (a moving tribute to the late tennis star). These make great 
reading even for people who aren't boys, but who might like to know a little 
better what the mysterious lives of young males of the species are like. 
</P>

 Each year many fine books appear that are appropriate choices for Black 
History Month. Among this year's best is Joyce Hansen's exciting and readable 
novel, The Captive (Scholastic, $13.95; ages 10 and up). Based on history, the 
story concerns the young son of an Ashanti chief who is sold into slavery in 
America but amazingly finds his way back to Africa. The same author wrote the 
Coretta Scott King award-winner "Which Way Freedom?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Board books" -- those chunky items with pages made of heavy duty, washable 
cardboard -- are always in great demand, but those with African-American 
characters have been hard to come by. Particularly welcome, then, is the 
handsomely designed series Good Morning, Getting Dressed, Let's Pretend and 
Good Night, by Dessie Moore, illustrated by Chevelle Moore (HarperFestival, 
$5.95 each; ages 9 mos.-3 yrs.), about what toddlers do all day. Sweet Baby 
Coming and The Baby, by, respectively, Eloise and Monica Greenfield, 
illustrated by Jan Spivey Gilchrist (HarperFestival, $$4.95 each; ages 9 mos.-3 
years) are aimed at toddlers awaiting -- though not necessarily eagerly -- new 
siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki Giovanni's loving poem of nostalgic praise to her hometown is brought to 
life beautifully in the picturebook Knoxville, Tennessee, illustrated by Larry 
Johnson (Scholastic, $14.95; ages 2-6). For older readers, more of her work can 
be found in Ego-Tripping and Other Poems for Young People (Lawrence Hill / 
Chicago Review Press, $14.95 hardcover, $9.95 paperback), an expanded edition 
of her original 1974 collection. Some of poet Langston Hughes' best work is 
included in The Dream Keeper and Other Poems (Knopf, $12.95; all ages), along 
with Jerry Pinkney's black and white illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's another moving tribute to Arthur Ashe, Daddy and Me (Random 
House, $13). Written by and illustrated with the photographs of Ashe's widow 
Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, the book shows the sports pro at home and at play with 
the couple's six-year-old daughter Camera. Written before Ashe died of AIDS 
last fall, it does not deal with his passing, but neither does it skirt his 
illness, which is handled with just the right mixture of honesty and tact. A 
difficult and important subject is given its due here. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Note: Many fantasy-adventure readers aged 10 through the teens will 
rejoice at the news of the sixth installment in British author Brian Jacques' 
award-winning Redwall series: Martin the Warrior (Philomel, $17.95) . . Adriane 
G. Berg, a radio talk-show host and financial advisor, and Arthur Berg Buchner, 
her 11-year-old son, put their heads together to co-author a savvy guide to 
young people's finances, The Totally Awesome Money Book for Kids and Their 
Parents (Newmarket Press, 10.95 paperback, $18.95 hardcover) . . . There are 
two great new books to mark the beginning of the "Year of the Dog": Red Eggs 
and Dragon Boats: Celebrating Chinese Festivals (Pacific View Press, $16.95; 
ages 4-9), in which talented author/illustrator Carol Stepanchuk includes a 
recipe for "Dragon Boat Dumplings," and Jama Kim Rattigan's Dumpling Soup, 
illustrated by Lillian Hsu-Flanders (Little, Brown, $15.95; ages 3-8).

 The winners of the 1994 Newbery and Caldecott Medal winners were announced at 
the American Library Assn. meeting in Los Angeles last week. Lois Lowry's "The 
Giver" received the Newbery for literature; Allen Say's "Grandfather's Journey" 
received the Caldecott, given to honor a picture book.

BONFIRE OF THE MODESTIES; ON FIRE: A PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF LIFE AND DEATH AND 
CHOICES, BY LARRY BROWN (ALGONQUIN BOOKS OF CHAPEL HILL: $17.95; 182 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Swindle, Michael Swindle, a New Orleans-based free-lance writer, 
grew up in Mississippi. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you ever steam-cleaned a hog? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither have I, but Larry Brown has -- with his friend Louie, and the steam 
cleaner at Louie's father-in-law's "combination wrecker yard/auto repair/used 
furniture store," where you can also buy fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 This experimental method for the removal of porcine hair proved to be a 
success, but you'll have to go to "On Fire" for the rest of the story on the 
firemen's cookout at Sardis Lake, which shows that the best laid pits don't 
always offer up the barbecue one had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown joined the Oxford, Mississippi, Fire Department when he was 22 years 
old, figuring he would spend the next 30 years fighting fires. He didn't make 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Half-way through his 16-year stint as a fireman, he decided to become a writer 
-- "an improbable, foolish-sounding thing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the publication of "Facing the Music" in 1988, however, it was obvious 
that firefighting's loss was the literary world's gain. His first book was (and 
remains) a brilliant collection of short stories about hard-luck characters in 
rural Mississippi that are hilarious, grim and cut-to-the-bone poignant, often 
all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five years, he published "Big Bad Love," another short story 
collection, and two novels. The first, "Dirty Work," was the haunting story of 
two Vietnam veterans, one black with no arms or legs, the other white with no 
face, whose lives become intertwined over the course of one night in a V.A. 
hospital. "Joe" wasa coming-of-age story about a young 
</P>
<P>
 boy from an extremely poor white trash family and the rounder he patterns his 
steep climb into manhood after, in which Brown made his deepest bow (some say a 
little too deep) to that other, unavoidable, literary Oxfordian, William 
Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Fire" is Brown's first foray into non-fiction. The book is a meditation on 
not only his years with the Oxford Fire Department, but also on being a husband 
and father, his struggle to become a writer and the changes that brought to his 
life, life in the rural Mississippi country he was born to, and finally life 
its own self. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that being a firefighter meant a great deal to Brown. "I love to 
go down on the floor and see the smoke over me," he writes, "worm my way 
forward to the fire, the hose hard as a brick, the scuffed rubber on the end of 
the fog nozzle. I love the two-and-a-half-inch hoses and the big chrome nozzles 
that no one man can hold, the red axes and the pry bars and the pike poles that 
we tear down ceilings with, looking for devious pockets of fire, sneaky little 
bastards that will smolder and rekindle the house after we're back at the fire 
station asleep in our beds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His respect for the power of fire is shown when he describes it as "almost 
like water the way it flows, every board and nailhead in the room consumed and 
living in bright orange fire." 
</P>
<P>
 While he can joke about the job, saying that most days a fireman's biggest 
worry is what to eat and what to watch on HBO -- "We prefer S and V (sex and 
violence), but we'll go with a nature show on The Discovery Channel if that's 
all that's flowing." -- he can also take us into the darker side of the 
profession: "Sometimes there was a weird callousness about the work we did. We 
couldn't let it get too close to use because we didn't want to be touched by 
it. We didn't talk much about the bad ones. When they happened, we dealt with 
them. Then we went back and ate or watched a movie or went on another call, or 
washed the trucks and polished the chrome. We got through our shifts and then 
we went home and went fishing or hunting or made love to our wives or played 
with our children. We hoped the bad things we saw would never claim us. We 
hoped we wouldn't die in smoke and flames or torn steel like the people we 
couldn't save." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was surely not your average fireman, as evidenced when he is waiting, 
with a woman trapped in a wrecked truck, for the Hurst Tool, the Jaws of Life, 
to arrived and free her from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lit a cigarette and she asked me for one. She wanted to know if it was 
dangerous to smoke under there. I told her that diesel fuel had a low flash 
point. I stayed under there and we smoked a cigarette apiece." 
</P>
<P>
 No Southern storyteller worth his salt, however, would tell one story straight 
through without digressions, and Brown is true to the breed. Interspersed in 
his musings on his days as a firefighter are random thoughts on dogs (the book 
is dedicated to his favorite dog, Sam) and deer hunting, a very funny story 
about a fight he had with a mouse, an equally hilarious chapter on his 
ill-fated entry into the rabbit raising business ("from which I never fully 
recover"), and of course, some thoughts on the hill country of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faulkner was right," he says. "He said the land would accomplish its own 
revenge on the people. I just wish it hadn't happened in my time. I saw what 
those woods were like. I walked in them, along their creeks, among the giant 
beeches riddled with squirrel dens. That's what this whole country used to be, 
what wasn't farmed. Big woods. Now the whole state's a pine tree. And the bugs 
are eating them. It's bad to hate something like that and not be able to do 
anything about it except recycle your paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing, Brown declares, was a curveball he never saw coming, but "On Fire," 
though more quiet, more contemplative and less raucous than his best fiction, 
shows that he wasn't afraid of that curveball. He stayed in the batter's box, 
kept his shoulder down and his head forward. He swung, and he connected.

WRITERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The correspondence between two hard-talkin' pals can cover a lot of turf. 
Imagine if Thelma and Louise had been avid letter-writers. 
</P>
<P>
 The poetic letters in "Calamity and Belle: Cowgirl Correspondence by Calamity 
Wronsky and Belle Bendall, illustrated by Bill Schenck (Gibbs Smith: $17.95; 50 
pp.) are honest, funny and sad; they are also always simple, always smart. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true cowgirl grit: the sensibility is so female it's, well, macho 
(macha?). "Life's a Bitch! Naw, she's a cowgirl . . . and ain't she got the 
spurs and brandin' irons to prove it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Female bonding, a girl knows, can be intoxicating, whether she's too young to 
drive or old enough, like Calamity, to be "looking more like Loretta Lynn every 
day . . . how humiliatin'. All the Oil of Olay in the world can't stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy of women dishing their men is intense (at times too intense to 
quote here). And Calamity and Belle do go back and forth (" . . . you said, 
'Who's that buzzard-eatin' fool?' But I know you liked him."). 
</P>
<P>
 They also share a perception that real women don't eat sentiment. Calamity 
writes Belle: "Dontcha hate the way people get all sappy when someone they 
didn't even know dies, like they haven't seen that skeleton face grinning 
underneath the surface of their own skin every time they looked in the mirror 
since they were about twenty-seven?") 
</P>
<P>
 This little book is plain ol' fun -- the colorful, comics-like illustrations 
are as vivid as the prose. The book is studded with interactive "mementos" such 
as a Pony Express telegram from Grandma Belle, and a copy of Calamity's vote 
for the fat Elvis postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a whole lot more. It's a valentine to a girl's best friend (and we're 
not talkin' diamonds, babe). Girlsfriends 4-Ever. Yeeee-Haaaa!!!  
</P>
<P>
 -- Danielle Roter 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it's a kind of epistolary verse novel with two authors."

 THE SAME RIVER TWICE by Chris Offutt (Penguin: $9.95; 188 pp.). Chris Offutt's 
descriptions of himself as a young man sometimes echo Conlon's.He grew up in 
the Kentucky Appalachians, determined to be writer, but unsure of himself. His 
gritty memoir presents a classic account of an aspiring writer's struggle to 
find his voice. Offutt hitch-hiked around the United States, taking whatever 
jobs he could find, until he realized, "My youth was behind me, not misspent 
exactly, but squandered to a certain extent. While the rest of my generation 
had been lodging themselves into careers, I'd pretty much run amok." Love and 
his commitment to his vocation as a writer saved him from prison or a homeless 
shelter: His understated journal suggests a conversation held late at night in 
a remote campsite.

 IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER by Gerry Conlon (Plume: $9.95; 234 pp.). Gerry 
Conlon's bitter memoir served as the basis for the current Daniel 
Day-Lewis-Emma Thompson film.Conlon was by no means an admirable or even 
likable character: He grew up in dire poverty in West Belfast to become a 
small-time burglar, a drunk and a gambler, with no ambition beyond getting the 
cash for his next pint or bet. At 20, he was picked up by the British police on 
suspicion of helping the Irish Republican Army bomb a Guildford pub. Conlon and 
three friends, who became known as the "Guildford Four," spent 15 years in 
prison for crimes they hadn't committed, and which the prosecutors knew they 
hadn't committed. He presents a chilling account of torture, abuse, 
falsification of evidence and obstruction of justice by the British police, 
judiciary and prison officials. The international outcry produced by this 
scandalous miscarriage of justice eventually lead to Conlon's vindication. "In 
the Name of the Father" offers provocative reading as negotiations over the 
future of Ireland continue, and American legislators call for limits on appeals 
as a way of streamlining the judiciary system.

 FIRST HORSES: Stories of the New West by Franklin Gish (University of Nevada 
Press: $10.95; 134 pp., paperback original). Gish's short stories are set in 
the contemporary Southwest, where Native American, Latino and European cultures 
cross-pollinate, despite efforts to preserve an illusory ethnic purity. His 
characters are the products of these multiple influences. The narrator of "Blue 
Danube Waltz," a promising guitar student, discovers his identity while trying 
to learn the old Strauss warhorse: "What I felt was the spirit of the great 
river, the mighty Rio Grande, the water of my birthplace. . . . I felt joy in 
realizing what I really felt -- my river, my soul. . . ."

 A DAY IN THE NIGHT OF AMERICA by Kevin Coyne (Henry Holt: $14.95; 316 pp.) . 
An estimated 10 million Americans ("a number equal to the combined populations 
of Ireland, Israel and Nicaragua") work at night. Coyne wandered from Boston to 
Alaska, watching and asking questions. He talked to people making doughnuts, 
cleaning offices, trading international currency, fishing for herring and 
patrolling the streets. His observations of this nocturnal world are 
interesting, but his writing lacks the flair needed to make the mundane seem 
extraordinary.

 TRAINS OF DISCOVERY: Western Railroads and the National Parks by Alfred Runte 
(Roberts Rinehart Publishers: $19.95; 116 pp., paperback original). Runte 
explores the link between rail travel and the growth of the U.S. National Parks 
system in this handsome history.During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
the railroads made the first parks available to large numbers of people. 
Competition for riders led the railroad owners to lobby for the expansion of 
the parks system, and they commissioned some of the most beautiful commercial 
art of the century to attract passengers. Although rail travel is considered 
passe in America, Runte notes that carriers have reinstituted passenger service 
to some parks, including the Anchorage-Fairbanks line that offers luxury trips 
to Denali National Park.

 EARTHQUAKE PREPARED: Securing Your Home, Protecting Your Family by Joel Leach 
(Studio 4 Productions, P.O. Box 465, Northridge, Calif. 91328: $8.95, plus 
$2.24 postage & handling; 63 pp., illustrated, paperback original). It's not 
too late to prepare for the inevitable Next One, and Leach provides clear, 
easy-to-follow instructions and diagrams on how to secure furniture, appliances 
and bric-a-brac. (He even includes a diagram of the gas valve that's invariably 
mentioned in earthquake safety literature.) One problem he fails to address: 
How to fit all the stuff an emergency kit is supposed to contain in the average 
car.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: SONY TO UNIVERSAL: 23 
OSCARS SKIDDOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And now for the bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar nominations had barely been tallied last Wednesday when Universal 
Pictures boasted that, with such best-picture nominees as "Schindler's List" 
and "In the Name of the Father," it had garnered 23 nominations overall -- the 
best in studio history and, perhaps, the best in Hollywood history as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia Pictures, with various nominations for "The Remains of the Day" and 
"The Age of Innocence," among other films, was still a distant second with 18 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't take long for corporate pride to take over. Columbia's parent 
firm, Sony Pictures Entertainment, soon weighed in with its own tally. Sony: 31 
nominations. Universal: 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony quickly got the word out to the press that three studios under its 
corporate umbrella had done a sterling job in the Oscar race. In addition to 
Columbia's 18 nominations, TriStar Pictures (led by "Philadelphia" and 
"Cliffhanger") garnered 10 and Sony Pictures Classics ("Orlando") had another 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal may well have achieved the best performance by a single 
distribution company in history, but Sony Pictures Entertainment achieved the 
best performance this year by any corporation," said a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Quicker than one could say "Jurassic Park," the howls of protest could be 
heard all the way to Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Universal considered itself Wednesday's true studio winner, a 
spokesman for Universal replied: "Absolutely! And so does everyone else in 
Hollywood who doesn't work for Sony." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some Universal insiders were hopping mad. Sony's contention that it 
had the most nominations was a "highly disingenuous, mean-spirited and petty 
way at looking at the world," said one executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pollock, Universal's movie chief, said that the last time he checked, the 
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences gave Oscars to studios -- not 
multinational corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They list all the pictures by studio," Pollock said. "They don't list any 
picture by Sony. . . . Corporate officials don't greenlight any (picture), nor 
does the academy look to who owns movies. They look to who produces it and what 
the production entity is. Maybe John Malone, who has pay-cable rights to all 
those (Sony) movies (that were nominated), should be proud." 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the controversy is the manner in which Sony is set up. Under 
its corporate banner, SPE has separate distribution arms in place at Columbia, 
TriStar, Sony Pictures Classics and Triumph Releasing Corp. Universal, by 
contrast, does the marketing and distribution for its movies. Disney, as 
another example, has Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney 
Pictures, but releases their product all through one entity called Buena Vista 
Distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Sony has complained that if the yearly box-office totals from all 
of its studios were counted as one, it would win the battle for market share 
against such giants as Disney and Warner Bros. But the rival studios have 
argued that Sony is a corporation, not a distribution company, and each must be 
judged separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony executives argue that since Sony Pictures Entertainment provides the 
capital for all its films, the corporation should reap the rewards when its 
films win Oscar nominations and reap the consequences when they flop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess that in time you will increasingly see Miramax's numbers folded 
into Disney's numbers," said a Sony spokesman. "They already had three 
stand-alone companies but, to use their argument, they have a single 
distribution pipeline."

<P>
 But unlike the three Disney labels (which as previously stated are distributed 
through Buena Vista), Disney-owned Miramax handles its own marketing and 
distribution, so only fairly it should be treated separately like Columbia and 
TriStar.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: LINKAGE; PAUL HOGAN 
BETTING A BUNDLE THAT 'LIGHTNING JACK' WILL STRIKE GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's as if Paul Hogan took his cue from Crocodile Dundee: When the Hollywood 
chips are down, turn to a little Aussie ingenuity to get a movie made. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hogan has done just that. Capitalizing on his immense popularity from his 
"Crocodile Dundee" films, Hogan went to the public markets Down Under and in 
the United States and put his latest movie, "Lightning Jack," on the stock 
exchanges to raise enough money to cover production costs -- about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy, which Hogan stars in and wrote, is his first screen appearance 
since Paramount's box-office stinker "Almost an Angel" four years ago. After 
being a hot commodity in the States when riding the crest of his hit "Dundee" 
films in the mid-'80s, Hogan says he retreated to the Outback after "Angel" 
flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 He joked that he took a reprieve from Hollywood because he didn't want to wear 
out his welcome. But the droll Hogan was really piecing together a story about 
an Australian named Jack, who joins up with a Civil War era gang in the States 
that gets obliterated when its members try to hold up a town bank. Only Jack, 
played by Hogan, escapes with the help of a young mute played in the film by 
Cuba Gooding Jr. ("Boyz N the Hood"), who insists on hanging with Jack despite 
Jack's attempts to get rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course there is a love interest, the saloon gal played by Beverly D'Angelo, 
and a cameo role by Roger Daltrey. Simon Wincer ("Free Willy," "Lonesome Dove") 
directs. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the film be a hit when it's released in North America on March 11 and 
in Australia on March 31, Hogan's Aussie ingenuity in raising the financing 
could be the way independent filmmakers get movies made in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising $25 million on the two stock exchanges, Hogan got the 
remainder of the budget from fees and guarantees from Savoy Pictures, which 
will distribute the picture domestically, and Disney's Buena Vista 
International, which will release the picture worldwide except for the 
Australian territories (Australia and New Zealand). 
</P>
<P>
 While he was developing his project, Hogan went to the States to try to grease 
the studios' palms. But he was rebuffed by all after he refused to relinquish 
creative control. "Yeah, Paramount said, 'Get out.' They told me 'Lightning 
Jack' 'wasn't funny.' They said, ' "Coneheads," now that's funny!"' quips 
Hogan. That Paramount film, of course, bombed in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's all right. I knew we'd get this made," adds Hogan. After all, the 
Australian star had no problem raising the cash for both of his successful 
"Crocodile Dundee" films, which he wrote and produced. But that was through 
private investments. 
</P>
<P>
 This time he did things a bit different. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on a few friends and advisers for help, namely investment bankers at 
Australia's Morgan's brokerage house; his lawyers at Sinclair Tannenbaum, Nigel 
Sinclair and Craig Emanuel, and Tony Stewart, his accountant and producing 
partner on his other pictures, who carries an executive producer credit on 
"Lightning Jack." Sinclair hooked Hogan up with the film's co-producer, Greg 
Coote at Village Roadshow.  
</P>
<P>
 That production funding link was critical to launch the picture in Australia 
and give the film its Australian support base so that it could qualify as an 
Australian-made picture. The picture also had to be shot partially in Australia 
(Queensland was the choice) and have an Australian director. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifications meant Australian investors would get a tax credit on their 
investment -- a major carrot in attracting their support. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan is well aware of the perils for all involved. "Yeah, this is very risky, 
but the best part is there's not some humorless accountant calling the shots," 
he says. "I'm sharing this ride with about 5,800 people who believed in me, 
some people who have a coupla grand in my picture and that means a helluva lot. 
I'll be terribly disappointed if this doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 And if it doesn't work, is there a "Crocodile Dundee 3" on the horizon? "Oh, I 
don't know. It's not like Dundee is some crimefighter like Batman, where you'll 
do 10 sequels. I can't see Dundee joining the CIA, can you?"

OFF-CENTERPIECE; HOLLYWOOD'S NEW EDIFICE COMPLEX; FORTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER 'THE 
FOUNTAINHEAD,' AN ARCHITECT FINDS THAT HE AND HIS ILK ARE AGAIN THE MOVIES' 
STUDS OF CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MERRILL, Tim Merrill is an architect in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshman year: The architecture department at the University of Oregon has 
rounded up the movie that will show us what awaits us once we graduate. Of 
course, we've all read the book. We're getting to the part where Dominique 
Francon is about to shed her dignity -- and her clothes -- as she did in the 
book, to convince Howard Roark just how much she believes in him. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I admit to a little disappointment. "The Fountainhead" came out in 1949 
and there's no actual shedding of clothing. But it's only a small letdown; I'm 
convinced I'm on the right track. Growing up in a small town, I had never met 
an architect, had never been in an architect's office and had very little idea 
of what one did -- I just knew I wanted to be one. I knew that they drew 
pictures of buildings, somehow had them built and were paid pretty decent money 
to do this. That left most of a lifetime's bases covered. 
</P>
<P>
 But seeing "The Fountainhead" really crystallized things. Suddenly it was 
clear that you not only drew pictures and built buildings, but, if you were 
good enough at it, women threw themselves at you! What else could you ask of a 
profession? Just watching Patricia Neal longingly admire Gary Cooper's muscled 
forearms was enough to buoy me through architecture school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of movie making since "The Fountainhead" did not produce another 
architect as leading man to rival Coop. I can recall only two films: "Don't 
Look Now" (1973) and "Two for the Road" (1967), neither of which were 
box-office hits. For several decades, in fact, architects were forced to defer 
on screen to detectives, doctors, attorneys, cowboys, longshoremen and 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Consider the recent flood of hunky cinematic architects: Wesley 
Snipes in "Jungle Fever," Steve Martin in "HouseSitter," Woody Harrelson in 
"Indecent Proposal," Tom Hanks in "Sleepless in Seattle," Jeff Bridges in 
"Fearless" and now Richard Gere in "Intersection." Suddenly, architects are the 
yuppie leading man occupation of choice. And it's probably no accident. The 
secrets of the appeal are plentiful: 
</P>
<P>
 * People can relate to what architects do: They build things. No need to burn 
up precious film time explaining what he does at the office as you would with, 
say, a nuclear physicist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set designers can have a lot of fun with architectural "stuff." These 
include models, drafting lamps, drafting tables, rolls of drawings and even 
hard hats and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Architects' homes and offices, usually set in some breathtaking location, 
look great on film. Some of the scenes in "Intersection," for example, were 
shot in the offices of renowned architect Arthur Erickson in Vancouver, Canada. 
He also acted as architectural consultant to the film. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because they appreciate classy design, architects tend to accumulate 
interesting toys -- sailboats, high-tech European timepieces and sports cars. 
You would not expect Richard Gere to go into that climactic skid in a Chevy 
Nova; the slate-gray Mercedes makes a much stronger accessory. 
</P>
<P>
 * Architects sport a celluloid-friendly, sexy look: loosened ties, rolled-up 
sleeves, shirts in just about every shade but white. In "Intersection," the 
tweedy look has all but given way to total Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most architects are obsessed with their "dream house," but few have the 
income to support their tastes, thus setting up a juicy cinematic conflict. 
This dilemma was suffered most poignantly by Woody Harrelson -- and exploited 
wickedly by Robert Redford -- in "Indecent Proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 A side benefit to the dream-house syndrome: The architect is a nester. 
Architects tend to pair for life. When the stability of the home is strained by 
an affair or trauma (see "Fearless," "Sleepless in Seattle" and 
"Intersection"), the result is frequently dramatic. Gere's business partner in 
"Intersection," Martin Landau, explodes when he finds out about his friend's 
affair: "It's a bad design. You're supposed to have everything under one roof. 
Architecture 101." 
</P>
<P>
 * Architects -- at least on film -- are stud muffins. In 1987's "The Belly of 
an Architect," an Italian architect strokes the legs of a colleague's wife and 
coos, "Architects ought to know about everything -- especially sex" and then 
elaborates on the specifics: "form, shape, function, elegance, proportionately 
strong, enduring, reliable and cost effective." 
</P>
<P>
 * Architects make good movie heroes because they have lofty ideals. 
Harrelson's character in "Indecent Proposal" issues this passionate challenge 
to his students: "If you really get it right, you can lift the human spirit!" 
Sometimes it's a little hard to buy this line. When your last big job was a 
jail, you reflect that the only lifting of spirits in that place will be by 
helicopter in an escape attempt! Really getting it right can mean some 
monumental conflict with contractors and clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein, Coop as Howard Roark said: "My work done my way -- nothing 
else matters to me." He blows up a building to prove it. Gere's character in 
"Intersection," unfortunately, reduces this noble passion to an expletive that, 
however tempting, is seldom directed on a real-life client. 
</P>
<P>
 He's sexy yet sensitive. He's professional yet casual. He's a workaholic but 
still has time for the finer things in life. He believes in family values; he 
dreams the impossible dream. But where was he in the '60s when, young and 
unmarried, I could have actually tried to be him?

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: FUNNY GODMOTHER; A FRIEND 
OFFERS GILDA A VALENTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Zweibel, one of "Saturday Night Live's" original writers, is 
understandably nervous about his upcoming first film, "North." It's based on 
his "worstseller" of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, worstseller. The creator of such zany, immensely popular characters as 
Gilda Radner's Roseanne Roseannadanna and John Belushi's samurai swordsman, 
wrote the book 10 years ago. Only a handful sold at the time, but that didn't 
dissuade Zweibel and his friend, director Rob Reiner, from adapting it into a 
$40-million Castle Rock movie starring Elijah Wood, set for release this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 While a reissue of "North" will precede the movie into bookstores by two 
weeks, Zweibel's thoughts are on a more personal manuscript: a valentine to 
Gilda Radner. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Bunny Bunny, Gilda Radner: A Sort of Love Story" is no ordinary 
valentine. Zweibel's tribute, which will appear in bookstores in August, is the 
stuff of aspiring writers' dreams -- filled with funny sketches and great 
dialogue, a loving farewell to a friend, colleague and comedian who died of 
ovarian cancer five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Zweibel misses her so much that about 18 months ago he scribbled down all of 
his favorite conversational memories of her and put them in a drawer. His wife, 
Robin Blankman, found them, read them and urged him to contact his literary 
agent, the same agent who pushed to get a second printing of "North" (published 
by Random House's Villard Books division) on the shelves by June 24, just 
before the movie opens nationwide July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy, which Zweibel wrote and co-produced with Reiner, who is directing, 
is about an 11-year-old boy named North who doesn't like his parents and sets 
out to find new ones, offering his services as a kid to prospective moms and 
dads. 
</P>
<P>
 Zweibel jokes that only about four hardback copies of "North" sold when it was 
published in 1984. In fact, you can't even buy one today. "They're a 
collector's item," he quips.  
</P>
<P>
 And it is Reiner who jokes about "North" being on the worstseller list. "But 
then again," adds Reiner, "I'm not even sure if it made that! 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner first met Zweibel when he hosted the third show of "Saturday Night 
Live," home of Zweibel's budding friendship with Radner. It was Zweibel who was 
assigned to help Reiner with his opening monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to creating Roseannadanna and samurai swordsman, he co-developed 
"Not Necessarily the News," co-created and produced "It's Garry Shandling's 
Show" and created and produced "The Boys" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember trying to option Alan's book after it first came out but Columbia 
already had the rights," says Reiner. "Years later, when we developed Castle 
Rock, we decided to take on the project." Columbia currently distributes Castle 
Rock's films. 
</P>
<P>
 Book flop or not, Reiner says he "loved the idea behind 'North.' Every kid at 
one point or another, looks at his parents and says, 'I could do better.' This 
book tapped into those feelings. It's about a kid searching for what he thinks 
are the ideal parents. But it's done in a very hip, satirical way. The humor 
will be appreciated by adults, but we played it for children (in test 
screenings) and they got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zweibel says he wants to make more movies with Reiner, but he wants the book 
to first have a life of its own. He plans to donate all of the proceeds from 
the sale of his book to Gilda's Club, a New York-based support group for cancer 
patients and their families named in Radner's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gilda was the godmother of my three kids. I wrote the book 1 1/2 years ago, 
reconstructing our relationship through dialogue. It made me feel close to her 
again . . . just to hear the voices come back," says Zweibel. "I had a tough 
time telling my wonderful friend goodby. The book was a catharsis for me. It 
was my therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Zweibel waited to publish the book until her family and her husband, actor 
Gene Wilder, gave their blessing. Wilder's comment for the book jacket: "After 
our first kiss, Gilda demanded that I meet her friend Zweibel. What a strange 
girl, I thought. If you want to know more about Gilda, I lovingly recommend 
this book." 
</P>
<P>
 To Zweibel, "It's about two people who hung onto each other and helped each 
other find their way through their careers and life." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently in the second year of his two-year development deal at Castle Rock 
to create TV and movie projects, Zweibel is now working on a CBS series pilot 
with Reiner called "Tell Me a Story." Reiner says the network has already 
ordered six episodes, which launch in September and center around a family 
named Canterbury whose children have all sorts of problems.

 It used to be that Valentine's Day could be managed adroitly with a dozen 
roses, a box of chocolates and something frilly or silly to wear.Then designers 
turned their attention to candy, flowers and even boxer shorts. No doubt the 
traditional will begin to seem just a bit mundane. Especially tomorrow.

 Rethinking floral displays, designers are taking flowers out of their vases 
and adding small keepsakes that will linger long after the flowers fade. To 
wit: Brentwood designer Wayne Woods' fanciful wire forms.Bustiers are dressed 
in rose petals and sweet William, and pumps are filled with baby roses. Both 
may be kept on the night table indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 At Secret Garden in Beverly Hills, David Williams Yeh's double-bowl 
arrangement (the large container holds potpourri and is swagged with fake 
pearls) will endure for years -- just replace the flowers with trailing ivy. 
And "Smoldering Love," by Rob Smith of Laurels in Los Angeles, combines dried 
roses and hydrangea with a long-lasting candle. Says Woods: "Flowers are so 
momentary. This becomes more than a gift of flowers because there's something 
left afterward."

 Inspired by the loose, full-cut trunks prizefighters were wearing in the ring, 
boxer shorts helped KO the union suit as men's underwear of choice in the 
1930s. Now, after the long reign of the brief, boxers have made a 
comeback.What's different about today's boxer shorts is they offer up comfort 
and personal style. And they aren't just for men anymore. Tessa Graham of San 
Francisco-based Joe Boxer estimates that up to 75% of the company's customers 
are women buying for men and, just as often, for themselves. Men continue to 
sport boxers primarily as undergarments, but the more fashion-forward allow the 
elastic waistbands to peek out from low-slung pants. Women don boxers as 
outerwear, for shopping, jogging and burrowing in at home. Aside from plain 
white cotton, boxers are available in brightly patterned fabrics such as 
flannel and silk charmeuse. Some also feature a sense of humor. A case in 
point: Joe Boxer's glow-in-the-dark undies, which read "NO! NO! NO!" by day and 
"YES! YES! YES!" by night.

JOYS IN THE 'HOOD; GOOD MENU, SWELL SERVICE, COMFORTABLE ROOM: A BRANCH GROWS 
IN BRENTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not every neighborhood is blessed with a real neighborhood restaurant, where 
the greeting is always warm, where they remember your face even if it's not a 
famous one, and where if -- God forbid -- you end up having to eat alone one 
night, you feel perfectly comfortable because you're a regular. Brentwood got 
lucky when Woodside opened a couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have kept the hardwood floors bare and hung a few dramatic, 
oversized paintings on the brick walls. Victorian ceiling fans stir the air 
high over the Craftsman-style chairs. And at night, when the tables are set 
with white linen and candles in fluted glass holders, the restaurant feels as 
comfortable as an old Harris tweed jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Step in the door, and you immediately sense that this is a team effort. On a 
busy night, the interplay between the hostess-manager, the servers in 
pin-striped vests and the young kitchen staff has the fluid quality of an 
experienced ensemble. The chef is Louise Branch, the diminutive woman with 
bobbed blond hair setting the pace in the open kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in her 20s, Branch has had a rigorous culinary education at Patina, 
Stars in San Francisco, and at Bikini, where she was sous-chef. Having this 
kind of stellar resume doesn't necessarily guarantee you can cook. If it did, 
there would be quite a few more great restaurants in this world. Branch, as it 
happens, can cook. And at Woodside, she moves out on her own for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 And she does so with verve and intelligence. She's not trying to do more than 
she's capable of doing at this point in her career. She's wisely kept the menu 
fairly short (eight appetizers, 10 entrees and half a dozen desserts) and, more 
important, consistent. The servers are not obliged to recite a long list of 
specials, because there aren't any. Instead, she's designed the menu to change 
every few months.  
</P>
<P>
 The fried calamari appetizer is gossamer light and set off with a wonderful 
fresh mint sauce with a bite of pepper at the end. Ahi tuna tartare, punched up 
with fresh serrano-ginger vinaigrette and lime, is accompanied with crisp puffs 
of pappadam . Her minestrone is a light, graceful broth laced with chunks of 
lobster and slivers of bright vegetables. The timbale, a lovely construction of 
spiraled eggplant and onion in a basil mozzarella sauce, sounds terrific, but 
the flavors and textures don't marry well. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than garnishing each plate with the same ho-hum vegetables, Branch 
considers each plate as a whole. Spicy grilled gulf shrimp come with fragrant 
cilantro-laced rice and a snappy corn-and-pepper relish. The grilled pork chop 
stuffed with prosciutto and sage is set alongside a pile of seductively sharp 
baby mustard greens and a robust sweet potato gratin. It's clear she thinks in 
terms of strong contrasts and vibrant flavors. One of her best dishes is the 
beef filet heavily encrusted with crushed peppercorns and served with red chard 
and dreamy mashed potatoes spiked with horseradish. In most circumstances, I 
might pass up a curried shellfish chowder. Here, that would be a mistake. I was 
reluctant to share even a bite of this spirited chowder of fat shrimp, mussels, 
squid and fresh peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch's menu also pays attention to the seasons. In the middle of January, 
it's silly to feature dishes with tasteless fresh tomatoes, as a number of 
restaurants still do. Instead, Branch features winter greens and root 
vegetables, especially in an old-fashioned stew of lamb braised tenderly with 
turnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts and such in a rich evocative gravy, the 
whole thing ladled over creamy blackwater grits. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every dish is so well grounded. The roast baby chicken one night was tired 
and overcooked. And a couple of dishes are plainly ill-conceived, notably the 
penne pasta tossed with three ingredients-of-the-moment -- duck confit, 
radicchio and shiitake mushrooms -- then topped with a gluey mass of molten 
fontina. The other, meant to be the vegetarian plate, is a grilled chickpea 
patty, dry and dense, suffused with dark-toned Middle Eastern spices to make a 
kind of upscale falafel, served with a medley of roasted and grilled 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, there's a plate of assorted cookies, enough to feed the entire 
table, and a fine buttery pear tart embellished with streamers of creme 
Anglaise. A warm tart of thinly sliced apples wears a demure veil of sugar. On 
a recent visit, the respectable but staid Belgian chocolate mousse cake had 
been replaced with a cappuccino mousse version, a fetching dessert shaped as an 
edible cup (with a baroque curved dark chocolate handle), with chocolate, 
coffee and white chocolate mousses layered to mimic the way espresso drinks 
separate into bands of color. The "foam" on top was cool, delicious cream. If 
this is any sample of the menu to come, I'll have to start pretending this is 
my neighborhood. 
</P>

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger

<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodside's almost-all-California wine list has two problems common in upscale 
restaurants: A markup formula that prices expensive wines out of reach of most 
consumers, and no vintage dates.  
</P>
<P>
 On pricing: The attractive Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay, which sells at nearby 
discount shops for below $14, is $34 here -- double the suggested retail price 
of $17. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because 1988 was a difficult year for Cabernet Sauvignon in Northern 
California, the Heitz Cabernet (an '88) is a poor choice at $32. Better is 1990 
Raymond Cabernet, a great vintage, at $26. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the good values are Brander Sauvignon Blanc, $17, and Carneros Creek 
"Fleur de Carneros" Pinot Noir, $19. Both are about twice their retail prices, 
but at least they are excellent. Dan Berger

STAGE WATCH: LA MIRADA TURNS TO MCCOY RIGBY TEAM TO REVIVE THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some cities -- Los Angeles comes to mind -- have cut way back on financial 
support of professional theater. Others aren't sure which way to turn; in 
Garden Grove, GroveShakespeare has finally dissolved on paper as well as in 
practice, leaving the City Council to ponder how to bring its Festival 
Amphitheatre and Gem Theatre back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cities, such as Glendale, with its revived Alex Theatre, have 
actually increased their support of professional theater in the midst of a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada is joining the latter group. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1987, the professional theater series at the 1,264-seat La Mirada 
Theatre had a base audience of 17,000 subscribers. That figure is now down to 
8,000. Last year, the city -- represented by the facility's new executive 
director, Jeff Brown -- took note of the drop and asked the father and son team 
of Herb and Scott Rogers, producers of the professional series for the last 17 
seasons, to submit a proposal for restructuring the operation. They also asked 
any other interested parties to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that Rogers Productions is out and McCoy Rigby Entertainment -- 
operated by Tom McCoy and his famous gymnast/actress wife, Cathy Rigby -- will 
take over La Mirada's professional series next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll have more money to work with -- a budget of $1.1 million, up $235,000 
from the Rogers budget. The financial deal is structured differently -- McCoy 
Rigby will be paid $100,000 for each season, while the city takes all the 
profits. The Rogerses received half of the profits, as well as fees, while the 
city was responsible for losses. This wasn't a problem until 1991, when the 
Rogers season was in the red, to the tune of $115,000. Although that loss 
hasn't been repeated, it didn't sit well with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city expects McCoy Rigby to stir up more community support for the 
theater. The couple lives in nearby La Habra Heights and works out of nearby 
Fullerton, as opposed to the Beverly Hills and Venice-based Rogers team. The 
Rogers team "focused on the 20-mile radius, while McCoy Rigby will focus on the 
five-mile radius," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, McCoy and Rigby will "pound the pavements, speaking to every Kiwanis 
Club" about the theater, McCoy volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming will be "a little more family oriented," Brown said. Certain 
members of the audience never forgave the Rogers team for producing "Other 
People's Money," with its dirty words. McCoy Rigby's first season (their 
contract is for three years) includes "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Forever Plaid" 
(pending acquisition of rights), "On Borrowed Time" and "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't shed many tears for the Rogers team, however. They've lined up another 
gig similar to the one they had at La Mirada, this time at the new, 1,218-seat 
Maui Community Arts and Cultural Center in Kahului, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 IF CLOSE IS FAR AWAY: Glenn Close has missed the last two Sunday-evening 
performances in "Sunset Boulevard." At press time, she had no plans to miss any 
other performances. But let's say -- this is just a hypothetical scenario -- 
that you bought tickets for tonight's (or any other) performance months ago, 
you get to the theater, and Close isn't performing. If you must see Close and 
not understudy Karen Mason, what can you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Check the cast board in the lobby before taking your seat. If Close isn't 
going on, that news will be posted. Otherwise, you'll have to leave your seat 
once the news is announced over the public address system, before the show 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the box office and ask for a refund or exchange. If there is a mob scene 
around the box office and you don't want to get involved in it, ask an usher to 
direct you to the house manager, who will sign your ticket stubs. You can then 
mail them to the theater for a refund or exchange. If Close in the future 
decides to cut back on regularly scheduled dates, then other rules may apply. 
</P>

<P>
 DANQUAH AT THEATRE LA: Meri Nana-Ama Danquah is the new associate director of 
Theatre LA, the city's primary theatrical producers' organization. The 
Ghanaian-born Danquah, known primarily as a poet and performance artist, could 
serve as a bridge between the performance scene and the more traditional 
theatrical producers who make up the bulk of the Theatre LA membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a link "may be an extra benefit" of Danquah's employment, said Theatre LA 
executive director William Freimuth, but he hired her primarily because of her 
administrative skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Danquah said she does plan to encourage performance producers to join Theatre 
LA, adding that "it's hard to put down a line of demarcation" between 
performance and theater. She noted that she has worked at a few of the Theatre 
LA member theaters as well as at performance venues.

ON THE RECORD: CATCHING DEBUSSY'S ELUSIVE 'PELLEAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the past quarter-century there have been seven or eight commercial 
recordings of Debussy's 1902 opera "Pelleas et Melisande," to a text drawn from 
Maeterlick's dense, otherwise long-forgotten symbolist play of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 For one reason or another, all those recordings are unsatisfactory, either so 
heavily weighted toward the orchestra and a conductor's "concept" (Karajan/EMI) 
that the singers become mere props, or because of damaging mis- or 
under-casting (Dutoit/London, Abbado/Deutsche Grammophon), or a lack of what is 
generally called "atmosphere" (Jordan/Erato). 
</P>
<P>
 Even in such a thoughtful effort as that led by Pierre Boulez (Sony), one has 
to lament how much better things could have been with just a bit more 
sensitivity, at the very least on the recording producer's part. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, "Pelleas" is fragile goods, whose air of beguiling mystery is 
shattered by flaws that might elsewhere be regarded as negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 What a joy, then, to welcome two recordings of the opera that treat the work 
with such thoroughgoing sympathy and understanding: Philips' reissue of its 
1953 Paris recording, handsomely remastered on two mid-priced CDs (434 783), 
and what we used to call a "pirate" recording -- unauthorized, but not 
actionably so (due to lax Italian copyright regulations) -- of a 1969 Rome 
radio broadcast (Great Opera Performances 711, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 The Philips entry has as its first advantage the authentically French (as 
Debussy would have recognized it) playing of the Lamoureux Orchestra, 
particularly its flavorfully vibrating brasses, exemplifying a national style 
we regarded as dated and expendable a few decades back, and which many of us 
sorely miss in our own age of orchestral homogenization. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor is the late Jean Fournet, a master of the idiom, leading an 
interpretation that stresses the score's dark, surging drama without slighting 
its mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Outstanding in the cast is the Pelleas of the late Camille Maurane, a high, 
light baritone of the type specified by the composer, and for three decades 
among Europe's foremost interpreters of the role. As a vocal actor, Maurane 
projects an excitable guilelessness, within a context of optimum vocal 
refinement. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner is the likewise recently deceased Janine Micheau, not the 
possessor of the ideally sweet and clean Melisande voice, but an artist of deep 
intelligence and verbal communicativeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Roux's very Gallic, nasal Golaud is explosive and winningly human as 
the opera's catalytic center. And in the by-no-means-inconsequential secondary 
roles, Rita Gorr is a Genevieve of uncommon vocal richness, Xavier Depraz a 
mellifluous Arkel and Annik Simon an incisive, non-cloying Yniold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rome radio transcription, in decent sonics, is led by Lorin Maazel, not 
today's fussbudget, but the vital, 25-years-younger conductor who could be 
relied upon to seek out and project the subtleties and dramatic potential of 
the most elusive scores, among which "Pelleas et Melisande" surely ranks high. 
</P>
<P>
 The pacing is a good deal slower than Fournet's and more traditionally 
"impressionist" in its moving about rather than zeroing in on a phrase. But in 
its discursive way Maazel's interpretation is no less convincing than the 
Frenchman's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rome Radio Orchestra may not be one's dream ensemble for this music, but 
the players -- notably the solo winds -- are consistently responsive to 
Maazel's hardly simple demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the cast is uniformly strong, with the sweet-voiced Henry Guy and the 
girlish-sounding Jeannette Pilou as the doomed titular couple. Gabriel 
Bacquier's towering Golaud is perhaps the most sympathetic and pitiable on 
recordings, and vocally at least a match for Roux's, while Nicola Zaccaria 
brings basso cantante warmth of tone and a wonderful feeling of aged wisdom to 
his Arkel. 
</P>
<P>
 The set, on three full-priced CDs, is uneconomical. There are no notes and the 
libretto is in French only, whereas the inexpensive Philips reissue gives us 
all the printed material we could require. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are two sides of a coin of inestimable value. It's difficult to 
imagine being without either.

 McCOY TYNER BIG BAND 
</P>
<P>
 "Journey" 
</P>
<P>
 Verve  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 The piano dynamo's follow-up to his Grammy-winning album "Turning Point" shows 
that, bit by bit, his large ensemble is gaining a recognizable personality. 
This mark is due mainly to a constant crew of fine musicians (saxman Billy 
Harper, trombonist Steve Turre and trumpeter Eddie Henderson, among them) and a 
repertoire that is built around Tyner originals (there are three here) and 
tunes in musical moods the pianist embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader's "Peresina," a gorgeous classic from the '60s, is given a robust 
treatment that finds Tyner juxtaposing brief phrases with flurries of notes, 
while his "You Taught My Heart to Sing" is centered on Dianne Reeve's rich and 
evocative vocal. "Blues on the Corner" is fairly basic bluesy stuff, though 
tenorman John Stubblefield's solo isn't, while "Samba Dei Ber" and "January in 
Brazil" explore Brazilian flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 The one drawback in Tyner's presentation is that there's not a lot of 
background writing behind the soloists -- these pieces tend to pretty much 
follow the formula of melody-solos-melody. One exception is Dennis Mackrel's 
propulsive "Choices," in which Tyner and Harper deliver explosive forays and 
the brass and reed sections toss lively phrases around conversationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

POP MUSIC CHARTS: KICKIN' UP THE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black-hatted singer John Michael Montgomery always gets picked on by critics 
for being bland, for being the latest country "hunk." No matter -- he's still 
the hot "hat." On The Times' Southern California country chart, his new album, 
"Kickin' It Up," is tops. There were a number of surprises this week. The 
"Straight From Da Streets" compilation debuted on top of both the R&B charts 
and pop album chart. It's a regional hit, reaching only No. 129 on the national 
pop chart. Other surprises: singer Tori Amos' album "Under the Pink" entered at 
No. 8 locally and No. 12 nationally, while Us3's jazz-rap single "Cantaloop" is 
up to No. 16 locally and No. 10 nationally. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,43,11 Title,

POP FACES: ZHANE; HEY, MR. DEEJAY, DON'T PIGEONHOLE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to see Renee Neufville and Jean Norris -- the vocal duo Zhane -- 
do a slow burn, call them terrific dance-music artists and predict they'll have 
more dance-oriented hits like the Top 5 "Hey Mr. D.J." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not dance-music artists," Neufville insists. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, she offers their debut album, "Pronounced Jah-Nay." "There's a 
variety of material on it -- R&B, jazz and some hip-hop," she says. "Also, we 
write our own material, we can really sing and we're schooled in music -- Jean 
even majored in music in college. For us, dance music is a steppingstone to 
something bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 So how do they explain their current single, "Groove Thang" -- another 
danceable tune? 
</P>
<P>
 "There had to be a transition song," Norris says. "It was written for the fans 
who expect the same kind of song as 'Mr. D.J.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, who's from Moorestown, N.J., and Brooklyn native Neufville -- both 23 
-- met as freshmen at Philadelphia's Temple University. While working on their 
degrees (both graduated last year) they moonlighted as performers and looked 
for a record deal. By 1991, their biggest credit was singing background on the 
DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince single "Ring My Bell." Says Neufville: "It was 
fun but it didn't really lead to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 What did lead to something was landing "Hey Mr. D.J." on last year's 
compilation album "Roll Wit' Tha Flava." The song was eventually released as a 
single, and its success generated a bidding war for Zhane (a blend of the 
pair's first names), which Motown won. Explaining why the label signed the duo, 
label President and CEO Jheryl Busby says: "They're excellent songwriters and 
singers, and they're in the tradition of the great Motown acts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to be taken seriously," Neufville says. "Everybody wants 
respect and nobody wants to be pigeonholed or regarded as limited -- certainly 
not with your first hit. We're well-rounded artists. Some of the dance artists 
are here today and gone tomorrow. That's not us."DENNIS HUNT

POP FACES: COLLIN RAYE; A CONTEMPORARY GUY PLAYING WITH TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT and DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contemporary country, traditional country . . . contemporary country, 
traditional country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Collin Raye bounces back and forth between these genres, not quite sure 
where he belongs. Fortunately for him, his fans don't seem to mind. They just 
like his music, however it's categorized. His first album on Epic, "All I Can 
Be," is at the 900,000 sales mark, while his second, "In This Life," is nearing 
800,000. His third album, "extremes," is just out. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Raye prefer one of the genres? 
</P>
<P>
 "In my heart, I'm stone country," says the 33-year-old Texan, whose sweet 
tenor is well suited to teary-eyed ballads. "I love to sing that down-home, 
Waylon Jennings kind of bare-boned, hard-nosed music -- that's pure emotion and 
heartache." 
</P>
<P>
 On record, though, Raye still seems more comfortable in contemporary country, 
an expansive hybrid encompassing pop, rock, blues and soul. In concert, Raye 
can rock out on Rod Stewart's "Hot Legs" or croon Elton John's melancholy 
"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me." The first single from the new album is 
"That's My Story," a frivolous Lyle Lovett song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critics jump on me for singing those non-country songs -- asking how can a 
true country artist sing those songs," Raye says. "Country has changed so much 
in the past few years that a country artist can sing anything. Maybe he 
couldn't do it comfortably years ago, but he can now." 
</P>
<P>
 Raye grew up on that Buck Owens-Merle Haggard brand of music in Texarkana, 
Tex. He worked the club circuit and recorded some singles with his brother 
Scott on Mercury Records in the '80s before landing a deal with Epic in 1990. 
Along the way he's become a sharp and outspoken observer of the country scene. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he's skeptical about its ballyhooed recent growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's going to keep zooming," he says. "It's leveling off. The 
boom is over. Too many artists jumped into country. A lot of the artists who 
are around now won't be around in a year and a half. Tell you one thing: I 
wouldn't open a country honky-tonk right now."DENNIS HUNT

$50 GUIDE: THE NEW, THE LINGERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early weeks of the new year once again have been a slow period in pop, so 
this edition of the guide -- a way to keep up with what's exciting in pop on a 
budget of $50 a month -- focuses chiefly on some highly recommended late 1993 
releases that continue to show momentum. January  
</P>
<P>
 Bikini Kill's "Pussy Whipped" (Kill Rock Stars) -- There's been much written 
about the underground feminist Riot Grrrl movement, but not a lot actually 
heard from the bands. This album finally proves that it's not just hype. Bikini 
Kill has put together a remarkable package that recalls the revolutionary power 
of the Sex Pistols: raw, punk defiance mixed with enough tuneful, songwriting 
savvy to make the key tracks stick in your mind like "God Save the Queen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cranberries' "Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We" (Island) -- 
Since this debut collection sold more than 1 million copies last year, it might 
seem strange to describe the album as still under-rated. If you've just heard 
the delicate "Linger," however, you might dismiss the Irish group as charming, 
but lightweight. Not so. Elsewhere, lead singer Dolores O'Riordan proves as 
seductive as Chrissie Hynde and as combative as Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting Crows' "August and Everything After" (DGC) -- One reason this album 
shot into the Top 20 after the group's "Saturday Night Live" appearance last 
month is that it is one of the first promising U.S. bands in ages that isn't 
aligned to hard-core grunge or industrial styles. There's obviously a large 
contingent waiting for some of the classic '60s and '70s singer-songwriter 
tradition of Dylan, Morrison and Springsteen, and the Crows -- in such songs as 
"Mr. Jones" and "Round Here" -- deliver it deftly. February  
</P>
<P>
 Meat Puppets' "Too High to Die" (London) -- The Kurt Cobain and Dave Pirner 
endorsements on the CD cover should help this veteran Phoenix rock trio catch 
the attention of a new generation of rock fans, but its best calling card rests 
in a decade of stirring and original work. Here again, the Meat Puppets make 
music that is sinuous and rootsy enough for the band to open for Grateful Dead, 
yet sufficiently biting and visionary to tour with Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Me'Shell NdegeOcello's "Plantation Lullabies" (Maverick/Sire/Reprise) -- This 
25-year-old New Yorker, whose musical influences are based in jazz and soul, is 
one of the most captivating arrivals of the '90s. "I'm Diggin' You (Like an Old 
Soul Record)" is as artful and sophisticated as "If That's Your Boyfriend (He 
Wasn't Last Night") is playful and sly. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dove's "Morning Dove White" (ffrr) -- One of the most exciting bands from 
Glasgow since the Jesus and Mary Chain, this trio combines a striking 
techno-tension with superior pop-rock skills in ways recalling the promise of 
the early, experimental Eurythmics.

</P>
<P>
 With its second album, the Miami-based Mavericks confirm their place among the 
elite of contemporary country music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that the triple-threat skills singer-songwriter-guitarist Raul Malo 
exhibited on the group's 1992 debut were no fluke.The first six songs, all of 
which Malo wrote with various partners, ring like classics: "There Goes My 
Heart" and "Pretend" could be vintage Buck Owens; "I Should Have Been True" 
shows that the operatic ballad didn't die with Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
 Melodies etch themselves into the memory instantly, instrumental hooks feel as 
if they've been hammered out during countless nights in beer-drenched 
honky-tonks. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's original tunes are so impressive that its versions of songs by 
Bruce Springsteen, Jesse Winchester and Harlan Howard -- not a slouch among 
them -- are anticlimactic. Still, even the album's less-gripping second half 
stands above what's topping the country singles charts these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Malo's honey-soaked voice -- poignant, apologetic or resigned at the right 
moments -- can evoke the sweep of Del Shannon, the power of Orbison or the 
twang of Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it's for real. 
</P>

 Deep house. Progressive. Tribal. Ambient. Trance. A novice trying to navigate 
through these many tributaries of contemporary dance music can easily get lost 
in a maze of endless sub-genres and hybrid forms.One of the most notable 
achievements of this state-of-the-art dance compilation is the way it puts it 
all in perspective. The 14 tracks adroitly outline the way the throbbing, 
Philly soul-derived form called house gave birth to today's techno as it 
absorbed influences ranging from Kraftwerk to Brian Eno. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Solution's "Love, Peace, and Happiness" (featuring that staple of house 
music, the belting diva) and Joe Roberts' "Back in My Life" are throwbacks to 
the late '70s and early '80s, when house roots lay firmly in black, gay clubs 
and the music fused spirituality with sensuality, optimism with melancholia. 
</P>
<P>
 Later tracks show a disco flavor, rework ethereal, ambient offerings into more 
muscular, dance-friendly options (One Dove's "White Love"), tap into a 
venomously hilarious, ribald vein exemplified by Sagat's "F-- Dat" and end the 
whole enterprise with techno's most acclaimed, cerebral outfit, Orbital. 
</P>
<P>
 The best tracks, though, are the Goodmen's wildly percussive workout "Give It 
Up" and a completely revamped version of Utah Saints' techno hit "What Can You 
Do for Me," now a classic house stomper featuring Gwen Guthrie on lead vocals. 
Easily one of the best dance compilations available.

 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 If Kurt Cobain's strangled rasp was the voice of upstart youth in '92, and 
Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan's neurotic angel took over in '93, Stephen 
Malkmus' wobbly croon is a real candidate as this year's model. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearning and determined, vulnerable and comforting, challenging and 
reassuring, it conveys a warm skepticism instead of the withering sarcasm that 
would be the easy, obvious and far less interesting tone for Pavement's 
exploration of rock 'n' roll's failed promises.This band is wary, but it's also 
compelled to repeatedly pulverize its doubts with blissful blasts of 
guitar-rock glory. 
</P>
<P>
 On this bracing second album, the players frame Malkmus' vocals with music of 
constant invention, from soft meditations to full-out fireworks. Sometimes it's 
so relaxed it nearly stops, then it's suddenly taut and jumpy. There's some of 
the Meat Puppets' loopiness, a Stones/Burritos folk-country resonance, and a 
chirpy pop tunefulness -- along with enough contrary abrasiveness to keep you 
from getting too comfortable with them.

 * * * Jawbox, "For Your Own Special Sweetheart," Atlantic. On its major-label 
debut, this Washington D.C.-based punk band continues to do what it does best: 
churn out frantic, tension-filled guitar rock.The most obvious comparison would 
be to fellow D.C. punks Fugazi, but Jawbox's fury is more melodic -- so much so 
that the guitars on such songs as "Savory" almost shimmer when they're not 
cranking out distorted bursts of noise.

vocals of this man called E, for a uniformly sunny, serene sound despite the 
often downbeat lyrics.But don't put on E's second album while looking to relax: 
Its crafty melange of power pop through the ages will drive you crazy trying to 
identify snippets and snatches you're sure you've heard before.

Wind & Fire-style pop-soul? Down-home funk? This group can deliver all that

poignant remembrance of a child's murder.This New York quartet is easily the 
most versatile new group to emerge in R&B circles in the past year.

facility for Woody 'n' Bob folkiness and occasional forays into Neil 
Young-Creedence territory aren't quite enough to make the modest charms of this 
mostly acoustic one-man show more than modest charms.Neither his voice nor 
songwriting is distinctive enough to flesh out what sound like strong demos for 
his band.

POP EYE: THEY'RE RAGING AGAINST THE MACHINE AND MORE ON MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gun control . . . Native American rights . . . runaway teens. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV is starting to look more like CNN than a music channel, and we're not just 
talking about the news segments. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Bands are increasingly using their videos as forums for political 
and social causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns, Native Americans and runaways are the subjects of recent music videos by 
Megadeth, Rage Against the Machine and Soul Asylum, respectively. And if three 
makes a trend, MTV is welcoming it with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young part of our audience looks up to (those bands) and listens to what 
they say," says Rick Krim, the channel's vice president of music and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bands are speaking in no uncertain terms. Megadeth's clip for the song 
"99 Ways to Die" features such printed lines on screen as "Every day 14 
children are killed by handguns" to make its point. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Rage's "Freedom" video uses scenes from the film documentary 
"Incident at Oglala" and printed quotes to argue that American Indian Movement 
leader Leonard Peltier was wrongly convicted of the 1975 murder of two FBI 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rage video is an important social issue and they're providing their side 
of the story and laying out the facts in an educational way," says Krim. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the gates now open for pop musicians to use MTV as a platform for 
their views, will MTV have to draw the line? The channel has already refused to 
air the end of the Rage video, which gives the address for the Leonard Peltier 
Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 That angered the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV wouldn't air it because . . . they wanted to remain neutral on political 
issues," say Rage guitarist Tom Morello. "I would argue that MTV's spring break 
bikini contest makes a political statement of a different kind. . . . And if 
you look at the corporate advertising, the right is well represented." 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one rocker -- veteran Ted Nugent -- is eager to test MTV's limits 
from the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Nugent describes MTV as being "so liberal" it makes him "want to gag." A 
longtime National Rifle Assn. supporter, Nugent is making plans for a video for 
the song "Love Jacker" from his upcoming solo album, in defense of gun 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna find out real soon if MTV's willing to put out an un-PC message," 
Nugent says. "(In the song) I talk about how it's not only my constitutional 
right to keep and bear arms, but it's my moral obligation to defend my family 
-- and it can't be done with 911. It's an overtly pro-gun song." Heidi Siegmund

SMALL FACES

<P>
 U2's management is denying persistent rumors that bassist Adam Clayton is 
leaving the band due to longstanding "lifestyle" differences between him and 
the other members. As evidence of harmony, all four U2 members have been 
helping out on sessions for the debut album by Clayton's girlfriend, model 
Naomi Campbell, and are expected to be on hand for Monday's invitation-only 
opening of the group's new Dublin bar-restaurant-club, the Kitchen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Action seems to have picked up again at the Viper Room, the Sunset Strip club 
co-owned by Johnny Depp that gained notoriety as the site of River Phoenix's 
death in October. Not only did Johnny Cash do a special show there recently, 
but last week Maria McKee performed with the Jayhawks and Mick Jagger jumped 
onstage for a few blues numbers with a band featuring L.A. guitarist Jimmy 
Ripp, who plays on Jagger's solo projects. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Julio Iglesias, in the spirit of his duet with Willie Nelson, returns to 
country territory with his upcoming album, "Crazy," due April 15. The title 
song is the old Patsy Cline standard, and on another number he duets with Dolly 
Parton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 L7 is working with producer Garth Richardson (he did Rage Against the 
Machine's debut) on a new album, titled "Hungry for Stink" and due in June. . . 
. Grant Lee Buffalo also has a new album due in June, following a March gig 
opening Midwestern shows by Pearl Jam. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Deconstruction -- the band formed by former Jane's Addiction 
bassist Eric Avery and guitarist Dave Navarro -- not going to be promoting its 
album due to Navarro's joining the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but now it can't even 
use the name, due to a small record label already having it tied up. The album, 
due in April, will still be titled "Deconstruction" though. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 While Public Image Limited is at work on a new album, leader John Lydon can be 
heard on a new U.K.-only single with techno group Left Field. The track, titled 
"Open Up," features typically vituperative Lydon lyrics, this time aimed at the 
Hollywood show-biz machine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Emerson, Lake & Palmer reunion seems to have stuck: The prog-rock trio is 
recording a new album with veteran producer Keith Olsen in Los Angeles. . . . 
Rapper Grand Puba is at work on a new album, due in the summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Richman is working on a Spanish-language album, featuring versions of 
some of his old songs en espanol . . . Los Lobos' Cesar Rosas produced a new 
album for San Diego rockers the Paladins, due Feb. 22. Rosas will guest with 
the band when it plays the Whisky on March 12.

 MORE MTV NEWS: The bands aren't the only ones on MTV who are taking stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The channel's aggressive 1992 "Choose or Lose" voter awareness campaign was so 
successful that MTV was credited with helping boost Bill Clinton into the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, MTV is going to focus its considerable influence on another topic: 
violence in America. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV President Judy McGrath promises to explore the issue in a variety of ways, 
incorporating views from everyone from gun control advocates to the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether the campaign also affects the channel's music 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV has a long track record of rejecting videos that contain gratuitous 
violence, but what about videos by artists who have exhibited violent behavior? 
Would MTV ban rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg or 2Pac if they are convicted of current 
charges ranging from murder to sexual assault? 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have a serious discussion here about what to do if and when Snoop 
Doggy Dogg or 2Pac is convicted," McGrath says. "We can say a video is 
important and people want to see it, but if things change and there are new 
factors that need to be looked at it will be a factor in how we program MTV."

 ANOTHER REUNION?: Cindy Wilson has rejoined the B-52's for an anniversary show 
at CBGB's in New York and a few other special dates in Atlanta.But will the 
singer, who left the group last year to stay close to her family, be doing more 
shows with the band? 
</P>
<P>
 The band's managers, are hopeful, but say it's too early to tell. We may get a 
clue when the group does some gigs tied to the opening of the new movie "The 
Flintstones." The group wrote the title song for the film and appears in it. In 
the spirit of the Stone Age, the band has adopted a new name for these shows: 
the B.C.-52's. Bruce Haring

 But it was left to Pop Eye to zero in on the issues that everyone really wants 
to know: Will there be a pig and will there be a wall?

<P>
 Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, seeming a little flustered, stared back and, 
after a pause, said merely, "I can say this: There won't be a wall."

RESTAURANT NEWS: QUAKE HELPS END BIKINI'S BEACH PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After two years in business, Bikini in Santa Monica has closed. According to 
chef-owner John Sedlar, the closure is only temporary. Bikini reopened four 
days after the earthquake despite a smashed front door and a 20-foot dumpster 
full of old bricks sitting in front of the building, but the final straw came 
when the air conditioning went out Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to regroup," Sedlar says. "Like a lot of businesses right now, we are 
trying to get (a Small Business Administration) loan. I have an application 
that has taken me three days to fill out. It weighs 3 1/2 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bikini first opened, Sedlar's pricey menu was filled with dishes nobody 
had seen before, including air-dried chicken fajitas and bass schnitzel with 
spaetzle. And before the earth moved, Sedlar was about to open Abiquiu, a 
Southwestern restaurant named after a pueblo in northern New Mexico, where he 
grew up. Located on the Bikini patio, Abiquiu was going to be a more casual 
(read: cheaper), spicier version of St. Estephe, his former Manhattan Beach 
restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Sedlar is considering reopening the entire Bikini space as Abiquiu. "I'm 
very anxious to cook that kind of food again," he says, "and I might."

 PLAYING BALL: You have until April 30 to eat your last meal at Sonora Cafe -- 
at least at its current downtown location. After unsuccessfully trying to 
negotiate a new lease with the owners of Union Bank Building's Figueroa Court, 
Sonora's Ron Salisbury is scouting the Westside and Pasadena for a new 
location. "I want to keep Sonora intact," he says. "It's like a veteran 
ballclub. After eight years you develop a crew. The first few years you may 
have a bunch of rookies and you don't win anything, but then you start playing 
together and develop a following and the crowd's behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 One space that's become available is Mario's Cooking for Friends on Beverly. 
After unsuccessful lease negotiations with his landlord, owner Mario Martinoli 
has closed his 5-year-old restaurant-deli. He eventually wants to open another 
restaurant; for now says he's going to stick to what he calls "food-related 
endeavors."

 LIGHTNING STRIKES: After several complaints from customers, Thunder Roadhouse 
on Sunset has dropped the 15% service charge it was adding to every bill. The 
boutique biker restaurant instituted the fee about three weeks after it opened 
because many of its customers were European tourists and they weren't tipping. 
The problem was that most servers weren't telling customers about the automatic 
tip, and on credit card bills, the charge wasn't itemized. In the darkly lit 
restaurant it was hard to read the fine print on the slips that stated the 
policy. "Irate servers," says owner Michael Eisenberg, "are much better than 
irate customers."

LAST IMPRESSIONS; A FINAL TIP OF THE HAT TO LA TOQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the night before La Toque shut its doors for good after 14 years in 
business, the dining room was packed, as it had been for two weeks straight -- 
since people realized that chef Ken Frank was actually making good on his 
longstanding threat to close his very personal restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the crowds always turned up at La Toque for special occasions, 
whether it was Valentine's Day or just garlic month. The problem for Frank was 
the nights in between: He has always been acknowledged as one of the best chefs 
in Los Angeles, but a customer could almost always drop by on a weekday night 
without a reservation and find an empty table, an eager staff. Unlike his 
neighbor Wolfgang Puck up the street, Frank was never able to generate an 
income equal to his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Many don't realize that Frank, who still has yet to reach 40, has been a 
restaurant star since the late '70s -- or that La Toque, built on the idea of 
shaking up the tired food scene that was entrenched at the time, opened before 
Spago. Frank is as much a pioneer of California cuisine as Puck, but he's never 
been on Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Feb. 4, as he emerged from the kitchen after cooking for several long 
hours, Frank seemed a bit tired but not at all bitter. He greeted old 
customers, accepted compliments on his wonderful cooking. True to form, he'd 
included an all-black-truffle menu along with his old favorites, and almost 
every table seemed to have an order of the rabbit stuffed with foie gras and 
truffles. There was even truffle ice cream -- better than you can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the rounds from table to table, Frank seemed genuinely happy to be 
moving on to a new project -- he's overseeing the food at Isaac Tigrett's House 
of Blues, a giant new nightclub on the Sunset Strip -- and he was excited that 
most of his kitchen and wait staff would be going with him to the new place. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, Frank's menu was an improvised, 
gourmet-chef-cleans-out-the-refrigerator kind of thing. There wasn't enough 
rabbit to go around, but there was no sense in buying more, because after that 
Saturday night, there would be no one to order it. LAURIE OCHOA

CASTING GALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Oleanna" casting controversy is disturbing inasmuch as it reflects a 
continuing erosion of artistic rights ("The Storm Over 'Oleanna,' " by Richard 
Stayton, Jan. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 If David Mamet wants a black actor in a part he wrote as white, then the Mark 
Taper Forum has no business objecting.This is what we pay our artists to do -- 
make creative decisions. Sometimes they appear ill-advised, but here we won't 
know until we see the production. Why shouldn't Mamet's celebrated ear and eye 
as writer and director be given the benefit of the artistic doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 More artistic damage is done if we're to take seriously a quote by the actor 
in question, Lionel Mark Smith. He says: "I deserve a shot (at this part). My 
father was a heroin dealer and my mother died of alcoholism. I remember the 
police kicking my door in when I was 4, looking for my father." He then relates 
further examples of his troubling and difficult youth. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to give Smith the benefit of the doubt and hope that his statement 
didn't really mean to suggest that his tragic upbringing entitles him to 
employment. This Queen-for-a-Day selection method is victimization run amok and 
does a disservice to Smith's own life, diminishing his very real, even heroic, 
accomplishments as a human being and actor.

 A number of people have asked me why the L.A. Cabaret Comedy Club was not 
mentioned in your article ("The Last Stand for Stand-Up?," by Chuck Crisafulli, 
Jan. 9). My response has been that the Los Angeles newspapers do not appear to 
think of the Valley as a place where culture and entertainment exist. 
</P>
<P>
 You should know that our club has been recognized as one of the best showcase 
rooms in the country by such greats as Milton Berle. This is the place where 
Jackie Mason started his one-man show, where Roseanne Arnold, her former 
husband and Tom Arnold worked when they first started in Los Angeles. When 
Pauly Shore needed to work, this is where he came. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Comedy Store and Improv are the nurseries for comics, we have been the 
delivery room. 
</P>
<P>
 So come on, give credit where credit is due. We have survived during a very 
difficult economic slump, but we need laughter in these times more than ever.

ACTING DOES PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reference to Dimitra Arlys' letter of last Sunday, in which she accuses me 
of not paying the actors in "The Tavern," hers is not an uncommon perception of 
the "99-seat theater plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Actors Equity Assn., in concert with local actor-producers, created 
an updated 99-seat theater plan that the Matrix Theatre Company and all venues 
of 99 seats or less that employ union actors adhere to. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors in "The Tavern" have received 21% of the gross box-office receipts 
to date. This is the highest acting payroll in any small theater in Los 
Angeles. This percentage is also higher than the national average that 
encompasses all Equity contracts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this clarifies a very important issue in this community -- an issue 
that many actors like Arlys use as an excuse to withhold their support for 
their fellow actors who work in small theater in Los Angeles.

 Regarding Peter Rainer's film commentary "Why the 'Schindler's List' 
Backlash?" (Jan. 30): 
</P>
<P>
 As one who holds the film "Schindler's List" in even higher regard than does 
Rainer, I thank him for his most thoughtful response to the complaints of the 
Backlash Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the debate, like the one concerning "Philadelphia," only demonstrates 
that filmmakers are sure to be "damned if they do and damned if they don't" 
when it comes to dealing with certain sensitive subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently viewed "Schindler's List" for the second time. I have little doubt 
that in decades to come this extraordinary work will come to be regarded as one 
of the truly great motion pictures. The present carping, so eloquently answered 
by Rainer, will be all but forgotten. As historians of the arts well know, this 
is a very old pattern.

<P>
 Political agendas aside, those who criticize the movie for not depicting the 
"Schindler Jews" as well-developed individuals have obviously never written a 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Anne Frank and the Sophie of "Sophie's Choice" were main characters, 
the Jews in Steven Spielberg's film were secondary. To have done justice to 
them, screenwriter Steven Zaillian would have had to devote enough pages -- and 
Spielberg enough screen time -- for a miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaillian and Spielberg chose to tell the story of Oskar Schindler. Their 
critics are saying, in effect, that they should have told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there are those who feel that Melville should not have written about 
an obsessed whaler.

 Rainer calls Nazism a "vicious riddle." It isn't a riddle to me, and I doubt 
it is to Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentation of Nazism and its roots, Hitler's understanding of a 
collective German character and his virtuosity in playing on the nationalistic 
needs of that character -- with appalling results for both Europe and her Jews 
-- is recorded with readable clarity by William L. Shirer in "The Rise and Fall 
of the Third Reich." 
</P>
<P>
 How many Americans do you think can identify the first two Reichs? How many do 
you think care? Someday our ignorance of the past will be our undoing.

<P>
 While I admired Rainer's sensitive piece on the deplorable backlash against 
Spielberg's masterful "Schindler's List," he should read the section on Hitler 
in Alice Miller's "For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the 
Roots of Violence" if he seeks additional insight into "the vicious riddle of 
Nazism." 
</P>
<P>
 He might also screen Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Conformist" and Elio Petri's 
"Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion" and "One Way or Another" if he 
thinks it's not possible to "explain" fascism in psychologically convincing and 
artistically satisfying terms.

 On the "Schindler's List" backlash and whether the Holocaust ought to be 
dramatized at all: 
</P>
<P>
 Time is a lens that alters our memories just enough to make grief bearable. 
That is why we are able to get over things. Art is often instrumental in that 
process: It condenses, replays, refocuses. By its very nature it can help us 
heal.

GREG GUMBEL'S GOLD-MEDAL MOMENT; PLUMB WINTER OLYMPIC ASSIGNMENT GIVES CBS 
SPORTS ANCHOR PRIME-TIME EXPOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Jack Mathews is film critic for New York Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, two decades after following his kid brother Bryant into television 
broadcasting, you might expect Greg Gumbel to show a little pique when asked to 
compare himself to the host of "Today." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Greg's career hasn't exactly been conducted in private. He was a 
star at ESPN for more than five years. For the last four, he has been a 
favorite of top brass at CBS Sports, who picked him first to replace Brent 
Musburger as host of "The NFL Today," then named the prime-time host of the 
1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic assignment is a huge boost to the 47-year-old Gumbel's career, 
putting him in a job held at other networks by ABC's venerable Jim McKay and by 
his own brother, who was NBC's host of the 1988 Summer Olympics. Still, there 
is a different level of celebrity for anchors of network news and network 
sports shows, and the fact is Greg is just now emerging from the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any question that I have been in Bryant's shadow," Gumbel says. 
"It would have been tougher to take if he hadn't been as good as he was. I 
don't think I'm a bad broadcaster, but he's always been terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel is quick to credit Bryant with getting him into the business. Greg was 
26 and selling medical supplies for a company in Detroit when Bryant, then a 
weekend sports anchor for KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, urged him to audition for an 
opening at the NBC affiliate in their home town of Chicago. Greg says it was 
the last time he ever looked for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very happy in Chicago when ESPN came along and offered me a chance to 
do more things," he says. "I was happy at ESPN when Madison Square Garden (now 
USA Network) came along and offered me more and different things. And I was 
happy there when CBS came along. The truth is I would have been happy to have 
stayed at any of those places. It's just that all of a sudden, somebody offers 
you a bigger ice cream cone, and you take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ice cream cones don't come any bigger than the Winter Olympics, an event 
Gumbel admits he paid little attention to until he went to work for CBS. Now, 
after a stint as a week-day anchor at the Winter Games in Albertville, France 
two years ago, and spending the last 13 months cramming with CBS' research 
staff for Lillehammer, he's ready to take a bite out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was ready for it two months ago," he says. "It's scary, but it's 
also going to be a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 On the air, Greg exudes a more accessible personality than Bryant, a quality 
that Sports Illustrated described as "amiable ease." Few people dislike him, 
many seem not to notice him, and that may be just what CBS needs to make 
critics and viewers forget its unfortunate pairing of Tim McCarver and Paula 
Zahn as studio hosts at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two weeks, Gumbel will be host of nearly 50 hours of prime-time 
coverage, and, yes, he says, the pressure is greater than at any other event 
he's covered. His greatest fear: that he will make a fool of himself by asking 
a stupid question in a key interview, or by misspeaking in some memorable way, 
as he once did in reporting that tennis player Jimmy Connors had defeated 
Harold Solomon in "straight sex." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gumbel has enough ego to relish the size of the viewing audience, 
particularly the one of Feb. 25, when the figure skating finals will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt real guilty saying the (Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story) is 
terrific for us, because that's kind of like news mavens drooling over a plane 
crash," he says. "But the fact is it helps us tremendously. ... Can you imagine 
anyone not tuning in the night Nancy Kerrigan takes the ice? I'm going to wear 
my best tie that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel may not get as much of the harsh media criticism accorded some of his 
colleagues, but what little comes his way pierces his thin skin, and that, he 
says, is probably the biggest difference between the Gumbel brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryant doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him, he couldn't care 
less," Gumbel says. "If I heard that somebody said I wasn't a very nice person, 
I'd spend half the day wondering how that came about. That's paranoia at a 
dangerous level, but the fact is, I am concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The one rap on the older Gumbel is that his amiability makes him too soft an 
interviewer. He agrees that he is non-confrontational, saying "I don't believe 
you have to conduct an interview by constantly interrupting someone and 
challenging them." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say he doesn't enjoy that quality in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone asked me if I watch Bryant in the morning," Gumbel says. "I said: 
'No, I listen to Howard Stern.' I love that guy."

PROFILE; SPREADING HIS WINGS; TIM DALY MOVES FROM HIS SITCOM PILOT SEAT TO THE 
ELECTRIC CHAIR ON A FUTURISTIC DEATH ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a hectic morning on Stage 19 at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, the home 
of the hit NBC series "Wings." Extras are rehearsing a scene, while the crew is 
busy readying the sound stage for the evening's taping of the long-running 
sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
 But series star Tim Daly, who plays clean-cut, strait-laced pilot Joe Hackett, 
is nowhere in sight. Cut to 10 minutes later when Daly appears in his exercise 
togs, his usually well-tamed hair in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, 37, profusely apologizes for his tardiness, explaining he had a plumbing 
problem at home and hasn't even had a bath this morning. Before settling into 
his cozy dressing room to talk about his latest TV movie, "Witness to the 
Execution" on NBC, Daly grabs his toothbrush and toothpaste. "I think I better 
brush my teeth before the interview," he says, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Wings" is celebrating its fifth season, the son of the late actor 
James Daly ("Medical Center") and baby brother of Emmy Award-winning Tyne Daly, 
never envisioned himself doing a TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good job and one I enjoy," acknowledges Daly, who received a Tony 
nomination and a Theater World Award on Broadway seven years ago for his 
performance in Tina Howe's "Coastal Disturbances." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's afforded me a lot of great things. But I don't see this as my career. 
I'm not going to grind out TV series for the rest of my career. I've a lot of 
other things I'm interested in doing. This is sort of a nice, interesting 
detour I've taken. I want to be working for a long time. Hopefully, my career 
will be taking a lot of interesting turns as it has in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers' perceptions of Daly have changed radically since he broke from his 
clean-cut image to star as cult leader David Koresh in last May's controversial 
NBC movie "In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco." Since "Waco," Daly's been 
playing his share of wackos. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, he was a drug dealer in the USA cable movie "Dangerous 
Heart." And in "Witness," he's all sleazy charm as a charismatic Death Row 
killer whose execution becomes a pay-per-view event. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden you play a bad guy," Daly says, "and they say, that's all can 
he do. Hopefully, I will keep people guessing long enough until they realize 
I've done a lot of different things. I've never been interested in becoming a 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Or having an image. "The biggest compliment I can ever get as an actor is to 
have someone say, 'We didn't recognize you.' That's not always realistic when 
you do something like a situation comedy, because you're hired for your face or 
your voice. I will always look for things that are different from the last 
thing I played." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Witness to the Execution," which is set in 1999, Daly's Dennis Casterline 
is an attractive, manipulative killer who claims he's innocent of slaughtering 
a family. Sean Young plays a savvy program executive, a la Faye Dunaway in the 
classic "Network," who comes up with the concept of televising a live execution 
on pay-per-view. But as millions of viewers sign up for the event, she begins 
to wonder if Dennis is really guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly says he had to make a personal choice in playing Dennis over whether he 
felt the character was guilty or innocent. "I hope that at least for a lot of 
the people who watch it, they are not quite sure until the very end," Daly 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 This choice, he says, is potentially dangerous. "You don't want people to 
think it's a wishy-washy choice. People long for black or white. He's guilty. 
He's the good guy. Sometimes they blame the actor: 'We couldn't tell if he was 
innocent or guilty. What a terrible acting job.' But somehow if you purposely 
have gone for that, then you achieve what you set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly took the project because of the provocative questions it poses: "How far 
will the media go to make a buck? How far will we go as an audience? What will 
we tune in to see?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In all of the discussion and controversies which have surrounded this film 
and have gone on about TV violence," Daly says, "the one thing that's very 
seldom mentioned is the fact that people have a choice to turn the TV off. We 
sort of have given up on the idea of taking any sort of personal responsibility 
for what we see. I don't understand it at all. There are many things that I 
won't let my kids watch. This movie, for instance." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly points out that a recent article in Advertising Age magazine described 
"Witness" as an example of "snuff" television. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've seen the movie," Daly says to his visitor. "There's a minuscule amount 
of violence in it. It's all inferred. The person who wrote that article, the 
mistake they made was that they confused emotional impact with gratuitous 
violence, not realizing that the purpose of drama is to make people feel 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's own feelings went numb while shooting the electrocution scene on the 
50-yard line at the Houston Astrodome. "It felt like a normal day and suddenly 
it's 4 in the morning and you look around and you realize, 'I'm in a fake 
electric chair with my face on the scoreboards behind me.' It was one of those 
things when I get a little perspective, I will remember it as a very strange 
moment in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Witness to the Execution" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC; "Wings" airs Thursday 
at 8:30 p.m. on NBC; repeats of "Wings" air weeknights at 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: GENDER POLITICS NEEDS A NAME BEFORE IT GETS, WELL, BORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good morning, and welcome to "Name That Phenomenon," the column that offers 
you a unique opportunity to bestow a title on whatever the hell it is that's 
going on between men and women these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we look to the glossier side of the news business -- three national 
magazines -- for clues in this mess that used to be called the War Between the 
Sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zeitgeist mongers are at it again, and it's going to be a thrilling ride 
down the rails of gender politics as we (all together now) name that 
phenomenon!  
</P>
<P>
 You well-dressed gents -- oh, and ladies, or rather womyn, or whatever -- may 
already be familiar with the February GQ's "The Way We Are" by Lucy Kaylin. 
Perhaps you have already slogged past the pages featuring moody dudes in 
wrinkled duds to get to this essay, in which the writer christens the current 
of antipathy coursing between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, the mood between men and women is growing far less libidinous 
than litigious," Kaylin writes, "what with the once-collegial workplace 
becoming a hotbed of abuses and almost as many categories of rape, suddenly, as 
Eskimo words for snow. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As more men stay home and women go to work, we're finally learning how the 
other half lives and that no one has had it easy -- that we've all been mired 
in quiet desperation. But the quiet part is finally over." 
</P>
<P>
 And what do we call this noisy replacement? 
</P>
<P>
 "Call it the New Hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Think on it, readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our second entry in Name That Phenomenon comes from Esquire's February 
edition: "The 21st-Century Fox." This issue is not devoted to a movie studio, 
if you catch our drift. In fact, we can't really delve into a whole lot of what 
writer Tad Friend addresses, because our censors -- make that taste mavens -- 
won't allow it. Suffice to say the essay in question is titled "Yes." As in, 
"That's the message from a new generation of women thinkers, who are embracing 
sex (and men!)" 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, radical feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin 
have held sway, declaring sex bad and men worse, but now comes a generation of 
young women who have read the theory, thought about it -- and rejected it. That 
purposeful hammering spreading across the land, bedroom by bedroom, is the 
sound of those young women beating their swords into bustiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Picking examples from a not-so-broad, as it were, spectrum, Friend lumps 
together several young, pro-sex women, such as writers Naomi ("I love nubile 
young soccer players") Wolf and Katie ("No such thing as date rape") Roiphe, 
and proclaims a new political movement emphasizing "sexual liberation, sexual 
equality and the reclamation of men from the scrap heap of theory." 
</P>
<P>
 And can you name that movement, Mr. Friend? 
</P>
<P>
 "Call it, 'do me' feminism." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll know soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Our third entry is the most recently published, and appears in this week's 
issue of Time. 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay more remarkable for its amiable wit than logic (if you permit us 
the small indulgence of saying what we think), writer Lance Morrow whines and 
cajoles and explores "the proposition that . . . men . . . are swine." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to preempt discussion, Time's cover features a clearly Caucasian pig 
head (white head, pink nose -- looks a little like the late Tip O'Neill, 
actually) sprouting from a human male body. 
</P>
<P>
 (Note to Time subscribers: The magazine assures us that the cover subject is 
no one's ex-boyfriend, as it is a composite photograph.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Men should think more about their situation and their behavior," Morrow 
writes. "Women should as well. Both men and women have been oppressed by the 
other sex, in different ways. And both have been getting away with murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Morrow wonders: "Are we really as awful as they say we are?" 
</P>
<P>
 His replacement for "The War Between the Sexes"?  
</P>
<P>
 "The War Against Men." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So. What'll it be, readers? Ready to name that phenomenon ? 
</P>
<P>
 Those partial to "The New Hostility," please raise your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do-Me Feminism?" 
</P>
<P>
 What about "The War Against Men?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, that's odd. No one seems to be voting. This is absolutely unprecedented. 
Readers, please. Signify that you are ready to vote by raising your hands now ! 
</P>
<P>
 Unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is responding. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a different question is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 A show of hands, please, from those too busy trying to keep marriage, 
children, relationships and/or career intact to care that A) relations between 
the sexes are just as muddled as ever; B) a few feminists are talking dirty and 
getting publicity for it, and C) some affluent white men are complaining that 
men are as oppressed as women. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought so. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unanimous.

UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON: LUNA-CY LURKS AT CABARET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cabaret room at LunaPark is a low-ceilinged black box hung with red 
curtains and mirrors -- as well a cabaret should be. Little round tables 
snuggle together. Candles smolder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm in a Turkish prison," comic Ed Kraznick says appreciatively, 
taking the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 LunaPark is the creation of Jean-Pierre Boccara, genius of the Lhasa Club and 
Cafe Largo. The cabaret is just one aspect of a bi-level, avant-garde theme 
park that promises "post-modern Mediterranean fare" in the restaurant upstairs 
and a fully equipped dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the cabaret proves to have a life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good entertainment for a nasty world, that's our motto," says Beth Lapides, 
the beehived mistress of ceremonies for Sunday night's "Uncabaret" comedy show. 
(Lapides won worldwide fame on CNN last year in her unsuccessful bid for the 
office of First Lady.) "The week of the earthquake, we were all very bitter and 
very real. This is a good place for a disaster -- any disaster," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday show features first-timers yucking it up from handfuls of notes as 
well as comedy luminaries like Bobcat Goldthwait venting hysterical spleen 
about the existential tortures of opening for Nirvana in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like the comedy safe house," Goldthwait declares, mid-rant, throwing 
his coonskin cap to the winds. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 o'clock, the Wayne Peet and Vinny Golia quartet takes over, and Sweet 
Baby J'Ai sings. If she had a coonskin cap, she'd chew it to bits and throw it 
to the winds without missing a note. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Thursday night at the cabaret, an audience too cool to be entirely 
industry packs the house to hear writer/performer Barry Yourgrau rescue runaway 
sex organs from the branches of trees and drown among a bevy of salacious 
mermaids. The reading was from his forthcoming story collection, "The Sadness 
of Sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Yourgrau is followed by guitarist Pascal Humbert's band Rex Voto, featuring 
Esther Balint, the bleak Hungarian gamin of "Strangers in Paradise" fame, who 
struts dire numbers with a country twang -- Joy Division does Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 If it isn't Berlin in the '30s, the cabaret at LunaPark at least offers a 
ribald alternative to despair in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is just about right," says actress Corinne Bohrer on her first 
visit to LunaPark. "A little too smoky for New Age saxophonists, but 
comfortable for people who maybe don't do so many drugs any more -- a nice 
place to hear stories and have a couple of vodkas.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's Thursday, so I guess we're all people who don't have jobs," Bohrer adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: LunaPark, 665 N. Robertson Blvd., West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Nightly. Times and entertainment vary. "Uncabaret" shows Sundays at 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices: Cover $5 to $10 depending on entertainment. Domestic beer, $3.50; 
imported beer and wine, $4; well drinks, $4.

THE BUZZ: IN GOOD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By COMPILED BY THE SOCIAL CLIMES STAFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you think you're a true coffee connoisseur? Think you're special because 
you can tell real Jamaica Blue Mountain from the fake stuff? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we ran into a woman the other day who takes her coffee very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 While in our usual coffee emporium stocking up on joe, a woman standing next 
to us said, "Wish I owned stock in this company," as her eyes scanned what must 
be a virtual gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, really," we said -- our usual brilliant small talk when shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take it with me when I travel," she said, pointing to two quarter-pound 
bags of coffee and a small plastic filter holder. "I just can't drink any other 
coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 We can see it now -- "Oh, waiter, would you bring me a cup and some hot water? 
And do you have any No. 1-size filters? I'm all out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, Thanks, but No Thanks: We love holidays, if for no other reason than to 
see how the candy companies interpret them. For instance, Holiday M&M's this 
time of year are red and white. Around Christmas, they're red and green, and by 
Easter they've changed into pastels. You can find Hershey's kisses right now 
wrapped in silver and red foil. 
</P>
<P>
 It's surprising no other companies have tapped into this marketing idea. How 
about Holiday Spam? Valentine's Day-themed pork and beans? Fourth of July 
frozen spinach? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it was just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Essentials What you need to maneuver the L.A. scene: 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: There are too darn many award shows. The Oscars, the Grammys, the Emmys, 
the American Music Awards, the Golden Globes, the Directors Guild, the L.A. 
Film Critics . . . we could go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: No one can possibly remember the enormous number of winners and 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's an industry-ite supposed to do in a social situation when faced with 
possible award recipients? If they've won something or are up for an award, you 
can't not acknowledge them -- that wouldn't be in your best schmooze interest. 
</P>
<P>
 We suggest taking a noncommittal approach, something like, "Congratulations!" 
or "Hey -- way to go!" 
</P>
<P>
 If they have been honored, they'll be so flattered that you remembered. And if 
they haven't, they'll just figure you were congratulating them on getting that 
walk-on on "Babylon 5."

GALLERY: ONE-STOP WALK DOWN THE AISLE

 Teresa Moreno doesn't cry at weddings. But neither would you if you had 
witnessed hundreds of them, as she has, as the owner of La Catedral de Los 
Angeles Wedding Chapel & Bridal Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She runs the all-in-one storefront salon and chapel at Broadway and 3rd 
streets Downtown, smack in the middle of a bustling row of appliance stores and 
other bridal shops. 
</P>
<P>
 As buses roll by belching black smoke, some 15 to 20 weddings a week take 
place in the tiny chapel at the back of the shop, decorated with white ribbons 
and peach-colored silk flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples like it because it's close by, and they can get everything done 
here," says Moreno, who can outfit the bride from head to toe, rent tuxedos and 
even handle the marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she's been in business, Moreno has seen pretty much everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people will come at the last minute or come late," she says. 
"Or else it will come time for the exchange of the rings and someone will say, 
'Don't you have it?' 'No, I thought you had it!' in the middle of the ceremony. 
And sometimes when the priest says, 'You may kiss the bride,' the groom will 
say, 'No, you have red lipstick on.' And the video's there taping this." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the job never becomes routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Saturday I tell my girls, 'Now we'll see what happens today.' Am I a 
romantic? Yes. Because how can you do this every day and not be a romantic?"

DUBAI; MODERN LUXURY, ARAB TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIA SCOTT HARRISON, Harrison is a Boston-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flying back from Europe in 1986, I read a piece on Dubai camel racing in the 
British Air in-flight magazine. That's when the craving began. Half a dozen 
years later, I went to see for myself, and what I saw convinced me I should not 
wait so long for a return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Primped and primed by massive offshore oil revenues (by one estimate, $3 
billion-worth flows in a day), the most successful commercial trading center 
and the glamorous leisure capital of the Middle East, Dubai is at the 
crossroads of Asia, Europe and Africa. For more than two decades, Dubai, in the 
United Arab Emirates, has been growing into an oasis of global commerce, and 
now it's ripe with worldly pleasures. Seven hours from London, six hours from 
Frankfurt, eight hours from Hong Kong and four hours from Nairobi, it's a hop, 
skip and jump to a newly created recreational center of fun, games and luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the whispering shore of the Persian Gulf, along the eastern coast 
of the Arabian Peninsula, the emirate of Dubai is encompassed by sea, desert 
and the Hajar Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Just across the gulf from Iran, bordered on the west and south by Saudi Arabia 
and on the east by the Sultanate of Oman, Dubai is a state, as well as a 
beautiful, independent and vivacious city of striking Western and Arabian 
contrasts. At 1,500 square miles, it's a little bigger than the state of Rhode 
Island with a bank account as big as the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 In this exotic land, largely unfamiliar to most Americans, I observed the ways 
in which traditional Arab Muslim life blends with the more than 30 
nationalities making up the city's 250,000 inhabitants. Churches and mosques 
coexist in neighborly fashion. The government is controlled by Sheik Maktoum 
bin Rashid al Maktoum, of the ruling royal family, and there are no beggars on 
the tidy streets. Nor is there any crime. The pristine beaches are uncrowded, 
and people live life at a less harried pace than the West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmopolitan, sophisticated and more tolerant than most other Arab countries, 
this English-speaking city sparkles with prosperity and optimism as the dark 
cloud of the Gulf War recedes and regional stability allows the local society 
to focus on economic growth. Flying into the world-famous, duty-free airport, I 
noticed a horizon dominated by a Manhattan-type skyscraper, the World Trade 
Center, the tallest building in the Gulf and a symbol of Dubai's long-range 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisecting the city is the so-called Creek, a misnomer by the American-English 
definition. It's a huge waterway developed to facilitate local shipping, 
clogged with small wooden cargo vessels called dhows. Off in the distance are 
expansive docks with tankers and container ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubai, the leading international trading center of the Gulf, is one of the 
seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi, the federal capital, 
is less than two hours from Dubai; Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Qaiwain, Ras 
al-Khaimah and Fujairah are the other six. Building a backup economy to avert 
dependence on oil, which some predict could run out as soon as 30 years from 
now, although no official word on this is available, Dubai is beefing up its 
tourism, turning lemons into lemonade with its solar-power climate while 
courting new commerce for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifestyle of the Emirates is much more relaxed than that of Saudi Arabia. 
Dubai is so Westernized, in fact, that it is lightly admonished by some more 
formal and traditional Middle East countries. Many of the Arab businessmen in 
Dubai have been educated in the United States, and they have embraced many 
Western cultural ideals. Still, they reinforce their heritage and pride by 
wearing Arab dishdashas -- white gowns -- and headdresses called kaffiyeh, and 
by following the strict religious practices of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 With roads, hospitals, banks and communications, and a stable currency (the 
dirham), Dubai is often described as the Hong Kong of the Middle East. It is 
also the adult playground and sports capital of the gulf, as it is host to 
major tournaments in golf (Dubai Desert Classic), tennis (Dubai Duty Free 
Tennis Open), rugby (World Sevens Tournament), snooker, football, cricket, 
volleyball and chess. 
</P>
<P>
 Water sports on the calm gulf include speedboat races, sailing, yacht racing, 
snorkeling and big-league fishing for the abundant barracuda, tuna, kingfish 
and sailfish. On land, the Dubai Horse Show (the Dubai Jockey Challenge, this 
year in March) features legendary Arabian thoroughbreds with competitors from 
the other gulf states and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Excursions into the desert take in Arabian barbecues at a Bedouin camp, with 
prerequisite belly dancers, a "photo opportunity" while riding camels, desert 
safaris and excursions in rugged four-wheel-drive vehicles driven over wadis -- 
the dried-up riverbeds near the Hajar Mountains. Helicopter sightseeing rides 
take off from the Aviation Club, an interesting place to drink and dine, too. 
Trips to other emirates, as well as archeological sites, are arranged by 20 or 
so tour companies and via hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within the city, I roamed parks, such as lovely little Safa Park, where Arab 
families picnic on Fridays, and historical sections of town, where I saw 
ancient wind towers, tiny old houses with carved teak doors, the exquisite 
Jumeirah Mosque and the market area, which is divided into a gold souk and a 
spice souk, not far from the post office. Packed tightly are small "bargaining" 
shops with aromatic spices, herbal medicines, oils, perfumes, local clothing, 
fabrics, brassware and tons of 18- to 22-carat gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Camel Race Track, in the shifting white sands on the outskirts of the 
city, 5- and 6-year-old boys (Velcroed onto their seats so they don't fall off) 
jockey 50 or so galloping camels per race. With camels bred and priced like 
thoroughbred horses, selling at up to $2 million, the zesty national sport is 
taken very seriously. In the fancy viewing stands, one sees only Arab men 
dressed in white, wearing dark sunglasses, being served cool drinks by starched 
and bow-tied waiters. Visitors, male and female, are directed to separate 
sections. Gamblers note: This is not a betting track. 
</P>
<P>
 Defying the arid environment, Dubai opened the first 18-hole golf course in 
the Middle East, the Emirates Golf Club, in 1988. The course is an engineering 
miracle designed by American golf course architect Karl Litten and owned by the 
government, headed by the royal family. The clubhouse is unique -- a series of 
connected Bedouin-styled tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city, the Arabian atmosphere is intensified by the frequent 
sounds of prayers broadcast via loudspeakers from the tops of mosques. On the 
marketplace streets, in the old part of town, some women wear the mask of black 
leather, covering only the nose and mouth, and a black veil with a long 
traditional black dress. In this same part of town, a visit to the modest Dubai 
Museum, housing a 150-year-old fort, shows a few examples of historical 
clothing along with ancient weaponry. And if you're lucky enough, as I was, to 
run across a four-day-long wedding festival, you've captured a stunning Arabian 
memory. GUIDEBOOK

TRAVEL INSIDER: PUTTING THE OFFICIAL STAMP ON MIDDLE EAST BORDER CROSSINGS; 
PASSPORTS: POLICIES ARE CHANGING, BUT SOME ARAB COUNTRIES STILL BAN TRAVELERS 
WHO CARRY ISRAELI VISAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian leaders may be talking at last, but travelers between 
Israel and its Arab neighbors still need to pay close attention to their 
passports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Middle Eastern nations for years have refused to admit travelers bearing 
Israeli stamps in their passports. And even though relations between 
governments have been fitfully improving, U.S. State Department officials say 
some immigration agents may still cling to old policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But which immigration agents? That's the big complication, because reliable 
information is hard to come by. In many Arab nations (as in the United States), 
two different government representatives may answer the same question in 
opposite ways. Lacking reliable information, U.S. State Department officials 
say, they can't even offer a specific list of countries that ban Israeli 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a problem in Egypt, the most common neighboring destination of 
American travelers to Israel. Egypt has accepted Israelis and travelers with 
Israeli passport stamps since soon after the Camp David Accords of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 But tourism officials say a longtime ban officially remains in effect -- at 
least for now -- in other Arab nations, including Bahrain, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. (There does, however, 
appear to be growing flexibility in some quarters. Jordanian officials, for 
instance, say they now make their admissions decisions "on a case-by-case 
basis.") 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's advice is that travelers "consult the nearest U.S. 
Passport Agency for guidance." The Passport Agency's Southern California office 
is at 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Room 13100, Los Angeles 90024-3615; tel. (310) 
575-7070. (Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, its hours have changed from 9 a.m.-4 
p.m. to 8 a.m.-3 p.m.) But that office's phone number provides recorded 
information, and officials there may be too busy for detailed consultations. 
Here are some options: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask Israeli immigration agents to stamp a separate piece of paper, rather 
than your passport itself. Officials commonly go along with such requests, but 
travelers should remember that this is a judgment call; Israel notes that the 
decision "is at the discretion of authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a temporary second passport from the U.S Passport Agency. Until 1992, 
U.S. officials issued second passports specifically for travel to Israel. Since 
then, the U.S. has issued second passports that don't specifically name Israel, 
but serve the same purpose and are good for two years. U.S. officials require a 
lot of paperwork to issue such a passport, and often counsel against it; if you 
have two passports, you are far more likely to lose one, or hand over the wrong 
one at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make Israel the final stop on your itinerary. This is by far the best 
option, and if there's any uncertainty about passport approvals, travelers 
should take this measure either alone or in addition to one of those above. The 
worst that can happen is that you see all the countries you intended to, get 
stamped in Israel, and come home to the U.S., where you can decide at leisure 
whether you care to replace the passport. 
</P>
<P>
 (For decades, South African passport stamps have posed the same problems in 
Africa that an Israeli stamp did in the Arab world. But now, as South Africa 
emerges from its former pariah status and approaches its first post-apartheid 
election in April, many of those sanctions have eased. Within the last 18 
months, both Egypt and Kenya have changed policies and started admitting 
travelers with South African stamps on their passports. Tourism officials of 
all but a handful of Africa's 50-some nations have made similar changes.) 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what your passport strategy, it behooves travelers to Africa and the 
Middle East to make advance contact with foreign embassies in the U.S. to 
discuss visa requirements and other details. Travelers should also take 
particular care to stay apprised of unrest and political developments that 
could affect tourism. Recorded country-by-country updates are available from 
the State Department at (202) 647-5225. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should also remember that the busiest season for passport 
applications is March to July, when processing time can stretch from the usual 
two weeks to three or four or even longer. Applicants need not apply through 
the Passport Agency's Wilshire Boulevard office; many people can apply by mail, 
and most people can apply through the "acceptance facilities" at post offices 
and county courthouses throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, passport applicants need to provide proof of citizenship (such as a 
previous passport, birth certificate or certificate of naturalization), two 
photographs (each two inches square, in either color or black-and-white), 
evidence of identity (such as a driver's license or a military ID card), a $65 
fee (or $40 for travelers under 18) and an application form.

NEWS, TIPS AND BARGAINS; NEW HOTEL IN HUATULCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Omni Hotels has opened a 27-acre resort in Huatulco, Mexico, bringing to nine 
the number of four- and five-star accommodations in the resort area on Mexico's 
southern Pacific coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Omni Zaashila Resort is on Tangolunda Bay, center of development in 
Huatulco and already home to Club Med, Sheraton, Royal Maeva, Holiday Inn 
Crowne Plaza and Casa del Mar hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Huatulco, with its 22 miles of coastline and nine pristine bays, sits about 
300 miles south of Acapulco and is the last of the Mexican government's planned 
tourist destinations (the others are Cancun, Ixtapa, Los Cabos and Loreto). New 
development there is meant to reflect lessons that Mexico has learned at its 
other tourist resorts. About 80% of the land has been set aside for ecological 
purposes and building height limits have been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says Wenceslao Salas, Fonatur's U.S. representative in the United States, 
"we are looking to give Huatulco a more Mexican profile. In Cancun, there has 
been criticism that it could be in any part of Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet and secluded, Huatulco is short on nightclubs but long on natural 
beauty. "Huatulco is a great escape," says Skip Stearns, a vice president for 
Omni Hotels. "The lack of night life is limiting for a certain audience, but 
it's great for honey-mooners and small groups." 
</P>
<P>
 "The bays," Stearns says, "make for natural environment for snorkeling, 
diving, game fishing and all the water sports. The colonial city of Oaxaca is 
close by, as are some charming small villages. The challenge in front of all of 
us and even the Mexican government is to create greater awareness of Huatulco." 
 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the resort expected to receive 250,000 visitors, up from 165,000 in 
1992. Footloose With the Fab Four 
</P>
<P>
 Attention Beatle-maniacs: You can go where the Beatles went before you, thanks 
to two new walking tours of London sites associated with the rock group. 
Richard Porter, who has been called the "Beatle Brain of Britain," and who is 
president of the group's London fan club, sets off on a "Fab Four" trail twice 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays, the tour takes in Abbey Road studios, the Apple recording company 
offices and the site of the art gallery where John Lennon met his wife Yoko 
Ono. On Wednesday, the walk includes the registry office where Paul and Linda 
McCartney were married; Ringo Starr's flat in Montague Square, and Marylebone 
Station, where the opening scenes of the group's movie, "A Hard Day's Night" 
were filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Walks are about $6. For information and reservations, call London Walks in 
London, local tel. 624-3978. Customs Fees Going Up 
</P>
<P>
 Air and sea passengers returning to the U.S. will now have to add $6.50 to 
their travel budgets if their trips take them to Canada, Mexico or the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the fee the Customs Service is charging travelers re-entering the U.S. 
from those destinations. Congress authorized a $5 customs inspection fee in 
1985 for all travelers entering the U.S., but exempted those coming from 
Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. That exemption was dropped on Jan. 1, and the 
fee was increased from $5 to $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
 One important exemption remains: Passengers arriving on one of the frequent 
ferry boats from Canada don't have to ante up. Banning Smoking on International 
Flights 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines will begin trial smoking bans on two international routes on 
March 1. Through September, the airline will test consumer response to a ban on 
one of its two daily nonstops between New York's JFK Airport and London's 
Heathrow, and on daily service from Los Angeles to Auckland/Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, from early June through September, designated flights to London 
from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington Dulles also will be smoke-free. 
The change could become permanent or be extended to other flights.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: IDYLLWILD; A FAMILY SHARES LONG WALKS, HOMEY RESTAURANTS -- AND 
MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Gorman covers Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are, I figure, three ways to enjoy a weekend getaway in the local 
mountains, depending on one's aspirations and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high end, there's the skiing scene, accompanied by fancy lodges, 
liqueur-laced coffees on the patio, ski lifts, and a deathly fear of falling 
and breaking a leg. Recuperation follows in a pricey condo rental. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't ski. 
</P>
<P>
 It's far more gutsy, I've always told the kids, to ride free-style down a 
mountainside in a gyrating snow pan, holding on for dear life, having no 
control over your immediate future and knowing that when you do fall, you're 
already at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 On the low end of mountain getaways, there is camping: a purist's adventure 
where you share the ground with things that jump, crawl or slither in the 
night. You spend an inordinate amount of time stoking the campfire so you can 
defrost your feet, while explaining to your spouse that bathrooms are 
unnecessary trappings, and explaining to the kids that, until mid-century, 
millions of teen-agers got along without TV, let alone MTV.  
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, I hate sleeping on the ground. Been there, done that. It was called 
Scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle ground, then, is the cabin experience. This can be upscale: You can 
rent someone's private part-time home through a local realtor and probably pay 
20% to 50% more than for plain commercial cabins. But they're nice, and you can 
snoop a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Jeanne and I have found a comfortable middle-ground for our 
mountain cabin experience. We go to Idyllwild and stay at Woodland Park Manor. 
</P>
<P>
 Idyllwild is situated at 5,200 feet, on the western slope of Mt. San Jacinto, 
a half-hour drive above Hemet in Riverside County. It's not as high as Big Bear 
or Arrowhead, but is delightfully free of some of the rank commercialism that, 
for us, spoils a weekend in the trees. There's no McDonald's, Jack-in-the-Box 
or Burger King. And Idyllwild is our alternative to Palomar Mountain in 
northern San Diego County, where there are no overnight accommodations, save 
campgrounds.

<P>
 We made reservations for Woodland Park Manor months earlier, hoping for snow 
in mid-January. There are great places in Idyllwild for snow-panning, somewhat 
secluded slides where grown men can scream. However, we picked the driest 
January in the history of mankind. (Several inches of snow fell last Monday 
night and Tuesday; days have been sunny, with highs in the 30s and 40s.) We 
kept our reservation anyway because it beat the honey-do list back home. 
</P>
<P>
 We left for Idyllwild on a Friday afternoon, after our 13-year-old daughter, 
Cassie, got out of school. From Escondido, it was a 1 3/4-hour drive in our '89 
Aerostar. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Park Manor is an old favorite of ours, and not really an authentic 
cabin at all. It's a faux-cabin duplex, actually. The larger side -- which we 
rented -- features a great room with a queen bed, dining/game table, bentwood 
rocking chairs and a brick, wood-burning fireplace. There is a separate, 
spacious bathroom, small but efficient kitchen, and a small alcove for the 
second queen-size bed. The smaller half of the unit, which can be rented 
separately or together with the larger side, is only a bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the unit has always been spotlessly clean and functioning. No 
spiders. The cabin's biggest joy: Virtually one entire side is floor-to-ceiling 
glass, affording a view beyond a large deck onto the trees beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 We unpacked and decided to look for a restaurant rather than cook. Idyllwild, 
as a whole, closes at 8 p.m. but we had time for dinner at O.J.'s Creekside 
Cafe. The night's special: chicken fried steak ($4.99). Cassie went for 
spaghetti ($6.50). The only waitress was overworked with seven tables and erred 
by $10 when returning our change, but heck, it was late and she was tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night was a clash of family values. Thanks to bundles of wood stacked 
near the office and sold on the honor system, I started a fire in the fireplace 
and conjured visions of 'Smores, family bonding, quiet talking. Cassie 
discovered the cabin's TV was hooked up to cable (something we don't get in our 
neighborhood, quite to her humiliation at school). She bounced back and forth 
from the QVC shopping channel to MTV to Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the 'Smores won out, and I remembered how sweetly rich a melting 
marshmallow, softening a piece of a Hershey's bar and squished between graham 
crackers, can be. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to bed as the flickering fire played its light on the walls and 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's agenda was shopping. Idyllwild is chock with quaint ma-and-pa gift 
stores, art galleries, craft shops and consignment boutiques like the Cat's 
Meow, where old hats and handbags are cast as "vintage clothing." It seems 
everyone in town sells knit sweaters -- even the baseball-card collection shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores are confused. Georgia's, one in a series of 
cottages-turned-storefronts along the main drag, sells dolls, jewelry and, out 
back, a rather impressive collection of gourds. Go figure.  
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting complex -- a place that old-timer home-grown merchants 
have little use for -- is a two-story collection of stores called "The Center 
of Idyllwild." Locals know it as "the fort" because of its monolithic fortress 
appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing charming or quaint about the fort, and locals complain that 
it's too commercial. Too pricey. Too uptown. Way out of character for 
Idyllwild. But still, the stores are worth a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite store inside the fort is "Reflections of . . . " It is a 
glass-art gallery representing works by 60 artisans from around the world, 
brought here by the store's owner, a flight attendant for an international 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night we went to Queen of Angels Catholic Church for Mass, and 
instead of singing to an organ or guitars, were accompanied by a harpist and 
flutist. Now, that was quaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was Hamburger Helper back at the cabin; the evening was spent over 
cards, some TV, 'Smores and a fire that again put us to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday promised to be scary. In the absence of snow, we committed to a hike. 
The last time we walked for reasons other than shopping was to change channels, 
in the days before the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 We stayed clear of the more threatening-sounding trails -- ones that required 
permits from the local ranger. The visitor's guide suggested the Ernie Maxwell 
Scenic Trail, which started at Humber State Park, just up the street. A 
beginner's trek. Indeed, it was mostly level, a soft-dirt path two to three 
feet wide along the side of the mountain. When we sat to rest on a huge 
boulder, we could hear a half-dozen woodpeckers knocking for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hiking lessons we learned was, when you get too tired to continue, 
you've still got to walk back to your car. Hey, we're new at this stuff, OK? 
</P>
<P>
 We rewarded ourselves back in town with chocolate-peanut butter ice cream in 
waffle cones. After two nights of 'Smores, our taste buds were dead anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night's extravagant dining-out experience backfired. We went to the 
Chart House, the only name-place in Idyllwild. Without reservations, we were 
told at 6 that we'd be seated by 6:30. We made it by 7. The salad bar's 
croutons were crumbs. The iced-tea tasted like a fruit drink. And the waitress 
didn't check on how our meals were prepared (too rare) until we were virtually 
done. We should have stuck with the Hamburger Helper and Lipton's sun tea back 
at the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 That night: cards. TV. And more 'Smores. Again, we fell asleep as the 
firelight danced on the walls about us. Sure beats the Flintstone nightlight 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 We came home Monday after one final trek into Idyllwild's treasures: the gift 
shops. We recommend The Epicurean, if only for the view off its back deck. And 
we finally spent money at a place called TimberRidge: some wildlife jewelry and 
a wood burl-and-glass sculpture. We probably could have bought them back home, 
but our friends wouldn't be as impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 As we drove down the hill, Cassie seemed saddened. I'm not sure if she was 
missing the fire, the 'Smores, the hike down Ernie Maxwell Trail, or the 
cabin's cable TV. To cheer her up, we stopped in Murrieta at Costco. Budget for

MCNEE RANCH: VIEWS AND WIDE OPEN SPACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even a sign welcomes you to McNee Ranch State Park, 25 miles south of San 
Francisco on the San Mateo County coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the park lacks in such basics as signs and facilities, it more than 
makes up for in grand views and wide-open spaces. And oh, what views! The 
coastline from Half Moon Bay to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is at 
your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The panoramic view is a hiker's reward for the rigorous ascent up Montara 
Mountain, whose slopes form the bulk of the state park. This mountain, 
geologists say, is a 90-million-year-old chunk of granite that forms the 
northernmost extension of the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A coastal scrub community -- ceanothus, sage and monkey flower -- predominates 
on the mountain. The park also boasts several flower-strewn grasslands. 
Meandering down Montara Mountain is willow- and alder-lined Martini Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The park's trail system includes footpaths as well as Old San Pedro Road, a 
dirt road popular with mountain bikers. Little hiker symbols keep walkers on 
the trail, but since all routes climb Montara Mountain and more or less meet at 
the top, you needn't be overly concerned about staying on the "right" trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the state park, across Coast Highway, is Montara State Beach. This 
half-mile sand strand is a popular surfing, fishing and picnicking spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearest spot for provisions is the hamlet of Montara, where there's a cafe and 
grocery store. Accommodations include the Montara Lighthouse Hostel, which sits 
right on the coast next to a working lighthouse. The 30-bed hostel has kitchen 
facilities, a volleyball court and even an outdoor hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: Take California 1 to Montara and park in the lot at 
the north end of Montara State Beach. Carefully walk 150 yards up-coast and 
cross the highway. The unsigned trail begins at a pipe gate across a fire road 
on the inland side of Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Walk up the fire road a short distance and join the trail on your 
left. It swings north, up-coast, over a seasonally flowered grassy slope. The 
path drops to join a dirt road, then begins ascending once more. 
</P>
<P>
 As you climb, you'll pass two benches, strategically placed for you to catch 
your breath. The dirt road eventually swings south, but you join a footpath and 
ascend to a saddle. Two trails lead left to the peak and to some terrific 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Below you, up-coast, is the town of Pacifica and, beyond, the Golden Gate 
Bridge and San Francisco Bay. Montara Mountain Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: McNee Ranch State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 7 miles round trip, with 2,000-foot elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Coastal, scrub-covered Montara Mountain, the far northern extension 
of the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Fabulous coastal vistas from Half Moon Bay to Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate to strenuous. 
</P>

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: COMING CLEAN: AIRLINES AND HOTELS SPEAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During a long airplane flight, there can be nothing more relaxing than sacking 
out with a blanket and pillow. Once at the hotel room, there's the joy of 
kicking off the shoes and stretching out on the bedspread, novel in hand, 
content in the thought that everything we touch is spotlessly clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanliness standards are high, according to airline, hotel and motel 
officials. But housekeeping practices vary from airline to airline and hotel to 
hotel. It is possible, for example, that a pillow used on the second leg of a 
flight was used by someone else on the first leg. Should that be the case, 
physicians say, travelers can increase their chances of contracting colds and 
other minor ailments. Yet a sharp eye and planning can cut exposure risks. 
</P>
<P>
 How often are those airline pillows and blankets cleaned or replaced? Airline 
spokespersons use words such as "frequently" and "as needed." In truth, it 
depends on the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our cleaners go through, they inspect all blankets and pillows each 
night," said Linda Burke, a spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines. "Pillow cases 
are changed each night. Wool blankets on board are washed as needed." 
</P>
<P>
 On that schedule, a pillow used on the first leg of the flight could be used 
by another on the second. But with each plane stocking about 20 pillows and a 
dozen blankets, Burke said, travelers who ask a flight attendant for fresh 
linens should be able to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Alaska Airlines, used pillow cases are changed after each flight segment, 
according to spokesman Lou Cancelmi, and also at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankets are inspected not just daily but after each flight segment, Cancelmi 
said. If a blanket is not damaged or soiled, it is refolded and put away. 
Blankets are dry-cleaned on an as-needed basis, with the frequency determined 
by those who inspect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Seat back covers are changed after each flight segment "if there is any 
indication of soil, drink spillage" or other problems, Cancelmi said. The same 
is true of bottom seat cushion covers. 
</P>
<P>
 At hotels and motels, clean linens "are an important part of quality 
assurance," said Ann Curtis, of Choice Hotels International, which operates 
Rodeway, Clarion Hotels and other lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel and motel operators turn to guidelines provided by the Educational 
Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Assn., according to an association 
spokeswoman. It gives advice on how often to replace mattresses and other 
furnishings, along with cleaning tips. "Bedding (mattresses and box springs) is 
replaced every three to five years, depending on occupancy," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels change sheets and pillow cases every day, but the frequency of 
bedspread washing seems to vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bedspreads are washed when changed and they are changed once a week or (more 
often) as needed," said Linda Swearingen, director of housekeeping for the 
Westin Bonaventure Hotel, Los Angeles. At the Biltmore, Los Angeles, bedspreads 
are changed and cleaned "once a month, minimum," or more often, if soiled, 
according to spokeswoman Holly Barnhill. Why don't hotels launder bedspreads 
daily? "The bedspreads don't come into contact with the guests," said one 
housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what might a traveler catch from less-than-pristine linens? 
</P>
<P>
 On an airplane "it is definitely possible, if someone uses a pillow used an 
hour or two earlier (by someone with a cold), to pick up a cold," said Dr. 
Ralph Hansen, chief of infectious disease at Century City Hospital. However, 
catching influenza in this way is unlikely, he noted, because the flu virus is 
more apt to be transmitted through the air. The viruses and bacteria that cause 
most transmissible diseases, he said, don't survive long outside an infected 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Because bed linens are usually washed frequently and in hot water, they 
probably don't pose much risk of disease transmission, but bedspreads could, 
Hansen said. "Even I don't like to hang out on hotel bedspreads," said Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, dirty bedding could be a source of head lice or scabies (a skin 
infection caused by a tiny mite), added Dr. Bernard Raskin, a Valencia 
dermatologist and UCLA assistant clinical professor of dermatology. "Those are 
both long shots, even though lice can last a few days in linens. But the 
reality is, lice are usually caught on a person-to-person basis." He cites 
children sharing combs as a common route. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergy-prone travelers and those hoping to avoid colds might consider taking 
along their own pillow or pillowcases during travel, Hansen said. Some 
allergists suggest travelers wrap hotel bed pillows in a plastic bag, then 
replace the pillow case to cut down on contact with allergens and molds within 
the pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who encounter soiled linens can easily solve the problem. "Call the 
general manager or the front desk," Curtis said, and most hotels will restock 
them promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

TAKING THE PLUNGE; AT GUADELOUPE, THE 'ISLAND WITH EVERYTHING,' THE IDEA WAS TO 
STAY IN THE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM Z. HORVATH, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A huge cement cross loomed above us, a monument to shipwrecks offshore; 
equally huge rocks loomed below. We loomed somewhere in the middle, clawing our 
way toward the top of Guadeloupe's easternmost cliff -- and straight into a 
bloodthirsty thornbush. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the same thought hit us both: 
</P>
<P>
 This was our Caribbean beach vacation? 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. I was on the first Caribbean island of my life, and I'd already learned 
and forgotten the great lesson of the Antilles within 24 hours of arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this: Stay in the water. Nothing bad can happen to you there. In the 
water, impossibly warm and clear, everything's wonderful and nothing matters. 
Float. Dive. Mmmmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof had come immediately the day before. From the terrace of our 
miniature cottage, we'd looked down on our hotel's tiny cove, where we intended 
to make our first Caribbean plunge together. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like a deserted mud flat. But after six hours in airplanes and 
airports, we had pledged to swim at the earliest opportunity. Now dusk was 
hitting the surf before we were. Down a dark path we hurried, gripping hotel 
towels and upholding an unspoken pact of I'll-keep-smiling-if-you-will. 
</P>
<P>
 We pitched ourselves into the water, and everything changed. We surfaced in a 
new landscape, or at least in a new perspective. What lovely brown sand (not 
mud after all), what a glorious view, what a cute little cove. 
</P>
<P>
 And now we couldn't stop smiling. Everything was wonderful; nothing mattered. 
We floated. We dived. Mmmmmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, I know. I wouldn't believe it, either. That Caribbean Sea, sure, it's 
nice and warm and it turns a dozen pretty shades of blue and green and it's so 
buoyant that it gathers around you and lifts you like an invisible cushiony 
raft, yeah, yeah, but it doesn't have miracle healing powers, correct?  
</P>
<P>
 All I know is, we stayed in that modest little cove past nightfall, until the 
hotel turned its spotlight on the water and got a bright eyeful of my 
girlfriend and me swirling around together like those giddy tourist couples in 
TV commercials. When we climbed back up the bluff, our wicker-furnished room, 
which had looked just maybe a tad shabby at first, now looked like one of the 
all-time travel finds, our own private treehouse over the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it because of the water that even the farmland scenery of Guadeloupe's 
interior would seem so bewitching? That sugar, chocolate, coffee, avocados, 
grapefruits and bananas would taste like nothing else in this world? That for 
once in our lives we would tan and tan but never burn? 
</P>
<P>
 It was suddenly clear why Caribbean travelers often just select an island, 
step onto the nearest beach, and then barely budge until the plane leaves, 
attempting no tasks more demanding than deciding on a level of sunscreen or the 
color of a cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, this great lesson didn't quite take. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all, we'd chosen Guadeloupe because it was the island with everything. 
"The Caribbean in miniature," was one guidebook's enthusiastic phrase, picked 
up during our long sojourns in bookstore travel sections. We were bound and 
determined to do it all. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the island with both a volcano and a casino; with sands of nearly 
every color and a rain forest with a permanent rainbow; with some of the best 
snorkeling, some of the best French and Creole food, some of the best roads. It 
was the island so diverse it was actually two islands, one of flat coral and 
the other volcanic and mountainous, separated by the only channel in the world 
connecting the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the week, we would circumnavigate both the mountainous 
Basse-Terre and flat Grande-Terre and visit a tiny offshore island to boot -- 
despite numerous wrong turns, several missed or misread road signs (they're in 
French), and temptations to spend hours each day eating dishes that were a 
total mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever we went, we looked for the water, to wash all that traveling away. It 
wasn't just the 11 beaches we sampled; we also bathed under two waterfalls, 
swam laps in a farm-country hot springs, snorkeled among hundreds of fish at 
Jacques Cousteau's favorite reef, and even got wet in the rain -- in the rain 
forest, of course. On our first day, we drove five minutes to Guadeloupe's 
largest white-sand beach, Plage Caravelle, which gave shape to our cottage's 
ocean view. Caravelle was bustling -- mostly with vendors walking up and down 
the shoreline with plates of pastries, calling "Cho-cho-chocolat," the French 
Caribbean equivalent of "Peanuts hear." But the water was serene. This is Club 
Med's location, and the perfect line of palms is certainly the resort's doing, 
but in Guadeloupe all beaches are public up to the high-tide mark. We pulled up 
a palm and sat down for the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the afternoon that we headed to the eastern tip of the island, 
Pointe des Chateaux, and lost our heads for a minute climbing up to the giant 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
 We did finally reach the top, a little scratched and a little shaky. We were 
rewarded with a view back over the entire upper island of Grande-Terre -- and 
the realization that we had totally missed the nice little path built for 
tourists. But a quick dip in the breakers below eased the pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a beach all the way to the west did the same thing. We had to 
take care of business in the morning -- changing money in the busy, 
traffic-plagued center city, Pointe-a-Pitre, and changing our rental car 
because the first one had proved a little unreliable in the steering, brakes 
and ignition departments. Armed with new wheels, we sped onto the mountainous 
lower island of Basse-Terre -- and drove right through the national park that 
was our destination, without realizing it. (Those darn little French signs 
again.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our consolation was the beach on the other side: La Grande Anse, a wild, empty 
stretch the color of raw sugar, with water that we stayed in for an hour at a 
time. Adding to the beach's mystique was a palm-shaded restaurant, Karacoli, 
with fiery stuffed crab and its own hidden entrance onto the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Day Three was our grand tour of Grande-Terre, bracketing the island's northern 
point, named literally "The Great View," with visits to three different beaches 
on the route. At one, Anse Laborde, the beach hosted a cow; at the next, Anse 
de Souffleur, the beach had a cemetery. We reached that one at sunset, and 
walked through the memorials of black and white tile and fresh bouquets lit by 
a purple sky. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned the next day to the park, by way of Basse-Terre's gorgeous rolling 
farmland and a hot springs turned into a spa. Once in the park, a short hike 
brought us to a waterfall where locals and tourists swam together, with the 
veterans showing the neophytes how to sit directly under the falls and dive 
through to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the coldest water we had been in, and we didn't care. We dried off, sat 
down with a picnic of baguettes and Camembert, and then jumped into the 
waterfall again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a day on the offshore island Terre-de-Haut, with fine coves of its own, 
we had our last marine adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 First we took a glass-bottomed boat to Pigeon Island, whose coral reef 
preserve, often featured by Jacques Cousteau, is now named after him. The place 
is a haven for divers, but mere snorkelers can swim amid entire schools of 
curious rainbow-colored fish just as easily -- even first-timers like me. It 
was, I imagine, like visiting outer space, only better because of the 
refreshing ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 There was still the promise of one more waterfall, and the accomplishment of 
rounding the southern end of Basse-Terre -- the one coastline we hadn't 
traveled. The mountain roads revealed wonderful views and a choice of more 
beaches to sample, but the road up to the falls called "Chutes du Carbet" 
proved to be another trip into new territory.  
</P>
<P>
 A half-hour hike, well marked, brought us to the middle falls of a set of 
three. This one was 200 feet high and boiling; nearby, we slipped into one of 
its steaming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 We did skip a few things. We missed the Rum Museum. We passed over merchants 
hawking "Your Name on a Grain of Rice." We spent only an hour in the casino and 
never explored the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been a very long drive and a very long hike. And there would 
have been nowhere to swim. GUIDEBOOK

 Going to Guadeloupe 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: American Airlines flies round-trip from LAX to Guadeloupe, with 
a change of planes in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Lowest available fare is $767. The 
island is part of France: You need a passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The clear winner was our own selection, La Toubana in Ste-Anne 
(from the U.S., tel. 011-590-88-25-78). Our cottage -- bedroom, bathroom and 
kitchenette -- was not fancy but was completely private, with a large terrace 
looking out to sea. The grounds were beautiful, the staff cheery and helpful, 
the restaurant excellent and our cove -- where we never saw another soul -- one 
of our favorite parts of the trip. High-season price: $175 double, including 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hotels: 
</P>
<P>
 Hamak in St-Francois (tel. 011-590-88-59-99), named for the hammocks on each 
patio, is the priciest resort. The grounds are very pleasant and so are the 
hammocks, but the rooms are neither particularly private nor elegant for the 
money. Price: about $300 for a double, including breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel Arawak (tel. 011-590-84- 24-24), on the Gosier strip, seemed to have the 
best beach in that area and was tastefully designed for a high-rise. A more 
affordable alternative at about $215 for a double, including breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Relais du Moulin (tel. 011- 590-88-13-78) near St-Francois was probably the 
best bargain we saw. It's not on the water, but the hotel beaches aren't the 
best ones anyway. This one has individual cabins with views and a fine 
restaurant. Price: about $100 for a double, incuding breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: It's difficult to eat lunch for under $20 or dinner for under 
$30 per person unless you picnic. Here are some non-hotel restaurants worth the 
money: 
</P>
<P>
 Le Rocher du Malendure, overlooking Pigeon Island, won for best setting and 
best cold fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant Karacoli, Grand Anse beach, has terrific Creole food. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Relais Caraibe, Gosier, serves Creole food and lots of charm. 
</P>
<P>
 L'Affamilar, Gosier, was a bargain serving pizzas and grills.

TERRE-DE-HAUT: GREAT BEACHES . . . NO CARS

 The last thing you should need to do on a Caribbean island is go to yet 
another Caribbean island. But there's an undeniable allure to going somewhere 
even smaller, more unspoiled, more secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs all over the Caribbean lure tourists with this idea, setting up 
excursions to privately-owned sandbars dressed up with a few beach chairs. But 
Terre-de-Haut, part of the tiny Les Saintes archipelago off the coast of 
Guadeloupe, is an island where you might want to live. We spent a day; we would 
have enjoyed a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Terre-de-Haut is six square miles of beaches, hills and views, all accessible 
by bicycle, motor scooter -- and nothing else. There are no private cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferries from Pointe-a-Pitre (75 minutes) and Basse-Terre (30 minutes) on 
Guadeloupe are the prime connection with the mainland for day-trippers and a 
community of year-round residents. There are also airplane connections from the 
Pointe-a-Pitre airport. Tour vans meet the ferries, but you can easily navigate 
yourself along the few roads. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't see many of the best sights; we could hardly leave the first beach 
we visited. Baie de Pont Pierre is a shallow cove of brilliant color, protected 
from the Atlantic breakers by a natural rock formation that you can swim to and 
easily climb. The dramatic view from the top takes in Guadeloupe seven miles to 
the north and Dominica around 40 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The other end of the island features more beaches and a 21-room hotel, Bois 
Joli, that gets good reviews in several guidebooks. Next time, we'd stay there.

SYRIA; WARM WELCOMES, DAMASCUS TO ALEPPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE KAYAL, Kayal is a free-lance writer based in Prague, Czech Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blue light of dusk had already begun to settle over this ancient city when 
we spotted the sign. We sprinted across the rush hour traffic, ignoring the 
honking taxis. "Look!" we shouted to each other as we pointed at the words 
overhead: "Saad Kayal, M.D." The family name in lights. And a doctor, too! 
</P>
<P>
 My roots brought me to Syria, but I had as little idea what to expect as any 
other American. I grew up a mall-going, Long Island girl and have none of the 
dark, sultry features that I associated with Syrians (wrongly, as I soon found 
out). And I always cringed slightly when someone linked me to that troublesome 
dictatorship bordering Iraq. I speak no Arabic, and my father and my uncle have 
forgotten most of theirs. Being a Syrian American meant only that I knew how to 
concoct a number of wonderful dishes, and that I had a box full of gold bangles 
and a jangly pair of filigree earrings from Aleppo, the city of my paternal 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 But when my sittau -- my grandmother -- died two years ago, severing our last 
link to Arab culture, my uncle decided that he and I should go scratch around 
the family's ancestral stamping grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Our journey began last October, just days after the world cheered a historic 
and unexpected peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (an agreement that Syria did not back then, and silently 
threatened to scuttle). Two Americans going to the demon Middle East? Were we 
crazy? Our friends thought so, and their most frequent parting remark -- "Be 
careful" -- only unsettled us more. 
</P>
<P>
 Our misgivings melted as soon as we touched down in Damascus. The crimeless 
streets (one of the benefits of a dictatorship) were full of European tourists 
-- Germans, French and British who apparently hadn't heard that this was a 
dangerous vacation spot. Most of the Syrians were eager to greet us and 
practice their English, the second language that appeared on many of the signs 
throughout the country. On our first day, an attendant at the dusty, 
artifact-filled National Museum was so happy to meet some Americans firsthand 
that he gave us eight postcards "for friendship." A boy of about 11 ran up to 
us in the street to ask where we were from. "Welcome to our country," he said. 
Those were the words we would hear most often during our two-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a warm welcome, Syria offers cities with cosmopolitan bustle 
and a 1930s charm, spectacular desert landscapes and ancient ruins straight out 
of an archeologist's dream. The travel is rugged and the word "luxury" has a 
slightly different meaning, but for adventurers who don't mind earthiness, the 
payoffs are well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, which claims to be the oldest inhabited city on earth (some say 
9,000 years old), the air swells with music and perfume. Four times a day, and 
once more at sunset, the hypnotic call to prayer, "Allah akbar" ("God is 
Great") floats up from the city's 250 mosques and beats softly against the 
sawdust-brown hills that border the city. Fragrances that I had known only in 
my sittau's home -- grilled lamb, mint, sweet, thick cardamom-scented coffee -- 
unfurl through the streets and mingle with the sweet jasmine that grows 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 To see the rest of the country and find our way 200 miles north to Aleppo, we 
hired a taxi, as we'd been told was the custom even for long distances. Our 
72-year-old driver, Essmayel, who spoke English well and had two gold incisors, 
took his duty seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have come to see your country," he said. "You shall see everything you 
want!" He'd told us that in Syria "there is a ruin every 25 centimeters." He 
seemed determined that we should see them all.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of climbing around ruins in southern Syria, we piled into 
Essmayel's 1983 yellow Nissan at 6 a.m. We would head east across the desert 
about 150 miles to Palmyra, where Queen Zenobia -- Syria's answer to Cleopatra 
-- had dared to challenge Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 We were the only ones on the road, save an occasional truck filled with red 
peppers or pomegranates usually coming down the middle lane in the opposite 
direction. Essmayel's wife had come along and, like every good sittau , she 
kept us well-supplied with apples, almond bars, sweet pistachio cakes and 
cardamom-flavored bubble gum. She also brought a Coleman vacuum bottle full of 
ice water that we cracked open just before the desert began. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria's tarred strip of highway cuts the wide plain like a river. Mud-packed 
mountains with jagged rock atop swell in the distance like giant ant hills. 
They made us feel like a board-game-sized car driving through a diorama. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust and road grit covered our windshield, our sunglasses, our teeth. But 
somewhere around mile 100 of the Cham Desert, the hard-packed earth gives way 
to lush olive groves, grape vines and fields of wheat and cotton. Essmayel 
poked me in the ribs and yelled, "This is Syria!" He waved his hand out the 
window and swept it across the plain where irrigation pumps and pipeline-sized 
concrete troughs carry precious water all the way to the horizon. "Big 
tractors," Essmayel said, "make it like California!" 
</P>
<P>
 The desert is full of such surprises. Contradictions cluster so close together 
they become difficult to comprehend: Cave dwellings lay 100 yards from condos; 
robed Bedouins ride tractors. A few miles further, a woman in a chador, the 
traditional Muslim dress, stood hitchhiking. 
</P>
<P>
 We passed the only herd of camels we would see as we drew near Palmyra. The 
1960s version of the American song "The Name Game" came on the radio mixed with 
the smell of a cucumber being peeled in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmyra appears through the dust like a handful of pink amethyst strewn across 
the sand. The rosy skeleton of the city is so well-preserved that you can 
easily visualize the bustle of the 80,000 merchants and businessmen who made it 
the capital of the spice and silk trade nearly 2,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mile-long main avenue lies like a parade route toward the hilltop citadel 
that cracks the sapphire sky. It seems as if it has all of its original 300 
columns (though less than half remain), and pieces of the limestone roadway 
still bear the grooves of wagon wheels. Intact facades of long-gone shops lie 
just outside the columns. The trail of history at Palmyra, though, is most 
visible at the Temple of Bel, whose monstrous pillars and sacrificial table 
stand side by side with remnants of a mosque, built on a church, built on a 
pagan temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmyra had its greatest day in the 3rd Century, when Queen Zenobia proclaimed 
the kingdom's independence from Rome (after helping to assassinate her husband, 
some believe). She conquered all of Syria and lower Egypt and was preparing to 
go further when the Romans arrived and carted her off -- in gold chains, no 
less. With her departure, Palmyra soon became nothing more than a faded 
frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
 Near sunset, we climbed to the citadel, accompanied part of the way by a 
Bedouin boy who played his reed for us. Standing in the cusp of the hill, 
something Essmayel had said suddenly made sense to me. When I had asked him how 
the pain and hatred between Israel and the Arabs could be overcome to bring the 
new peace -- which everyone we spoke to said they wanted -- he responded: "We 
have a great history. We understand such things." 
</P>
<P>
 I had stewed over those words for days. But it was only as I watched the 
remains of almyra below us begin to glow red that I understood what Essmayel 
had meant. In this part of the world, even the most pitched battles merge in 
the swirl of history, where they mellow and eventually become part of the 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before Israel released 700 Palestinians as a concession to peace, 
we set out for the final leg of our journey to Aleppo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours west of Palmyra, we stopped at the Krak des Chevaliers, an imposing 
Crusaders castle standing hawklike on its perch above the landscape. It was 
overcome by 13th-Century Muslim forces who were smart enough to employ that old 
Trojan Horse trick: They sent a forged letter in the name of the defenders' 
commander advising them to surrender. Then we turned north and stopped at 
Hamath, a ruin that's only 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamath is famous for its giant wooden waterwheels built in the Middle Ages to 
irrigate the city's gardens and orchards. In 1982, it was all but destroyed by 
the tanks of Syrian President Hafez Assad, who bombarded the town to suppress a 
Muslim fundamentalist uprising. Of the city's more than 30 waterwheels, only 10 
remain. Their tattered planks rise along the shores of the Orontes River, but 
serve as little other than diving platforms for local teen-agers. A colossal 
statue of Assad marks the entrance to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad, in fact, makes sure everyone remembers who's boss by plastering his 
image all over the country. We caught three different profiles of him even 
before we got through customs. Assad sports a number of different looks: 
there's the debonair "Belmondo" Assad, with half-cocked head and eyes squinting 
with laughter; the serious General Assad; angelic Assad with a gold corona, to 
name but a few. Some of these are enormous, backlit portraits with lights 
strung around them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the road continues north, the soil turns from dusty brown to rich red 
ochre. We passed pomegranate trees bending under their ruby weight as my uncle 
and Essmayel drilled me on my newly learned Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 We started with personal pronouns. "Ana, Inta, he'a, who'a" ("I," "you," 
"she," "he"). I practiced over and over. I had already begun to understand 
simple sentences without realizing it, as a part of my brain closed since 
childhood had suddenly opened. I hadn't realized that I knew any Arabic at all, 
except for certain food words and the phrase "Ateeni bosi" -- "Give me a kiss" 
-- a standard part of any grandchild's lexicon. My uncle, who like my father 
had grown up speaking Arabic but now remembered only basic phrases, stared at 
me in amazement as I repeated to him in English bits of his rudimentary 
conversations with people. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons ended around dusk on our approach to Aleppo. I reached back and 
squeezed my uncle's hand in excitement. We stared out the window silently with 
butterflies in our stomachs as we noticed something we hadn't seen in Damascus: 
white-painted metal terraces -- filigreed, just like my earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 After checking into our hotel, we hurried down the tree-lined avenues toward 
the center of town. A right turn, a left turn, a right turn and suddenly the 
street opened onto a blue-lit boulevard, wide with fountains and sidewalk 
cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 My family early had weaned me from romantic visions of my grandfather's 
pre-American life. When I was small, I thought that my giddau had ridden a 
camel, but I was informed that Giddau was from a city, and therefore most 
likely had never even seen a camel. Sittau's parents had come from Aleppo even 
before Giddau, so no one had any information about their lives. That left me 
with no images to conjure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jumble of Aleppo's ancient history and cosmopolitan flair gave me some 
answers. Smartly dressed families pack the city's restaurants and men fill the 
coffee houses, smoking four-foot-high water pipes as they play cards. The 
white-tiled pastry shops look like pizza joints, with customers yelling out 
orders and teen-age waiters hurrying to deliver stacks of rosewater sweets. 
Shops proffer shoes from Paris and finely made clothing. The tawdry bustle of 
Baron Street contrasts with the faded elegance of the 84-year-old Baron Hotel, 
where Lawrence of Arabia stayed and where, some say, 30 years ago guests could 
shoot ducks off the balcony. And although there had been 80 years between 
Giddau's departure and my arrival, the 1957 Chevy taxi cabs let me know that 
things probably hadn't changed all that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner was another revelation. In southern Syria, we had begun to think that 
our relatives were the only Syrians who ate stuffed grape leaves hot and in 
tomato sauce. In Damascus, they serve the leaves cold, with olive oil (in the 
Greek fashion that most Americans know). But here in Halab, the Arabic name for 
Aleppo, they arrived steaming, just like Sittau's. The other delights of Syrian 
cuisine -- babaghannouj (an eggplant dip), hummus (made from chick peas and 
garlic), tabbouleh (a parsley salad), kibbeh (fried lamb with wheat) -- were 
the same as in Damascus, but with the addition of something special: mamuniyya 
. Mamuniyya is a childhood breakfast treat made from farina and sugar that 
Damascenes had curled their lips at when telling me they didn't have it. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the medieval covered bazaar, the souk, a living 
contradiction to the sophistication of the cafe district. Imagine the frenzy of 
a street where a fire or earthquake is under way; that is what the souk is 
like. Rampaging donkeys and boys on bikes careen through the covered alleyways 
saddled with sacks of allspice and coffee. We wandered past stall after stall 
of red peppers, green beans, whole lambs, halves of lambs, eyes of lamb, every 
conceivable part of lamb and stopping to have coffee with a trader, who told us 
he had cousins in New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
 Our new friend led us to the gold souk (the shopping areas are divided 
according to life's basic needs: food, clothing and gold), where we bought a 
bangle by haggling the merchant to submission ("Sittau used to do this in 
Macy's," my uncle said to me, closing his eyes with remembered mortification). 
We stumbled out of the souk giggling like drunks and covered with a fine soot 
of cardamom, coffee and donkey dust. We squinted like moles in the sunlight as 
we made our way to the nearby citadel, which stands at the market's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, we decided to try to locate some family, although, after eight 
decades we knew the odds were slim. There were plenty of our namesakes about, 
however -- one was the chief of police, we found out, and the others were 
apparently very wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 What we found was a gravel-voiced former journalist, Giddau's first cousin, 
who had the same distinctive jowls that I remember on my grandfather. We found 
him by asking after any Kayals at the Byzantine church where we figured my 
grandfather had been a member. One of the laymen led us through the winding 
alleyways of the Christian quarter, knocking on doors until we found the right 
family. Joseph Kayal greeted us with surprise and fondly referred to my 
grandfather, Mitchell, as "Mike." We stayed for tea, took a photo of all of us 
together, then went back out into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 We left Aleppo two days later. We were eager to show my parents the photos of 
Giddau's cousin, and yet, tracking our relatives had somehow seemed 
anti-climactic. We were far more excited about our photos of Palmyra and the 
Syrian children. As we drove back down the highway we'd come in on, we realized 
that we were only one small punctuation mark in the history of the land that 
claims to be the cradle of civilization, the beginning of everybody's roots -- 
even of our skeptical friends back home. GUIDEBOOK

 A Sortie to Syria 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: From Los Angeles, Lufthansa offers daily service to Damascus 
through Frankfurt. TWA also connects to Damascus through various European 
cities. KLM has a weekly connection to Damascus through Amsterdam. Round-trip 
air fare on all carriers is $1,924 through May. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: Within the cities, the easiest way to travel is on foot or by 
taxi. Syria has friendly, honest cab drivers, and taxis are cheap (a ride 
across town in Damascus cost us about 50 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 For an inter-city driver, visit any of the dozens of travel agencies in the 
hotel districts of Damascus and Aleppo. Ten days of escorted private travel and 
round-trip transportation from Damascus to Aleppo cost us $660. In Aleppo, 
cruise down Baron Street and stop in at one of the agencies or go to the 
Tourist Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnak Tours and Transport operates daily tours to major cities and sites 
around Syria. In Damascus, tel. 221-492 or 226-136; in Aleppo, 210-248). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: In Damascus, we stayed at the the Omayad Hotel (4 Brasil St., 
P.O. Box 7811, Damascus, Syria; from the U.S., telephone 011-963-11-21-77-00). 
Doubles begin at $70 with breakfast. The Cham Palace (Maysaloun Street, P.O. 
Box 7570, Damascus; tel. 011-963-11-232-300), is a luxury Hilton-style affair.

<P>
 In Aleppo, the Tourism Hotel (Majd al-Din al Jabri, Aleppo, Syria; tel. 
011-963-21-210-156 or 210-158) is dull looking but full of 1930s ambience. 
Doubles begin at $48 with breakfast. The Hotel Baron (P.O. Box 130, Aleppo; 
011-963- 21-221-0880, fax 221-8164) has run-down nostalgic charm, complete with 
rotating ceiling fans. Doubles: $31 with breakfast.

HOT DATES; SAMPLING THE FRUITS OF THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

California Farm Cookbook (Pelican Publishing, $26.95).

<TEXT>
<P>
 The winter harvest season is to me one of the most picturesque times of year 
to visit the Coachella Valley. Gone is the intense summer heat and its 
lingering desert haze, replaced instead by balmy breezes and brilliant blue 
skies. Palms laden with the year's date crop stand at attention across the 
desert like rows of green feather dusters on parade. I walk among the towering 
trees listening to the breezes move through the fronds, while the sun's rays 
play a symphony of gold on the heavy bunches of ripe fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to observe the painstaking harvesting process -- one that still relies 
on the skill of experienced hands. In many Coachella Valley groves, this is the 
job of pickers, or palmeros, who climb up the trees and attach themselves to 
the trunk with a heavy chain laced through their picking belts. Wielding a 
machete, the palmero slices off a bunch of ripe dates and lowers it, attached 
to a large metal hook, to a partner waiting below. Clouds of dust engulf the 
earth-bound workers as they manually shake the dates loose into a large bin. As 
the harvesting trucks purr their way through the grove, tree limbs stripped of 
dates remain scattered on the ground like skeletal bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, palm trees and date-bearing palms especially, have always had special 
meaning for me. When I was growing up in Casablanca, my parents sometimes took 
my brother and me to spend a weekend in Marrakech, a historic town in southern 
Morocco. To this day when I visit, I plan my arrival for sunset, when the 
town's graceful, ocher-colored minarets emerge like beacons from the 3,000-acre 
grove of date palms encircling it. During the fall harvest season, vendors sit 
in the shadow of the graceful, towering trees, hawking bunches of freshly 
picked dates to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same atmosphere prevails throughout the Coachella Valley that cradles 
Indio and the appropriately named town of Mecca, where dozens of varieties of 
dates can be purchased at roadside stands. And it is there that I like to 
explore not just the expansive groves themselves (the area produces 95% of all 
the dates consumed nationally), but what there is to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, my husband and I spent the day cruising through the valley from 
Cabazon southeast to Indio and on to Thermal. We meandered through the ritzy 
desert outposts of Rancho Mirage and Indian Wells to the older, more modest 
farm communities of Thermal and Coachella, tracing an L-shaped itinerary of 
about 50 miles through the heart of California's date country. 
</P>
<P>
 Next weekend is a good time to explore, as well as to eat, when the National 
Date Festival at the Riverside County Fairgrounds in Indio (Feb. 18-27) 
presents a plethora of events, including camel races, costumed vendors and a 
date cook-off. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Coachella Valley, the date of choice is the semi-soft, amber-colored 
Deglet Noor (or "date of light" in Arabic), sold nationally as the California 
date. It accounts for 95% of the harvest here, but it is accompanied by the 
sweet and soft, caramel-like Halawy (which means sweet), its cousin the 
Khadrawy (green) and, finally, the small and golden, semi-soft Zahidi 
(nobility). To me these all present unique and separate opportunities for 
eating and cooking and the perfect excuse for a drive. 
</P>
<P>
 While dates are mainly thought of in the United States as a kind of exotic 
snack, they are an integral part of the cultural lore of North Africa and the 
Middle East. There, tradition dictates that a platter piled high with the 
sweetest and plumpest dates -- usually Medjools -- accompanied by a glass of 
milk, be offered to guests as a sign of welcome. In Morocco, they also enter in 
the preparation of a wide variety of sweet and even savory tajines, or exotic 
stews. Thoughts of these familiar specialties were dancing in my mind as I 
drove past the landmark forest of eerie windmills marking the approach to the 
Coachella Valley that signaled the first stop in my quest for California dates 
at their source: Hadley Fruit Orchards in Cabazon. 
</P>
<P>
 For many travelers, Hadley's provides the introduction to locally grown dates, 
including Medjools and the soft, dark amber Barhee, in addition to the more 
common varieties. Sampling is encouraged and, in my case, lead to the purchase 
of sticky date coconut rolls ($2.99 for 12 ounces), diminutive date nuggets 
($1.99 a pound) and a coarse, caramel-colored date sugar, among other 
date-based products. Hadley's banana date shake, rich and smooth and very 
sweet, was hearty enough to sustain this urban nomad and a companion for 
several hours (large, $2.40; small, $2.20). Those who want to take home a taste 
of the California desert can order one of Hadley's lovely gift packs. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Leaving Hadley's and driving east on Interstate 10 and then southeast on 
California 111, I found my way to Shields Date Gardens in Indio, which is 
perched on the edge of 111 -- a road sometimes referred to as "The Date 
Highway." For decades, Shields has enticed visitors to its vintage '50s gift 
shop and adjoining theater with a continuous showing of "The Romance and Sex 
Life of a Date." The show -- many of the slides now scratched and yellowed with 
age -- is narrated by the late E. Floyd Shields, a pioneer date producer. 
Seated inside the darkened theater, viewers learn that the landmark 
establishment was started in 1924, when pioneer date grower Shields began 
experimenting with dates from Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Following this short expose on date horticulture, I slipped out of the theater 
and headed straight for the ice cream counter to sample Shields' trademark 
Black Date ice cream cone ($1) -- an unctuous blend of vanilla ice cream 
generously laced with date puree. Informative descriptions lured me to the 
glass display case filled with packages of Brunettes and Blondes ($2.25 a 
pound), cans of Medjools ($17 for a three-pound can) and golden date crystals 
($5.50 for 1 1/2 pounds), among other products. Abdullah the mechanized camel 
grinned at me as I left the cavernous store clutching a package of deliciously 
chewy Blondes that I eventually snacked on like peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monroe Street, off California 111 in Indio, Dates By DaVall occupies 15 
acres. DaVall is a small operation that prides itself on growing dates 
organically. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing by the small counter, visitors can sample their syrupy-sweet ripe 
Honey dates ($14.40 for 2 1/2 pounds, including shipping), and buttery, 
caramel-hued Empress ($15.15 for 2 1/2 pounds, including shipping), also 
available by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles east down 52nd Avenue in Coachella, north a block or two on 
Harrison and at the intersection of Harrison Street and Baghdad Avenue, 
Charlotte Anderson Stocks and her sister, Catherine Kerby, own and operate the 
Covalda Date Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the original equipment remains at the company headquarters in the 
Covalda Packing House, a cavernous building constructed in 1919. If you drop 
in, a smiling Stocks, who zips around the warehouse in an electric cart, may 
guide you through the sorting and packing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Covalda's products include chopped dates ($1.75 a pound) and, naturally, 
dehydrated date chips ($15.80 for a five-pound sack) -- a product created by 
her mother, Stocks said -- date almond confections ($2.67 a pound) and crunchy 
date pecan logs ($4.40 a pound). Covalda's smooth-as-silk date shake is made 
with reduced-calorie ice milk in an effort to trim the caloric content ($2.25 
and $1.50). All of Covalda's date specialties, except for the shakes, are also 
sold by mail order. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A short detour west, on California 86, imposing groves of palm trees and 
fields of artichokes paint a green swath all the way to Valerie Jean Date 
Garden in Thermal. The open-air date stand, with an adjoining packing house, 
occupies the tip of the sweet potato patch that its founder Russ Nicholl, who 
is generally credited with inventing the date shake, once tended. The farm 
stand was opened in 1928 and has since expanded to include a bakery and a 
packing house. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Jean's appears as if not much has changed since the '20s, except, 
perhaps, for the constant hum of traffic zooming past and the steady stream of 
customers stocking up on prepackaged dates and tubs of gooey date butter spread 
($3.25) -- great on toast or as a frosting for a simple butter cake, and an 
essential ingredient in Valerie Jean's thick, soul-satisfying date shakes. Gift 
packs sold in the store or by mail order include date cakes ($2.50) and 
cookies, as well as date assortments ($20.50 for 15 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 Back on California 111 is another mandatory stop for date lovers: Oasis Date 
Gardens in Thermal. A welcome patch of emerald green lawn welcomes picnickers 
around tables scattered under the cool cathedral of palms. There is no more 
picturesque place in the valley to sample California dates at their source, nor 
can I think of a better location to sample the thick and chewy date pie ($1 a 
slice), or sinfully rich, oversize chocolate-covered jumbo Medjool date ($1 
each), or a velvety-smooth and honey-sweet date shake made with yogurt or soft 
ice cream ($2 each). 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the area's Sahara-like climate, owner Ben Laflin's father 
homesteaded the land in 1912. At first he planted seedlings, but seedlings 
rarely adopt the parent tree's characteristics. Offshoots of existing trees 
were required, and for that, Medjools were imported from Morocco. The original 
nine trees eventually multiplied into 5,000, creating one of the largest 
commercial Medjool groves in the United States. Each step in Oasis Garden's 
production, from the individual picking of ripe Medjools to the careful packing 
process, is done by hand. The Laflins produce the Barhee date and sell it in 
the "khalal" or hard, yellow stage (a style of date that is highly prized by 
some aficionados); the dry and chewy Thoori or "bread date," the Halawy, which 
is ideal for shipping, the mahogany Khadrawy, one of the first dates to ripen 
in the valley, and the less common black Abada dates. Oasis Date Gardens 
products are sold year-round here and also by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, the pony-tailed Jim Dunn of Great Date in the Morning runs 
a mail-order-only date business. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking off a few moist Barhees, Dunn reflects on the path that brought him 
from Berkeley to this corner of the valley. A college friend with connections 
in the desert first introduced him to the area, he said. For several years 
after that, he hauled organic produce and dates from the Coachella to Santa 
Cruz County in his 1946 Chevy flatbed truck. He eventually settled in the 
Coachella Valley permanently, and now owns more than 50 acres of certified, 
organically grown date palms. In a departure from the norm, Dunn is among a 
handful of growers who freezes his dates instead of fumigating them before 
sending them to market or, in his case, by mail order. (Barhees cost $3.25 a 
pound for a two-pound bag; Khadrawys, $2.45 a pound for a two-pound bag). 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the palm grove, sampling a few of Dunn's ripe Barhee dates right 
off the tree seemed a fitting conclusion to my excursion into the California 
desert. Satiated in body and spirit, I was ready to head home laden with 
several pounds of fresh Barhees, Medjools and Deglet Noors. At this moment, the 
Marrakech palm grove felt only a heartbeat away. GUIDEBOOK

JOURNEYS TO THE MIDDLE EAST; RUINS TO RICHES; JORDAN; EXPLORING ANCIENT 
MYSTERIES IN PETRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE KAYAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelangelo said that when he looked at a block of marble he saw a figure 
trapped within it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nabateans of southern Jordan were a bit more ambitious. Two thousand years 
ago, much before Michelangelo ever picked up a chisel, these Arabian tribesmen 
looked at cliffs of stone and saw an entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 Without drills, tractors, jackhammers or even picks as fine as the sculptor's, 
they set upon the hillsides and began carving deep into them, hollowing out 
two-story temples propped on Corinthian columns, tombs bedecked with obelisks 
and statues of gods, courts, reservoirs, staircases, aqueducts and homes of 
stony grandeur. More than 800 examples of their towering handiwork sprawl 
across 36 square miles of a hidden valley in Jordan's desert, a site that 
attracts thousands of tourists every year. "If you are only going to see one 
place in Jordan, or the whole Middle East for that matter, make it Petra," 
advises one guidebook. 
</P>
<P>
 My uncle and I had just spent two weeks climbing around the ruins of Syria, 
but none of it had prepared us for Petra, the city whose name means "rock." 
Just after sunrise last fall, we boarded a rickety Asia Motors mini-bus with 
about a dozen other visitors and, to the thumping quarter tones of Arabic dance 
music from the driver's tape deck, made our way south from Amman, the capital, 
through 155 miles of dismal countryside, scrubby and pock-marked by electrical 
towers and phosphate mines. About three hours later, our cheery Palestinian 
driver pulled off at an overlook. 
</P>
<P>
 There, cutting the horizon, jagged, jutting swells of stone pushed their way 
up like the angry children of some prehistoric geophysical calamity. Back 
there, the driver told us, behind that, is Petra. 
</P>
<P>
 Our ears popped as we descended a corkscrew pass, passing shabby wooden signs 
for hotels that herald the approach to the site. At the visitor's center, the 
door of the van swung open and a bird-like head poked in. "Awright, hey, who 
wants to see Petra?" squawked Hanny, a guide who had learned his rapid-fire 
English in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes we were calling Yullah! ("Let's go!") to our horses as they 
clopped along the needle-width, rocky gorge that is Petra's only entrance.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the gorge cracked open and flooded my eyes with pinkish light. In the 
break of the craggy pass, el-Khazneh, or the Treasury, rose like Atlantis 
uncovered, towering ahead and giving off an other-worldly glow in the late 
morning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Petra's signature monument, the Treasury, looms 140 feet high, with six 
Corinthian columns in its portico and a giant urn adorning its second story. As 
we stood in the shade of the soaring colonnade, Hanny told us that the 
2nd-Century structure is believed to have taken 100 years to finish.  
</P>
<P>
 How did they do this? 
</P>
<P>
 Hanny had no answer to that. The Nabateans were expert architects and 
engineers and probably had iron tools. Yet archeologists have found no records 
or telltale marks of the construction techniques employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they do this? Why dig buildings out of a stone mountainside? Because 
the sandstone was far more plentiful than wood, nearly indestructible, and soft 
enough to sculpt with relative ease. The single entrance to the site also made 
the city easily defensible, and the solid homes themselves offered the best 
protection against all torments, human and divine -- wars, storms, floods, 
"and, of course," Hanny said, "earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner from the Treasury, the Street of Facades contains a row of 
ancient high-rises whose entrances stand a full story above ground, protection 
against thieves in the days before locks.  
</P>
<P>
 From there, we continued on foot along the gorge, which opens into a valley of 
broken ground. The ground is deep with primrose- and cornflower-colored sand, 
and icicles of rough rock that looked as though they had dropped from the sky.  
</P>
<P>
 With our socks full of sand, we chased Hanny up a hill toward the Urn Tomb, so 
named for the funereal object that decorates its roof. From the tomb's elevated 
plaza, we surveyed the hills of the Wadi Musa -- the Valley of Moses -- where 
the prophet struck the rock and drew water.  
</P>
<P>
 We scampered down from the tomb to the center of ancient Petra. Barely 
discernable were the battered remains of the grand avenue that led into it 
2,000 years ago, when the city, under Roman control, was a stop on one of the 
major trade route from India. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, shifting routes drained away the city's business. As Petra 
declined, the Romans abandoned it, earthquakes rattled it, the Muslims sacked 
it, and by the 8th Century, obscurity claimed it.  
</P>
<P>
 As we headed back in the afternoon, we felt as though we had seen so little, 
even though Hanny had whisked us through as much as possible on our three-hour 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The High Place of Sacrifice that overlooks the rocky valley was still miles 
away. The burial site of the prophet Aaron, Moses's brother, and el-Deir, "the 
Monastery," a building similar to the Treasury but said to be more spectacular 
because of its grander scale, were still many hours' journey on horseback.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: SEEING AMERICA BY RV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, millions of seniors have turned to recreational vehicles for 
vacation travel in the United States and Canada, and the numbers are growing. A 
University of Michigan study revealed that RV ownership has increased 50% among 
householders over age 55 since 1980. Nearly half of the 9 million RVs on 
American highways are owned by people over 55. And thousands more are rented 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many seniors rent RVs to help them determine what type of vehicle to purchase. 
A full-color book offering advice for the RV renter, "Set Free in an RV," is 
now available. It includes tips on how to choose the most suitable RV, a list 
of campgrounds and notes on travel courtesy, RV jargon and safety. A separate 
publication, "Who's Who in RV Rentals," is included when ordering the book. The 
price for both is $5, plus $2 for postage and handling. Write to Rental 
Ventures, 3930 University Drive, Fairfax, Va. 22030. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the popularity of RVs, the American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) 
has created a travel industry public relations office and is co-publisher, 
along with the Recreation Vehicle Industry Assn., of a comprehensive booklet on 
RVs. It details the types of RVs and covers driving, travel planning, weight of 
the vehicles, tires, towing, emergencies and equipment. See address below to 
order a free copy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the RV industry has grown, so has the number of camping clubs whose 
membership are predominantly 50-plus RVers. In addition to companionship and 
social activities, these clubs offer other courtesies such as message service, 
mail forwarding, discounts on campground fees and merchandise. There are also 
caravans to visit selected destinations where arrangements for group activities 
can be booked. 
</P>
<P>
 RV campgrounds have grown increasingly sophisticated, and RVers have come to 
expect such amenities as restrooms and showers, mini-markets, laundry 
facilities, golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools and a variety of 
activities and social events such as craft classes, exercise groups and dances. 
</P>
<P>
 RV travel offers both freedom and flexibility so that RVers need not limit 
their travel to summer vacation periods, when most national parks and other 
facilities are usually full. Wise travelers select the spring and fall, before 
and after school vacations, to visit the popular campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 RV travelers like to point out that they never have to look for rooms and that 
restaurants do not consume a large part of their travel budget since many RVs 
have beds, showers and kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon request, the RVIA will send a comprehensive set of booklets, including 
"Set Free in an RV" and "Safety in RVs," which is jointly published by AARP and 
RVIA, along with a catalogue of publications and videos available for purchase 
through RVIA. Write: RVIA, Dept. MT, P.O. Box 22090, Reston, Va. 22090. 
</P>
<P>
 For an introduction to RV travel and camping, a free Vacation Planner from Go 
Camping America is available by calling (800) 477-8669.

BOOKS TO GO: THE MAGIC THAT WAS PRAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MAGIC PRAGUE by Angelo Maria Ripellino, translated by David Newton Marinelli 
(University of California Press, $30 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 Prague is hot, a bellwether of emerging Eastern European urbanism, a 
gloriously ornate tourist destination, a new mecca for American expatriates 
with an artistic bent. When Angelo Maria Ripellino (1923-1978), a professor of 
Russian language and lecturer in Czech language and literature at the 
University of Rome, published this book in Italian some 21 years ago (under the 
title "Praha magica"), however, Prague was still chilly. It was, that is, still 
shivering from the unseasonal and violent winter that had frozen out the 
reforms of the so-called "Prague Spring" five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist politics weren't Ripellino's concern, though -- and the tragedy of 
Alexander Dubcek and his colleagues is not a story he tells. Instead, he 
presents a Prague full of fantasy and fantastical art and literature, a Prague 
in which ritual and superstition and unexplained events help shape the 
character of daily life. He quotes Nietzsche as saying, "When I seek another 
word for music, I always and only find the word Venice," and adds that when he 
himself seeks "another word for mystery, the only word I can find is Prague." 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately enough, then, his book about the place is itself mysterious -- 
part literary-philosophical textbook, part history, part autobiography, part 
educated traveler's guide, part magic realism. It may be a bit much to claim, 
as the dust jacket does, that the book invents a new genre -- but it certainly 
isn't an easy work to classify. Suffice to say that the serious, 
literary-minded traveler to Prague (or the armchair traveler) will learn a 
great deal about its spirit and its past from this book. To the tourist looking 
for hotel recommendations, it will prove almost surrealistically useless.

 CITY WOMEN: Stories of the World's Great Cities, edited by Liz Heron (Beacon 
Press, $30 hardcover, $15 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 "A tiny, chubby Chinese child is running races with a black puppy along a 
Shanghai street. It is summer and the child is clothed in a tiny red apron that 
just covers its stomach. It has been sitting in the dirt." "Immediately after 
the Allied troops had pushed their way to the North, I went down to Naples and 
shut myself up in the house for a whole year of despair." "It's fall and the 
storm rattles the butcher's signs. The trees on Enghavevej have lost nearly all 
of their leaves, which almost cover the ground with their yellow and 
reddish-brown carpet that looks like my mother's hair when the sun plays in it, 
and you suddenly discover that it's not totally black." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are excerpts from writings on Shanghai by Alice Smedley, Naples by Anna 
Maria Ortese and Copenhagen by Tove Ditlevsen, respectively. Also present in 
this highly varied and readable volume are sketches and apercus and short 
stories by Djuna Barnes on Greenwich Village, Virginia Woolf on London, Jean 
Rhys on Paris and more. The diverse summonings up of cities all over the world 
are illuminating and compelling.

 VIETNAM: Travel Survival Kit, second edition, by Robert Storey (Lonely Planet, 
$15.95 paper). Everybody seems to want to go to Vietnam these days (my, how 
times have changed), and for anyone who does go, this book ought to be required 
reading. Nobody treats difficult destinations better than Lonely Planet. (This 
isn't exactly a second edition, incidentally; as the first edition was titled 
"Vietnam, Laos & Cambodia." The latter two nations now have their own Lonely 
Planet guides.) 
</P>
<P>
 CITIES OF GOLD: A Journey Across the American Southwest in Coronado's 
Footsteps by Douglas Preston (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14 paper). An 
unusually well-written and engaging example of the 
following-in-famous-footsteps genre of travel writing -- first published in 
hardcover in 1992. The footsteps in this case are those of the Spanish 
conquistador Francesco Vasquez de Coronado, the terrain reaches across Arizona 
and New Mexico (including the portion of the latter state in which the Spaniard 
found his famous "Seven Cities of Gold"), and the travelers -- author Preston 
and his friend Walter Nelson -- are alert, adventurous and amiable.

 Regarding "A Vacation Report From Albania" (Jan. 16): 
</P>
<P>
 Albania didn't "recently" open its crumbling doors to tourists for the first 
time. I was in Albania well before their revolution, in 1990, along with a 
handful of other Americans, on an all-Greek-speaking, six-day bus tour from 
Athens.I was disappointed to learn that the author saw only one other tourist 
in his entire week. I had hoped that others would take advantage and visit 
Albania -- undoubtedly, the most fascinating nation in Europe.

<P>
 You are to be commended for the wonderful article about Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 Permit me to add a comment about the wonderful people. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Holocaust, every one of the 300 Albanian Jews and the 600 Greek and 
Yugoslav Jews who "escaped" into Albania was hidden or protected by the people 
of Albania and survived. Approximately 20 Albanians have been honored by Yad 
Vashem for rescuing Jews. They include Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox and 
Muslims. Their full story has yet to be told.

MORE ON MY LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I like Paul Dean's writing. Usually. But the irritating use of my lady to 
describe his travel companion (one assumes he hasn't bothered to marry her), 
combined with his description of the "near-piddling" $514 weekend package at 
the Hotel Del Coronado ("Birthday Suite," Jan. 30), nearly caused this 
"tonstant reader" to "fwow up."(Sorry, Dorothy Parker.) Get a grip, "my man."

<P>
 Lynda Fairman (Letters, Jan. 16) was "annoyed" because Paul Dean referred to 
his female companion as my lady in his article on Santa Paula ("Weekend 
Escape," Dec. 5). The term denoted "to her, and possibly to other readers, 
ownership and possession." My lady conveys feeling or regard this man had for 
this woman, not possession. Fairman's "annoyance" was not Dean's use of my lady 
, but her own stupid interpretation. Why don't Fairman and women like her who 
go around trying to straighten out the world according to them, do what 
Professor Higgins advised in "My Fair Lady" and "clean up the mess inside." 
Maybe then Fairman could have some opinions worthy of respect.

COLD WAR'S UNWITTING WARRIORS WONDER ABOUT THE PAST, FUTURE; NUCLEAR TESTS: 
ROBERT GIORDANO TENDED SHEEP EXPOSED TO RADIATION AT CAMP PARKS, CALIF. LATER, 
HIS DAUGHTER DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT DVORCHAK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Giordano never thought of himself as an unwitting guinea pig or 
believed a daughter who died of severe birth defects was a Cold War casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, he was paid $1.25 an hour to tend sheep that were part of 
hundreds of radiation experiments at Camp Parks, an obscure military base 40 
miles east of San Francisco in California's picturesque Livermore Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano's chores included burying the droopy-skinned, black-faced beasts who 
died of radiation. Their limbs would fall off in his bare hands as he pitched 
them into graves. 
</P>
<P>
 His work at this atomic ranch didn't concern him even when a daughter was born 
in 1983 without a trachea and with damaged internal organs. But renewed 
interest in radiation experiments has created a nagging unease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to know if there's any possible connection to those experiments 
and what happened to my daughter. Nothing will bring that baby back. But it 
would be a little easier to put behind us if we knew for sure one way or 
another," said Giordano, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they were testing the animals for radiation, but I was never given any 
warnings or special instructions," he added in a recent interview. "Shouldn't I 
have had some type of protective clothing or gloves or anything? How hazardous 
was it? Were they 100% sure we weren't wandering in the wrong area? Does being 
exposed to radiation cause birth defects?" 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano's questions, fears and doubts -- despite assurances that they are 
unfounded -- aren't the only ones with elusive answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people and their relatives have been pondering the legacies of 
the nuclear age since December, when U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary asked 
the government to review all radiation experiments and to compensate those who 
were harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these Cold War battlegrounds was Camp Parks, a 2,000-acre site where 
the Navy and the Office of Civil Defense conducted tests between 1959 to 1980 
on how to survive a nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of tests were done with fallout shelters, crops grown in irradiated 
soil, farm animals bombarded with radiation, and radioactive sand used to 
simulate fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, people lived on or around the base. The Pleasanton School 
District operated a school seven blocks from where the radioactive sand was 
made. And the Job Corps -- a federal program for disadvantaged children -- used 
buildings where experiments were done. 
</P>
<P>
 Although precautionary fences and warning signs were erected around "hot" 
areas, similar tests under modern-day standards would be impossible because of 
the threat of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't be allowed to do that today. It would never be approved. Never. 
There would be more controls," said James L. Thomas, who served as a radiation 
safety officer at Camp Parks for seven years. "You'd have to be absolutely 100% 
sure (that) the radiation would be contained and enclosed and that no one could 
get into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and those who conducted the tests say there are no health hazards, and 
inspectors said the base was clean in 1983. But to dispel fears, camp commander 
Lt. Col. Mark Nelson ordered a re-examination of the work. A report is due by 
the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all like to know if there really is a nuclear bogyman out there," said 
Nelson, who served in the Persian Gulf War as a combat engineer with the Army's 
82nd Airborne Division. "I'd like the image to go away (that) we're some kind 
of time bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The review is being done by the earth sciences consulting firm of 
Woodward-Clyde. And some of the report is being written by James Sartor -- 
project manager on many of the Camp Parks radiation experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no danger in what we did," Sartor said. "There were no human guinea 
pigs involved in any of the experiments. Employees were never purposely part of 
the tests. We had a very rigid health physics program." 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were monitored independently by the Atomic Energy Commission, which 
in 1975 became the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no problem. They took air samples and radiation surveys. There was 
no hanky-panky. Everything was above board. These were highly competent 
people," said Ray Fish, a retired safety officer with the AEC who monitored the 
tests. "People should have a whole lot of confidence in the end results and in 
their inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
 During an era when people were building back yard bomb shelters, a Camp Parks 
test involved a 100-person fallout shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine its habitability, volunteers lived inside the bunker for up to 14 
days -- the time it would take fallout to dissipate. One test involved inmates 
from the nearby Santa Rita County Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 And on April 15, 1960, the bunker was rimmed with tons of burning scrap lumber 
to test its ability to withstand the heat of a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Campbell, an adviser to the National Assn. of Atomic Survivors, 
contended more than wood was involved, however. He said radioactive material -- 
code-named "Rolla" -- was placed in the flaming piles to simulate a nuclear 
bomb, and volunteers were exposed to "hefty doses" of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sartor, Fish and Nelson flatly deny Campbell's allegations. Any documents that 
could prove or disprove Campbell's claim are under review by the Department of 
Energy and are unavailable for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There exists no public documentation of it," Campbell admitted. But he added: 
"It shows what happens when the government or a group of people go amok with 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the bunker was tested for its ability to shield against 
radiation, but no humans were inside at the time. Measurements were made by 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tests at Camp Parks included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Testing the long-term effects of fallout on plants. From 1962 to 1965, crops 
were grown in soil spiked with plutonium. The radioactive material was later 
packed into drums and buried in Beatty, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 * Determining the effects of whole-body radiation with animals. Behind a 
series of fences and warning signs, sheep were zapped with cobalt-60 from 1963 
to 1973. The radiation was stored underground behind lead shields, and 
mechanical arms lifted the cobalt from its protective envelopes. Some sheep 
were exposed for up to 23 hours a day, 74 days at a time. Exposures were done 
about a mile from the sheep pens, where donkeys, beagles, pigs and mice were 
also housed. In a separate experiment, about 100 sheep were injected with an 
iron isotope in 1971. When they died, these injected sheep were also buried on 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decontaminating buildings and grounds. A site called the Target Complex, 
which simulated a typical neighborhood, consisted of abandoned barracks, 
streets and lawns. Workmen sprinkled the area with radioactive sand using 
spreaders pushed by hand or towed behind a truck. The stuff was then hosed, 
swept or plowed away during cleanup. The sand contained lanthanum-140, which 
has a half-life of 40 hours and decays to normal background levels within 14 
days. Ropes, warning signs and a barbed wire fence were eventually erected 
around the 17-acre area. The buildings were turned over to the Job Corps and 
then torn down to make room for a federal prison, where Patricia Hearst served 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simulating the effects of radiation on ship's hulls. Inside a gymnasium, the 
Navy sprayed sea water containing lanthanum-140 onto metal panels to test the 
effects of vessels if a nuclear bomb threw sea water into the air. Tests were 
done between 1961 and 1963, and the gym was turned over to the Job Corps in 
1965 (former heavyweight champion George Foreman trained there). In 1983, 
demonstrators at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab were supposed to be 
detained there, but U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said, "The 
risks are so grave and unknown, no court should be in the position of placing 
anyone in such risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-nuclear activists are particularly concerned about the Camp Parks school, 
which was closed in 1971 -- not because of radiation concerns but because it 
didn't meet earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1961 report by the AEC cited lack of proper safeguards. "If one of the 
students did become contaminated, no one would find out," the AEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of the pattern where certain people were considered disposable 
by the nuclear Establishment," said Marylia Kelley of the Tri-Valley Citizens 
Against a Radioactive Environment. "Unless the scientists claimed that they 
control the wind, they cannot have been guaranteeing those children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these experiments can be justified either today or yesterday. 
If the community had known more about them at the time, (we) probably would 
have acted to stop them," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the people pressing for answers is Peggy Stewart, who lived at Camp 
Parks and attended school there. From 1957 to 1973, her father, Emory 
Pettigrew, was chief of fire protection and base security. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Stewart roamed the base freely with her go-cart and dune buggy. 
She admits to youthful mischief, sneaking into buildings and getting past 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 And she kept quiet until reports of radiation experiments resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost seemed like 'Silkwood,' " she said, referring to a movie about 
Karen Silkwood, a nuclear power plant employee who died under suspicious 
circumstances after contending that the plant was unsafe. "Everyone always 
lived with the fear that if you opened your mouth, you better fear for life." 
</P>
<P>
 What's worrisome is that her father died of bone cancer in 1990 and suffered 
horrible headaches and sterility. Her mother lost a child at birth and later 
had a hysterectomy. Stewart, 39, has been diagnosed with fibrous tumors and has 
suffered from headaches, swollen lymph glands, anemia and high blood pressure. 
She also recalls pet sheep and rabbits that died on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm entitled to remuneration, but I'd sure like to have some 
questions answered," said Stewart, who now lives in Carefree, Ariz. "Could some 
of these things have been related? Is that the stuff that killed my rabbits and 
sheep? What do these things do to people? What did you expose us to? What are 
our families going to be exposed to? Did you take all the safety precautions? . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to do experiments, fine. But don't allow people to live in 
and around the place," Stewart said. "To be exposed to risk without being told 
about it is very wrong."

ATHLETES FIND WAYS TO STARE DEATH IN FACE; SPORTS: POSSIBILITY OF BEING KILLED 
OR INJURED IS THE INVISIBLE PARTICIPANT IN THE ARENA. PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY MANY 
PROFESSIONALS DENY FEAR EXISTS. SOME BELIEVE THEY'RE INVINCIBLE.

<P>
 If, as the psychologists say, all living animals, from humans to the dust 
mite, feel fear, how come: 
</P>
<P>
 1. A baseball player can face a 90 m.p.h. fast ball that, if it veered off 
course by an inch or two, could cause severe harm or death? 
</P>
<P>
 2. A race car driver can speed along at more than 200 m.p.h. when an inch or 
two can mean fiery death or severe injury? 
</P>
<P>
 3. A 100-pound jockey can ride a 1,200-pound horse in a race when an inch or 
two can mean being crushed to death or severely maimed under the hoofs of other 
1,200-pound animals? 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of death or injury is the invisible participant in the world 
of sport, a world that dominates the lives of many Americans almost every 
waking hour. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be entertainment to those millions, but to the athlete there is a much 
darker side. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, for instance, race car driver and television personality Neil 
Bonnett died in a crash during a practice session at Daytona International 
Speedway in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett, 47, had been attempting a comeback after what was thought to be a 
career-ending crash in 1990 that left him with a severe concussion and memory 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors advised him then to quit the sport, and Bonnett turned to television 
work, becoming a racing analyst, color commentator and host of a show called 
"Winners" before being drawn back to driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't walk away from a sport you've spent your entire life around," 
Bonnett said in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Austrian skier Ulrike Maier, winner of two world titles, died 
after breaking her neck during a World Cup downhill race. She was 26. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Mike Utley of the Detroit Lions, a 290-pound offensive lineman, was 
paralyzed when he broke his neck after being flipped upside down while making a 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 The next season, Dennis Byrd, a defensive lineman with the New York Jets, 
broke his neck going after a quarterback. Byrd was more fortunate. Expected to 
be left paralyzed, he has almost completely recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, how do athletes overcome fear? 
</P>
<P>
 Some say they are never afraid, which psychologists call denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Unser Sr., one of car racing's legendary figures, said: "You know people 
get killed, but you always think it will be the other guy. It won't be you. If 
I were standing with just one other car racer and we were told one of us would 
be killed in a race, I'd still race. I would be sure it would be the other 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the repression of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all players are afraid," said Tim Lewis, who retired during his third 
year with the NFL's Green Bay Packers after doctors found he had a congenitally 
narrow spinal canal that could eventually leave him paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In football many a locker-room conversation is about how I hope this doesn't 
happen and that doesn't happen," Lewis said. "But when the whistle blows, fear 
goes out of your mind. You're invincible. You're Superman; you're a projectile 
missile." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is George Young, a scholar whose life has been football -- first as a 
player, then as a high school coach and now as general manager of the New York 
Giants: "The Marines and the Army use discipline to get a man to walk into 
bullets. It's not natural to get a soldier to walk into bullets. And what we do 
in football isn't much more natural." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Unser's competitors over the years, Mario Andretti, said he never 
realized his wife's fears until his own son started racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a lousy spectator. I'm OK when I'm running with my son. But when I'm 
not going against him, I can't watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists and psychiatrists have been studying the "athletic personality" 
for almost 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They found a macho world, one they had hoped women would help soften. Instead, 
as women's sports grew, the women quickly assumed male roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial exists everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Two basketball players, Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics and Hank Gathers of 
Loyola-Marymount University in Los Angeles, died after playing with diagnosed 
heart conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though few athletes acknowledge fear publicly, the realization that this could 
be the last ride, the last race, the last fight hovers in the subconscious. 
They live in a world of broken bones, crippling spinal cord injuries, detached 
retinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighters end up brain damaged; hockey players toothless; football players with 
hip replacements and arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me describe for you what it is like to be hit hard," said former 
light-heavyweight champion Jose Torres, who has spent his life in boxing, a 
sport that has seen its share of death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like 1 million ants get into your brain and into your whole body. I got 
hit that way three times in my career. Today, fighters get hit like that three 
times in one round." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear is ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
 A baseball player feels it as he hits against a fastball pitcher; football 
players when they're about to line up across from a 250-pound linebacker; 
lightweight jockeys as they mount a horse that may toss them into the path of 
several tons of thundering hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 But with pain and fear comes reward, especially at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 For the amateur athlete, there is adulation or the high that comes with 
defying injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
 For the professional, there is that and a lot more -- the money that can be 
earned in big-time professional sports has become astronomical. Troy Aikman of 
the NFL's Dallas Cowboys recently signed a contract that will pay him $50 
million over a decade -- six months after undergoing delicate back surgery that 
could have ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger isn't always in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Seles, then the world's No. 1 woman tennis player, was stabbed last 
year by a spectator during a match. She has yet to resume competitive tennis 
even though her wounds were not life threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was struck on the knee by an 
assailant after a practice session. Charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest danger remains in the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 During a qualifying round of the springboard diving at the 1988 Olympics, 
American Greg Louganis hit the back of his head on the board as he was coming 
down. Such accidents can be fatal -- a Russian diver was killed at the World 
University Games in a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Louganis, however, went on to win a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 He did it by denying it happened -- he never watched the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want that image in my head going into the competition," he said at a 
post-victory press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective. I jumped off the board and heard a big clank. That's all 
I know. I don't want the visual image of seeing me hit my head." 
</P>
<P>
 His fear? 
</P>
<P>
 More of losing than of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared going into the final," he said. "When I hit my head on the 
board, it shook my confidence a lot. I took extra dives in my morning workout. 
I needed to get over the jitters." 
</P>
<P>
 And diving is far tamer than those in which the danger is clearly visible, 
like boxing, football or auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Football players at least have size to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with jockeys, whose maximum riding weight is around 114 pounds. Clad 
only in helmets, goggles and bright silks, their stirrups shortened, they sit 
astride animals bred for speed with huge bodies and thin ankles. When those 
ankles snap, the rider is in death's path. 
</P>
<P>
 The jockey's guild says that 125 riders have been killed since 1940. The only 
year since 1960 in which there were no fatalities was 1992, the guild says. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Krone, certainly the best of all women jockeys, was almost killed last 
Aug. 30 at Saratoga when she was thrown. Doctors said her Kevlar vest, the 
bulletproof vest used by police departments, saved her life. She ended up with 
a shattered ankle that has kept her idle since. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my whole life, I said to myself, 'This is really 
dangerous,' " said Krone, who weighs 99 pounds. "I felt uncomfortable about 
riding." 
</P>
<P>
 But the feeling was temporary. A month later, she couldn't wait to ride again. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Tekulve, a former pitcher once described by Los Angeles Dodgers manager 
Tommy Lasorda as a "tall skinny nightmare" because of the fear he inspired in 
hitters with his submarine delivery, was himself terrified when he came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls hitting against Nolan Ryan, when Ryan didn't always know where his 
fastball, clocked at more than 90 m.p.h., would go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just stand out of the box and wait for three strikes. And Ryan wasn't 
even pitching hard at me. He knew I couldn't hit," Tekulve said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Ron Hunt, who played from 1963 through 1975 and at one point held 
the major league record for being hit by pitched balls -- 243 times in 12 
years, or 20 times a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Injury? Hah! I was never afraid," said Hunt, 52, who deliberately got in the 
way of fastballs from Ryan and other hard throwers. He was either the lead-off 
batter or second up and describes himself as a "head player." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a rancher in Wentzville, Mo., Hunt took delight in jumping in front of the 
catcher after he was hit and throwing the ball back to the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxers may be hit 243 times in a 45-minute fight by fists barely covered with 
gloves weighing 8 to 12 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few refreshing changes in this world of denial. One is Torres, an 
Olympic silver medalist in 1956. He says his knees shook, his stomach was in 
knots every time he was ready to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear was my main emotion. I learned through experience how to deal with it, 
how to manipulate it. I made fear my best friend," said Torres, a novelist and 
a former New York State boxing commissioner. "I knew when my opponent was going 
to throw a punch before he threw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres says a fearless fighter doesn't go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At the highest level, players have to be motivated to play through pain. Many 
realize that after a while, the risk isn't worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Young of the New York Giants has a maxim in choosing players. 
</P>
<P>
 "You rarely want a player who's extraordinarily smart. He could do something 
else with his life than play this silly game." 
</P>
<P>
 One example is John Frank, who spent five years with the San Francisco 49ers, 
played on two Super Bowl champions, and was entering his prime at 27 when he 
walked away to go to medical school full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, a medical student in the off-season, once rushed to the side of an 
opponent who appeared seriously injured, only to be chewed out by a coach for 
giving aid and comfort to the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 That was his decision-maker. Frank is now a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Migliore, 29 in March, was the nation's leading apprentice jockey in 
1981. Since then he's had a series of spills, the most serious in 1988, when he 
broke his neck and doctors told him he'd probably be a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back riding in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 His attitude is typical of top-level athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's your day to die," he said, "it's going to happen."

ROSES ARE RED, GROWERS ARE BLUE AT INTERLOPERS; FLORAL MARKET: DOMESTIC 
PRODUCERS MUST CONCENTRATE ON QUALITY AND ON TYPES OF FLOWERS THAT CANNOT 
SURVIVE SHIPPING FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. VALENTINE'S DAY IS INDUSTRY'S 
"CHRISTMAS." 
</P>

<P>
 All for love in the shape of a rose, men and women make summer days of winter 
nights in the snow-laden Taconic hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In an icy valley 20 miles west of Albany, on a seven-acre indoor farm, bathed 
in the amber glow of simulated sunshine, hybrid roses grow on 6-foot-tall 
bushes pampered in a computer-controlled atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Kardinal," said greenhouse manager Phil Riccardi, 53, curling his 
chapped fingers delicately around a vibrant bud. "This is the most popular red. 
Very bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Roses by any other name may smell sweeter -- the mauve Lavande, for instance, 
fills a room with heady perfume -- but the nearly odorless Kardinal, Royalty, 
Samantha and other reds rule for Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 For Riccardi and his four brothers, and America's 225 other growers of 
florists' roses, Valentine's Day is big business. According to industry 
figures, the holiday accounts for more sales, at higher prices, than any other 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale prices for long-stemmed red roses typically double between 
mid-January and Feb. 14, from about 50 cents to more than $1 a stem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riccardis, owners of the 66-year-old Henry J. Seagroatt Co., grow more 
than 4 million roses a year on 152,000 bushes in greenhouses started by their 
grandfather. In the days leading up to Valentine's Day, they'll cut about 
300,000 velvety red buds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one day accounts for 20% of our business," said Al Riccardi, 51, Phil's 
brother and president of the company, which also sells carnations and other 
imported flowers from its wholesale warehouse in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans spend $12.5 billion a year on floral products, according to the 
Floral Index, a trade group in Chicago. Sales of cut flowers have more than 
doubled over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are hard times for American growers. Many have thrown in the trowel, 
unable to make a profit in a market flooded with low-priced blossoms from 
Colombia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 21 years, we've lost more than 5,000 growers," said Dave Machtel, 
executive director of the Floral Trade Council in Haslett, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, more than 1.4 billion cut flowers, 4% of them imported, were sold in 
the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1992, 
sales topped 3.4 billion blooms -- 73% imported. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnation growers have been hardest hit by global competition. The number of 
domestic growers dropped from 1,525 in 1971 to 139 in 1992. Imports now account 
for more than 84% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose growers have fared better, because roses don't ship as well as 
carnations. The number of U.S. rose growers declined from 323 to 225 over the 
last 20 years. Imports now account for 55% of the 1.2 billion roses sold 
annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern rose growers have been affected most by the imports. But in 
California, which produces 65% of domestic roses, growers are keeping an uneasy 
eye on the budding business in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "My market has completely changed," said Ron Enomoto, who grows roses in Half 
Moon Bay, Calif. "We used to ship to people back East. Now, that market's been 
taken over by imports coming into Miami from Colombia." He worries that imports 
from Mexico will take over Western markets as trade barriers fall under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Johna Beall, owner of Beall's Roses in Seattle, grows roses on a 40-acre farm 
in Bogota, Colombia, where equatorial sunshine and moderate mountain 
temperatures provide perfect growing conditions. She sells 8 million roses a 
year in the United States, 1 million for Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Beall agrees with Floral Trade Council allegations that some Colombian growers 
are "dumping" roses in the United States at unfair prices. Growers who are 
staying afloat despite the flood of cheap flowers are those with the highest 
quality product and best marketing skills, Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to continually work to produce a better product for less money," Al 
Riccardi said. "We've expanded our greenhouses, we've computerized them, we've 
added lights. We choose the most productive varieties. We have to use energy 
very wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 The Riccardis added a new complex of greenhouses to their first nine in the 
mid-'80s, doubling their growing space to 300,000 square feet. Double-layer 
acrylic glazing provides better insulation than the old glass, but it still 
takes 300,000 gallons of oil to keep winter temperatures in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil has been replaced with a mixture of bark, peat moss, and rock wool, which 
is watered twice a day by pipelines injected with fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thousand 1,000-watt sodium vapor lights bathe the plants in golden light 
all night long and on cloudy days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're replacing sunlight with these lights," said Al Riccardi, raising his 
voice above the hum of greenhouse fans, the clickety-clank of steam heating 
pipes and the clamor of the cutters' rock radio. "These high-intensity lights 
have allowed us to double our winter production." 
</P>
<P>
 A computer controls everything: lights, cooling vents, irrigation lines, heat, 
fertilizer. Even the air is engineered for maximum plant growth, with carbon 
dioxide increased to three times the level outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant pests and diseases are a problem, complicated by Environmental 
Protection Agency plans to ban or limit certain chemical sprays, Al Riccardi 
said. "This controlled atmosphere is ideal for fungus and insects as well as 
roses. Mildew is very difficult to control." 
</P>
<P>
 In raised concrete beds 4 feet wide and 150 feet long, the roses form hedges 6 
feet tall or more, supported by a network of steel wire. In shoulder-wide 
alleys between the beds, cutters search the walls of green for buds at just the 
right stage of color and size. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut roses with 26-inch stems are held in buckets of water in a refrigerated 
warehouse for shipment within a day of cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't compete with Colombia on price, because labor there is so much 
cheaper and they don't have our heating and electricity bills," Al Riccardi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A poorly handled rose may hang its head and refuse to unfurl. Imports may be 
flown in out of water and held on docks and in warehouses for as much as a week 
before reaching consumers. But Seagroatt roses are trucked in water within a 
day of cutting to retail florists in eastern New York, Vermont, Massachusetts 
and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 They choose flowers that suffer in shipping. "The more perishable it is, the 
better we'll be able to compete by offering quality," Al Riccardi said. "We can 
sell our own alstroemeria for two to three times what we get for the South 
American stuff."

MUSLIMS IN MIDEAST BEGIN RAMADAN FAST; HOLY MONTH: BELIEVERS SHUN FOOD, DRINK 
AND SEX, STARTING WHEN THE CRESCENT OF THE NEW MOON IS SIGHTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Muslims throughout the Middle East thronged mosques and shops Friday on the 
first day of Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting from sunrise to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims shun food, drink and sex during the fast, beginning when the crescent 
of the new moon is sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Muslims are expected to temper their eating at night as well, food 
consumption at night reportedly triples in some parts of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is feasting and not fasting, oh Muslims," complained Sheik Ibrahim Awad, 
prayer leader of the Manama al-Fateh, or Conqueror, mosque in Bahrain. "You 
have to endure the fast and, when you break the fast, think of your hungry 
neighbors. Do not gorge." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramadan, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is named after the 28-day month in 
the lunar Muslim calendar. Its start this year coincided with the Friday 
sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 It also came with welcome cool weather in several Arab Muslim countries. The 
mild chill renders the fast more tolerable, with people spending more time 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Jordanians crowded mosques, and shoppers jammed downtown 
Amman to prepare for the special meal, called Iftar, that ends each day's fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lebanon the long-silent powder cannon traditionally used to signal dawn and 
dusk boomed out for the first time since the 1975 outbreak of the 15-year 
Lebanese civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-run Saudi Press Agency, monitored in Bahrain, distributed sermons by 
preachers at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet Mohammed Mosque in 
Medina, which urged the faithful to piety and charity during Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelry prevailed elsewhere in the Gulf, with shops selling Arabian delicacies 
and minarets ringing with prayers. Veiled women patronized stores, looking for 
for nuts, sugar, rose water and other items, and sidewalks were festooned with 
colored lanterns and neon lights. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, tens of thousands of worshipers crowded the al-Aqsa Mosque, the 
third holiest shrine in Islam after Mecca and Medina. Militants spoke out 
against the Israel-PLO agreement on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This state of Israel will be crushed and Islam will win the holy fight 
against the Big Satan in Washington and its ally in Tel Aviv," shouted an 
Islamic Jihad activist, calling on worshipers to wage holy war against the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Egypt, Cairo is especially festive at nights during Ramadan, when people 
gather for religious celebrations, interpretation of Koranic edicts and 
seminars. Children roam through the streets swinging lanterns and chanting 
Ramadan songs for sweets and coins.

AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT ACCUSED OF RACIAL BIAS; TEXAS: USDA CONCEDES THE 
DISCRIMINATION, BUT DISAVOWS WHAT FARMER CALLS A LEGAL SETTLEMENT. THE 
PREJUDICIAL CONDUCT INCLUDED WITHHOLDING TECHNICAL ADVICE AND LOANS, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The warning came early, Robert Williams Jr. says: He wouldn't have an easy 
time as the only black farmer owning land in Nolan County. 
</P>
<P>
 'You got this old farm, I helped you get in,' " Williams says he was told by a 
Farmers Home Administration official when he bought 349 acres in 1990. " 'Son, 
you standing up there smiling, but you're going to have to fight like hell to 
keep it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' cotton crops never flourished on the land he bought using funds from 
FmHA, the lending arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends the agency's employees in nearby Sweetwater ridiculed him and 
denied him additional loans and technical guidance because of his race. After 
an investigation, the USDA conceded it discriminated against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't no secret," Williams said. "They let me know up front that I wasn't 
like the white man. When it came time for me to get money or do certain things, 
they just wouldn't do things." 
</P>
<P>
 After each planting season, Williams' widely known financial woes deepened. 
Other farmers in his West Texas hometown of 1,500 taunted him, he said, and 
someone killed his dogs, glued shut the locks to his gate and draped the farm's 
entrance with a racist banner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Williams and his attorneys say, the USDA is reneging on a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole system is messed up," said Williams' wife, LaVerne. "They don't 
care. For the government -- I mean, all the way to Washington -- to do someone 
like this, that was a hard pill to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought maybe the nightmare was over," she said. "In a sense, it's just 
begun." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Williams camp calls a settlement, the USDA describes as a proposal 
containing terms the agency has no authority to honor. Bob Nash, the agency's 
undersecretary for small communities and rural development, said the official 
who signed it Aug. 27 was pressured. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney James Myart denies pressuring Carlton Lewis, acting branch chief 
for the FmHA's Equal Opportunity Division. Myart says he considered the 
document final. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his interpretation . . . and I'm not going to refute it one way or the 
other," Lewis said, declining to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 The document in dispute, labeled a "settlement memorandum," resulted from a 
seven-hour meeting in San Antonio between Williams' attorneys and USDA 
officials from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The document instructs the FmHA to pay Williams $1.08 million for farm 
liabilities and damages and $270,743.50 in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lewis started the meeting out saying, 'We are not here to say who was 
wrong, who was right, because we know already that you people have been done 
wrong,' " LaVerne Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Finally, somebody is listening to us,' " she said. "I got 
excited. He said, 'We're here to settle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But a clause in the document required its submission to FmHA acting 
administrator Sharron Longino. One month later, Longino rejected the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no authority that would permit me to pay for such things as Mr. and 
Mrs. Williams' other business debts, lost income, emotional suffering or 
attorneys' fees," she wrote to Myart. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she offered to take the farm to satisfy the operating loan debt, and 
to help work out agreements with other creditors. The FmHA was willing to lease 
the land back to Williams with a purchase option or help find another farm, 
Longino wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've disavowed the agreement and are attempting to treat it as a proposal, 
which is preposterous," said Myart, who accuses agriculture officials of using 
skewed legal reasoning to stall the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, the undersecretary, said USDA lawyers are working with the Department of 
Justice and Williams' representatives to find an acceptable solution. 
</P>
<P>
 He defended his department's handling of discrimination complaints since Mike 
Espy, who is black, became agriculture secretary last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The USDA didn't identify any discrimination cases in 1991, and just six in 
1992, Nash said. But in 1993, the USDA found 26 instances of discrimination and 
is remedying them as quickly as possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be naive for me to say that because Mike Espy is secretary of 
agriculture that no further discrimination will occur at USDA," Nash said. "But 
it is also very realistic for me to say that Mike Espy and his staff will root 
out and investigate every allegation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash confirmed that an investigation revealed discrimination against Williams, 
49, but declined to describe what the Office of Advocacy and Enterprise found. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint that Williams filed in November, 1992, was his second against 
the FmHA. The first was filed in August, 1991, and withdrawn six months later 
-- under coercion, Williams said, and the promise of a $24,900 operating loan, 
which he received. 
</P>
<P>
 Myart, his attorney, titled his summation of the case, "The Williams Tragedy: 
Down in the Land of Cotton, Look Away! Look Away!" 
</P>
<P>
 The summation demanded $1.23 million for farm liabilities, lost income and 
damages including reputation injury, humiliation and severe anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, Williams said, the teasing in the local coffee shop, 
vandalism, debts and FmHA discrimination ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a good old boy," he said, "until I got a farm of my own."

MYSTERY LINGERS ABOUT MYSTIC AND 10 DEATHS; TEXAS: AFTER NEARLY FOUR YEARS OF 
INVESTIGATION, PROSECUTORS ARE NO CLOSER TO PINNING THE FATALITIES ON ANYONE. 
BUT TERRI HOFFMAN FACES UP TO 50 YEARS IN PRISON FOR BANKRUPTCY FRAUD. 
</P>

<P>
 Was mystical leader Terri Hoffman somehow responsible for the suicides or 
accidental deaths of 10 people, eight of them her followers? 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly four years of investigation, prosecutors are no closer to pinning 
the deaths on Hoffman and no evidence has been presented to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But the families of those who died may soon receive at least some consolation: 
Hoffman could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison this month after being 
convicted of bankruptcy fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's at least some semblance of justice," said Dallas County 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Cecil Emerson, who heads the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson conceded a murder indictment is improbable, but said the case will 
remain open, even though it is no longer active. Closing it, he said, "shuts 
down a thin hope that we could convict her of something, or that maybe somebody 
will come forward that knew something more that would help us out." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office began investigating Hoffman after the 
mysterious deaths of David and Glenda Goodman, the last of her followers to 
either commit suicide or otherwise die untimely deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goodmans, who had broken with Hoffman, were found shot to death in their 
home in January, 1990, two handguns beside them on the floor. The couple had 
written Hoffman checks totaling more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1979 to 1990, 10 people with ties to Hoffman died -- six by suspected 
suicides, including two of her four husbands, and four in apparent accidents. 
Of those, two told relatives they suffered from terminal illnesses, although 
autopsies showed they did not, and at least four bequeathed money and property 
to Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the dead were involved with Hoffman's group, Conscious Development of 
Mind, Body and Soul Inc., which religion experts say has cult-like leanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman is to be sentenced Feb. 25 on the fraud charges, which could unblock 
two civil lawsuits pending since she filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 22, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits accuse Hoffman of using "hypnosis, behavior modification, mind 
control and emotional manipulation" to cause the followers' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suits, filed by Leonard Goodman, David Goodman's father, contends 
Hoffman "not only influenced but had almost total control" over his son and 
daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that if David and his wife, Glenda, had never met Terri Hoffman, 
they would be alive today," Goodman said in an interview from his home in Santa 
Maria, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been an ordeal for them," said Dallas attorney Jim 
Barklow, who represents Hoffman's stepchildren in the other suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hoffman, Terri Hoffman's fourth husband, committed suicide by a drug 
overdose on Sept. 16, 1988. He thought he had a terminal disease, but autopsy 
results showed no signs of illness. He left everything to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 His children contend Terri Hoffman used hypnosis to persuade their father to 
kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in a position of just waiting to see what happens in the 
bankruptcy case," Barklow said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Judge Steven A. Felsenthal converted Hoffman's bankruptcy to 
Chapter 7 liquidation status. The order came two weeks after Hoffman was 
convicted on 10 counts of bankruptcy fraud for failing to report an agreement 
to pay her lawyer 15% of any book or movie deals relating to her life story, 
and for failing to disclose that she had power of attorney to control her 
boyfriend's bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The action enables attorneys in the civil lawsuits to refile settlement claims 
with the bankruptcy court or try to proceed with a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Cleaver of Dallas, whose 14-year-old daughter and ex-wife were followers 
of Hoffman and died in mysterious accidents, said the courts "now have the 
opportunity to assess evidence relating to the person one federal law 
enforcement officer has characterized as possibly the most successful, 
unprosecuted serial killer-for-profit in the history of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman, who referred all questions to her attorneys, remains free until her 
sentencing on the fraud charges. She faces up to five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman became known in Dallas in the late 1960s and early '70s for her 
meditation classes, a blend of mythology and metaphysics in which "masters" 
were said to be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 She founded Conscious Development in 1974 to sell tapes and booklets of her 
teachings. The group still has about 100 members in Dallas and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Time, who represents Hoffman in the wrongful death lawsuits, contends the 
family members and Dallas officials are on a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a group of anti-cult people who have nothing to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will never persuade Leonard Goodman of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it go to trial and see her brought up on (murder) charges," 
Goodman said. "But the fact that my son's dead will never go away."

MODELS COPE WITH WARFARE, REGRET; BOSNIA: TWO YEARS AGO, THEY TURNED DOWN JOB 
OFFERS IN WESTERN EUROPE SO THEY COULD FINISH SCHOOL. TODAY, AMID UNIVERSITY 
STUDIES AND MORTAR ROUNDS, THEY ASK HOW THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SO STUPID.

<P>
 At 17, the Mandzuka twins turned down modeling offers from Western Europe so 
they could finish school. Two years later, they dodge shells and haul water 
just to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma and Maja Mandzuka try to keep up appearances. Going about their business 
as though the siege did not exist is a popular ruse among Sarajevans for coping 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The way many people in the city still dress, especially young women, can make 
it hard for an outsider to realize how desperate their situation is. They play 
the age-old shadow game of appearance and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all of their clothes date from before the war and a lipstick can cost 
$60 on the black market, the twins rely on occasional gifts of cosmetics and 
their own ingenuity to put it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 One winter day, Alma wore a red roll-neck sweater, a black imitation-fur 
jacket and jeans. Maja was dressed in an olive paisley shirt over black 
leggings, with sunglasses holding her hair back. Alma wore lipstick and eye 
makeup, Maja only eye liner. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 of the girls' close friends have been killed. For the two blond, 
blue-eyed teen-agers, budding careers in modeling and television have given way 
to chores imposed by war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had offers from Italy, France and Germany," Alma said. "We didn't accept 
them because we were very young. But we were very stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Shells permitting, they continue their business and marketing studies at 
Sarajevo Economics University. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening study is by candlelight because their part of the city is usually 
without electricity. They walk the three miles to classes, carefully planning 
the route to avoid snipers, because the streetcar line between their 
neighborhood and downtown Sarajevo has been knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Alma and Maja even try to keep up a semblance of social life, meeting friends 
in cafes, but always get home before the 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day is dangerous. Three shells landed near their home recently, killing 
five people, three of them friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins have virtually no income. Their father, Slobodan, a 46-year-old 
Muslim Serb, is paid only a few coupons a month as an army lieutenant. Their 
mother, Jasmina, 45, is unemployed. Both parents worked in insurance before the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 In winter, the sisters nearly always have colds and worry about the skimpy 
diet they share with other Sarajevans. Breakfast is canned beef from relief 
supplies, if they have it, or just bread and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our health is damaged," Maja said. "We are ill because, for two years, we 
have been living on that beef." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fruit! Fruit is a dream," Alma said. She fears a lack of milk and other foods 
is damaging their teeth and hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once every two weeks do they shampoo their shoulder-length hair. They 
need a total of 13 gallons of water, which means at least two dangerous trips 
to the pump, and must use precious fuel to heat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Their friends tell them they have lost weight, but they have no scale to weigh 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters are tall -- 5-foot-9 -- and strikingly similar, but not identical. 
They worked as a team until the Bosnian war began in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Resuming their careers is still a hope, and they are searching for a way to 
get to Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in Sarajevo breeds suspicion, however, and Alma said the twins worry that 
someone offering work abroad might really be trying to lure them into "some 
dirty job." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't trust anybody," Alma said, but Maja added: "In Sarajevo, every day 
we die slowly."

<P>
 The average income of the nation's physicians rose to $177,400 in 1992, up 4% 
from the year before, the American Medical Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average income figures, compiled annually by the AMA based on a telephone 
survey of more than 4,100 physicians, ranged from a low of $111,800 for general 
practitioners and family practice doctors to a high of $253,300 for 
radiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians' median income was $148,000 in 1992, or 6.5% more than a year 
earlier. Half the physicians earned more than that and half earned less.

WEATHERING WINTER WITHOUT TV METEOROLOGISTS, SNOW BLOWERS OR CARS; NATURE: IN 
THE PAST, PEOPLE ACCEPTED THE SNOW AND COLD AND ALTERED THEIR LIVES TO COPE. 
THAT COULD MEAN STAYING INDOORS FOR WEEKS, EATING CANNED FOOD AND BURNING 
STOCKPILED WOOD. BUT NOWADAYS, COMMUTERS EXPECT TO GET TO WORK NO MATTER WHAT.

<P>
 They did it without road salt or electric blankets, without television 
meteorologists, forecasting satellites or snow blowers -- and, especially, 
without automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, people 100 or 200 years ago managed to weather winter without most of 
the "conveniences" considered indispensable today. In many ways, they handled 
the season better than we do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an acceptance of the winter, and a willingness to work with 
whatever the weather brought you," said Katie Boardman, associate director of 
the Farmers' Museum in Cooperstown. "I think that was because people's daily 
lives were so much more connected to nature and the elements than we are 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 The dread of a winter commute that millions of motorists feel today, for 
instance, was just the opposite in the pre-automobile age. Without the muck of 
fall and the even worse mire of spring, winter was regarded as the most 
dependable season for travel in the horse-powered era, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our road network today, we feel winter must have been much more 
difficult in those days," said Charles Gehring, a New York State Museum expert 
on the Dutch settlers of the 17th and 18th Centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "But back then, it was so much more advantageous, because you didn't have 
these huge, muddy ruts in the roads during the winter," Gehring said. Heavy 
items, in particular, were easier to move on the hard winter ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse-drawn sleigh was the most popular means of winter transportation 
before the automobile. Roads were often rolled after snowstorms by teams of 
oxen or horses, creating a smooth carpet of ice for sleighs' runners. 
</P>
<P>
 People still died or were injured when sleighs overturned, and they risked 
exposure if they were stranded by drifts or injuries to their horses. But the 
sleighs were still probably just as safe, if not safer, than fast cars on 
crowded, snowy roads, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter was often a social time too. With farm chores limited by the snow, 
people had more time for visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 People were adept at stocking up for winter by canning vegetables, curing 
meats and drying fruits, Boardman said. They amassed supplies of firewood. They 
"piled their clothes on and kept them on, even indoors," Boardman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People 100 years ago were much more self-reliant," said Tim Clark, executive 
editor of the Old Farmer's Almanac. "That's not to say they were any more 
virtuous, but back then they had to fend for themselves in weather like this." 
</P>
<P>
 They usually had the advantage of not having to leave home, for days or even 
weeks if necessary, during dangerous storms or cold snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The first crude motorized snowplows appeared in the 1920s and 1930s, according 
to Duane Amsler, an engineer with the New York Department of Transportation. 
Road salt came along after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 During those decades, there was a gradual shift in the pattern of life in New 
York and the rest of the United States. People moved from cities and farms to 
the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of walking to the office or the barn, people had to drive to work from 
the suburbs, Amsler said. People demanded an all-weather highway system and 
came to expect to roll out of bed and to get to work in more or less the same 
time, whether it be sunny or snowy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a kind of presumptuous attitude toward nature that most people in the 
pre-automobile age did not have, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People looked at the clouds a lot," Boardman said. "Many farmers looked at 
their almanacs. They looked at the moon cycles. They watched the plants and the 
animals around them to see how they were reacting. They used that information 
to help them know what was going to come. . . . And they were very careful 
about going out." 
</P>
<P>
 Formal attempts to forecast the weather did not start until after the Civil 
War. For the next two generations those were limited by information that could 
be gleaned from a thermometer, a barometer, a wind gauge and telegraphic 
reports of conditions to the west and south. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Blizzard of 1888, the most famous snowstorm of the 19th Century and 
probably in all of American history, came as a shock to everyone. That included 
forecasters, who predicted rainy and windy conditions, followed by clearing, as 
the tempest was starting to blow on March 12, 1888. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 21 inches of snow fell on New York City; nearly 50 inches on Albany. 
Hundreds were killed up and down the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, we know so little anyway, and there is so much more of which we are 
and must be ignorant," the weather service's organizer, Cleveland Abbe, said a 
few days after the 1888 blizzard. "We are utterly ignorant of what is going on 
to the east of us, and overhead." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those killed in the Great Blizzard were in cities, especially New 
York, Philadelphia, Albany, New Haven, Conn., and Hartford, Conn. Typically, 
they ventured out in the face of the whirlwind and became trapped in 10- or 
15-foot drifts while walking to catch trains or elevated railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in 1888, some people saw in that blizzard the dangers of putting too 
much trust in the "advances" of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the boasting and progressive 19th Century that is paralyzed, while the 
slow-going 18th would have taken such an experience without a ruffle," the 
Hartford Courant editorialized just after the blizzard. "It is our own 
'advantages' that have gone back on us. . . . It is only a snowstorm, but it 
has downed us." 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, wintertime continues to remind people that for all their 
Die-Hard batteries and four-wheel drive vehicles, for all their efforts to 
triumph over cold and snow, they can't ignore the inconvenience or do much 
about the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of going back to the Bible, where we are supposedly given rule over 
everything," said Mark Wysocki, a lecturer in meteorology at Cornell 
University. "But we don't have rule over everything. The winter reminds us of 
that. It reminds us of the fact we are slaves to nature."

STORMS OF PROTEST BUFFET TV FORECASTERS

 Obscene phone calls, hate mail, a hangman's noose: That's what TV 
meteorologists get just for doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by extreme weather like the recent blast of arctic air across the 
Midwest and East, some tempestuous viewers blame the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll swear at you. They'll cuss you out on the answering machine," said 
Boston weather forecaster Bruce Schwoegler of WBZ-TV. "There are people who 
feel that we do control the weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Most viewers know meteorologists just forecast, but some grant them God-like 
authority, holding them personally responsible for blizzards and numbing cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwoegler said a meteorologist at his station once received a tiny twine 
hangman's noose in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 At WATE-TV in Knoxville, Tenn., Ken Weathers -- his real name -- said a woman 
once called him to scream because her electricity was knocked out by a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Chisholm, forecaster for WHAS-TV in Louisville, Ky., said she no longer 
goes to the grocery store in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get my food in the cart because everybody stops you and says, 'What's 
the deal with all this rain? When are you going to stop it?' They actually 
blame you for it," Chisholm said. "There's only so much you can take." 
</P>
<P>
 And recently, when a record-breaking 21 below zero chilled Chicago, Tom 
Skilling of WGN-TV got a typed letter accusing him of being too extreme when he 
called the cold front "brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 "This fringe element comes out after every spate of bad weather," Skilling 
said. "I think it's a 'kill the messenger' syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such hate. They pretty much tell you to drop dead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some viewers looking for warmer weather take a more positive approach. 
Chisholm said people have called asking her to "please put sunshine in her 
computer." 
</P>
<P>
 George Kessler at KBJR-TV in Duluth, Minn., got a bribe the other day. The 
letter said: "Here's a dollar for a temperature of zero. Maybe $10 if you'd get 
us to 50." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Paul Schervish said TV meteorologists provoke viewers because 
their theatrics -- "shaman-like" maps and radar machines -- give weather 
reports the aura of decree by high priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not the reporters but the producers of the weather. They say, 'I have 
good news for you.' They don't say, 'The weather is bad news.' They personalize 
it," said Schervish, a professor at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 But Skilling said some viewers might be angered when forecasters focus on 
damaging storms and record lows. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fascination is sometimes seen as excitement -- the willful desire to 
inflict pain and suffering on our viewers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming meteorologists for bad weather gives viewers a feeling of control over 
people they sometimes see as a family member, said Ellen Langer, a Harvard 
University psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, like a family member, they can be hated or loved," she said.

A FISHING VESSEL CALLED MISTAKE FINDS SUNKEN SPANISH TREASURE BY ACCIDENT; 
HISTORY: ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT A MAJOR FIND, THE GULF OF MEXICO DISCOVERY OF 1783 
SILVER AND OTHER ITEMS HAS INSPIRED RESEARCHING THE VOYAGE'S CIRCUMSTANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Spanish brig-of-war El Cazador, laden with 19 tons of newly minted silver, 
struggled against the storm -- until the battle was lost, and the ship and its 
treasure sank in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 There it rested for 210 years, until last year, when it was found by accident 
-- and by Mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, the fishing vessel Mistake dropped a trawl along the muddy bottom 
in 300 feet of water, 50 miles south of Grand Isle. It came up torn and full of 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those rocks didn't fit in with anything that's supposed to be there," said 
the Mistake's captain, Jerry Murphy. "While I was thinking about that, one of 
my deckhands fell down on his knees on the deck and started shouting, 'Coins! 
Coins!' . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The rocks and coins were being banged together in the net and started to rain 
down through the webbing." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, this was not a major find -- the kind that might make its 
discoverer outrageously wealthy or unleash a murderous competition for silver. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has inspired a kind of historical treasure hunt, looking for the 
circumstances surrounding the ship's voyage. And even if the sunken treasure 
isn't worth billions, plans are afoot to exploit it commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 The coins were dated 1783 and carried the portrait of Carlos III of Spain. 
Murphy called the uncle who owns the Mistake and told him to get hold of his 
friend David Paul Horan, a marine salvage attorney who worked with the treasure 
galleon Nuestra Senora de Atocha in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him it looked to me like a mint shipment, because the coins were 
stacked, like poker chips, and all the same date," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 His guess was right on the money. Horan had a maritime history researcher 
check the Spanish archives. The researcher, Robert Stenuit, learned that El 
Cazador -- The Hunter -- was sent to Vera Cruz in late 1783 to get hard cash to 
pay the troops and government, and to redeem 250,000 pesos worth of paper notes 
used to pay them over the previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 It carried 400,000 silver pesos and another 50,000 pesos worth of smaller 
change, of various dates. At one ounce to the peso, and 12 troy ounces to the 
pound, that's 37,500 pounds of silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship left Vera Cruz for New Orleans on Jan. 11, 1784, and was declared 
lost in June. It was the only big cash shipment out of Vera Cruz to be lost by 
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico from 1783 to 1785. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership formed to salvage the money and the ship asserts that the loss 
contributed to Spain's decision to return the Louisiana Territory to France in 
1800. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Paul Hoffman, a Louisiana State University history professor and 
an expert in the state's colonial history. The people most affected by the loss 
would have been those who let Spanish soldiers buy on credit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laundresses and boardinghouse keepers and tavern keepers -- folk who 
extended credit to soldiers -- would have had to wait another year," Hoffman 
said. "It almost certainly did not have any effect on Spain's decision to give 
up Louisiana . . . which had to do with its position in Europe and diplomacy 
and warfare and other reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 The coins' value depends on their history. The 1783 peso is common, worth $25 
to $250 depending on condition, said Tom Michael, a market analyst for the 
Standard Catalogue of World Coins. 
</P>
<P>
 The price would be even lower if they were all sold at auction at once, 
because dealers would buy in bulk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horan acknowledged that, as treasure ships go, this one is almost small 
change. The partnership sees people interested in history and in treasure lost 
at sea as the market for most of the coins and other artifacts, Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a very affordable type of coin, purchased with a 
historical account of where it was found and where it was going," Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other clients have invested $3 million to $4 million in robotics to 
excavate a wreck about 8,500 feet deep off the coast of Central America, he 
said. "This is not going to justify that kind of expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is well worth bringing up more than the 40,000 or 50,000 coins, the 
ship's bell, a faceted yellow stone -- possibly a topaz -- and other things 
found so far, Horan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Grumpy Partnership -- the Mistake is owned by Grumpy Inc. -- will 
bring up coins first, because they are the most likely targets for theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the cooking utensils, the dishes, the belt buckles and weapons 
owned or used by the 40 to 100 men on the brig. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have the armament of the day -- muskets and side arms and 
cutlasses and sabres and dirks and things like that," Horan said. "We've got to 
be in position where we can stabilize and conserve all of those. We won't bring 
anything to the surface that we can't take care of." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the hope that Lt. Gabriel de Campos y Pineda, who was in command 
of the brig, might have been smuggling jewels.

RULING COULD BOOST CHINESE IMMIGRATION; BIRTH CONTROL: FEDERAL JUDGE SAYS 
BEIJING'S STRICT POLICY VIOLATES A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. IF THAT INTERPRETATION 
HOLDS UP, EXPERTS SAY, MORE CHINESE MAY WIN LEGAL REFUGE HERE.

 When the Chinese government ordered the sterilization of Guo Chun Di and his 
wife as part of a population-control crackdown, the 29-year-old farmer decided 
to run away. He hopped a freighter and fled to the United States -- "a freedom 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had paid a smuggler $5,000 for a spot on the boat and spent four months at 
sea. But as soon as he arrived in New York in June, on board the ill-fated 
Golden Venture, Guo was put behind bars, winding up in a jail in Winchester, 
Va. He was about to be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came a federal judge in Alexandria, Va., who gave him another 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision that specialists say could encourage a new wave of Chinese 
immigration and trigger more lawsuits for asylum, U.S. District Judge T. S. 
Ellis III ruled that China's population-control strategy is political 
persecution, a violation of a basic human right. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy has been criticized for using sterilization and abortion to enforce 
the country's one-child-per-family rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ellis' ruling did not grant Guo political asylum, it ordered 
immigration officials to review his case and consider the family-planning issue 
when deciding whether to send him back to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Guo remains in jail, dreaming that one day his wife and daughter 
will be able to join him in the United States, according to his lawyer, Timothy 
S. Burgett. 
</P>
<P>
 Guo, who has six years of schooling, "knows we've won a victory. But he 
doesn't understand, if he won, why he's still in jail," Burgett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ellis' Jan. 14 opinion is not binding on dozens of similar cases 
pending in federal courts across the nation, human-rights advocates described 
the decision as a breakthrough in recognizing China's family-planning policy as 
a legitimate basis for granting political asylum. Those who seek to limit 
immigration view it as a dangerous invitation to illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely important opinion, a trailblazing opinion, because this 
is the first federal judge to rule on this issue," said Craig Trebilcock, an 
immigration lawyer who is seeking asylum for 22 Chinese refugees jailed in 
York, Pa. "There can tend to be a domino effect in these matters." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, called the judge's decision "a disaster" and added, "We're sending a 
message back to China: You're going to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling raises moral and public-policy questions at a time when the Clinton 
Administration's policy on Chinese refugees is under review. The issue has 
generated debate at the White House, Justice Department, Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and State Department as well as in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key questions is how far this country should go to grant relief to 
Chinese who want more than one child. 
</P>
<P>
 Guo Chun Di's story is similar to those of other Chinese refugees seeking 
asylum for family reasons. He told authorities that he came to the United 
States in desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has no freedom," Guo told an immigration judge last summer. "I only 
have one child. I want to have two more children, but they won't let me. I'm 
afraid that if they find me, they will take me to get sterilized." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Chinese men who sailed with Guo on the Golden Venture have cases 
pending at the Alexandria courthouse: Yang Cheng Huan, 26, who said his wife 
was sterilized two years ago after giving birth to their second child, and Chen 
Zhao Chai, 41, who said he was fined and sterilized for fathering two children. 
His wife was forced to have an abortion in 1992 to prevent a third birth, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guo, Yang and Chen declined to be interviewed after requests were made through 
their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 China has come under international criticism for its population-control 
policy. The Chinese government says the policy, pursued since 1979, is 
necessary so that population growth doesn't wreck the economy. The world's most 
populous nation, China has nearly 1.2 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance with the policy is encouraged by education, economic incentives and 
stronger measures such as fines and demotions. Although abortions and 
sterilization are not officially mandated, they continue to occur, most often 
in remote rural areas. The number of children a couple is allowed to have 
before being penalized varies by region.

HE WALKED AWAY FROM FOOTBALL; ATHLETES: TIM LEWIS QUIT AFTER AN INJURY WHILE 
WITH THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. DOCTOR TOLD HIM: 'YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THE 
GAME.'

 War and football are often viewed as analogous. Tim Lewis discovered that and 
walked away from football rather than risk paralysis or death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marines and the Army use discipline to get a man to walk into bullets," 
said George Young, the general manager of the NFL's New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football players have to be disciplined in much the same way -- to give pain 
or absorb it. It's not natural to get a soldier to walk into bullets. And what 
we do in football isn't much more natural." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Lewis quit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, in his third year as a defensive back for the Green Bay Packers, he 
tackled Willie Gault and went down, no feeling in his arms or legs. It had 
happened before and he had recovered, so he assumed he'd recover again. He did, 
but doctors told him his body wasn't equipped to absorb the shocks and stresses 
of everyday collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an athlete, I thought I'd be ready in a couple of days," Lewis said. "But 
the doctor (at Mayo Clinic) told me I had a congenitally narrow (spinal) canal. 
'You never should have played the game,' he told me. Usually, they tell you 
it's just a stinger, you'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not washed up," Lewis said a doctor told him. "You're Mr. Invincible, 
Mr. Tough Guy. He said, 'Go tell Coach Gregg you can play. It's just a bruise. 
Just a bruise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Forrest Gregg told Lewis that he should go to the Mayo Clinic and 
that he would abide by the findings of the doctors there. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings at Mayo? 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was crazy to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor there asked me if I had my college degree. I told him I did, and 
he said 'Use it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He interviewed for many jobs, but ended up coaching, eventually landing back 
at Pitt, the University of Pittsburgh, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, he's still walking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all players are afraid," he said. "In football, many a locker-room 
conversation is about how I hope this doesn't happen and that doesn't happen. 
But when the whistle blows, fear goes out of your mind. You're invincible. 
You're Superman; you're a projectile missile. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're more afraid of looking soft and intimidated. Your body is the last 
thing you think about."

CALIFORNIA VINTNERS REMEMBER DRY DAYS OF '26; WINEMAKING: WHILE MANY PIONEERING 
FAMILIES WENT OUT OF BUSINESS, OTHERS SURVIVED OR EVEN PROSPERED BY SHIPPING 
GRAPES AND CONCENTRATED GRAPE JUICE BACK EAST FOR THE LUCRATIVE HOME MARKET.

<P>
 More than 65 years have passed since the day the wine flowed like a river in 
Healdsburg, but Sonoma County winemaker Louis Foppiano remembers it as if it 
were yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibition was 6 years old, with no end in sight. In the Foppiano Vineyards 
cellars, 150,000 gallons of old wine was slowly turning to vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't sell it and it was going bad," Foppiano said. "(So) in 1926, we 
dumped it down the side of the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 And as two federal agents watched, the good people of Healdsburg did what they 
could to stem the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in town came up and picked up the wine -- in gallons, quarts, tin 
cans, anything they could pick it up in," said Foppiano, who was 15 at the 
time. "It was heartbreaking to see all that money go down the side of the 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strange scene that befit Prohibition, which took effect in 1920 and 
was repealed 60 years ago, on Dec. 5, 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of a spirit of moral rectitude, Prohibition inspired Americans to new 
heights of decadence and provided an economic base for organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volstead Act set penalties for the transport and sale of alcoholic 
beverages, but not their consumption. It banned the sale of wine except for 
sacramental or medicinal purposes, but allowed home winemakers to ferment up to 
200 gallons a year for their own use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prohibition wasn't a single monolithic condition, but had all sorts of 
contradictions . . . curious gaps and crazy compromises," said Thomas Pinney, a 
Pomona College professor who has published a history of the wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere were the paradoxes greater than in California's wine country, 
according to industry pioneers reminiscing about the dry years. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. wine production plunged from 51 million gallons in 1918 to 3 million in 
1925, according to government figures. The number of wineries in California 
fell from 694 in 1922 to a quarter that number in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 But while many winemaking families in California went out of business, others 
survived or even prospered by shipping grapes and concentrated grape juice back 
East for the lucrative home market. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the outset of Prohibition, everybody supposed that the California wine 
industry would disappear. But the grape-growing acreage of California doubled 
between 1920 and 1925," said Pinney. 
</P>
<P>
 "As someone said, if only Prohibition had lasted long enough, America might 
have finally become a wine-drinking nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Grape prices shot up -- from as low as $8 a ton to as high as $200 before they 
collapsed -- and many a young wine country boy's hands grew calloused nailing 
together lug boxes which held 25 pounds of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was not in school I used to make those boxes," said Ed Mirassou, 74, a 
fourth-generation winemaker. "It was quite an art, and I remember my brother 
and I tried to make them as fast as the professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Mirassou's family left the wine business to ship grapes and grow prunes in 
1920. He and brother Norbert didn't make wine again until 1937, when they 
founded Mirassou Vineyards in the Santa Clara Valley south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine makers were largely Italian, French and Eastern European immigrants, and 
their craft was so intertwined with their culture that they couldn't quite 
believe Prohibition would actually come about. "It seemed strange and unnatural 
to us because wine was part of our everyday meal," Mirassou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis P. Martini, the 74-year-old chairman of Louis M. Martini Winery, said 
his father had a hard time believing Prohibition would last. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did last, as did the damage to the wine industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the best grapes were uprooted and inferior wine grapes -- thicker 
skinned ones that shipped better -- were planted," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirassou said poor grape quality and an exodus by expert winemakers to other 
professions set the industry back two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The skill of winemaking in California was lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when repeal finally came, who really cared? For years, table wines were 
outsold by fortified dessert wines with more kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers were not used to drinking wine. They wanted a quick jolt -- a lot 
of alcohol without a lot of quantity," Mirassou said. 
</P>
<P>
 The descendants of California's turn-of-the-century winemakers say they won't 
make the same mistake twice, and they are speaking out loudly against what they 
believe is a neo-Prohibitionist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some people who want to see all alcohol eliminated. It 
doesn't matter if it's a glass of wine with meals or somebody getting soused 
and driving," Martini said. "The lesson of Prohibition is you really can't 
legislate that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Other things have changed too. The wine industry is better prepared, but 
anti-alcohol forces have changed their approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real motive behind the Prohibition drive was moral. . . . Now it's under 
the guise of health," Pinney said. "But from either point of view, wine is seen 
as both destructive and unnecessary. It's the same puritanism."

WOMEN'S DUDE RANCH LASSOS CALLUSES, JOY; KANSAS: GUESTS CHANGE FROM THEIR CITY 
CLOTHES, ROLL UP THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES AND EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT 
DOING THE CHORES.

 Lisa Ribar pulls a long plastic glove over her arm, yanks it in place and 
looks at the cow standing in the chute. 
</P>
<P>
 She slides her arm inside the cow and, gazing upward, listens as the 
veterinarian tells her to poke around gently and find a spot that responds to 
her touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh! Awesome. I feel it. A baby cow. Awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Ribar, 35, an office worker from Rogers, Ark., paid for the experience as a 
weekend guest at Prairie Women Adventures and Retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 On this clear autumn Saturday, about 40 cows wait to be run through the chute 
so the vet can learn if they're pregnant. Cattle also will be vaccinated, and 
some will have their horns cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is done by the dozen or so guests, three ranch hands, the vet and 
Jane Koger, who operates the retreat out of her 6,000-acre ranch in the Flint 
Hills of southeast Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Koger notes after Ribar does her pregnancy check that the guest has what's 
called "the prairie woman look." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the look that says, 'I just caught the cow's head as it came through 
the chute, and I'd never touched a cow before and didn't know what a chute was, 
and yet I just did this,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what life is about at Koger's ranch: women feeling courageous and 
capable, as if there isn't much that can stop them from doing what they want -- 
especially when they're driving a two-ton hay bailer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also what Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Least Heat Moon may have 
seen in Koger when he wrote about her and the rest of Chase County in his 
latest book, "PrairieErth."  
</P>
<P>
 Koger, 40, a fourth-generation Chase County rancher, left the region briefly 
for college and returned in 1979 to get into the family business. But she 
defies the stereotypes of a cattle rancher. 
</P>
<P>
 She drives a four-door Mazda, loves Broadway and travels to New York City for 
the shows. And, although she grew up eating meat twice a day, she now limits 
that to about two times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that I wanted to prove to myself, and to others, that I can play 
this game of ranching. And I have done that. I can do this, and I can do it 
well. But what I'm about now is education and women, and the good ol' boys 
can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Koger started Prairie Women Adventures and Retreat in 1986 because she felt a 
need among women to experience ranch life and do chores that meant getting 
smelly, dirty and sore. 
</P>
<P>
 Female-only guests stay in the bunkhouse, which was designed by women and 
built by an all-woman crew in about two months last year. Guests start the day 
about 8 a.m. and spend their time herding, branding, castrating and vaccinating 
cattle -- depending on the season. Meals are served in the bunkhouse, which 
also has a deck and a hot tub, where guests often linger long into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Why only women? 
</P>
<P>
 "Men have so many more opportunities in life, and ranching is so traditionally 
male anyway, that we're here to help women understand ranching and let them 
take from it what they can, which I happen to think is a lot," Koger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because "PrairieErth" chronicles the past and present of Chase County, Koger 
said she knew there would be a surge of interest in the area and in her ranch. 
She was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie Women Adventures and Retreat costs about $200 for a weekend and has 
become a popular draw for women from New York to Kansas City to Washington 
willing to trade their suits, heels and Volvos for jeans, boots and horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prairie Women is really about three things, education, environment and 
empowerment," Koger said. "The women who come here get to do non-traditional 
jobs, and it is empowering." 
</P>
<P>
 Many come not so much for what they can learn about ranching but for what 
ranching can teach them about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got here and I just felt: 'Ah. At last. A place I can be comfortable,' " 
said ranch hand Jessica Panko, 24, of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Panko, who recently graduated from Harvard with a degree in comparative 
religions, had been working at the ranch for about a month and planned to stay 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so exciting. They come from all walks of life," said Prairie Women 
director Rhea Miller, a longtime friend of Koger's. "When the ranch hands first 
see the guests, they think, 'Oh no, they'll never get along or . . . they'll 
never be able to do this work.' But by the end of two days they are pushing up 
cattle and getting each other's addresses."

 The fishing ministry increased the quota for harp seal hunting on Friday, but 
a ban on killing cubs remained in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian sealers in the western zone will be allowed to hunt 10,600 harp 
seals this year, an increase of 2,100 seals over last year, the ministry said. 
The zone quota of 1,700 hooded seals was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 On the east coast and the adjacent zone near Russia, the quota stayed at 9,500 
harp seals, Permanent Secretary Gunnar Kjonnoy said.

caught a head-banging, chest-ripping cold. On the third day, a chain letter 
arrived in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This paper has been sent to you for good luck," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been around the world nine times. The luck has been sent to you. You 
will receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, provided, in 
turn, you send it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all junk mail, is any more irritating than the chain letter? It comes 
unbidden, unwelcome, forcing on us a choice we never sought, declaring that 
good fortune is no matter of luck after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter bore no return address, no signature. Just "St. Jude" typed at the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "THIS IS NO JOKE," it said, driving home the point with examples of people who 
built or broke the chain: 
</P>
<P>
 "An RAF officer received $170,000; Joe Elliot received $40,000 and lost it 
because he broke the chain. . . . Darlan Fairchild received the letter and, not 
believing, threw it away and died nine days later." 
</P>
<P>
 Great. A photocopied extortion note, with fate as both payoff and threat. Time 
to call in the feds -- specifically, Paul Griffo of the U.S. Postal Service's 
inspection office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 As I read him the letter, including the part about its going around the world 
nine times, he stopped me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, the St. Jude letter," he said. "Nine is a low estimate of how many times 
that thing has been around the world. It's as old as dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 His office keeps track of chain letters. When they involve the exchange of 
money, they are considered illegal lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many versions tell you to send a dollar (or $10 or $100) to the name at the 
top of a list. Then you're supposed to retype the list, leaving off that name 
and adding your own at the bottom before sending it to five or 10 or 20 
friends. Before long, such letters promise, your mailbox will be stuffed full 
o' cash. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some non-monetary chains the Postal Service considers 
relatively harmless -- Little Golden Book chains, circulated among children; 
dish towel chains; even panty chains for women's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no chain letter like the St. Jude chain letter, Griffo said. It 
is the granddaddy of all chain letters, by far the most persistent and widely 
circulated. The wording changes over the years; new testimonials of luck 
replace old ones. "But it remains uncannily the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the St. Jude letter doesn't ask for money, it is not illegal, Griffo 
said. Just annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter itself claims the chain started in Venezuela, written by one Saul 
Anthony DeGrou, a missionary. Griffo has no idea where it really comes from, 
nor who keeps it going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it is started, it's almost impossible to track down the origin of 
anything like that," he said. "It is almost a folk tradition. It becomes a 
superstitious observance more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In popular Roman Catholic belief, St. Jude is the patron saint of lost causes 
-- an appropriate symbol for the Postal Service's futile efforts to stop this 
and other chain letters over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a fairly safe bet that if you throw it away, nothing is going to 
happen to you," Griffo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if everyone kept the chain going, it wouldn't be lucky. It would be 
apocalyptic. Suppose I sent 20 letters as instructed, and each recipient sent 
20 letters within four days, and everyone down the line did the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the Postal Service delivered each batch within three days, then by 
Day 57 there would be 25.6 billion sheets of luck wafting around the planet. By 
Day 92, there would be 81.9 quadrillion letters, or enough 8 1/2-by-11 inch 
pieces of paper to cover the entire United States 634 sheets deep. Not to 
mention envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another few weeks and civilization would be buried miles beneath shifting 
dunes of photocopied letters, each one proclaiming, "This paper has been sent 
to you for good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone passes the letter on. Just enough to keep it alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to believe," Griffo said. "They want to believe that something is 
going to be a panacea for all their problems, that this is finally it, this is 
the good omen they've been looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 I'll find my omens elsewhere, thank you. After reading the chain letter, I 
realized the wastebasket was a challenging 10 feet away. I crumpled, aimed, 
threw -- and swish . A perfect shot. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt luckier already.

WESTSIDE WATCH: A FINAL TIP OF THE HAT TO A HOLLYWOOD LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valentine's Day will bring heartache to Hollywood, where funeral services are 
scheduled at 10 a.m. for the famed Brown Derby Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark eatery at 1628 Vine St. was damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
Demolition of the restaurant, which has been closed for nine years, began Jan. 
24 and is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral at the restaurant site -- on what would have been the Brown 
Derby's 65th birthday -- is being organized by Hollywood Heritage, a 
preservation group, and will include a motorcade, roses and a casket. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, within the Brown Derby's distinctive wood-paneled interior, Clark 
Gable proposed marriage to Carole Lombard, Irish mafia members Spencer Tracy, 
Ralph Bellamy and Pat O'Brien tippled into the wee hours, and restaurant owner 
Bob Cobb invented the Cobb salad after rummaging through the refrigerator to 
feed some pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that Disney World just contacted us about building a replica of 
the Brown Derby in Tampa," said Christine O'Brien of Hollywood Heritage. "The 
original restaurant here will now only exist in fantasy -- and isn't that 
Hollywood?"

 PARTY'S OVER: Just when you thought it was safe to ignore the parking meters, 
Santa Monica's curb cops are again on the prowl.

 Because many parking garages were closed after the earthquake, the city

 Temporarily. As of last week, the dreaded ticket-writers were back on the job.

 SPIRIT OF '76?: State Sen. Tom Hayden's announcement Wednesday that he will 
seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination may have brought back bad memories 
to some of his fellow party members. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Santa Monica Democrat ran a statewide campaign was 1976, 
when he took on then-U.S. Sen. John V. Tunney in that spring's Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start Hayden gained ground, aided by contributions and loans from 
then-wife Jane Fonda. But then Tunney attacked Hayden's proposals for a "new 
democracy of participation." Tunney won with 54% of the vote to Hayden's 37%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden gave little help to Tunney during the general election campaign. 
Pollster and political analyst Mervin Field said last week that Hayden's 
primary challenge to Tunney was instrumental in Tunney's general election loss 
to Republican S.I. Hayakawa.

RULING RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT HOMELESS LAW; COURTS: INVALIDATION OF A SANTA ANA 
ORDINANCE COULD AFFECT SANTA MONICA'S PROHIBITION OF ENCAMPMENTS. THE STATE 
SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY WILL DECIDE THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When an appellate court recently threw out a Santa Ana law that outlawed 
homeless encampments, the justices said what advocates for the homeless in 
Santa Monica have contended all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply not a crime to be unemployed, without funds and in a public 
place," the opinion said. "To punish the unfortunate for this circumstance 
debases society." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words came originally from a 1967 opinion written by the late U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. They were quoted verbatim by 
Associate Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. of the California Court of Appeal in 
striking down the Santa Ana law Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision in the Santa Ana case has been long awaited by those on both 
sides of the homeless issue, in Santa Monica and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pushing for regulation of the homeless population in public places were 
hoping to get the court's OK to move forward. Legal advocates for the homeless 
were looking for a ruling that would thwart efforts to outlaw living in parks 
and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 With its strong language, the Court of Appeal's decision in the Santa Ana case 
is fodder for homeless advocates such as ousted Santa Monica City Atty. Robert 
M. Myers. He argued strenuously that laws restricting homeless people 
criminalize poverty and are meant to drive the homeless from a community. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's law prohibiting encampments, which was written after Myers was 
fired, has also been challenged by public interest lawyers. It has not been 
enforced pending the outcome of the Santa Ana case. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the future of the Santa Monica law is even more uncertain. "I wouldn't be 
in favor of trying to enforce that law with this decision out there," said 
Santa Monica City Councilwoman Asha Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg pointed out, however, that the climate in Santa Monica is vastly 
different from that in Santa Ana. In the Santa Ana case, the court had an 
official memo entitled "Vagrants." It spelled out a City Council policy "that 
the vagrants are no longer welcome in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, by contrast, has a strong track record of serving its homeless 
population, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christi Hogin, an attorney who wrote the Santa Monica encampment law, agreed. 
She said the Santa Monica law is modeled on a West Hollywood ordinance, also 
written by Hogin's firm, Richards, Watson & Gershon, that has been declared 
legal by a three-member appellate panel of the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court.

BRIEFLY; ARTS: GETTY TRUST TO HELP MEND CAL ARTS' QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The J. Paul Getty Trust in Malibu has pledged $2 million to help the 
California Institute of the Arts in Valencia recover from damage sustained in 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal Arts is recognized internationally as a leading educational institution 
devoted to the arts and has flourished under the leadership of its president, 
Steven Levine," said Harold M. Williams, president and chief executive officer 
of the trust. "It is vital that it be made whole again as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag for repairing the damage is estimated at $12 million to $15 
million. The institute hopes to have its campus fully repaired by September. 
While most of the campus remains structurally intact, extensive damage to 
mechanical systems has forced the institute to find temporary, off-site 
classroom space for its 1,000 students of art, dance, film/video, music and 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty Trust is a private foundation dedicated to the visual arts and 
humanities. Entertainment: Hollywood Walk of Fame Star to Pat Sajak 
</P>
<P>
 "Wheel of Fortune" host Pat Sajak got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sajak and co-star Vanna White have become virtual television icons in America 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's format is simple: Contestants attempt to complete common phrases 
one letter at a time, after spinning a wheel marked with various dollar 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sajak, a onetime Army deejay in Vietnam, got his professional start in radio 
in Chicago and his first TV gig as a weatherman in Nashville. He said he looks 
forward to the day his 3-year-old son will walk past the star and think of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate this more than you can know," Sajak said. Government: 
Assemblywoman Wants Simpler Air-Quality Rules 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) has prepared legislation aimed at 
helping businesses overcome two problems that she says can complicate their 
dealings with air-quality agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem, Bowen says, is that businesses sometimes want to install 
new equipment that does not increase air pollution -- and may even reduce it -- 
but cannot do so because air-quality rules have not yet been developed for the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The second, she says, is that some companies are unable to comply with certain 
air-quality rules because the equipment they need for doing so has not been 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, Bowen's legislation would help businesses because it would 
allow agencies such as the South Coast Air Quality Management District to grant 
a single variance to all companies faced with these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, such businesses must apply for variances individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said that in one instance, a Southern California manufacturer developed 
a new way to clean paint spray guns that reduced air emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the manufacturer was granted a variance to make the product, any 
company that wanted to buy it and use it had to go before the (AQMD) hearing 
board to ask for a variance," she said. "That's crazy, not to mention 
time-consuming."

AN HIV WORKSHOP JUST FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seminar on how to live with HIV filled Pat Griffin with hope and 
determination,but it left her with one burning question: Where were all the 
women? 
</P>
<P>
 At next weekend's Los Angeles Shanti Foundation seminar at the T.H.E. Clinic 
in the Crenshaw district, things will be different. For the second time in a 
year, Griffin has helped organize a workshop geared toward women who are living 
with the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so much out of it, I started wondering why it couldn't be done for 
women only," Griffin, 41, said of a 1991 Shanti seminar that attracted few 
other women. "They had an hour presentation on women's issues, but that wasn't 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 After the seminar, Griffin approached Barbara Crofford, program manager of the 
nonprofit foundation, and began volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until October, however, that Griffin's mission was accomplished: The 
foundation sponsored its first weekend seminar for HIV-positive women and their 
care-givers, "Women for Positive Living," at the T.H.E. Clinic, 3860 W. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day workshops provide women with more than strategies to maintain good 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "People usually think in terms of medical intervention, but there's a lot 
more," said Crofford, who leads the workshop with Griffin. "This seminar is 
about the mind-body-immunology connection, and for women who may be struggling 
with self-esteem this is particularly important. We try to teach them how to 
have a higher quality of life overall." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 participants will hear discussions on the special needs of women: 
caring for children, practicing safe sex, asserting themselves with doctors and 
health care providers, and addressing gynecological problems. All of these can 
be difficult for women who are accustomed to being care-givers rather than 
caretakers and who often blame themselves for carrying and passing on the 
virus, Crofford said.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important fact participants learn at the seminar, Griffin 
said, is that they are not alone. "We provide a safe place for women to talk to 
other women, probably for the first time," she said. "We try to break the 
isolation, the stereotypes and stigmas attached to HIV and AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of creating a nurturing environment, the foundation offers 
participants free child care, meals and transportation. At the sessions' end, 
women are given flowers, beauty products, candles and other gifts that 
reinforce a feeling of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to be Pollyanna, but neither is HIV a death certificate," 
Crofford said. "Participants can look around and see that there are other women 
like themselves who are happy, satisfied, and saying: 'Yes, I am HIV positive.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, about one-fourth of the workshop volunteers, including Griffin, are 
HIV positive. T.H.E. Clinic itself houses the county's largest support program 
for HIV-positive women. Griffin said that women, who constitute the 
fastest-growing group of documented AIDS cases, can't find the workshop soon 
enough, particularly women of color.  
</P>
<P>
 "Black and Latina women make up only 19% of the population, but they're 
accounting for 72% of all female AIDS cases," she said. "Women are too often 
reluctant to do things for themselves. We have to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 295-5671. Women and AIDS From 1981 through 1993, Los 
Angeles County recorded 23,630 AIDS cases, with women composing 4.9% of them,

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA: PERFORMANCE DEPICTS POSTWAR BLACK LIFE

<P>
 For dancer and choreographer Pat Taylor, the upcoming performances of "Midtown 
Sunset" with jazzman Mark Shelby are a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taylor and her two partners opened the Dance Collective studio on Degnan 
Boulevard a year ago, she had envisioned joining forces with the musical talent 
that regularly jammed at the World Stage, a small but prolific jazz spot across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much artistic ability here, I knew right away I wanted to do 
something," Taylor said. "Now it's come to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of a $5,000 Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibits artists' projects 
grant, Taylor and Shelby, a bass player and leader of the Black/Note Jazz 
Quintet, were able to mount "Midtown Sunset." It is a concert piece based on 
and named for one of artist Romare Bearden's seven collages depicting slices of 
postwar black American life. The performances will be Friday and Feb. 20 at the 
Morgan-Wixson Theatre on Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had always been inspired by Bearden's work. "I try to capture the 
feeling of improvisation, the complexity and rhythms, coloring and phrasing of 
his work," she said. "I did a lot of research on Bearden and found out he was 
very much inspired by jazz. Illustrating his work with dance and jazz music 
made sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's six-member troupe, the Jazzantiqua Dance Ensemble, will perform 
"Midtown Sunset" accompanied by a quartet that Shelby formed expressly for the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first large-scale piece I've composed for dancers, and it's been 
a real challenge," said Shelby, 28. "But the whole spirit of the piece, the 
nature of the art, made it easy for me to do. It's been great having the total 
support of the dance company. And the fact that Pat and I do our work here 
really makes it part of the community too."

L.A. CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT LOS ANGELES CITY HALL 
DECISIONS AFFECTING THE WESTSIDE IN THE LAST WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * LICENSED CONTRACTORS: Approved a motion authorizing the Department of 
Building and Safety to publicize its little-known Certified Licensed Contractor 
Program. Under this program, electrical, plumbing, roofing and other 
contractors would be tested to certify their ability to do work that complies 
with city codes.The campaign will stress that licensed contractors certified 
under this program can provide quality work and save homeowners time and money 
because they know code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 * NOISE CONTROL: Approved a motion that would temporarily suspend the city's 
noise control ordinance within a one-mile radius of the Santa Monica Freeway so 
Caltrans can work around-the-clock if necessary to repair earthquake-damaged 
sections of the freeway. The goal is to finish reconstruction by the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 * HELIPORT: Approved a permit to allow the continued use of a heliport on the 
roof of the Hughes Aircraft corporate headquarters at 7200 Hughes Terrace. The 
nearest residential properties are located approximately 750 feet away. HOW 
THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * PARKING METER SLUGS: Approved an ordinance that would fine users of illegal 
tokens in parking meters the cost of repairing the meter if it was damaged. 
Costs to repair a meter range from $50 to $300. Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
argued against the original ordinance that called for mandatory jail time, not 
to exceed five days, saying it would exacerbate the problem of already 
overcrowded jails. Passed 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting yes: John Ferraro, Zev Yaroslavsky, Ruth Galanter, Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting no: Marvin Braude, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD: HELP FOR RUSSIAN EMIGRES WHO FIND THE U.S. 
TAXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They fled tyranny and now they've got taxes. But there's help yet for Soviet 
emigres bent on adjusting to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth year, accountants affiliated with the United Jewish Fund will 
help prepare tax forms for Russian immigrants who thought their old bureaucracy 
was confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 The free tax-preparation session begins 5 p.m. Tuesday at the Jewish 
Federation Council, 6505 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The session is aimed at a group for whom the concepts of deductions and 
earned-income credits -- or even filing a tax return at all -- can seem as 
foreign as baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a totally different system," said Tatyana Kodner, who arrived from St. 
Petersburg six years ago and works with new arrivals. "(In the former Soviet 
Union), you never file anything. . . . The government is just deducting (money) 
on a monthly basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after her arrival here, an accountant charged Kodner $35 to do her 
1987 return -- on only two months' income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was outrageous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax-help session is open to emigres from the former Soviet Union who have 
been in the United States for three years or fewer. Interpreters will be on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Emigres should call (213) 651-5999; volunteer accountants can sign up by 
calling (213) 852-7774. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA: SAINT JOHN'S RESUMES OUTPATIENT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saint John's Hospital and Health Care Center on Monday will reopen outpatient 
services damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Outpatient services in the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center and Saint 
John's Heart Institute will be available along with imaging, radiation oncology 
and nuclear medicine services in the south wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have said the badly damaged north wing will be razed and 
rebuilt. The south wing is expected to fully reopen by August and the undamaged 
west wing, where minor outpatient surgeries are performed, has been operating 
since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage forced the city's largest employer to lay off 1,750 of its 2,000 
employees. Administrators plan to meet today with workers to address the future 
of the hospital and possible rehiring.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PACIFIC PALISADES: PAR FOR THE COURSE: CHARITIES WIN AGAIN AT 
L.A. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 800 business professionals volunteered last week at the Nissan Los 
Angeles Open golf tournament, a 68-year-old event that last year raised 
$400,000 for more than 40 charitable and community service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce, the tournament at the 
Riviera Country Club is the oldest civic-sponsored Professional Golfers 
Assn.Tour event and the Junior Chamber's major annual fund-raiser. The Junior 
Chamber uses the proceeds for its community service projects, which include 
hosting an annual foster family picnic and helping coordinate the L.A. Watts 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. became the title sponsor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteering at the tournament provided Junior Chamber members with not only a 
chance to rub elbows with golf professionals and Hollywood celebrities, but 
also to help disadvantaged youths, said spokeswoman Susan Forte .

WINDING ITS WAY THROUGH TROUBLE; BALLONA CREEK HAS A STORIED PAST, BUT IT'S THE 
POLLUTED PRESENT THAT'S THE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We came across a grove of very large (trees), high and thick, from which 
flows a stream. The banks were grassy and covered with fragrant herbs and 
watercress. . . . We pitched camp near the water."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Explorer Juan Crespi, observing La Ballona Creek, near present-day La 
Cienega Boulevard, in 1769 
</P>
<P>
 From its underground "headwaters" in the Mid-City district to its mouth in the 
Pacific Ocean near Marina del Rey, Ballona Creek is the most disparaged body of 
water in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Transformed by public works projects spanning half a century, the 9.1-mile 
stream that Juan Crespi described in his journal meanders through residential 
neighborhoods, past grimy factories and beneath busy thoroughfares on its way 
to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike graceful canals in Amsterdam and San Antonio, the concrete-lined 
Ballona serves as a gargantuan gutter, draining 126 square miles of storm-water 
runoff between Downtown Los Angeles and the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In heavy rains, such as last week's, the creek pours up to 10 billion gallons 
of water a day into the ocean -- enough to fill the Forum in Inglewood 33 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 And the runoff, unfortunately, is not simply water. It's a toxic mix that 
includes oils from the vehicles we drive, household chemicals, yard waste, 
illegal and accidental spills from businesses and industrial plants -- indeed 
anything that lands in any of more than 100,000 street gutters or enters the 
315 miles of drainage channels that serve as the creek's tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the American Oceans Campaign found significant levels of at 
least 50 toxic chemicals consistently present in the creek, including several 
carcinogens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that may be the tip of the iceberg," said Robert Sulnick, the 
environmental group's executive director, who says further chemical testing of 
the creek's contents is desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, much of the creek's negative public image stems largely from a 
problem that may no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine times during the past seven years, partially treated sewage discharged 
into the creek by the city of Los Angeles led to much-publicized beach closures 
by county health officials. The largest of the spills -- 66 million gallons -- 
occurred on a single day in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, after a false start the year before, the city finally placed into 
service a new sewer line that is expected to render major spills a thing of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. Environmentalists say that even with the sewer problem 
apparently solved, Ballona Creek remains the largest source of pollution for 
Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as federal, state and local officials grapple with how best to combat 
storm-water pollution in what has rapidly become a new frontier in the effort 
to clean up rivers, lakes and urban waterways, Ballona Creek again figures 
prominently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creek is symptomatic of a national problem," said Mark Gold, staff 
biologist with Heal the Bay. The Santa Monica environmental group has made La 
Ballona a centerpiece in its call for more stringent water quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its environmental shortcomings, Ballona still holds an allure for 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Joggers and sweethearts stroll its banks at Culver City and Playa del Rey. 
Rowdy teen-agers claim its subterranean tributaries north of the Santa Monica 
Freeway as turf. 
</P>
<P>
 As unlikely as it may seem, there are even recreational users. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen cast from the Pacific Avenue Bridge at Playa del Rey despite 
warnings against eating anything caught there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fish look pretty good to me," Michael Smith, a regular at the bridge, 
said on a recent afternoon, showing off half a dozen smelt he had reeled in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not far upstream, where rowing teams from UCLA ply the murky waters for 
practice and competition, women's team coach Andrew Morrow appeared resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no other place we can go," he explained. "It's a long commute 
to Castaic Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before it became an urban drainage canal, the creek was a wild and scenic 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream that Crespi observed in the 1760s was fed by natural springs and 
emanated from las cienagas (Spanish for "the swamps") near where present-day La 
Cienega Boulevard skirts the Los Angeles-Culver City border. 
</P>
<P>
 A great flood in 1815 caused the Los Angeles River to change its course near 
Downtown and flow into the ocean by way of Ballona Creek. The river switched 
back to its current course, which empties near Long Beach, in 1825. 
</P>
<P>
 The swamps remained, however, and La Ballona continued to figure in the area's 
development in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Civil War, the Union Army placed 1,500 soldiers along its banks 
east of the present-day San Diego Freeway to keep Confederate sympathizers in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1886, a real estate developer with backing from the Santa Fe Railroad 
promoted a plan to develop the estuary at Playa del Rey as a major seaport. 
Nothing happened, and by the time the idea resurfaced during World War I, ports 
at San Pedro and Long Beach made the notion of a Port Ballona seem impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it were not for the creek, Culver City might never have become a center for 
motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1915, after Harry H. Culver began building houses near La Ballona, film 
pioneer Thomas Ince, while shooting an early Western, sent several canoes 
filled with actors dressed as Indians paddling up the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver, after witnessing the shoot, hit on an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered the filmmaker a prime piece of property to move his Inceville 
studio from north of Santa Monica to a spot on Washington Boulevard near the 
creek, becoming the first of three major studios in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, a veritable fantasyland of movie history sprang up on the 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer back lots near the creek -- a Moorish fort, a Western town, 
an Italian abbey and an African jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Atlanta burned in 'Gone with the Wind,' you could smell the ashes over 
La Ballona," said Carl Pitti, 77, of Hemet, who grew up in Culver City and 
spent 40 years as a stuntman at MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls that while dove hunting along the creek in the 1940s, in an area 
now dotted with factories, he came eye to eye with a tiger. The cat was on the 
other side of a tall fence where the studio kept animals for its Tarzan movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although earthen levees had been built to help tame the unpredictable Ballona 
near the estuary in the 1920s, the creek's transformation to storm drain didn't 
begin until 1935, when the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration approved 
massive dredging by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers began their channeling near the mouth, alongside property later 
bought by eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes as a site to build his Flying 
Boat, or Spruce Goose. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes is said to have picked the property partly because the creek could be 
used to float the huge aircraft out to sea. Instead, it was assembled piecemeal 
and trucked to Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the remainder of the creek began to be encased in concrete after World 
War II, and the once-natural streams flowing down out of the Hollywood Hills 
were converted to submerged storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, no one is more familiar with the creek and its tributaries than the 
workers who clean and maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing you see down there really surprises you," said Jim Canter, a county 
Public Works employee who has helped maintain the waterway for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He once discovered a wooden "dope den" complete with carpeting, a mile into 
one of the tunnels that feed the creek's upper reaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Canter and his colleagues found a car inside another of the tunnels. Thieves 
had used the passage as a hideaway to strip the vehicle for parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the tunnels become the scene of search and rescue efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a pet Labrador retriever belonging to Los Angeles Rams owner 
Georgia Frontiere disappeared into a Beverly Hills manhole and was lost for 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tracked him four miles nearly all the way to the creek," recalled 
maintenance worker Charlie Sherman, who found the pooch hungry but unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of La Ballona's human victims have been less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 John Parker, who works for a lumberyard beside the creek, recalls the time a 
man in a wheelchair committed suicide by throwing himself off a bridge into the 
creek's rain-swollen waters. "We were told they found his body floating in the 
ocean," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation workers, who have had to contend with rattlesnakes and rats, say 
they worry more about young hooligans who claim sections of the creek as 
personal territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mid-City district, where the channel is enclosed by vertical walls 20 
feet high, workers have been pelted with rocks and bottles so often that guards 
are posted before crews enter. Several workers narrowly escaped injury two 
years ago when some young toughs tried to hurl a sofa on top of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, meanwhile, warn of a farther-reaching threat -- the toxic 
pollution that the creek sends daily into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration drew praise when it announced earlier this month 
that it plans to extend the reach of the 1972 Clean Water Act, a move aimed in 
part at easing pollution in urban streams such as Ballona Creek. But skeptics 
note that legislation passed in 1987 promised a similar effort but has gone 
largely unenforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 law requires local governments to find ways to prevent pollution from 
entering storm drains. Critics say the agency charged with enforcing the 
measure locally, the state Regional Water Quality Control Board, has failed to 
do its job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regional boards have become absolutely toothless," said state Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who would like to see the panels reconstituted or 
abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Ghirelli, the regional water board's executive officer, dismisses 
criticism that his agency has become lax, insisting that it is doing its best 
with limited resources. "Our board feels we will get more bang for the buck 
working with people than hitting them over the head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the regional board has had only one qualified enforcement 
specialist devoted to storm-water pollution for the entire 4,500-square-mile 
area it serves in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, Ghirelli said. It is in the 
process of training five others. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is no less woeful with other governmental entities. Los Angeles 
County has two such specialists, and the city of Los Angeles, which depends 
largely on maintenance workers to help spot storm-water polluters, hopes to 
hire eight people later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practically speaking, there is virtually zero storm-water enforcement 
anywhere in the (Los Angeles) Basin," said Gold, the Heal the Bay biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that in La Ballona, it is hard enough to pin down where illegal 
pollution comes from, much less catch environmental bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint survey conducted by the city and county two years ago determined that 
there are 312 pipes and other openings ranging from four inches to six feet in 
diameter entering the aboveground portion of the creek. Officials say they have 
no idea where at least 40 of the conduits originate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to do a Hawaii Five-O, and say 'Book 'em Dano,' but it's not 
that simple," said Chuck Ellis, a spokesman for the Los Angeles storm-water 
management division. "Because we're strapped for resources, we're only now 
getting to the point where we hope to do some enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ballona watchers say some progress has been made to help clean up the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of environmentalists, governments within the Ballona watershed 
have agreed to stop dumping chlorine on sewage leaks entering storm drains 
whenever pipes burst, noting the chemical's harmful effect on marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 County storm-water managers recently set up an anti-dumping hot line, and last 
June installed a net across the creek at Culver Boulevard that has snared 15 
tons of debris that otherwise would have ended up in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They are small gains compared to the damage the creek's pollutants regularly 
visit upon Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ocean at the mouth of the creek, 500,000 cubic yards of 
lead-contaminated dirt and sand lay hidden barely beneath the waves, making it 
tricky for pleasure boats to negotiate the southern approach to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Army Corps of Engineers tried using huge dredges to flatten 
the nasty stuff along the bottom in a procedure known as a "knockdown," after 
the federal Environmental Protection Agency determined that the debris was too 
toxic to dump at sea. But the sediment has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 La Ballona is nothing if not relentless. On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 A truck driven by a Los Angeles storm-water management worker speeds down 
Ballona Creek near Overland Avenue. The creek, which drains 126 square miles of 
urban runoff between Downtown Los Angeles and the coast, is the biggest conduit 
of toxic pollutants into Santa Monica Bay.

 Ethel Schatz says she has a complex. She always feels she's the youngest 
person in the room -- no matter whom she's with. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz 78, seems thrilled with life, and that attitude has rubbed off on the 
students, 60 and older, who took her journal-writing class two years ago and 
continue to meet with her informally today. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Ruby. Her husband died a few months ago. She, like the others, has 
been keeping a journal, writing at home and reading the material in class. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could see in screaming, blinking lights was the word 'widow,' which, 
for me, meant my life was over," she said. "The people who I thought would be 
supportive reacted like I had a plague and I was busy making them feel 
comfortable. But the journal group, they came through for me, even when I said 
negative things about my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ethel Schatz's group everything is considered relevant, the good with the 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz, a former English teacher, started keeping her own journal in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of wonderful family stories, and when my grandchildren would 
crawl into bed with me, they would beg me to tell them the stories of when I 
was a bad girl," she said. "Who would tell these stories when I died? So I 
started writing them down. I didn't care how I wrote but what I wrote, and this 
is what I tell my students." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz's students originally met as part of a class sponsored by Santa 
Monica-based Senior Health and Peer Counseling. When the term was over no one 
wanted to leave, and the group has been meeting weekly ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, in the beginning, thought they couldn't write. I would say, 'If you can 
talk you can write. You don't learn to write, you write to learn,' " Schatz 
said. "Our goal is to change and grow, and writing the history of our times -- 
customs, social life -- is also about opening a window into yourself, which is 
the best gift you can give to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz's eyes light up when she talks about her students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there's Erica: "When she came in she read about a medical 
diagnosis of a disease she had and now it's as if she's not sick at all," 
Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia: "She's the oldest at 81. She couldn't express her feelings, only facts, 
and now she is able to express how she feels." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, Ruby: "She thought no one was interested in what she wrote 
about, and now, with her wit and talent exposed, she always shares her work." 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps the group together is trust. It's more than a journal writing 
group. It's a growth group. According to Dr. James Birren, associate director 
of the UCLA Center on Aging, you're never too old to grow or grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Birren originated autobiography as a technique for senior citizens to examine 
their inner life and at the same time leave a legacy for their families. 
Birren, the author of "Guiding Autobiography Groups for Older Adults: Exploring 
the Fabric of Life," said: "You don't know where you're going unless you know 
where you've been. Writing about the past frees you up to deal with the future 
and expand future relationships with other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Such benefits are what keep Schatz's group together. Said Schatz: "I think 
when we are on our deathbeds we're going to say we can't go because we haven't 
finished our journals."

HOT PROPERTY: HE LEFT HIS HEART IN N.Y. 
</P>

 Veteran crooner TONY BENNETT, who has found a new audience with the modern 
rock crowd, has sold his longtime Beverly Hills home, where his ex-wife, 
Sandra, had been living for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sold as part of their property settlement, the house had been owned by the 
couple since 1974. The couple, who separated in the 1980s, has two grown 
daughters. Bennett also has a son who is his personal manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Tony) comes out a lot to play engagements here, but he lives in mid-town 
Manhattan, and when he's not in New York, he's usually on the road," a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old singer, who does 200 concert dates a year, has been an 
entertainer for more than 45 years, but became an MTV and modern-rock 
radio-station favorite late last year with his 95th album of pop standards, a 
tribute to Fred Astaire called "Steppin' Out." The album earned Bennett, whom 
MTV considers "a living legend," a nomination at the Grammy Awards, to be held 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, who won a Grammy last year for his album "Perfectly Frank," honoring 
Frank Sinatra, was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences in December for his 1962 recording, "I Left My 
Heart in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 The house that he left in Beverly Hills was built in 1911 but was later 
remodeled. It has five bedrooms and maid's quarters plus a guest house in 
slightly more than 5,800 square feet. Bennett, who is also an artist, had an 
art studio in his Beverly Hills home during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally priced at $2.75 million, the home sold for just under the last 
asking price of $1.65 million, sources say. The buyers were described as a 
local family. 
</P>
<P>
 MaryAnn Musico of Prudential/Rodeo Realty, Beverly Hills, had co-listed the 
home with Gary Velis and Rory Barish, both of Stan Herman/Stephen Shapiro 
Associates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD MOLL -- who played Bull, the bald bailiff, in the long-running "Night 
Court" TV series and now appears as Boo, an auto mechanic, in the NBC sitcom 
"Getting By" -- and his wife, Susan, have put their Playa del Rey home up for 
lease in anticipation of completing a remodel of their Pacific Palisades home, 
which was built in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 The newlyweds, who have been married for nine months, bought the 
3,000-square-foot Palisades home last November for close to its asking price of 
$1.75 million, and they have been adding a second story, consisting of a master 
suite. They also plan to build a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Playa del Rey home, which was built in the 1980s and has three bedrooms 
in 3,000 square feet, is for lease at $3,000 a month through Brendan McCarthy 
of Jon Douglas Co.'s Brentwood office. The actor has lived in the Playa del Rey 
home for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer/keyboardist YANNI -- the Greek-born, New-Age music favorite also 
known for his good looks and for his long-term relationship with Linda Evans -- 
has decided to sell his Laurel Canyon home and move to Seattle to be with the 
actress, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanni has listed his three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot hideaway, with a 
state-of-the-art sound studio, at $385,000 with Tom and Leah Steuer at 
Prudential/Rodeo Realty, Beverly Hills. Yanni has owned the 32-year-old home 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Film producer CARLOS DE ABREU and his wife, JANICE PENNINGTON, a longtime 
hostess on the TV game show "The Price Is Right," have completed refurbishing 
the Holmby Hills home they bought in 1991 for $1.3 million. They spent an 
additional $250,000 restoring it, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennington was knocked off stage by a TV camera during a 1988 taping of "The 
Price is Right" and broke her right shoulder. She was awarded $1.3 million by a 
jury hearing her negligence suit against CBS in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She and De Abreu co-wrote the recently published book "Husband, Lover, Spy," 
and De Abreu is founder of the 3-year-old Christopher Columbus Society for 
Creative Arts, which helps bring new screenwriters to the attention of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino home of the late ROBERT P. STRUB, son of a founder of Santa 
Anita Racetrack, has been sold for $2.23 million, sources say. Strub was 
chairman of the board of the Santa Anita Operating Co. at the time of his death 
last May at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-bedroom, 6,500-square-foot home, on nearly two acres, was built in 
1914. An adjacent five-bedroom home on one acre, still owned by Strub's heirs, 
is listed at $895,000. John Tartaglione and Maggie Navarro with Jon Douglas 
Co., Pasadena, represented the sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese billionaire GENSIRO KAWAMOTO paid $42.5 million in cash five years 
ago for a 7,200-acre Honolulu estate that he is trying to give back to the 
seller, with no refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawamoto, who hadn't spent a day there in the past year, wanted to end his 
$1-million-a-year ground lease, but to do that, he was told he would have to 
cough up $26 million. That was too much for Kawamoto, who recently turned over 
his keys to the lessor, said Honolulu Advertiser reporter Greg Wiles.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY; STATE DISASTER LOANS OFFER LAST RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A small state housing program that has been tested in 16 disasters in the last 
five years is being revved up to help homeowners and apartment owners whose 
buildings were damaged by the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 The California Natural Disaster Assistance Program (CalDap) offers financing 
to repair or replace single-family homes or rental-housing units that have 
suffered damage from a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, CalDap has come to the rescue time and time again, 
aiding more than 1,000 homeowners and apartment-building owners with 
rehabilitation and home-improvement loans. The state has dished out nearly $200 
million following 16 different disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody always thinks that the government screws up with disasters," said 
Toni Symonds, principal consultant with the Assembly Housing Committee, which 
crafted the legislation creating CalDap after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 
1989. "But with so many disasters under our belt we are learning how to 
respond." 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program only comes into play when the governor has declared a state 
of emergency and can only be tapped as a source of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "After someone has gone everywhere else, owners can apply for funds (from 
CalDap)," said Michael Carroll, who heads up the program for the state 
Department of Housing and Community Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, homeowners tapping CalDap are usually in desperate need of 
assistance and are typically underinsured. "By the time a disaster victim 
reaches CalDap, he or she generally has little ability to make monthly 
payments," according to a legislative report on the program. Consequently, they 
can't qualify for a private rehab loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family homeowners can borrow up to $50,000 for repairs sustained from a 
disaster. Payments on the 30-year loan can be deferred for the entire term of 
the loan but must be repaid when the home is sold. The interest rate of 8.5% is 
lowered if the homeowner repays in less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, the homeowner must be residing on the property when the disaster 
hits and the loan must be secured by a deed of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Condos, townhomes, mobile homes and co-ops qualify, but vacation homes do not. 
And the money can also be used as "gap financing" by homeowners while they wait 
to receive federal disaster relief and insurance payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Before qualifying for a special state disaster loan, homeowners must show that 
they have tapped their homeowners insurance and have registered for emergency 
funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment owners can obtain loans up to $35,000 per unit at 8.5% interest, but 
they cannot defer payment. Only buildings with five or more units qualify, and 
the tenants must be permanent residents, not vacationers or short-term rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 If apartment owners agree to keep rents low in their buildings after they make 
the repairs, they receive a lower interest rate on the state loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has had to make adjustments to CalDap in the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, some communities were so aggressive about obtaining funds after 
disasters that there were some abuses, according to Symonds. She pointed to one 
community where owners tried to get loans through CalDap for new kitchen 
cabinets on homes where there were just slightly damaged walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, "we were getting dinged for housing repairs that were sort of 
ridiculous," said Symonds. Since that time, the Legislature has made 
adjustments to prevent abuse and to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
 CalDap can't be used to acquire property, and it can only make loans on those 
repairs that are necessary for the disaster victims to obtain city permission 
to occupy the home. 
</P>
<P>
 CalDap loan officers can be reached at (800) 552-5479 or by writing the state 
Department of Housing and Community Development at P.O. Box 952054, Sacramento, 
Calif. 94252.

CONDO Q & A: WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR QUAKE REPAIRS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I serve on the board of directors in a condominium association whose 
property was damaged in the Northridge earthquake. The association does not 
have earthquake insurance. There is damage to the common areas of the building 
as well as some interior damage in several of the condominium units. Is the 
association responsible for all repairs? What, if anything, would the unit 
owners be responsible for repairing? What about balconies that are designated 
as "exclusive use common area" in the association's legal documents? Can the 
association apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) or should the individual owners apply? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Your legal documents should be reviewed by the association's attorney 
to determine responsibility for specific repairs. If your association has not 
consulted an attorney in the past, I recommend that you contact an attorney who 
specializes in community association law. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney will refer to your association's condominium plan and the 
declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) to find out where 
the association's responsibility ends and the owners' responsibilities begin. 
In general, the association is responsible for repairing the structure of the 
building and all common areas. For instance, common area includes the common 
walls, the framing, studs and wallboard. The unit owner is responsible for the 
paint or wall covering or other improvements on the interior surface of the 
perimeters of the unit. Therefore, tiles that fell from the bathroom wall or a 
broken shower door in an individual unit would be the unit owner's 
responsibility to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding exclusive use common area, many associations have CC&Rs that state 
that the owner is responsible for maintaining areas such as garage spaces, 
entry doors and balconies. The state law clarifies maintenance responsibility 
if your documents are unclear regarding exclusive use common area. Many 
attorneys believe that the owner's responsibility to maintain in this context 
means keeping the area clean, and possibly even repainting as the need arises, 
but the owner's responsibility would not extend to major balcony repairs of a 
structural nature. The board of directors should rely on expert legal advice 
regarding the meaning of the documents and the California laws that apply in 
your situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The association can apply for FEMA assistance and then your association will 
be referred to the Small Business Administration for a loan application. Lisa 
Cookie, public information officer of the SBA, states that the individual 
owners also can apply for assistance in paying one lump-sum special assessment 
that the association's board or membership approves. The association or 
individual owners can apply for assistance prior to determining the specific 
amount of damage or the total cost of repairs. Subsequently, the loan can be 
declined if you find that it is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's board of directors can vote to use reserve funds for 
emergency repairs to the common area and other related expenses such as hiring 
structural engineers and other experts. The board should then replenish the 
reserves by approving an emergency or special assessment. Proper 30-day notice 
must be redistributed to all of the owners prior to the due date for the 
special or emergency assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The board can approve a special assessment that is less than or equal to 5% of 
the current year's total assessment. If the association's expenses exceed the 
5% ceiling, the board has two choices. They can either submit the special 
assessment to the owners for approval or they can approve an emergency 
assessment and distribute the necessary documentation to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake recovery expenses were an unforeseen expense at the time 
that the current fiscal year's budget was adopted, the board of directors has 
the authority to approve an unlimited emergency assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The board should consult an attorney to be certain that the association 
complies with all requirements of the legal documents and the California Civil 
Code, Section 1366. The individual owners can also apply to SBA for assistance 
to pay for repairs within their units. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, if you find that the assistance is not needed, you can decline it in 
the future. How Does Board Start Picking Up Pieces? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our condominium was damaged extensively by the earthquake. Although we have 
earthquake insurance coverage, the insurance deductible is a major expense that 
some of our owners will probably be unable to pay. Some unit owners have told 
the board of directors that they plan to abandon their units. It appears that 
the association may be unable to rebuild even with the insurance proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many complex issues that my fellow board members and I need some 
advice so that we can set some priorities. Where do we start? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For many association board members, aftershocks aren't the only cause of 
sleepless nights. As board members, in addition to your own personal losses and 
concerns, you must deal with the association matters too. You are undoubtedly 
getting numerous phone calls from anxious owners wanting to know what is being 
done. You should not be embarrassed to tell the other unit owners that you just 
don't have all of the answers yet. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend that the board schedule a special meeting of owners to let them 
know what is happening and what the board is doing. If possible, invite the 
association's attorney, insurance agent, manager and any other professional who 
can assist the board in answering the owners' questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Leonard Siegel, with the law firm of Wilner, Klein & Siegel in 
Beverly Hills, recommends that the board's first priority is to review the 
association's declaration (CC&Rs) concerning destruction and condemnation of 
the project. The law firm has prepared an excellent checklist for community 
association boards of directors that are dealing with post-earthquake issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The checklist states, "Most likely, the CC&Rs of your association will contain 
provisions that will require that the board take certain actions as a result of 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the CC&Rs of your association are unique, your board should review 
your CC&Rs for pertinent provisions with the assistance of the association's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, CC&Rs of a community association may contain provisions which 
require that the structures be rebuilt where damage is extensive, provided that 
insurance proceeds are sufficient to finance some percentage (often 85%) of the 
costs of rebuilding the project. Likewise, your CC&Rs may require that the 
board initiate the reconstruction pursuant to existing plans. However, if the 
board wishes to modify these plans, your CC&Rs may provide that reconstruction 
in accordance with modified plans requires approval of some percentage of the 
association's members and some percentage of the holders of the first trust 
deed ('senior lenders'). 
</P>
<P>
 "If the insurance funds are not sufficient to finance the stipulated 
percentage of the rebuilding costs, your CC&Rs may provide that rebuilding may 
only be initiated with the approval of members and senior lenders. Your CC&Rs 
also probably address how insurance proceeds must be distributed, to whom and 
on what basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the event your project will not be rebuilt, your CC&Rs probably authorize 
the partitioning of units, and require that certain notices be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, if the buildings of your project have been condemned, your CC&Rs 
should address how these condemnation proceeds are to be distributed, to whom 
and on what basis. You must review your CC&Rs to determine the rights and 
obligations of your board and your members." 
</P>
<P>
 I have added some of my comments and summarized Wilner, Klein & Siegel's 
checklist of steps that the board of directors should take: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Notify the homeowners about damage, liability and other issues as soon as 
reliable information can be obtained. Try to limit the information to 
statements of fact that can be substantiated. Be sure to disclose the 
statements or conditions that need further research or clarification and put a 
date on the material that is distributed. As the information is updated or 
revised, owners will be able to see from the date which information is most 
reliable. If the board has consulted with independent sources or professionals, 
inform the owners. For example, your notice could state, "The board of 
directors has been advised by the association's insurance agent that. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. Call FEMA at 
(800) 462-9029 or (800) 525-0321. They will mail to you the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) loan application. All loans are processed through the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Obtain a list of all senior lenders (first mortgagees) for all of the 
condominium units. Your insurance agent may be able to help with this. The 
association CC&Rs probably state that the senior lenders have the right to vote 
on any decision not to reconstruct and the senior lenders are entitled to their 
pro rata share of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Notify the lenders and the unit owners of any actions that may require 
their approval. Some lenders may have already filed an official request for 
notification of any occurrence that may affect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- If any units are uninhabitable, advise the owners to check their 
individual insurance policies to see if relocation expenses are covered. The 
owner should check with their insurance agent regarding the specific coverage 
and then keep records of reasonable expenses resulting from the relocation. I 
assume that most insurance companies will challenge a claim that includes 
five-star accommodations with caviar on the room service bills. Many hotels are 
offering discount rates to those who are displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners may have earthquake coverage under their individual condominium 
owners' insurance policies. One of the options available is "earthquake loss 
assessment coverage," which protects the unit owner when a special assessment 
is approved by the board or the association members. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- The board should retain a structural engineer as soon as possible to 
identify the extent of the damage and estimate the cost of repairs and the 
estimated time that repairs will require. The board should consult the 
association's attorney for referrals to engineers, architects and other 
professionals. Relying on the advice of these professionals will tend to reduce 
the board's liability. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Adopt a plan for funding the reconstruction. The board must decide how 
the insurance deductible will be paid and how to finance any repairs that are 
not covered by insurance. Consult the association's attorney regarding the 
procedures for special assessments and emergency assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- If the association is already a party to a loan agreement, consult the 
lender regarding deferred loan payments, an increase in the line of credit or 
any other special benefits that the lender might offer to the association. 
Advise owners to check with their mortgages about deferred loan payments or 
other special arrangements that will temporarily ease their financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Review vendor contracts and equipment leases if revision or termination 
seems advisable. Consult your attorney regarding any changes that are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Advise homeowners to contact the county assessor's office about a 
reassessment of the property taxes on their unit. 
</P>
<P>
 11 -- Inform homeowners about their responsibility for repairs to the interior 
of their units. Wilner, Klein & Siegel's advice is, "Under the CC&Rs of your 
association, homeowners may be responsible for the repair of damage to the 
interior of their units (including the interior surfaces of walls, ceilings and 
floors), as well as fixtures and personal property in the units, to the extent 
that these damages are not covered under the association's master insurance 
policy. Typically, this will be true if there is not major exterior damage to 
your project." After consulting an attorney, the board's written notice to the 
owners should cite the attorney's advice regarding the owners' 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 12 -- Consider hiring a construction engineer and/or architect before hiring a 
contractor. Most of the law firms that I have talked with advise associations 
to complete the repair work that the structural engineer has recommended. 
Damage must be inspected, reconstruction plans need to be designed and 
specifications need to be prepared so that contractors can submit competitive 
bids. A construction engineer or architect may be able to assist the board in 
reviewing the bids, inspecting the work of the contractor as it progresses and 
interfacing with the insurance carriers. The additional cost can be submitted 
as part of the insurance claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilner, Klein & Siegel advises the association board to "exercise the same 
care with this reconstruction as you would with any construction project your 
association undertakes. Many of our clients advise us that they are under great 
pressure to reconstruct their project as quickly as possible, even if this 
means neglecting to take the kind of precautions they would take under ordinary 
circumstances. These precautions include soliciting competitive bids, checking 
references, having your construction agreement reviewed by the association's 
attorney, and monitoring the work performed to ensure that no payments are made 
unless the work to date has been satisfactory and all lien releases have been 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although exercising this level of care may delay the date your project is 
reconstructed by several weeks or more, these precautions are essential. A year 
from now, if your project has been reconstructed properly, no homeowner will 
care that the board proceeded methodically. However, if in the upcoming year 
the workmanship is so poor that the board has to hire a substitute contractor 
to complete the job, and at great additional time and expense, no homeowner 
will forget and many may not forgive the board." Free Quake Seminar 
</P>
<P>
 A free seminar for homeowner association directors and members entitled "After 
the Quake: Rights, Responsibilities and Relief" will be presented from 10 a.m. 
to 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 26, at the Encino Community Center, 4935 Balboa Blvd., 
Encino, by the greater Los Angeles chapter of Community Assns. Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers will include representatives from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA), Small Business Administration (SBA), California 
disaster-recovery agencies and Michael Kennedy, from Sunrise Bank in San 
Francisco, who will share his experiences of community associations' recovery 
from the Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Goldsmith, an attorney with the law firm of Wilner, Klein & Siegel, will 
explain whether condominium associations or the individual owners are 
responsible for uninsured damage to homes. He will also talk about the 
associations' authority and owners' rights regarding reconstruction, special 
assessments, approval of bids and the decision not to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance agents Timothy Cline and Steve Segal will discuss what kinds of 
earthquake-related damages are covered under an association's fire-and-casualty 
policy without earthquake endorsements and the types of losses that are 
included and excluded under typical association and condo owners' earthquake 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster-recovery resource materials from several government agencies and the 
Red Cross will be available.

SPEAKING OUT: IS THE HOUSE YOU ARE BUYING QUAKE SAFE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMIR A. LAWRENCE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lawrence is structural section 
manager of the Ralph M. Parsons Co., a Pasadena-based international engineering 
and construction organization. He recently built his own home in Glendale. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake showed how important it is for your house to be 
solidly built. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you invest your life's savings in a home, you should review its 
structural soundness, making sure that it is able to withstand both sudden and 
gradual stresses placed upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 By conducting a visual inspection or discussing the construction of the house 
with your builder, you can help safeguard your huge financial and emotional 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the level of thoroughness you desire, you may use some or all of 
the suggestions that follow. 
</P>
<P>
 If your new house is under construction, you can conduct periodic inspections 
as it is being built. If you are buying a finished home, many of the 
suggestions can be done easily, but you will need to break off small pieces of 
plaster to inspect any hidden items in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, your house should be built like a crate box. A crate box 
endures being stuffed with goods, tossed around from site to site and carted 
thousands of miles, because it is designed to absorb the stress and pressure 
placed upon it. Your house should be designed likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin your inspection in the attic, by examining the underside of the roof. If 
it is sagging, you can expect water to get trapped and the roof will eventually 
leak and sometimes fall. The roof's underlay should be made of plywood or wood 
boards. Look around the attic to make sure that the roof's supporting 
framework, called "trusses" by home builders, is not damaged and is built in 
the shape of closed triangles. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a good look at the fasteners that hold the boards together. Only nails, 
bolts and wood-lag screws should generally be used, sometimes along with metal 
straps or clips. The nails should be long and large enough in diameter to hold 
the wood together. The frame of the walls should be 2-by-4s if the house is one 
or two stories and 2-by-6s if it is three stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
 When buying a home in California, the most important item to check, or to 
discuss with the builder in the construction of a new home, is that some of the 
walls have been built to withstand an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "shear walls" by builders, these walls are built to protect your house 
against the bidirectional stress of an earthquake. While seismic forces pull a 
house in one direction and then back in the other direction, these walls keep 
the house anchored to its foundation and distribute the stress of an earthquake 
evenly throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Shear walls must be well-fastened to the foundation and the roof or floors, 
and must not have any windows and doors. On the exterior of the house, shear 
walls are usually built with plywood. They should be secured to the foundation 
with hold-down clips and bolts at the ends of the walls, especially if the 
walls are short, and to the floors or roofs with nails. Nails should appear 
along the four sides of the shear wall's edges and across its center. 
</P>
<P>
 Plasterboard on interior and exterior shear walls should be nailed, not 
screwed. If the house is already finished, you will need to break some plaster 
to check for evidence of hold-down clips, bolts and proper nailing, because 
they are out of sight behind the wall's interior gypsum covering or exterior 
stucco and plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind that breaking plaster may not be desirable for everyone, but is 
an option for some after opening escrow. You can hire a plaster contractor for 
a nominal fee to fix the damage. The repair charge is small when viewed in the 
context of the cost of the Southern California home. 
</P>
<P>
 If the house is under construction, conduct your own visual inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 For older homes, especially ones built before World War II, you should make 
sure that the house has been anchored to its foundation. To confirm this, go to 
the sides of the house and look for a crawl space opening. Enter this crawl 
space and check for anchor bolts that connect the house walls to the concrete 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do not find any anchor bolting and still wish to buy the house, you 
should hire a local concrete-anchor-bolting company shortly after moving in to 
your new home. The company should install concrete-expansion anchors, if 
possible, because they will allow the bolting to handle the stress of an 
earthquake. Do not accept a sheet metal clip in lieu of an anchor bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the top of each story's frame for two rows of 2-by-4s or 2-by-6s, 
called "top plates" by home builders, placed one on top of the other in a 
staggered manner. To prevent pipes from interrupting the stresses in the 
frame's beams, a steel plate should be mounted on the side of the 2-by-4s or 
2-by-6s where the pipes are located. 
</P>
<P>
 The last item to inspect inside the house is the floor. It should be made of 
plywood or decking, but not pressboard. The floor's beams, or "joists" in 
building parlance, should be sufficient to support the length of the span.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside the house, check the foundation for excessive cracking. Look for 
uneven settlement of the foundation, especially if the house is built on clay 
soil. Another way to check for undesired settlement is to look above windows 
and doors for any bend in the beams and lintels and for any difficulty in 
opening and closing windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect soil conditions. It should be compact and firm. Also, look for a 
proper drainage system to divert rain away. 
</P>
<P>
 If the house is located on a hill, note the integrity of the retaining wall. 
Is it cracking or settling? If so, there could be a problem. Also, make certain 
there is a proper drainage system behind the retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
 You also should inspect the condition of stucco and plasterboard. Only minimal 
cracking is acceptable. Keep in mind when checking for cracks that a slanted 
single crack indicates settlement or shrinkage of the plaster, while a crack in 
the shape of an "X" indicates that an earthquake damaged the plaster and wall. 
If a wall has an X-shaped crack, the house's ability to withstand the next 
major seismic force is much less. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, scan or ask about the materials used in the house. The concrete should 
be high quality; again, cracks may indicate trouble. Douglas fir should be the 
wood of choice in California, when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Most California homes are structurally acceptable. But be on the look out for 
the ones that are cracking at the seams.

YOUR MORTGAGE; BE SPECIFIC ABOUT CONTINGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is a financing contingency? 
</P>
<P>
 Most people can't afford to pay all cash for a house. Therefore, most purchase 
contracts contain a financing contingency that makes the offer subject to the 
buyer obtaining a loan commitment from a lender. 
</P>
<P>
 For your protection, a financing contingency should be specific. It should 
include the amount of the loan you need; the interest rate you'll accept (in 
the case of an adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, it's the initial interest 
rate); the number of points (upfront loan fees) you're willing to pay; the term 
of the loan (usually 15 or 30 years), and the time period you'll need to obtain 
a commitment from a lender. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-day time period is reasonable unless the refinance or real estate market 
is particularly active. Check with your real estate or loan agent to make sure 
the time period you're proposing is adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets can change significantly during a 30-day time period. If 
rates were to skyrocket after you signed a purchase contract (unlikely in 
today's market) and you could no longer get a loan on the terms specified in 
your contract, you would have legal grounds to cancel the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Protect yourself, but be reasonable. Savvy sellers will object to a financing 
provision that's unreasonable. In periods of rising interest rates, expect that 
sellers will want you to agree to accept a slightly higher interest rate, if 
it's necessary, to obtain loan approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Most purchase agreements stipulate that you will act in good faith. What this 
means is that you will make a reasonable effort to get the loan you proposed in 
the contract. If you are repeatedly turned down for a loan after applying with 
several lenders, you can probably cancel the transaction and have your deposit 
returned. If, on the other hand, you make no effort to get a loan and you fail 
to complete the purchase, your deposit could be forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two parts to any home loan approval process. First, the buyers must 
prove they have the means to repay the loan. Second, the property must be 
appraised by an appraiser designated by the lender, or loan broker, to make 
sure the purchase price represents fair market value for the property. Make 
sure that the financing contingency states that both the buyer and the property 
must qualify for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time Tip: To avoid confusion, it's advisable to remove your loan 
contingency in writing. But before removing your loan contingency from the 
contract, make sure that you have an unconditional loan approval from the 
lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Many loan commitments are conditioned upon additional requirements, such as 
paying a charge card account down to a zero balance. If the lender's approval 
is conditioned upon something that's beyond your control, such as a review of 
the appraisal of the property, don't remove your contingency unconditionally. 
Find out how long it will take to satisfy additional lender requirements. Then 
remove your financing contingency conditioned upon satisfying the lender's 
extra requirements within the indicated time period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Buyers are often unsure at the time they make an offer of what 
kind of loan they want. If you make your offer contingent upon obtaining a 
fixed-rate loan, and then decide to take an ARM, you should have no problem 
making the change since ARMs are easier to qualify for. But let's say you 
specify an ARM in your financing contingency. Then you decide you want a fixed 
loan but you can't qualify for it. In this case you'll have to settle for an 
ARM to keep from violating the terms of your contract.

BOLD NEW LOOK, SAME OLD HOPE; NEW PERSHING SQUARE DECLARESS CONFIDENCE, BUT CAN 
DESIGN CHANGE L.A.'S SOCIAL HABITS?; CRITIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Whiteson writes on architecture for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is an intensely private city. Most social life here happens in the 
home, and, as a result, the city's residential architecture is far more 
innovative and hospitable than most of its public buildings or communal places. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to public parks and squares, Los Angeles is sadly underserved. 
In keeping with the privateness of our urban life, these spaces are scarce, 
tawdry and often dangerous. They seldom serve as real meeting places for the 
population of a fractured city. 
</P>
<P>
 This stark contrast between our private and public realms reveals our weakness 
as a community. If we cannot create a common ground where citizens of all 
classes and ethnicity will mingle freely, we will always live on the verge of 
social fragmentation. 
</P>
<P>
 These thoughts came to mind as I walked through the newly renovated Pershing 
Square, our oldest and most urban civic space. Redesigned and reconstructed at 
a cost of $14.7 million, the new Pershing Square embodies the hope that its 
reincarnation will counter the stubborn separateness of Anglo and Latino, the 
affluent and the poor, that plagues downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation has changed Pershing Square out of all recognition. In place of 
the familiar shabby, shadowy mini-park characterized by scuffed grass and 
stunted trees, we now have a bold, brave act of architecture open to the 
sunlight. Where the old square seemed apologetic and neglected, the new layout 
seems to declare its confidence in a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 But the central questions are: Can an act of architecture change a city's 
ingrained social habits? Can the bravest design overcome the mutual suspicions 
that seem to plague our ethnically diverse metropolis? Can we create a truly 
urban public place in an overwhelmingly suburban city? 
</P>
<P>
 The new Pershing Square, designed by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta 
in collaboration with Philadelphia-based landscape architect Laurie Olin and 
Los Angeles-based Langdon Wilson Architecture & Planning, is thoroughly urban 
in style. No attempt has been made to pretend that Pershing Square is a park. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous layout of the square, dating from 1952, covered an underground 
garage with a thin layer of landscaping. In the Legorreta-Olin plan hard 
surfaces dominate and planting is a formal background rather than a central 
motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored and partially financed by the Pershing Square Property Assn., an 
organization representing the landholders bordering the square led by developer 
Maguire Thomas Partners, the renovation divides the five-acre square in two. 
</P>
<P>
 The division between the two halves is marked by a 120-foot-tall purple shaft. 
The free-standing shaft, which mimics a traditional Italian campanile, has a 
dramatic cascade of water flowing down one sloping side. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern half of the square, bordering 5th Street, includes a raised 
section intended to double as an outdoor stage for public performances. Planted 
with stately Canary Island palms, this area is the square's highest point. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the raised section is an informal amphitheater of long, low concrete 
benches designed to accommodate an audience of up to 2,000 people. The benches 
are laid out in an abstract pattern in a carpet of grass. Beside the 
amphitheater area is a small, palm-filled courtyard where all the square's 
historic sculptures have been relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern half of Pershing Square revolves around a circular pebbled tidal 
pool fed by a high, narrow aqueduct that connects with the central tower. 
Several times an hour, surges of water flow from the aqueduct to fill the pool, 
then drain away. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern edge of the pool, parallel with 6th Street, is ringed by a curved 
concrete bench with a high back. The bench-back is inscribed with a quote from 
Carey McWilliams' book "Southern California Country." The quote ends with the 
offer of "a ringside seat at the circus" that is Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stucco pavilions, painted a vivid yellow, line the square's Olive Street 
frontage. One pavilion houses a Los Angeles Police Department substation. The 
other accommodates the access to the subterranean garage and an outdoor deli 
operated by the Biltmore Hotel across the street. The deli will be supplemented 
by six kiosks selling a variety of ethnic food. 
</P>
<P>
 The square's Hill Street frontage is screened by a line of short, pink columns 
and a tree-shaded promenade lined with planting. Familiar trees, including 
jacarandas, coral, cedar, orange and liquidambar, have been placed throughout 
the square.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the trees, what architects call "hardscape" predominates in this 
design. Most of the surface of the square is paved in beige concrete stamped 
with a linear pattern, alternated with sections floored with a grayish 
decomposed granite. Hard-wearing and rough, these surfaces are meant to take 
heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Six entrances -- one at each corner plus two others on Olive and Hill -- lead 
into the square. In that sense, access is more controlled than previously and 
entry into the square is made more of an event. Although entry is controlled, 
the edges of the square have been kept low so that the surrounding street 
facades appear to be invited into the open space. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two welcome improvements over the previous layout. First, the garage 
ramps leading to the underground garage have been reduced in width and are 
screened by planting. Second, the square is now completely ringed with walkable 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 An element of playfulness is attempted by the square's mandatory public art 
program. However, such gestures as the stylized "earthquake fault line" in 
charcoal quartzite and black terrazzo with gold accents by artist Barbara 
McCarren seem more silly than amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious concern is security. Given its recent checkered history, the 
issue of public safety is crucial to Pershing Square's success. To this 
purpose, the open layout, supplemented by strong lighting, provides clear sight 
lines for the police foot patrols and six full-time rangers from the Department 
of Recreation and Parks who will watch over the square. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the property owners' association hopes that only law-abiding citizens 
will frequent the place, and that the local gangs and the homeless transients 
who have claimed the square in the recent past will stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 This understandable concern for security has given the new Pershing Square a 
somewhat desolate look, especially when empty. Legorreta's trademark postmodern 
"Latinismo" architecture seems tense here, as if facing a hostile environment, 
and the center of the new square needs large crowds to make it friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, how could present-day Pershing Square be friendly? 
</P>
<P>
 Situated in what has become an uneasy no-man's-land between Latino Broadway 
and Anglo Grand Avenue, it is surrounded by a downtown still struggling to 
assert its identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pershing Square's recent history of decline is a symptom of that uncertain 
identity, and its reputation has taken a steep dive since the mid-1980s. Its 
last moment of glory was the extravaganza it hosted for the 1984 Olympics. 
Since then, the square has failed to fulfill the official hope that it would 
become a bridge between downtown's Anglo and Latino social orbits. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it bluntly, Anglo downtown has seemed to turn its back on Pershing 
Square in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biltmore Hotel undertook a renovation in which the building's main entry 
was relocated from Olive Street onto Grand Avenue. A block away from the 
square, the host of new skyscrapers surrounding the lavishly restored and 
expanded Central Library to the west has become a major urban focus. As a 
result, the square has been pushed to the edge of that part of downtown in 
which the Anglo business community feels at home. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's yet to be seen if the Bunker Hill office community will be seduced 
into adopting the new Pershing Square. If they return, they will have to be 
willing to rub shoulders with citizens they seem to prefer to keep at a 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't return, this expensive and ambitious act of architecture will 
fail to transform a habit of urban apartheid deeply entrenched in the soul of 
Los Angeles.

IN THE GARDEN: CLIMBING ROSES SOLVE THORNY SPACE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Free-lance writer Karen Dardick grows 
150 rose varieties in her Eagle Rock garden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Climbing roses, overlooked in recent years in favor of the more highly touted 
hybrid tea roses, are gaining popularity as home gardens shrink in size and 
vertical space becomes more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of old favorites and new creations, four white climbing rose 
varieties are especially noteworthy: Sally Holmes; Climbing Iceberg; Lace 
Cascade and Lady of the Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the interesting aspects of Southern California's long growing season is 
its affect on roses. Some varieties that in other parts of the country or the 
world behave as demur shrubs explode in size here and can be trained as 
climbing roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Holmes and Lady of the Dawn are two such roses. Sally Holmes, hybridized 
in England by amateur grower R. A. Holmes, who named his new creation after his 
wife, is a four- to five-foot shrub in most parts of the world. But here, it 
explodes into a very vigorous, 15- to 20-foot garden showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 I've grown Sally Holmes plants in my garden for the last three years and am 
astounded at both their beauty and endurance. Sally produces huge clusters of 
hydrangea-like blooms filled with single flowers of buff, pure white or white 
with pink tinge. In cooler weather, the flowers take on a definite pink hue. 
</P>
<P>
 But what makes this rose so remarkable is that it hangs on to those clusters 
for weeks on end. Last July, I noted clusters that stayed in flower for one 
full month, even when the temperatures exceeded 90 degrees. An added bonus is 
that Sally Holmes is very disease-resistant. The only drawback is there's 
little fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lady of the Dawn, developed in Holland and sold as a floribunda, produces 
arching canes of 8 to 10 feet that, when pegged or bent, will form white 
flowers tinged with pink along the length of the canes. This rose will yield 
three to four excellent bloom cycles throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When roses produce vertical canes, the bushes send hormones to the top (or 
terminal) buds and cause them to open," explained Tom Carruth, hybridizer for 
Weeks Roses in Upland. "But auxiliary buds exist along the cane's length. 
Bending the canes defeats the gravity hormonal flow and allows the auxiliary 
buds to flower." 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth cautioned that not all roses can be trained to do this -- they must 
produce long enough canes, at least five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace Cascade, introduced in 1993 in the United States by Jackson & Perkins, 
was developed by the late Bill Warriner for J&P specifically as a climbing 
rose. Keith Zary, the current J&P hybridizer, assisted in its development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outstanding rose," Zary said. "It repeats rapidly and so is rarely 
without flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also very disease-resistant, Lace Cascade has been honored at rose trials in 
France, Switzerland and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The other noteworthy white climber is Climbing Iceberg, a "sport" of the most 
highly regarded white rose, Iceberg, a floribunda. A sport is a spontaneous 
mutation of a plant to another form, and in this case, an Iceberg bush in 
England produced long canes that could be trained as climbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with a lot of rose sports is that the climbing varieties don't 
flower as well as the originals," Carruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Weeks Roses obtained budwood from several different sports of 
Iceberg, studied them carefully and propagated the most floriferous. Last year, 
only 10,000 Climbing Iceberg plants were developed. This year, Weeks produced 
12,000, and plans to increase production yearly to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unusual, Carruth said, for consumers to have such an outstanding 
selection of climbing roses. "There are more excellent white climbing roses 
than there have ever been," he said. "I wish the same were true for the other 
colors." Although white roses are not the top sellers, Carruth believes they 
deserve more prominence. "White is Mother Nature's electric light bulb," he 
said. "White flowers glow in the twilight of sunset." 
</P>
<P>
 With four top choices, how can you decide which to select? "It really depends 
on color preference and garden space," Carruth said. He selected Sally Holmes 
for his personal garden in Altadena. "She's a great rose and I love her keeping 
quality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zary also regards Sally Holmes as "a fantastic plant," he will plant 
Lace Cascade in his personal garden. "I'm a little prejudiced since I helped 
developed this rose." 
</P>
<P>
 Both experts offer a few suggestions for success with whatever variety is 
planted: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Plant in full sun and be sure to provide support for the canes that will 
form. Arch the canes so their tips point down to the ground. Zary said the 
canes of Lady of the Dawn will quickly become brittle so it's best to train 
them within a few months of their formation. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Be patient. Climbing roses spend their first year developing strong root 
systems and rarely flower. Expect to see some the second year, but full 
production begins in the third year. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Don't prune climbers for several years. Check with rose experts or rose 
books about pruning climbers since they require different pruning techniques 
than other types. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Fertilize and water the same as other roses. Fertilize once monthly in 
early spring, late spring and fall. Don't feed in summer's heat and after 
October. Water deeply once or twice weekly, more in hot or windy weather.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME SECURITY SYSTEMS NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 QUESTION: I am on a limited budget, but I want to install a security(burglar) 
system in my home. I leave lights on now, but that pushes up electric bills. 
What type of easy-to-install systems are available? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Although security systems use some electricity, they consume less than 
keeping lights on. You can install a basic do-it-yourself security system for 
about $100 to $200. As your budget allows, expand the system with more window 
and door sensors and automatic police, fire and emergency telephone dialers. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect only one door, like a back door, you can get inexpensive 
self-contained alarms. One loud alarm (about $40) is designed to fit a sliding 
glass patio door. Another is a small "electronic dog." If it senses vibration 
or noise at a door or window, its alarm sounds like a large barking dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unique system indicates, before you open the door to go in, if there 
was a break-in while you were away from home. This eliminates the possibility 
of surprising an armed burglar inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest-to-install security system, in an existing home, is a wireless 
remote design. You can install a complete system (window, door, motion sensors 
and automatic dialer) in a couple of hours. If you ever move, you can remove 
the sensors and take them to your new home. 
</P>
<P>
 A wireless system uses small 9-volt battery-operated sensors that transmit 
signals to the main control unit. This unit is often located in a closet and 
has battery backup in case of a power outage. The batteries last about one year 
or you can use rechargeable ones and save. 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage of wireless systems is the small hand-held remote control. You 
can take it outdoors with you. If you get hurt, see smoke in your house, etc., 
you can hit either an emergency, fire or police button to summon help 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound or motion sensors in several rooms and a stairway are effective. If you 
have pets, select a motion sensor with a "pet alley." The scanning path is 
limited to above the height of your pet, so it won't set off the alarm. 
</P>

manufacturers of home security systems and products, descriptions of each 
system and prices. Please include $2 handling fee -- cash or check. Send your

 * I can't recall reading as percipient an editorial about the financing of the 
cost of repairing damage to the state's transportation facilities in Los 
Angeles County as yours of Jan. 21 ("Necessary Evil: A Temporary Gas Tax"). Too 
many people who advocate the use of bonds to raise money for payment of such 
repairs disregard (and so does the unsuspecting public) the enormous interest 
expense of issuing bonds; for every $100 million of bonds, California taxpayers 
would pay an additional $70 million in interest over the lifetime of the bonds, 
and that money would emanate from the sorely beleaguered general fund of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1922, Californians have built highways with a user fee; it's called the 
gasoline tax and it's based upon the principle that those who use the 
facilities should pay for the facilities. It's less regressive than the totally 
regressive sales tax and it's fiscally as prudent a method as can be devised 
for repairing the earthquake-damaged highways in Los Angeles.

 * All federal aid related to the earthquake should be loans, to be paid back 
at market interest rates.The same goes for aid related to floods, hurricanes, 
brush fires, etc. It's completely predictable that, over a long period of time, 
all these disasters will happen. If people want to live in an earthquake or 
flood zone, that's fine, but the rest of the country shouldn't have to 
subsidize their choice.

 * Larraine Segil's call for government and business to focus time and 
attention on telecommuting (Commentary, Feb. 4) was right on target, but it 
left out one critical component of our work force: home-based businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine years of debate, the city of Los Angeles still doesn't have an 
ordinance allowing a person to obtain a business license to work out of his or 
her home.What's also troubling is a plan recently approved by a Los Angeles 
City Council committee. It allows city workers to operate from home with a 
phone, fax and computer, but someone with a home-based business doing identical 
tasks can't be licensed and is subject to prosecution if he or she is caught.  
</P>
<P>
 Over 350 of California's more than 450 cities and 42 of our 58 counties allow 
people to work at home under certain conditions. Because some 2,500 residents 
applying for such a permit are turned down by Los Angeles each year, the city 
is losing licensing revenue.

 * Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) deserves the fullest support of all 
Californians for his bill to remove limitations on taxpayer deductions for 
losses occurring in an area the President has declared as a disaster area (Feb. 
8). 
</P>
<P>
 At present the only bone Internal Revenue Code throws the devastated taxpayer 
is the option of taking the deduction in either the year of the disaster or the 
year preceding.Otherwise IRC restricts the deduction to the amount in excess of 
10% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income plus $100. Berman's bill removes 
these limitations under such circumstances as our recent quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the federal government can provide only very limited financial aid, 
Berman's bill is badly needed to relieve distress and get our economy moving 
again.

WHY JORDAN WILL BE NEXT TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Yossi Melman, Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist, is co-author of Friends 
in Deed: Inside the U.S.-Israeli Alliance, to be published in April by 
Hyperion.

<P>
 With Palestinian self-rule closer to becoming a reality after Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization signed a second agreement last week, the next 
Middle East breakthrough may well involve the Jewish state and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 King Hussein hopes to meet "before too long" with Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, and during a recent visit to Washington, the Jordanian monarch 
reportedly confided to a group of Jewish-American leaders, "I have met with all 
the Israeli prime ministers but Begin." His readiness to admit this "secret" is 
surprising, though it's one of the best-known "secrets" in the Middle East. 
Truth be told, Hussein has met with most of Israel's prime ministers. Even so, 
the king has logged more "Israeli hours" than any other Arab ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade following his ascension, in 1953, to the throne, Hussein 
assigned the task of conducting clandestine encounters with Israelis to his 
military advisers. Newly declassified State Department documents reveal that as 
early as September, 1957, Israel's intelligence operatives were relaying -- via 
the Central Intelligence Agency -- secret information to Jordan, warning of 
"internal movements" that sought to undermine the king's regime. Later on, the 
Mossad uncovered and then informed Amman of several plots against the king's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Hussein felt sufficiently self-confident to meet face-to-face with 
Israelis. His first meeting, held in London, was with Ya'acov Hertzog, a top 
aide of Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol. The central topic was the Jordan 
River. Two years later, he met with then-Foreign Minister Golda Meir in Paris, 
which produced a secret understanding on how to share the Jordan River's water. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeat in the 1967 War, Hussein continued to meet with his enemies, 
hoping to regain land lost in the fighting -- the West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
In a series of meetings in London with top Israeli ministers, Hussein agreed to 
sign a peace treaty in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied territories. The pact was never signed, because Israel refused to 
return all the conquered land. Still, the two sides reached several secret 
understandings on such topics as aviation safety and ecological threats in the 
Gulf of Agaba. 
</P>
<P>
 After Meir became prime minister, in February, 1969, the king accepted the 
Israeli explanation that because of her "poor health," the sites of future 
talks would have to be in Israel. Some of the locations were downright exotic. 
One meeting took place on an Israeli missile boat in the Gulf of Agaba, with 
Mossad agents posing as "waiters." Altogether, between 1969 and 1973, there 
were at least 10 secret meetings between Hussein and top Israeli officials, 
among them prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings produced some tangible results, especially in the areas of 
defense and intelligence. At the request of the Nixon Administration, in 1970, 
Israel deterred Syrian forces from carrying out their mission to help overthrow 
the Hashemite monarchy. The Syrians had invaded Jordan to assist PLO leader 
Yasser Arafat. Direct phone lines were established between Israeli and 
Jordanian army headquarters. Intelligence on Palestinian plots to unseat 
Hussein were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein reciprocated in September, 1973. During a meeting with Meir, he raised 
the possibility of an imminent Syrian-Egyptian attack on Israel. The Israeli 
prime minister ignored the tip. Two weeks later, Israeli defenses were 
unprepared when the invaders struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the king and Israeli leaders soon continued. During his three 
years in power, Rabin, Defense Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Yigal 
Alon met five times with the king and his advisers. But the political stalemate 
remained. Hussein repeated his position that he would not settle for anything 
less than the entire West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings came to an end in 1977, when Menachem Begin and his right-wing 
Likud came to power. Advocating the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West 
Bank, which he perceived as part of "Greater Israel," Begin found no room for 
any compromise with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The clandestine talks resumed in 1984, after Begin's sudden resignation and 
the formation of a Labor-Likud government. But during the seven "lean" years 
under Likud, Jordan had relinquished its responsibility over the West Bank to 
the PLO. Rabin and Peres continued to meet Hussein during most of the '80s, but 
there was no place for the king in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hussein -- the second longest-serving leader in the world, after 
Kim Il Sung of North Korea -- has risen, again and again, from the political 
ashes. The Israeli government and, to a lesser degree, the PLO realize that 
there is a place for Jordan in their future plans. Since Israel and the PLO 
signed their peace accord in September, Rabin and Peres have met at least twice 
with Hussein. Both sides still oppose an independent Palestinian state in their 
midst. For them, the ideal solution would be a confederation between the future 
Palestine entity and the Hashemite kingdom. Arafat has not ruled out this 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear. Once the agreements between Israel and the PLO are 
consolidated, Hussein will agree to end his more than 30 years of secret 
diplomacy and surface in a public meeting with Israeli leaders. Such a meeting 
will undoubtedly produce another peace treaty.

THE BOSNIA TRAP; SOLVING THE UNSOLVABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER RUSSELL MEAD, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). He is now working on a book about U.S. foreign policy for the 20th 
Century Fund. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is peace at hand in Bosnia? Is the Clinton Administration beginning to show 
some foreign-policy competence and sophistication? A week ago, both questions 
seemed ridiculous. The shelling of the Sarajevo market put the Bosnian war back 
on the international front-burner -- but peace seemed as far away as ever. And 
the Clinton Administration was still clueless, uttering threats against the 
Serbs it had no power to enforce, and offering the Bosnians hollow promises of 
support that only prolonged a hopeless struggle.  
</P>
<P>
 But late last week, the Administration signaled a change of course. With 
Russia trying to block air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
and with Boris N. Yeltsin refusing to take President Bill Clinton's phone calls 
for two days, the Administration seemed to understand just how bad its Bosnian 
options really were, and accepted that its entire Bosnian policy had been a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the threat of air strikes remains if the Serbs fail to remove the 
artillery around Sarajevo, there will be no more talk about bombing the Serbs 
to the negotiating table, no more huffing and puffing about European 
"appeasement" of Serbian aggression. The Administration has now agreed to back 
the European peace plan it once condemned; and some officials now support 
lifting economic sanctions against Serbs, who the Administration once compared 
to the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, two important facts finally sank in. Air strikes won't change the 
military balance in Bosnia, and the ethnic division of Bosnia is inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes were always popular with people who wanted to "do something" about 
the Yugoslav war but didn't want to commit U.S. ground troops. But the option 
was never realistic. Air strikes are a trap. What happens if we bomb and they 
still don't obey? What then: More threats? More air strikes? And if they still 
don't obey? What then -- ground troops, or a humiliating admission of failure?  
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the Administration has always understood it would be hopeless 
to intervene with U.S. ground troops. The Serbs are the best and most 
determined guerrilla fighters in Europe, and the Bosnian Serbs are tougher than 
their Yugoslav cousins. During World War II, the German Luftwaffe launched 
massive bomb attacks on Belgrade and the German Army marched into the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the signal for a furious campaign of national resistance. The Germans 
retaliated with brutal savagery, executing hundreds of innocent civilian 
hostages in retaliation for German soldiers shot by partisans. Serbs were 
slaughtered wholesale by Croatians allied with the Nazis. The Serbs -- like the 
Vietnamese and the Afghans -- fought on. By the end of the war, some of 
Germany's toughest and most cruel divisions were hopelessly tied down in a 
losing guerrilla war in Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
 Can we succeed where Adolf Hitler failed? Do we really want to try? The 
Administration always knew the answer to both questions was no -- but it 
couldn't bring itself to accept the inevitable consequences. If we aren't going 
to go to war against the Bosnian Serbs, then the Bosnian Muslims have lost the 
war, and they will have to take the best terms the Serbs can be persuaded to 
give them. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the bone in the Administration's throat: Accepting Serb demands for 
partitioning Bosnia meant accepting ethnic division of a multiethnic country, 
recognizing mass expulsions of Bosnian Muslims from their homes by the 
victorious Serbs. This, said the more idealistic and fuzzy-minded members of 
Clinton's foreign-policy team, was tantamount to accepting ethnic cleansing, 
something the United States can never do.  
</P>
<P>
 This misses a subtle but important difference. The forcible removal of 
populations involves the involuntary exile of people who belong to the "wrong" 
ethnic group. Ethnic cleansing is the combination of forcible removal with 
deliberate crimes and atrocities: massacres of civilians, systematic attempts 
to destroy rather than relocate a particular group of people. When people are 
ordered to leave their homes, this is forcible removal. There may be a threat 
to use force if people do not go peacefully, but this is far different from the 
murderous anarchy and pogroms where people are shot, brutalized and chased from 
their homes by armed gangs of thugs.  
</P>
<P>
 Let us be careful here. Recognizing that forcible relocation has created new 
facts on the ground does not mean condoning war crimes. Where civilians have 
been murdered and populations massacred as the result of interethnic conflict 
-- where ethnic cleansing has been practiced -- crimes have been committed. The 
question of how the world should treat war crimes in the former Yugoslavia will 
have to be decided when the shooting stops and a U.N. tribunal begins its work. 
This is a difficult question and the final answers are unlikely to satisfy 
anyone fully. But, for now, it is enough to draw a distinction between catching 
and punishing criminals and stopping a war.  
</P>
<P>
 Forcible removal isn't new. It isn't even always illegal. In 1945, the 
victorious allies met at the Potsdam Conference and ordered the forcible 
removal of the Sudetenland Germans: 3 million people, guilty of no crime except 
German ethnicity, were driven from their homes under appalling conditions. The 
United States and Britain approved this unjust and cruel act. Later, 12 million 
more Germans were driven from Poland -- some died as they struggled on foot 
through winter snows.  
</P>
<P>
 Forcible relocation was bad, but it solved some problems in Poland and 
Czechoslovakia. Demands of ethnic Germans in Sudetenland and the Polish 
Corridor helped destabilize those countries before World War II and increased 
German political support for Hitler. Those problems don't exist any more. 
Without relocations, there would now be millions of restless Germans in Poland 
and Czechoslovakia. They would be a majority in many parts of both countries, 
and many would be demanding reunion with the Fatherland.  
</P>
<P>
 The Balkans have a long history of relocations. The breakup of the Ottoman 
Empire left ethnic groups scattered and intermingled from Yugoslavia to Iraq. 
Repeated massacres -- of Armenians, of Turks, of Jews, of Greeks, of Albanians, 
of Serbs, of Gypsies and of Croats -- led to forcible relocations throughout 
the area. For the West today to act as if forcible relocation is a crime 
invented by the Serbs and without historical precedent is disingenuous and 
misleading. When people have grown to hate each other, and that hate has grown 
murderous, there is no point in forcing them to live side by side. Instead of 
basing policy on opposition to the principle of relocations, we should be 
working to alleviate the suffering of the victims and to help them build new 
lives in new homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Forcible relocation is like divorce: messy, expensive, bad for the children 
and never a good solution. But, sometimes, it is the least bad possible 
solution. It would be better if the peoples of the former Yugoslavia could live 
together in peace. But, obviously, they can't, and we will not get peace until 
boundaries correspond more closely than they do now with the distribution of 
the former Yugoslavia's peoples.  
</P>
<P>
 Now that the United States has swallowed this bitter pill, peace may not be as 
far away as it looks. For all the noise, the three sides in Bosnia -- Croats, 
Muslims and Serbs -- are not all that far from a settlement. The Serbs have won 
most of what they wanted on the battlefield, and are even willing to make a few 
small concessions to the Muslims. The Muslims, for their part, are fresh from a 
string of victories over the Croats, and the Croats are ready to settle. Peace 
hasn't broken out because the Muslims are hoping for a few more gains against 
the Croats and a slightly sweeter offer from the Serbs -- perhaps under 
pressure from the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the Clinton Administration, beneath the usual diplomatic double talk, is 
in the process of extinguishing the last Muslim hopes for victory and 
encouraging them to accept a political settlement based on the military facts 
on the ground. This will stop the killing, improve the conditions of life for 
Bosnians and allow the process of reconstruction to begin. It will also reduce 
the chances -- very real and very worrying -- that the Bosnian war will spread 
to engulf the entire Balkan peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslims have lost land in the war, but peace will be different. 
The Bosnian Muslims are a talented, entrepreneurial and well-educated people -- 
much more so than the Serbs. They may have lost the war, but they are likely to 
win the peace. This has happened before -- look at Germany and Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has finally accepted that the West can't help the 
Bosnians win the war. This doesn't mean we are helpless: We can and should help 
them build a peace. A generous program of reconstruction and development aid 
can give the survivors of this terrible, unjust war something that more 
bloodshed can't -- real hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And, speaking of hope, the new realism now animating the Clinton 
Administration offers hope to Americans as well. It may be that, at last, the 
Clinton Administration is shaking off its rosy illusions about the state of the 
world, and that the next three years will see more of the sophisticated 
foreign-policy thinking that offers the best hope for world peace and American 
security.

THE HEALTH-CARE ISSUE? WHY, IT'S AN 'EXIGENCY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregg Easterbrook, Gregg Easterbrook is a contributing editor to Newsweek 
and the Atlantic Monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so maybe health care isn't in crisis , ("a crucial or decisive point," 
"American Heritage Dictionary," third edition), as Hillary Rodham Clinton 
maintains -- for example, re cently telling a physicians' conven tion of "the 
unfair and in many ways cruel claim that there is no health-care crisis." 
Probably the year 1994 will not be "crucial or decisive" for health care 
regardless of what Congress decides, since the medical system is guaranteed to 
clank and wheeze forward in some form. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, health care is hardly just a problem ("a question to be 
considered, solved or answered"), as Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is insisting. How 
to choose your doctor is a problem. How to pay that doctor's bills is far more 
than a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's test-drive other words recently applied to the subject. Health care 
can't be an emergency ("a serious situation or occurrence that happens 
unexpectedly"), since its deficiencies have been apparent for some time; or a 
disaster ("an occurrence causing widespread destruction and distress"), since 
medical personnel solve rather than cause distress, at least usually, or a 
nightmare ("a dream arousing feelings of intense fear"), since health-care 
issues are annoyingly real. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, I nominate this compromise label: the "health-care exigency." Exigency 
means "the state or quality of requiring much effort or immediate action." 
Surely, Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives and even 
insurance-industry ad agencies can agree on that terminology. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can seriously contest that there exists a health-care exigency. Some 37 
million Americans have no medical insurance. Perhaps you don't care, since you 
do not number among the "medically indigent." To the man, those like Dole and 
the conservative Republican strategist William Kristol, who insist everything 
is hunky-dory in the U.S. health-care system, are not among the uninsured. 
Their health plans are generous and fully paid-up -- usually by somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 The central reason many GOP politicians and strategists have shifted ground 
recently, from touting their own health-reform packages to denying any 
substantive legislation is required, is their realization that virtually the 
entire GOP constituency -- the middle class and senior citizens -- has good 
health insurance, either through employer-provided plans or Medicare. The group 
with the keenly felt problem -- the 37 million uninsured -- is mainly a 
Democratic constituency. So screw 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the existence of a vast block of Americans lacking health insurance has 
two deleterious effects on society generally, harming even those securely 
insured. This makes the lack of universal insurance not only the key issue in 
the health-care exigency -- but an issue the majority of Americans ought to 
care about, if only for selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, by some estimates, the existence of the class of medical indigents 
increases net health-care spending. People who don't have any coverage -- who 
can't qualify for Medicaid because they are not under the poverty line, but 
whose jobs provide neither health benefits nor enough income to purchase 
insurance privately -- usually neglect to get routine preventive care. This 
causes health conditions that might be corrected at low cost in the early 
stages to advance to serious illness -- which is expensive to cure. Then 
middle-class taxpayers and insurance ratepayers get stuck with the bill for the 
expensive cure. 
</P>
<P>
 After the medically indigent become so ill they can't stand it, they go to 
hospital emergency rooms -- where, by federal law, anyone with an acute 
condition cannot be turned away. In emergency rooms, the medically indigent 
receive treatment far more expensive per visit than what they might have gotten 
in a doctor's office. That treatment is then paid for with state funds, charity 
or, most often, by the markup on the bills of private-pay patients. If an 
uninsured person needs an operation or other extended care, he or she gets it, 
too -- again at the expense either of the taxpayer or the private-pay patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of 37 million Americans without health insurance harms even the 
securely insured majority in another important way. Practically everyone in the 
"medically indigent" class is working poor: people who hold jobs, not 
freeloaders. (Full-time labor at the minimum wage, about $9,000 annually, puts 
you above the income line for Medicaid in most states.) Most of the working 
poor have families to support. These people are poised at the boundary line 
between productivity and dependence, between pulling their own weight, or 
falling backward to become wards of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fair to expect people in the working-poor category to be responsible for 
their own housing, food and education -- however difficult it may be. It's 
preposterous to expect families earning $9,000 a year (about $7,000 after 
taxes) to be able to spare about $3,300 for medical insurance (the national 
average). By denying health insurance to the working poor, society makes it 
more likely they will fall backward toward dependence, rather than advance 
toward productivity. And each new dependent member of society costs 
middle-class taxpayers far more than is at issue in universal health coverage 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the fractured-flickers system, by which the uninsured are denied low-cost 
preventive care, then once rushed to the emergency room have the most expensive 
treatments money can buy showered on them, no questions asked, pushes the 
working poor toward dependence. This is because the longer someone waits to 
have sickness treated, the lower the odds of a cure. Among the working poor are 
a significant proportion of people with disabling illnesses or degenerative 
conditions. Often the disabling part of the problem results from having waited, 
for financial reasons, till the rush-to-the-emergency-room moment is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, it's disquieting that opponents of the Clinton plan are now 
coalescing around a health-care exigency proposal offered by Democratic Rep. 
Jim Cooper of Tennessee. Cooper's plan has several appealing aspects that would 
solve most health-insurance anxieties of the middle and upper classes. Under 
the Cooper plan, no one could lose benefits for changing jobs; no one could be 
denied coverage for having a "pre-existing condition"; insurers could not 
discriminate against the self-employed who work at home as consultants; lots of 
new price and performance data about doctors and hospitals would have to be 
published, helping the sharp-minded negotiate for better care. All these 
aspects of the Cooper proposal are desirable reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But something essential is missing from the Cooper plan -- there's no 
universal coverage for the working poor. The middle class would be seen to. 
Society's dependent class would still be protected, via a successor to 
Medicaid. And, of course, the upper class could have whatever it wants. But the 
working poor -- those 37 million Americans for whom a major hospital bill is a 
greater trauma than the sickness itself -- would get next to nothing. They'd 
get "access" -- the legal right to buy a medical plan. And they'd get a 
somewhat vague, partial public subsidy for the price. But the bottom line is, 
under the Cooper plan, millions of Americans would still have no health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the worst outcome of the health-care exigency would be that the middle 
and upper classes get the medical reforms they need, such as portable insurance 
plans, while the working poor get shafted. After the concerns of the middle 
class are addressed, the majority of Americans will no longer believe there's a 
health-care crisis, problem, exigency -- or anything else. But the group most 
in need will remain in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, with support shifting to the Cooper plan, an outcome that serves 
only the middle class seems increasingly possible. Fixing what ails the 
majority on health care, while leaving the struggling to fend for themselves, 
would be a depressing outcome indeed.

LETTERS TO THE TIMES; ASSISTANCE FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "U.S. Officials Misjudged Magnitude of Disaster," Feb. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 While the article focused on the huge numbers of non-English-speaking people 
requesting assistance from the FEMA sites, I think the National Guard's role in 
servicing those individuals should not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within one week of the earthquake, as soon as the need was identified and the 
decision made, approximately 110 foreign language experts from the 223rd 
Military Intelligence Battalion (Linguist) were brought in from all over the 
state to provide translator support for the disaster assistance centers.These 
soldiers were desperately needed and greatly appreciated by both the victims of 
the quake and FEMA representatives at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the linguists involved in this recovery process have spent 
many years learning and perfecting not only their language of specialty, but 
also their direct communication skills. With these tools they were able to 
offer more than simple communication; they soothed frazzled nerves, offered 
comfort in the face of disaster and provided a feeling of calm control. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time a battalion of linguists has ever been called out to 
provide language support for a major disaster in any U.S. city.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, with downsizing such a large issue in the National Guard, the linguists' 
contribution in this disaster and the potential for an even greater 
contribution in future emergencies only serve to strengthen the California 
National Guard's position as an important and extremely necessary part of our 
state's emergency preparedness team.

OK, SO ALL POLITICIANS LIE -- BUT NORTH IS JUST TOO GOOD AT IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Oliver L. North is running for the U.S. Senate in Virginia, and his 
announcement has occasioned a fit of Washington apoplexy. Republican Sen. John 
Warner of Virginia says North is unfit for the job. TV journalists have 
essentially called North a liar to his face. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the critics have not managed to explain what bothers them so 
violently about North. Unless they do better, he will roll right over his 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to see the cause of the indignation. North, after all, not only 
said during the Iran-Contra hearings that he had lied to Congress, but he 
portrayed the legislative branch of the federal government as a body not worthy 
of being given the truth. Now he says he wants to sit there. His audience can 
be forgiven for smelling hypocritical opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the lying looks like a habit. Even before North's announcement, the 
Reader's Digest, in a piece by Rachel Flick Wildavsky, presented the evidence. 
North claimed he was close to President Ronald Reagan and told how he and 
Reagan had watched, on television, the homecoming of U.S. students evacuated 
from Grenada. But Reagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says Reagan never saw North 
that day. North also said he was close to the late CIA director William J. 
Casey, visiting Casey's home and attending his wake at Mrs. Casey's behest. But 
she says she never saw North at the house, and that he went to the wake on his 
own initiative, not hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Digest is known as a conservative publication, and most of the specific 
"lying" charges against North have been made by his ideological allies -- 
including retired Gen. John K. Singlaub and former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. 
True, many of North's enemies are liberals who cannot stand his politics -- but 
something about him makes even a lot of conservative skins crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, these accusations do not ring quite true. Political types who say they 
can't stand lying sound about as reasonable as a bunch of surgeons protesting 
they can't abide blood. Political people lie all the time, even -- or 
especially -- to Congress. Iran-Contra prosecutions in this area were difficult 
partly because the laws prohibiting such lies had almost never been applied to 
political testimony -- despite a history replete with omissions, misimpressions 
and falsehoods. More generally, no one has leveled with us about Travelgate or 
Whitewater. So why the sudden burst of sensitivity? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, I hesitated to write about this question, conflict-of-interest 
fervor being what it now is, because my husband represented another defendant 
in the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I remembered that even before Iran-Contra, I had my own, independently 
verifiable experience with then-Col. North. At the time, Congress was already 
suspicious of North's pro-Contra activities. The White House put out the 
convenient word that North was being fired from his job on the National 
Security Council staff because of his overzealousness on the Contras' behalf. 
North made himself available to presumptively friendly journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 I bit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone, North named a time and place. He said if I had to call him back, 
I should use only my first name. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first false note. This guy is calling from a place where people 
have stratospheric security clearances and access to all official phone logs. 
The minute I write a piece about him, everyone will know where it came from. 
And he wants to hold a first-names-only charade? 
</P>
<P>
 But we met on the appointed day in a dark cave of a restaurant down the street 
from the White House. North introduced himself and began talking. He was 
fascinating. He told about the U.S. politics of Contra aid and the Contras' 
internal political and military situation. Some of the material, I knew, was 
secret. I took furious notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an hour of this, another funny feeling hit me: Why is this man 
talking to me so trustingly, confidingly, sincerely, intensely? Why is he 
telling me so much? How does he know I will protect him just because I'm a pal 
of an ally of his? 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I called friends who knew North. I told them about the funny feeling 
and asked whether there wasn't something inappropriate -- too politically 
intimate -- in the way North had acted toward a near-stranger. They said it was 
all right; Ollie was straight. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote a piece contorted like a pretzel by its ambivalence, but, on balance, 
favorable to North. Soon after, the Iran-Contra scandal told me what a bill of 
goods I'd been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it's true that Hell hath no fury like a journalist taken for a ride -- but 
there is another lesson in this. The problem is not that North lies; the 
problem is that he seems so good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism of North's Iran-Contra history reinforces his current 
credibility: He clashed with a Congress perceived, often for good reason, as 
inconstant and pusillanimous. He, by contrast, stood for patriotism and keeping 
promises. They lost. He won. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also shored up his credibility by his post-Iran-Contra behavior. His 
critics say he has made lots of money, but he has also spent a lot of time 
practicing old-fashioned Virginia politics -- traveling to every corner of the 
state, making fund-raising appearances for other Republican candidates, eating 
bad food, building alliances. He has been paying conventional dues and honoring 
commitments, thus making it harder for his foes to persuade others that he must 
be disbelieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, more important is North's manner -- well-developed before the first klieg 
light ever hit him. The cute smile, the husky and touchingly hesitant voice and 
the sincere eyes never stop. When challenged, he doesn't falter. His response 
is never small-minded. Ugly charges do not distract him from his own rhetorical 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see that something is not quite right. Sometimes, the intensity does 
not match the topic. Every so often, you can detect the manipulative inner 
machinery at work. But then it disappears, leaving you with the certainty that 
inside that head something disciplined and fleet-footed is going on, not just 
the normal messy thought process that governs us more ordinary types. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to describe this bothersome quality. That is what makes North so 
good. You end up saying, "He lied on such-and-such occasion" or "His appeal to 
traditional values sounds like snake oil." Yet, many of your listeners will 
just scratch their heads and answer, "It's all right. Ollie's straight." 
</P>
<P>
 This skill of North's means he can go far in American politics. Seeing that 
fact makes us critics even more apoplectic. Some think they will fight his 
appeal by exposing his extreme policies, but they should not count on it: North 
will likely take respectable conservative positions and articulate the 
respectable conservative arguments for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The national press, in short, will probably not be able to knock North out. In 
the media-driven, moralistic politics that many of his critics helped create, 
he is a champion. The task of rendering final judgment on him will have to be 
left to the people of Virginia -- who, in the end, may do a better job of it 
than national opinion leaders have managed so far.

ENDING THE NUCLEAR THREAT: BUY YOUR ENEMIES' BOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gar Alperovitz, Gar Alperovitz, president of the National Center for 
Economic Alternatives and author of Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam 
(Simon & Shuster), is writing a book on the launching of the nuclear era. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Russia moves toward a fascist or semi-fascist state, signaled by the 
popularity of ultra-nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and the recent 
resignations of the country's top economic reformers, how can the United States 
immediately move to reduce the nuclear threat raised by this turn of events? 
</P>
<P>
 The starting point is to recognize what some of America's hardest-line defense 
intellectuals have begun to stress: In the post-Cold War era, U.S. security can 
only be achieved if there is a radical reduction of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Paul H. Nitze, one of the toughest Cold Warriors, recently contended 
in a piece that, "We might reasonably contemplate making nuclear weapons 
largely obsolete for the most practical and fundamental strategic missions." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara has stressed a related point: 
"It can be confidently predicted that the combination of human fallibility and 
nuclear arms will inevitably lead to nuclear destruction. Therefore, insofar as 
it is achievable, we should seek a return to a non-nuclear world." To 
MacNamara, a reasonable interim goal would leave "at most 100 to 200 warheads" 
in the hands of one nation or an international enforcement organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin put it this way in June, 1992: 
"There is no longer any need for the United States to have nuclear weapons as 
an equalizer against other powers. A world without nuclear weapons would not be 
disadvantageous to the United States. In fact, a world without nuclear weapons 
would be better. Nuclear weapons are still the big equalizer but now the U.S. 
is not the equalizer but the equalizee." 
</P>
<P>
 The primary danger, many specialists note, is not nuclear attack by some small 
nation using intercontinental ballistic missiles. It may be something as simple 
-- and as hard to detect -- as shipping a nuclear "device" into New York Harbor 
on a freighter, a task not much more difficult than driving a load of bombs 
into the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitze and McNamara are clearly not "peaceniks." They assert the cold logic of 
the situation: U.S. security would increase if we could move radically toward 
nuclear disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward this end, we should build on our current arms-control strategy. In our 
new agreement with Ukraine, we have promised the government more than $1 
billion in aid in exchange for giving up 1,684 nuclear weapons. Suppose we 
expanded on this principle: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the United States 
could save $261 billion over the next 15 years if the country reduced its 
long-range nuclear arsenal to 1,000 missiles, far more than is needed in the 
post-Cold War world. That translates to $17 billion a year that could not only 
be saved, but could also be used to form a kitty large enough to buy out the 
nuclear opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 This reduction in our nuclear arsenal combined with an expansion of current 
arms-control policy could provide enormous leverage: Far larger sums of money 
than are now being contemplated could be offered to Russia and Ukraine as 
incentives to radically reduce, or actually eliminate, their nuclear arsenals. 
Simultaneously, the prospect of a reduced U.S. threat would help ease Russia's 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are really interested in our security, $17 billion is no magic number. 
We are now paying $276 billion a year to maintain our defense. If it is true 
security we want, rather than knee-jerk funding of obsolete military programs, 
and if we could increase our security by buying out the nuclear opposition -- 
then we could up the ante and double the amount and still be well ahead of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little-noticed comment during the press conference announcing his 
decision to withdraw his nomination as secretary of defense, Adm. Bobby Ray 
Inman suggested the possibility of a annual $50-billion cut in the Pentagon's 
budget even without using the savings to reduce nuclear weapons elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a 10-year period, this would add up to $500 billion -- a hefty "wallet," 
as President George Bush used to say, if we wanted to get serious about buying 
out the nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookings defense expert, William W. Kaufmann, has gone farther. He estimates 
that U.S. post-Cold War defense needs could be satisfied even if the current 
Pentagon budget were cut by roughly 50%. By 1997, Kaufmann calculates, a 
restructured U.S. military could be spending no more than $135 billion (1993 
dollars) and still provide effective security (that is, able to counter attacks 
on allies in Europe, the Middle East, or on South Korea, with minimal American 
casualties). Under a more limited scenario, he estimates a savings of $152 
billion in the next three years, or nearly $584 billion in the next eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not know whether Russia's movement toward fascism can be halted. What 
counts is removing the beast's nuclear fangs. Nonetheless, paying significant 
sums of money to buy out Russia's nuclear capability might well be the way to 
give Russia the monetary support it needs to slow, even reverse, its move 
toward extremist politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, any serious attempt to achieve a major shift in the nuclear threat 
would require a global "build-down" process and would have to involve many 
other nations, especially China. It would require rehabilitation of the limping 
United Nations peacekeeping capacity. Powerful new inspection systems and other 
safeguards would be essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Any bold approach, of course, would also require major presidential leadership 
-- the kind Bush demonstrated, for other purposes, when he mobilized world 
opinion during the Gulf War. One thing is clear: Of the many things that have 
traditionally stood in the way of truly significant arms control, peacekeeping, 
and inspection efforts, lack of money need not stand in Clinton's way. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War over and the Soviet Union no more, the rationale for nuclear 
arsenals is fast disappearing before our eyes, as men like Nitze, MacNamara and 
Kaufmann are beginning to suggest. The trouble is that we are so used to 
thinking in narrow terms about small policy steps that it is a jolt to imagine 
the use of significant national-security funds to buy real national security.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; RICHARD RILEY; REBUILDING THE NATION'S PUBLIC 
EDUCATION SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elizabeth Shogren, Elizabeth Shogren covers federal social policy for The 
Times. She interviewed Richard W. Riley in the secretary's office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mid-1950s, while in the Navy, Richard W. Riley developed a degenerative 
bone disease that caused intense, chronic pain for many years and eventually 
curved his spine. Determined not to become dependent on pain relievers, he 
chose to endure the pain. Throughout his career as a lawyer, politician and 
education reformer, he has exhibited the same fortitude and tenacity that he 
has displayed in dealing with the disease, which now prevents him from turning 
his head or standing up straight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, as a state legislator in South Carolina, Riley fought an uphill 
battle for school desegregation. While many white parents put their children in 
private schools to avoid integration, Riley continued to send his children to 
public schools. Largely through his children's education, Riley learned how 
miserably the schools were failing South Carolina's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley was an underdog when he launched his second attempt for the 
governorship, but he came out on top after a campaign that stressed overhauling 
the schools -- which, at the time, spent less per pupil than all but one other 
state. His reforms, paid for by a special sales tax, are credited with helping 
South Carolina's students make the nation's biggest leap in SAT scores, 
increasing employment opportunities for graduates from vocational education and 
encouraging far more high-school graduates to go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as secretary of education, Riley, 61, is trying to do the same thing for 
the nation's schools. The linchpin of his strategy is legislation to create 
national scholastic and skills standards, called Goals 2000. Riley has shunned 
the bully pulpit -- where his predecessors waged their wars. Instead, he has 
used his persuasive powers in closed-door sessions with key members of 
Congress. In these moments, the secretary's dogged determination combines 
effectively with his genteel Southern courtliness. 
</P>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton and Riley are friends and were fellow warriors in the 
battle for better schools as governors, but the President has pretty much left 
him alone to fight for national education reform. This has made Riley's job of 
pushing the Administration's initiatives through Congress particularly 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley and his wife, Ann, known as "Tunky," have four children. Riley has 
passed his passion for public education on to his children -- his daughter, 
Anne, chose teaching public school as her profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the state of education?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's mixed and fragmented. In any school district, you find grand 
examples of schools that are working, and classes that are working, and kids 
engaged in education and parents involved. And, in the same region, you find 
some where that's not the case -- some where it's mediocre, and some where it's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You talk, in particular, about how public schools fail poor children. Why 
is that so and what should the government do to change that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Research shows that poor children have a more difficult time achieving in 
school -- that's a fact. It shows further that poor children in a poor school 
have a double difficulty in achieving. By the same token, poor children in a 
more wealthy school, surrounded by kids who are well-educated, and motivated in 
an educational way, do better. That's part of what the elementary and secondary 
act is about -- Chapter 1, which we call Title 1 -- and that's why we're paying 
special attention to that. That is, money -- $9 billion over the major act, and 
Chapter 1 is $6 or $7 billion. We are trying to target more of those enrichment 
funds in Chapter 1 to the poorest schools . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The high standards we are talking about are for all kids -- no more 
watered-down Chapter 1 curriculum, no more watered-down Chapter 1 assessment. 
Every kid will be expected to learn under Goals 2000. Every kid will then be 
given the responsibility to study and prepare. It will take several years for 
that to sink into the system, but that is going to be an enormous change for 
this country. When you go into kindergarten, every single child is expected to 
learn. You aren't out hunting for kids to pull out and put into slow groups, 
but you are expecting all kids to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Teachers often say they now have to play more of a parenting role, because 
children do not come to the classroom with the same preparation they had in 
previous generations. What is the role of parents and communities in education 
reform?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When I talk to teachers, it has been my observation that they don't talk to 
me about their pay or their long hours or the difficulty of their jobs. They 
talk to me about the fact that they can't get parents to help them with the 
education of their children. That is a real problem in American education . . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000 is the answer to that. It is a way that each school can develop 
their own systemic reform -- which means parents are involved in it. Each 
person can begin by working with their own children every night -- and take a 
special interest in what is happening in their school and what their teacher is 
telling them and develop respect for teachers and schools and learning. Every 
parent can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who are not parents, there are so many needs for mentors and tutors 
in the neighborhoods and the schools. I think it is tied to this whole idea of 
building community spirit back into this country -- something we've kind of 
lost. It used to keep the country great, because we had this community spirit. 
The school should be the center of the community spirit; and people involved in 
helping the young people grow and become leaders in the community. That's why I 
tell parents not just to get involved, but to spend time with their own 
children and spend time supporting the school. Do not get frustrated and stay 
away, but go into the school and participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It seems schools have to deal with more serious issues now than they did in 
the past -- life-and-death issues, like violence and AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 A: What I say to people is identify your needs, find out what your special 
problems are. If it is teen-age pregnancy, then you have a need to deal with 
it. Sit down with good people in your community and state and decide how you 
think is the best way to deal with it. Don't not deal with it. It's not my 
place to tell you how to deal with it. If it's a problem that affects children 
and their learning, then deal with the problem the way you think is best. I 
think it's important for me, as a national leader, to say: Don't turn your back 
on these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can the federal government help states and localities educate immigrant 
children -- legal and illegal ? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The law of this country is that all children are entitled to have an 
education, that's universal. That means we do not go into whether their parents 
have a green card or whatever other kind of card. If there are children who 
live in a region, under this country's laws, they are entitled to an education. 
</P>
<P>
 That works a special hardship on the education systems in many areas -- the 
L.A. region is a good example of that. When I was in L.A., I visited several 
schools where 40 or 50 languages were spoken. I recognize all that. We have 
bilingual programs and other ways to recognize certain support. Chapter 1 is a 
key way that helps especially disadvantaged kids who would come here as 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The recognition of foreign language being a competency -- that every child 
should be educated in two languages -- is another way we can help. It's good 
for kids who grew up speaking English as a first language to learn Spanish or 
French or German or whatever; and it's good for a kid who has Spanish to learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why has the Administration focused education on apprenticeships for 
high-school students who do not intend to go on to college?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If you stood back and looked at the American education system, I think you 
would have to say that those young people who are not studying for a four-year 
college program have been somewhat neglected. Our systems have been devised to 
provide a good education for those going on to a four-year education and to 
help the others get by. It has caused a disconnection of young people from the 
learning process and from our economy and society in general. In the high 
schools you see that problem begin to show up in graphic ways -- in violence 
issues, drug issues, truancy and drop-outs; 82% of those in prisons are 
high-school dropouts. A lot of that can be prevented if, from the very early 
years, we drive the education system with high standards for all students and 
make their academic standards important to them and have them connect that with 
success and jobs and a place in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you support public-school choice but not public vouchers for private 
schools?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't see any way that you can say a voucher -- paid with tax dollars to 
pull students and active parents out of the system -- can help the schools . . 
. . One is designed -- public-school choice -- to improve public schools for 
the children, and the other is designed for what would amount to destroying the 
public schools for the purpose of getting them so bad that you have to start 
over. I don't think that makes good sense, and it would be very damaging to 
schools and to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the role of public education changed in America?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It has changed dramatically. I was asked the other day, what is the problem 
with public education -- in a philosophical way. My answer was that the needs 
and requirements in education itself have changed in the world and we are 
having to change the education system, the schools and the process to make the 
changes that are already out there. 
</P>
<P>
 We are in a world-competitive economy. We are in a global society. It used to 
be, in terms of literacy, if you could sign your name, you were perceived to be 
literate. Now that's not enough. The person who can't read and write well is 
not going to get a meaningful job in this country today. You could do that in 
the agricultural era and under the industrial era. There was a place for manual 
labor and domestic labor. But that is relatively nonexistent today. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have dramatically changed and we have to do more in those school years 
in terms of education . . . . In this era, all kids are going to have to be 
productive; and to be productive, they're going to have to be well-educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics also make it more important -- because we have more older people, 
more people going into retirement, percentage-wise. So, it is more important 
for all kids to learn and be well-educated. We have never in this country 
needed young people who can do things, and who know things, like we do now. So 
it becomes more important to take kids with a learning disability or with a 
disability and say, "We expect more of you. We are going to give you more 
opportunities to learn but we are expecting you to learn and produce and 
participate in our great economy." 
</P>
<P>
 We can't spare anyone. I don't care if they're an immigrant who has just come 
here and can't speak the language, or a kid who has a learning disability or a 
brilliant person who is hanging out and is not interested in studying. All kids 
are going to have to get into this world of knowledge and education and become 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is going to happen. Goals 2000 is the first step for it to happen, 
and it is going to energize all states and all schools. Then you're going to 
see a patriotism develop -- if you want to serve this country's future, the way 
to do it is to become well-educated. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are charter schools and contracts with private companies to run public 
schools good options for preparing young people for the demands of the next 
century?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The trend in several places of contracting for management services or 
operating schools is an option, but it should be accompanied with a criteria, 
and that criteria is hard to reach. And that criteria are more resources in the 
classroom instead of fewer.  
</P>
<P>
 If you can contract with the private sector and have more resources in the 
classroom, and have high academic standards prevail, and be the driving force 
and have flexibility and accountability -- then it makes sense in some cases. 
But that's going to be awfully hard to come by if you start talking about a 
large profit being taken . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You must be careful with all these options. You are dealing with children's 
lives and the future of the country. There is no easy magic bullet. The magic 
bullet is teaching and learning.

DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE A FUTURE AFTER ITS DELUGE OF DISASTERS?; POLITICAL 
FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After temblors, wildfires, riots, mudslides and economic recession, what is 
the future of the state? The Times asked seven California writers and 
historians. Gerald W. Haslam, Professor of American studies, California State 
University, Sonoma.  
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that might not have a future is the California Dream, which 
never was real to begin with. Expectation always preceded reality in 
California. The quest for el dorado was rooted in an unreal expectation. When 
Americans came with the Gold Rush, they saw abundance; there was no reason to 
say that anything could be denied. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, we Californians have to begin living within the means of the 
land, to start having a sustainable culture. Fernando J. Guerra, Professor of 
political science, Loyola Marymount University The future of California rests 
with leaders who are willing to be innovative, not only in government but in 
industry, religious institutions and universities. California will be judged 
not only by the wealth it creates, but by how it treats its youngest, its 
oldest, its poorest. Jeff Lustig, Professor of government, former director of 
the Center for California Studies, California State University, Sacramento 
We've got to apply California's "notorious" reputation for innovation to 
political forms. We have to decentralize politics inside the state, make it 
possible -- and necessary -- for citizens to participate in public affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Our current constitution was adopted when the state had 800,000 people. The 
very ways we go about being public prevent us from implementing the public 
interest. Patricia Nelson Limerick, Professor of history, University of 
Colorado, Boulder The future of California is to move to Colorado and to other 
western states. The combination of discomfort from the economy and earthquakes 
and fires and ethnic tensions are making people pick up and move. This is the 
pattern in American history. People pick a western location, thinking it will 
cure their problems. A lot of people moved to California to escape reckoning on 
limits on their freedom. Newcomers thought they could build their houses in a 
freer sort of way, only to discover that they had built in fire zones or places 
where there are earthquakes. James D. Houston, Author of "Californians: 
Searching for the Golden State" California is going to be profoundly affected 
by its rate of population growth. The state has been growing by more than 1,000 
people a day for more than 50 years, and it has finally caught up with us. 
Every system in the state -- water, roads, housing, education -- is overloaded. 
The upside of the Northridge earthquake is if it manages somehow to discourage 
people from coming to California. 
</P>
<P>
 The birthrate and immigration are hard things to talk about, because you have 
racial charges being thrown back and forth. You can't fault people for having 
kids, but there's got to be greater control of immigration and some education 
on birth control. Gloria Lothrop, Professor, history at California Polytechnic 
University, Pomona. I see a very hopeful future, economically, with increased 
trade. Activity in the Wilmington-Long Beach Harbor will increase with the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. On the down side, as I listen to debates 
regarding family values, crime and violence, I sense a growing conservatism and 
wonder whether California will lose its position as the bellwether of trends. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the idea of state division not as remote as some people would. With an 
increasingly youthful population and increasing demand upon social services -- 
which will lead to less (resources) for higher education, infrastructure, arts 
and recreation -- I wonder if there won't be a call for state division, with 
the idea that parts of the state that are not as affected by these demographic 
patterns may not want to be burdened with the cost and responsibilities. Robert 
V. Hine, Professor of history emeritus, University of California, Riverside and 
Irvine campuses. California has always been a state of boom and bust throughout 
its history. We have always been able to pull out of difficult periods, and I 
don't see why we can't pull out again.

A DEMOGRAPHIC LESSON; WARNINGS ABOUT STATE POPULATION EXPLOSION MISS THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California has learned the lesson that demographics is as imperfect a science 
as economics. As recently as 1991, unbridled growth seemed as much a part of 
the landscape here as fan palms and bougainvillea. That year one leading 
demographer, Leon F. Bouvier, projected a nearly doubled state population of 50 
million by 2011 and an alarmed Gov. Pete Wilson, proclaiming that "rapid growth 
will continue," launched a now forgotten project to manage this growth. All the 
world, it seemed, wanted to come to sunny, booming California. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state report shows how wrong all of this was. It documents that 
recession has slowed the state's population growth dramatically, to only 1.4% 
last year, about half the rate during the last decade. A dozen years ago, at 
the height of the Texas oil boom, some predicted that Houston would be the 
world's largest city by the turn of the century. That will not be, nor, surely, 
will California's population double in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be something of a blow to state pride, not to mention real estate 
developers. But it represents an opportunity, a pause, to realize that 
perception often lags reality. Even as Gov. Wilson was mounting his 
growth-management study, growth was slowing; even as politicians of left and 
right today crusade against illegal immigration, the evidence is that the pace 
is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is worth asking whether these trends will help solve some of our problems. 
Will we really need so many costly schools, toll roads, airports and rail 
lines? To be sure, the public infrastructure is badly in need of repair. And 
the overall population trend masks some troubling undercurrents in a state that 
is experiencing a net loss of better-paid, middle-class households to other 
states even as growth from foreign immigration and births continues. That 
raises the question of whether we will have a long-term tax base that can pay 
for even reduced expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The population slowdown offers us an opportunity to ponder the fact that 
demographic forces are powerful in shaping our lives, and are often as 
unpredictable as the natural ones that have shaken us of late.

LETTERS TO THE TIMES; REGINALD DENNY'S SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Having read "Suit by Denny, 3 Riot Victims, Cleared by Judge" (Feb. 1), I 
can no longer keep silent. After seeing a man on television walking the 
riot-ravaged streets of South-Central pushing a baby carriage looking for food 
for his child, I took $100 worth of baby formula to a food-gathering center 
located at a car dealership on Crenshaw Boulevard. My friend and I stayed for 
several hours helping to pass out food. My belief in the possible goodness of 
people was renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, hearing about Reginald Denny's skyrocketing medical bills, I 
sent $100 to him. Being self-employed, I do not have the best medical insurance 
and felt that in such a tragedy I too might be dependent on the kindness of 
others.  
</P>
<P>
 Quite awhile after the check had cleared I read an article in The Times about 
how Denny was doing extraordinarily well in his recovery and had purchased a 
truck, not for his business but for his personal use. My heart sank. My first 
response was if he had received enough money to cover his medical bills and was 
truly the remarkable person reports were making him out to be, how could he not 
have donated the extra money he'd received to other victims of the riots? I 
didn't understand. Almost immediately I felt extreme guilt. This man had been 
through such an ordeal, who was I to judge his behavior? I let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 Then as the trials of his attackers were televised, I watched Denny hug the 
mother of one his most aggressive attackers and defend that attacker and others 
as victims while he himself had a case pending against the taxpayers of Los 
Angeles. All compassion left me and I wanted my money back. From now on my 
money goes only to organizations such as the Red Cross, or in this case 
directly to the medical facility.

 * The "go slow" approach toward the Alameda Corridor which Jerry Epstein wrote 
about in your paper ("A Yellow Light on Alameda Corridor Deal," Commentary, 
Feb. 3) shows exactly why the most critical transportation project in 
California is still on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the state Transportation Commission, Epstein criticized the 
path which negotiators followed on the price and terms for the corridor.He 
argued that Southern Pacific got too much money and that California should have 
just seized the Alameda Corridor under eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Land seizure would only have resulted in a terribly expensive legal battle 
which would stall the Alameda Corridor for years and leave California's 
taxpayers footing the bill for a case that would certainly end up in the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for everyone to stop kicking dirt at the Southern Pacific 
railway or second-guessing the bargaining tactics of Long Beach or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We must put aside our differences to make this project happen. If only our 
state Transportation Commission would declare that the Alameda Corridor should 
be the No. 1 priority for Caltrans, then California would have a much easier 
time getting federal money to help put the Alameda Corridor on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The time we waste hemming and hawing in hindsight over a deal that has already 
been swung just adds more cargo trucks to our freeways and bigger clouds of 
diesel smoke to our air.

 * As one who walks for exercise, I am fearful of being run down by bicyclists, 
roller-skaters and skateboarders who suddenly and soundlessly appear from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of common sense and etiquette I was taught years ago when learning to 
ski would prevent accidents. The person about to overtake another should yell 
the warning, "Passing on your right," or, "Passing on your left." 
</P>
<P>
 Although bicyclists are not supposed to be riding on the sidewalk, they 
frequently do.

 * Epstein's commentary was misguided and fraught with contradictions. On the 
one hand, he correctly lauds the Alameda Corridor as "an important catalyst to 
our economic revival." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he condemns the purchase price and the lack of committed 
funds for the project. The project has passed many hurdles and has many to go 
before completion. The right-of-way negotiations have been tough and 
protracted, savings the ports tens of millions off the original asking price. I 
am amazed that Epstein honestly asserts that the whole $1.8 billion should be 
committed before purchasing the corridor right of way. This onerous and 
unrealistic recommendation would put the whole project in a Catch-22 situation 
as no public money can be spent and little appropriated before a right of way 
is secured.  
</P>
<P>
 Stimulating California's languid economy is not a task for the faint of heart. 
As chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Alameda Corridor Project, I 
can assure you that there is broad support for this project regardless of 
economic and natural disasters. We will get people back to work.

 L.A. County Sheriff Sherman Block comments on the response by law enforcement 
and the public to the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 From a law-enforcement perspective, we were fortunate that the magnitude of 
the earthquake was not greater.The response system at the county level worked 
very well but was taxed to the limits. The loss of financial resources the last 
few years would have made it impossible to be as effective had the devastation 
been more widespread. County and city governments must steel themselves for a 
future drain on revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The public was far less prepared than law-enforcement agencies to deal with 
the emergency -- not having at the ready such simple necessities as water, 
food, flashlights and battery radios. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. County Office of Emergency Management has made available through many 
public facilities an earthquake survival program with at least a dozen 
pamphlets on preparedness in both English and Spanish. (For information, call 
(213) 974-1166.) 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson to be learned before the Big One is stark, but real: People must be 
prepared to provide for themselves for several days following an earthquake, 
until official agencies can deal effectively with their needs.

COLUMN LEFT / DANIEL SCHORR: THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT; SOMETIMES 
MISSTATEMENTS ARE MORE THAN MERE GAFFES.

 "The President misspoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said it in a hushed tone as though committing some form of 
blasphemy, and immediately added that he should probably not be saying this, 
and that it was on very deep background. 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying to explain how it was that on Nov. 7, President Clinton had 
said, "North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb," whereas now 
the Administration was pursuing a compromise that might "grandfather" any bomb 
that North Korea already had. What the President had meant to say, my source 
volunteered, was that North Korea would not be allowed to become "a nuclear 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President misspoke" is a tricky way out of an apparent contradiction, 
because the credibility of government rests on the tacit assumption that the 
President can say no wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Vice presidents can misspeak, and that can be amusing, as when Dan Quayle, 
trying to quote the motto of the United Negro College Fund, said, "What a waste 
it is to lose one's mind." Or when Al Gore, delivering a foreign-policy speech 
in Milwaukee, said that America's ethnic melting pot shows that America is " E 
pluribus unum -- out of one many." (It's the other way around, of course.) 
</P>
<P>
 But with the President, the acknowledgment of "misspeaking" suggests that 
either he cannot talk straight or that he doesn't understand his 
Administration's policies.  
</P>
<P>
 Once in 1953, President Eisenhower made a remark so egregiously out of line 
with known policy that James (Scotty) Reston of the New York Times, leaving the 
news conference with me, suggested that the only way out for Press Secretary 
James Hagerty was to say that "President Eisenhower does not necessarily speak 
for this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents sometimes do misspeak: The words that come out of their mouths are 
not the words they intended to utter. (Let's leave Freud out of this, shall 
we?) President Bush was particularly prone to verbal accidents. Attacking Gov. 
Michael Dukakis on the Pledge of Allegiance during the 1988 campaign, Bush 
himself misquoted it, saying, "One nation under God with freedom and justice 
for all." (Spokeswoman Sheila Tate said he was "paraphrasing.") Bush also said, 
"I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism."  
</P>
<P>
 President Reagan clearly misspoke in 1986 when, at a rally for a Republican 
Senate candidate in Nevada, he said Democratic voters had found "they can no 
longer follow the leadership of the Republican Party, which has taken them down 
a course that leads to disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 But, more often in the case of Reagan, "misspeaking" appeared to be a matter 
of confusion about facts and policies. In August, 1984, he said that 
submarine-launched missiles were "less destabilizing" than land-based missiles 
because "they could be called back." (They can't be.) Earlier the same year, 
Reagan said, contrary to stated Administration policy, that Lebanon involved 
American "vital interests." ("Less than precise," explained an anonymous 
official.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking as a historic misstatement was the Reagan proposal to Mikhail 
Gorbachev at the Reykjavik summit in 1986 for total elimination of nuclear 
weapons. (Just an "ultimate goal," explained spokesman Larry Speakes, reluctant 
to say that the President not only misspoke, but also misperceived the nuclear 
stalemate.) 
</P>
<P>
 When ousted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos complained of having been 
betrayed by being flown to Guam on an American plane after being promised he 
would be transported to a place elsewhere in the Philippines, Reagan blandly 
countered, "I think maybe he was misinformed. It happens to every president." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first year of the whiz-kid Clinton Administration, there has been 
relatively little need to drag out the dread word "misspoke." More common is 
being "misunderstood" or "misinterpreted," as when Strobe Talbott, after the 
Russian election in December, said there would be "less shock and more 
therapy," suggesting an easing of pressure on economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But something more was involved when Clinton introduced the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, as one whose "family fled in 
a cattle car westward (from Poland) to Germany in front of the Soviet advance." 
In fact, the general's father had been a major in the Nazi Waffen SS, enjoying 
a privileged life in Warsaw. ("Irrelevant," said press secretary Dee Dee Myers, 
declining to say the President misspoke from a misleading biography.) 
</P>
<P>
 So when we are told "the President misspoke," we are not sure if it was a 
twisted tongue, a twisted fact or a changed policy. But however it happens, it 
can sometimes put a serious misspoke in the President's wheels.

SAVE $25 MILLION WITH NO PROGRAM CUTS; L.A. COUNTY: WHERE'S THIS MAGIC MONEY 
HIDDEN? IN A PENSION PROGRAM THAT COUNTS BENEFITS AS BASE PAY. FIX IT NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLORIA MOLINA, Gloria Molina is a Los Angeles County Supervisor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely, you'd think, Los Angeles County Supervisors would jump at the chance 
to save upward of $25 million a year, without cutting any vital public 
programs. On Tuesday, we'll have that chance. But because it involves county 
employee pensions, it's been a hard sell so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is pension reform -- or, more precisely, ending the county's 
ill-conceived practice of "pension spiking." It is an obscure, complex, 
technical and often difficult issue to understand -- but too important to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will $25 million a year be saved if the reforms are adopted, but a 
wrong will be righted. By all standards, pension spiking is unethical. But 
because of a series of complicated political maneuvers and questionable legal 
opinions, Los Angeles County, since 1991, has been doing it -- adding the cost 
of an employee's benefit package to his or her base salary for the purposes of 
determining the amount of future pension pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: If a county manager earns $50,000, he or she might have 
an annual benefits package of $7,000 (with which to buy medical, dental, life 
insurance, etc., under the county's "cafeteria" style benefits plans). Even if 
the employee spends all of the $7,000 on benefits, and takes none of it as 
cash, that money is still considered "pensionable." Thus, for pension purposes, 
the employee's salary is not $50,000, but $57,000. That is called "spiking." 
Each time the cost of benefits rises, so too does the cost to our pension 
system. And to each of us -- the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this unusual? You bet! For the most part, L.A. County is unique in this 
practice. When it was applied to all employees, the county's unfunded pension 
liability jumped up by $400 million, requiring higher county payments into the 
fund. That costliness is why most public and private entities do not allow 
spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? The county's former chief administrative officer, now 
receiving a lucrative county pension, ordered it three years ago, before he 
retired. No cost studies were ever done. The Board of Supervisors never 
publicly debated its fiscal impact; nor did the county Board of Retirement, 
which runs the pension system and must approve all changes. It was done behind 
closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Who benefits most? Since the county rewards its employees with a large 
percentage of their salary for benefits, the highest paid get more. In fact, 
the problem was much worse when transportation allowances and deferred merit 
pay were also used to spike the pensions of the county's elite -- a trick 
foiled by the intensity of public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 How do we fix the problem? The Board of Supervisors asked our Economy and 
Efficiency Commission to study the issue and bring back a series of 
recommendations. Now, an expertly crafted plan of action is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly, the commission's recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * For future employees, eliminate "spiking" simply by excluding benefit costs 
from pension calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 * For current employees, diminish the impact of pension spiking by freezing or 
reducing the dollar amount of benefits taken in cash or equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
 * For all employees, fund the cost of health-care increases outside the 
current benefits package so they won't be pensionable. 
</P>
<P>
 * To prevent any more such abuses, require public votes and financial impact 
studies for all future changes to the pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support strengthening of the new state law that addresses the problem of 
pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 This quiet, complicated little scandal is costing us roughly $300,000 every 
week that we do nothing. We must put this public-policy embarrassment behind us 
by voting, without a minute's more delay, for the most aggressive version of 
the reforms being presented. It's not exactly making lemonade out of a lemon, 
but it's close.

BANKING ON CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's almost nothing a banker hates more than being saddled with a 
foreclosed house -- having to get the lawn mowed, the windows washed, the 
property sold. It's even worse if the house is seriously damaged, as so many 
were in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, some homeowners have eyed cracked foundations and walls and 
decided that walking away is the smart move, because their mortgages are 
greater than the depressed worth of their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agencies are now turning to this and other long-term recovery 
problems. Officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the 
Small Business Administration were in town last week, working with Mayor 
Richard Riordan and local, state and federal officials to streamline loan 
procedures, snip red tape and encourage so-called "character loans" that lie 
outside traditional lending guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is also looking to the private sector for solutions. Enter the 
nation's largest savings and loan, Irwindale-based Home Savings of America, 
which is offering some of its own mortgage holders without equity in their 
homes a smorgasbord of assistance, including about 200 repair loans on which no 
payments are required until the homes are sold. At that time an owner will 
split any profit 50-50 with Home Savings, up to the loan amount. Yes, it's a 
gamble for the S&L, but it is likely to stave off larger losses. It's also an 
admirable bet on Southern California's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is to keep people in their homes," says Home Savings Chairman Charles 
R. Rinehart. "This is good for the stability of the community and ultimately 
good for us."

PERSPECTIVE ON SLAVERY; ACKNOWLEDGING A TERRIBLE SACRIFICE; IN A NATION THAT 
COMMEMORATES DEFINING ASPECTS OF ITS HISTORY, WHY HAVE THE PEOPLE IT SUBJUGATED 
BEEN LEFT OUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. ALLEN COUNTER, Dr. S. Allen Counter is a neuroscience professor at 
Harvard University and director of the Harvard Foundation, an intercultural 
institute. His latest book is North Pole Legacy (U. of Massachusetts Press, 
1991). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When slavery was abolished in 1865, our nation's leaders made a feeble gesture 
of recompense by promising each freed slave 40 acres of land and one mule to 
work it. The government never kept that promise or provided any other formal 
economic aid to former slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic advantages that this land derived during three centuries of free 
agricultural and industrial labor from millions of enslaved human beings are 
incalculable. At the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, more than 10 
million disenfranchised black Americans were turned out of slavery -- 
disoriented, stripped of their African identity, and by then so mixed with 
American Indian and European bloods as to be literally a new "native American." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most telling evidence of the American denial of slavery is the 
conspicuous absence of a national memorial to the millions of enslaved African 
Americans who lived and died in bondage up to and beyond the signing of the 
Emancipation Proclamation. In a nation that commemorates defining aspects of 
its history with memorials, none has been raised to the helotry of a 
historically subjugated people whose ancestors were forcibly brought from 
Africa to the Americas, who were forcibly held in slave labor to build the 
early foundations of this country and who died by the millions en route to or 
on these shores. Many Americans of all races find it unconscionable that we 
have never established a national memorial for black American slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 But what symbol best drills the essence of the African American slave 
experience? Some European Americans have suggested that the Lincoln Memorial is 
the unofficial American slavery memorial. However, while Abraham Lincoln's 
opposition to slavery was pivotal, the Lincoln Memorial honors the insightful 
President who kept our nation united as it grudgingly evolved from a slave 
economy to an industrialized and more civilized nation. Some African Americans 
have suggested that an African tribal symbol or family statue be placed at some 
official site in Washington, D.C. But which tribal nation or symbol? Black 
Americans come from numerous African peoples, ranging from Gambia to Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony from Africans and African Americans of the diaspora, from Canada to 
Argentina, suggests that the most enduring image of the trauma of slavery is 
the voyage to the Americas. All enslaved Africans shipped to the Americas 
shared this most terrifying aspect of the slave experience. While the 
overwhelming majority of American ancestors of all races arrived by ship, only 
one group arrived chained to the planks. This fact alone makes the origins of 
the African American unique. 
</P>
<P>
 For the enslaved Africans, the voyage of this "middle passage" was like a 
journey through Dante's Inferno -- a one-way trip to a realm as utterly alien 
as it was unimaginably horrid. One day, they were living as free villagers in a 
land they had inhabited for thousands of years; the next, they were in chains 
and being forced into the hold of a strange vessel, never to return to their 
families. On board, they experienced what can only be described as hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary accounts by European ship captains and other officials inspire 
horror and revulsion. "They were literally piled one on top of another and the 
unsteady motion of the ship, combined with foul air and great heat made the 
place simply horrible," writes one captain. "The floor of the hold was so 
covered with blood and mucus which proceeded from them in consequence of the 
flux, that it resembled a slaughter house. . . . Sometimes a dead and living 
Negro (were) fastened by their irons together . . . (T)he living Negro was 
disengaged and the dead one thrown overboard . . . It is not in the power of 
the human imagination to picture a situation more dreadful or disgusting." 
Nothing better symbolizes American slavery than the lower decks of the slave 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for the leaders of this nation to erect an American Slavery 
Memorial on the Mall in our nation's capital. It should be a memorial of 
commanding proportions, presence and dignity that will remind all Americans -- 
especially African Americans -- of our nation's commitment to racial justice, 
fairness and equality. Fair-minded citizens throughout the land would support 
the erection of such a memorial as an enduring symbol of national appreciation 
for the contributions of the millions of African American slaves and their 
progeny to the United States. Throughout the Americas, descendants of slaves 
could point to this tangible symbol with the satisfaction of knowing that a 
great nation has finally and eloquently acknowledged a great and terrible 
sacrifice.

IS METROLINK MORE THAN AN INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST DISASTER?

 Los Angeles' quake-created window of opportunity for public transportation is 
closing fast. The Northridge temblor induced a short-term spurt of ridership -- 
especially on Metrolink, the region's commuter rail system -- and fueled 
long-term expectations of packed transit vehicles. But a month after the quake, 
Metrolink's Santa Clarita ridership is dropping fast, and Caltrans has 
announced plans to reopen Interstate 5 through the Newhall Pass six months 
ahead of schedule. Despite all the rhetoric and high hopes, we are not 
rethinking L.A.'s transportation system. We are rebuilding it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, this is a shame. The one thing all transportation experts seemed to 
agree on was that the earthquake presented a golden opportunity to re-examine 
how transportation works in the metropolis and how it might be improved. But 
the rebuild-it-quick sentiment reflects a subtle, underlying reality: There's 
been little consensus on what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail advocates say the quake reveals the importance of a rail-transit system. 
Highway advocates contend it shows how critical the freeways are and suggest 
that money should be diverted from the struggling rail system to rebuild 
auto-oriented infrastructure. Vice President Al Gore will probably tout the 
quake as another reason to invest in the telecommunications superhighway. The 
truth is the quake should remind us that all these components must play an 
important role in our regional transportation system, and if we ignore any one 
of them, we do so at our peril. 
</P>
<P>
 No one questions the importance of auto travel in Southern California. No one 
can ignore the emerging power of telecommunications. But the quake has tested 
our long-term commitment to a rail-transit system -- especially Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiated in 1992, Metrolink was, at best, a modest pre-quake success, 
carrying 10,000 daily riders from distant suburbs to Union Station and Burbank. 
Though this constitutes a tiny fraction of the region's transit commuters (more 
than 1 million travel by bus in central Los Angeles), Metrolink is a 
transportation priority, one of the most heavily subsidized services in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the quake, it became a vital connection, especially between Los 
Angeles and its northern suburbs. With the I-5/Highway 14 interchange knocked 
out, auto commuters traveling south into the San Fernando Valley had few 
options. The Santa Clarita line became a lifeline. Ridership rose from 1,000 to 
more than 20,000 a day. But as soon as Caltrans opened alternate car routes, 
commuters on the line dropped to fewer than 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is surprising to transportation experts. Indeed, it parallels 
almost exactly the Bay Area's experience after the Loma Prieta quake in 
October, 1989. Like the Northridge temblor, Loma Prieta knocked out several key 
transportation arteries -- especially the Oakland Bay Bridge. And like 
Metrolink, BART provided an alternative along a similar route for car-bound 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, BART ridership rose 50% between September and November, 1989 -- from 
219,000 to 314,000 riders a day. When the Bay Bridge reopened, ridership slid 
sharply, bottoming out at about 250,000 riders a day. That's still an increase 
of 30,000 riders -- a 16% permanent increase -- almost overnight, which is 
nothing to sneeze at. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not the whole story. According to researchers at UC Berkeley's 
University Transportation Center, BART ridership was rising 5% a year before 
Loma Prieta, meaning a 16% increase would have come in approximately three 
years, anyway. Furthermore, since 1990, BART ridership has been absolutely 
flat, at 250,000. The Berkeley researchers theorize that the new, permanent 
BART riders would probably have switched to transit in any case; Loma Prieta 
simply captured them a little early. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink will also probably sop up some latent demand and a little more. The 
permanent ridership hike will probably run higher than 16% (that would only 
amount to 1,600 new riders), simply because -- compared with BART -- the 
service is still so new. But in numerical terms, any increase would be a drop 
in the bucket -- especially when compared with the 1 million-plus riders on the 
MTA's bus lines and millions more in cars on the freeways. There's certainly a 
definable upper limit to rail-transit ridership, especially in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if the earthquake taught us anything about transportation in Los Angeles, 
it reinforced the idea that a transportation system has to provide many 
alternatives instead of being dependent on one mode of travel. In the short 
run, there's no question that Metrolink proved its value as an insurance policy 
against natural disasters. The Valley and its surrounding suburbs have to be 
less disrupted -- in terms of mobility and economics -- than they would have 
been otherwise. That alone is worth some of the investment in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Mumford decried the coming of the freeway age by arguing that we should 
not make cars more important than other ways of getting around. "Each type of 
transportation has its special use," he wrote. "There is no one ideal mode of 
speed: human purpose should govern the choice of the means of transportation. 
That is why we need a better transportation system , not just more highways." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford's words ring even more true today. We cannot afford to think about 
rail vs. highways vs. telecommunications as an either/or future for 
transportation in Southern California. In a metropolis so diverse, so 
sprawling, and so accustomed to operating on individual, private decisions, we 
need them all.

 OLYMPIC SECURITY: Thanks to the Tonya Harding hoopla, security is a hot topic 
at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, this week. One key player: Racal 
Recorders Inc. of Irvine has set up for Olympic authorities its "Wordsafe" 
system that lets them record all phone calls into each of their 16 event 
arenas.That's in case of bomb threats or any other security problems. . . . 
Says a Racal spokesman: "Wordsafe is for anyone who wants to know exactly what 
was said, by whom, and when."

 WARM-UP PITCHES: Comedian Garry Shandling makes so many millions from TV these 
days he rarely has time for the small club dates that gave him his start. But 
the Irvine Improv, which has been trying to get him back since his hit 1990 
appearance there, came up with an idea he bought: Since he'll be hosting the 
Grammys on March 1, maybe he'd like to use the Irvine Improv stage to try out 
his Grammy material. . . . Result: He'll do two shows there Thursday, and two 
on Friday. Admission is $20.

 FOR SISTERHOOD: Some cities hook up with sister cities in other countries to 
promote goodwill. But it can also come in handy. . . . Queretaro, Mexico, 
recently asked the police in its sister city of Orange for help: It had an 
unidentified murder victim shot four times and found in a ditch. The only clue 
wasn't much -- a parking stub from a Detroit area airport. Orange Lt. Timm 
Brown started making calls to Michigan until he hit pay dirt: The victim was 
president of a Farmington Hills, Mich. software company. FBI and Mexican police 
are investigating and believe an international kidnaping may have been 
involved.

CHOOSING BEST TRACK FOR TRANSPORTATION; * URBAN RAIL SYSTEM POSES THE MOST 
BENEFITS, CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation choices clearly are needed in Orange County, which has some of 
the worst traffic in California. And one intriguing solution being considered 
is an urban rail system. There are even some tax dollars accumulating after 
being approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are so many unanswered questions at this point that it is hard 
to know exactly what to make of all the talk. Presumably, such a system would 
run through the heart of Orange County, and again presumably, it eventually 
could link up with train service to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 What specifically would be connected? Recreation areas, residential areas, 
work centers and the airport? Would a train be a costly duplication of existing 
bus service? What would it really cost to install and subsidize? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is exciting and offers a hopeful alternative to the automobile. At 
this point, though, it is at a very formative stage. There is no concrete plan 
that is driving the search for dollars. Rather, it is the presence of some 
dollars and the prospect of more that is driving the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear at this point is that there is a lot of money on the table, and 
a lot more money than that in the pipeline of dreams. And it is this pot of 
gold, rather than some urgent need to put down track, that fuels speculation on 
a monorail or similar rail system envisioned for a 15- to 30-mile starter line. 
</P>
<P>
 The two key financial components are Measure M, the half-cent sales tax 
approved by county voters in 1990, and the cycle of federal transit funds. The 
Orange County Transportation Authority board has at its disposal revenue from 
Measure M, which envisioned an intra-county, multi-stop system. This clearly 
would be something more advanced in county rail than the commuter trains that 
run between counties with a few stations along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 For county planners, some of the justification properly arises from a feeling 
that the county should keep faith with the spirit of the sales-tax measure. And 
two studies have shown that a route from South Coast Plaza to Disneyland, 
running roughly along Main or Bristol streets in Santa Ana, would be suitable. 
With hundreds of millions of dollars available from the sales-tax measure, 
which would build an estimated six miles or so of the starter line, it is 
tempting to rev up the engines. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Washington is going through its seven-year cycle of transit 
funding. The next one starts in 1996, which will be just after OCTA finishes 
its mandatory analysis, scheduled to look at transit methods for the corridor. 
Make no mistake; the infusion of federal money to build a viable system would 
have to be huge. The analysis of transit options alone is an estimated 
$1-million to $2-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Other considerations for maybe going ahead: The Northridge earthquake showed 
that the numbers of train riders increased many times after the disaster. We 
learned from a crisis what we already know from our everyday traffic mess -- 
alternatives to the automobile are necessary. Transit officials argue that the 
Blue Line from Long Beach has been a success. Urban rail in Orange County also 
might be a catalyst for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 When rail systems around the country have cost so much more than projected, it 
is an understatement to suggest that the county must proceed carefully. In the 
past, some key planning decisions in Orange County have been made on 
shortsighted considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very important decision that is going to be made for a very long 
haul, and will affect not so much current generations as future ones. Study it 
well.

HOUSING FOR WORKING POOR IS WELCOME; * SINGLE-ROOM-OCCUPANCY HOTELS ACCESSIBLE 
TO MANY OTHERWISE PRICED OUT OF COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The abundance of million-dollar homes is testimony to Orange County's longtime 
reputation as a location blessed by the good life, but of course those 
spectacular houses are not the norm. It long has been clear that the county 
suffered from a need for affordable housing, somewhere for police and 
firefighters, nurses and secretaries to live. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been just the homeless who found themselves without shelter in the 
county. The working poor and those several rungs higher on the economic ladder 
have also been priced out of much of the county's housing stock. A welcome 
development to help the working poor has been approval of residential hotels 
known as SROs, or single-room-occupancy hotels, in several cities in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of quarreling, Irvine last month approved plans to build an SRO 
hotel in an industrial area off Jamboree Road. Owners of nearby businesses 
argued to the City Council that hotel residents would be bothered by noise, 
traffic and pollution from industry. That is why the Irvine Planning Commission 
previously voted against the SRO. The business people also said they worried 
that hotel residents would complain about the noise and demand that working 
hours be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 That is something the residents should not do. The council wisely voted to 
require residents to sign acknowledgments that nearby industry creates noise 
and sometimes operates 24 hours a day. If residents honor those agreements, it 
should satisfy the complaints of the council minority that voted against the 
SRO. 
</P>
<P>
 This month Fullerton joined the bandwagon, with the city's redevelopment 
agency agreeing to loan $1 million to a developer to build a 112-unit hotel for 
people earning less than $17,000 per year. The one-room apartments, with 
toilet, sink, refrigerator, microwave and small stove, plus a bedroom area, 
will rent for an average $326 per month. That may sound like a bargain to some, 
but for a senior citizen on a fixed income, or a fry cook in a fast-food 
restaurant, that is often all they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, the city converted what had been a 96-room motel into an SRO, 
home to people making less than $19,500 per year. Two nurses, two night 
watchmen and a secretary were among the first residents to move in last 
December. The County Board of Supervisors did a good job in helping Costa Mesa 
with a $1.2-million loan. The county needs more such housing, and other cities 
will do well to look toward Costa Mesa, Irvine and Fullerton for guidance.

THE CHANGING FACE OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; * HERE'S HOPING IMPENDING 
REDEVELOPMENT DOESN'T DETRACT FROM DOWNTOWN'S CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two decades, San Juan Capistrano has wrestled with the challenge of 
revitalizing its historic downtown in a way that is respectful of local 
tradition and character. The city seems poised now to at least do better than 
in the past, when redevelopment plans ran afoul of a late-blossoming 
preservationist movement. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the city is taking some pride in having business leaders and 
preservationists involved much earlier in the planning. The other encouraging 
aspect of the current discussion is that there is a local developer, wealthy 
rancher Richard J. O'Neill, who has bid to buy a city block. The developer will 
at least have some familiarity with community history. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have differing viewpoints on the need for redevelopment at all. But 
like it or not, redevelopment is basically a reality. The redevelopment 
agency's ambitions matter when it owns a sizable chunk of the downtown. It owns 
10 acres of city property straddling El Camino Real, just south of the 
218-year-old Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 But planners should keep in mind that San Juan Capistrano is one of the few 
locations in Orange County that has any identifiable historic sense of place. 
Much of the county is new with malls and housing tracts spread out in 
cookie-cutter style. When you have custody of a rare location, why not take 
advantage of the history instead of making it look like everyplace else? San 
Juan Capistrano would be wise to be respectful of the scale and history of its 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that opinions are sharply divided between those who think 
redevelopment has brought too much commercialization already and those who see 
redevelopment as the way into the future. Developing the area could be 
exciting, or it could be an overhaul that makes downtown San Juan Capistrano 
just another intersection in sprawling Southern California. The city ought to 
be able to find a tasteful approach.

CONSIDER CITIZENS IN WETLANDS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Stephen D. Anderson's letter, "Wetlands Future Should Be on Ballot" (Feb. 
6), talks about the property rights of the developers and how they are being 
"obstructed." 
</P>
<P>
 These developers who live off in gated areas in their huge estates need to 
have their property rights "obstructed" when they come into our town and try to 
jam a massive high-density housing project down our throats. What about the 
rights of the rest of the nearby homeowners in Huntington Beach who don't want 
the added traffic congestion and pollution? 
</P>
<P>
 In suggesting that the issue be put to a vote, Anderson knows full well that 
in the present depressed economic conditions any tax bill will go down to 
certain defeat. And Anderson conveniently ignores the fact that the present 
Huntington Beach City Council was elected to do exactly what they are doing -- 
trying to keep the developers from building on wetlands that could be easily 
restored. (Look what was done at the Talbert Marsh.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Bolsa Chica wetlands is nationally known, and is a stopover for 
migrating birds on the Pacific Flyway, its importance certainly extends beyond 
the city limits of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge our City Council to stay its course and to continue to seek funds for 
its purchase -- nationally, statewide, countywide; government or private! 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of California's wetlands have already been destroyed by 
"progress." Those of us in Orange County who care about our quality of life 
must do everything in our power to fight off any and all attempts by the 
money-worshipers to destroy the very few parcels of coastal wetlands left. 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES R. GALLAGHER 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * I share the concern of the majority of the Huntington Beach City Council 
about the lack of public hearings on the proposed development of the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands. County government recently attempted to exclude Huntington 
Beach from public hearings regarding bridges across the Santa Ana River at 
Banning and Garfield. Only at the insistence of the Huntington Beach City 
Council were hearings rescheduled for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that county government was not pleased to have publicly displayed 
how out-of-step they were with citizens and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's position on the Bolsa Chica is evident. Their problem now is to 
effect the plan as quickly as possible to minimize the public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 They intend to make technical compliance with the law regarding public 
hearings. They will allow public input only in writing and only if submitted by 
Feb. 18. They will conduct public hearings in a setting that they control. They 
will schedule public hearings at a time and a place as inconvenient for 
concerned citizens and taxpayers as possible. While the bureaucrats attend 
these meetings on the county's payroll and park free, citizens and taxpayers 
use vacation time to attend, and pay the county about $10 to park.

INSPIRATIONAL STORY OF MONA RUIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read the article ("Gangbanger to Gangbuster," Jan. 30) about Mona Ruiz, 
the Santa Ana policewoman who is an ex-gang member, to my classes at 
Westminster High School and then had the students write their reactions. All of 
them were captivated by her story and her heroism in breaking away from gang 
life to pursue a profession her father had encouraged her to get into -- all 
the while raising three children alone. She is a real hero in the eyes of our 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to enclose a short (piece) from Stephanie Porter, one of the

 When the story was read to me about Mona Ruiz, both sadness and joy came to my 
mind. It's a joyful story, knowing that someone in that kind of harsh lifestyle 
can change for the better and make something of their lives, instead of just 
wasting it away. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a sad story to know that so many more teens are still in this kind 
of dangerous situation. It's also sad that so many people have to be killed 
before people realize what gang violence can do. 
</P>
<P>
 What's especially upsetting to me is that not just the gangbangers are getting 
hurt and killed, it's also the innocent bystanders that unfortunately are in 
the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, one day, if we all work together, the violence can stop.

 * A very important story by Geoff Boucher about a major Latina hero, Santa Ana 
Police Officer Mona Ruiz, made a beautiful sight on your front page Jan. 30. 
The story had substance, depth, was well written and gave a fascinating 
biographical look at a local member of our community who turned her life around 
to make a substantial contribution to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more heroes than villains in our Latino communities. Don't stop with 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a proud moment when our young people can see the eyes of their own role 
models looking straight at them from the prestigious front page of The Times 
instead of just another gangbanger! It's confusing when the punks are the only 
ones who rate the limelight.

WRONG PEOPLE LAID OFF IN ORANGE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Once again, the Orange Unified School District is attempting to pay for its 
multimillion-dollar scandals by laying off people who actually work with our 
kids, including my daughter's favorite librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim Supt.Marilyn Corey, attempting to justify the action and spouting the 
sort of doublespeak typical of our district's administrators, says that the 
district has to lay these people off in order to avoid cutting services to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the district is in such dismal financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion? In order to finance the salary of our next $100,000-a-year 
superintendent, the school board should delete textbooks from next year's 
budget. Or lay off a few teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, why should money actually go toward our children's education when 
there are executive positions to fill?

 Now my son's school library is being hit by the Orange school board's 
shortsighted decision to pay for its past fiscal irresponsibility by laying off 
library workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board may not care about my son's education, but I do. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm tired of these high-paid bureaucrats cutting services to the public in 
order to perpetuate their bloated existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't they cut a few administrative positions for once and let the people 
who actually work with children do their jobs?

THERE'S A REASON FOR SCHOOL MANDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * (Shirley) Carey's column ("Unfunded Mandates a Drain on Education," Feb. 3), 
shows a serious lack of understanding of mandates and a total lack of knowledge 
as to the real issues. 
</P>
<P>
 To even suggest that school districts should have the flexibility to allocate 
funds as they see fit is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the federal mandate of providing a free appropriate public education 
for disabled students, school districts totally excluded these students from 
public education or would pick and choose the students they would educate. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws were enacted because school districts could not be trusted to provide 
and protect the civil and moral rights of these young people. So much for 
flexibility! 
</P>
<P>
 Some mandates and their policies, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act 
of 1991 and The Individual With Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (formally 
called Education of the Handicapped Act of 1975), simply cannot be expressed 
alone in terms of dollars and cents as Mrs. Carey would have you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some policies must symbolize the commitment of society to a higher goal, such 
as equality of life for disabled persons.

<P>
 Whatever happened to no salary increases for administrators, fewer 
administrators, improved fiscal management and greater consideration for the 
health, welfare and quality of education for all children. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare Mrs. Carey consider the elimination of ADA and IDEA, which are among 
the best pieces of legislation ever enacted in our country during the last 20 
years.

CHEERS, JEERS FOR AGRAN'S EL TORO REUSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Hooray for Larry Agran! Finally someone has the guts to talk about a viable 
alternative for conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, a plan 
that's feasible, economically sound, and that protects our environment from 
another commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Agran's commentary ("Let Irvine Co. Swap Farmland for Base, Then Wisely 
Develop It," Feb. 6) was a serious approach and should be considered by the 
recently formed governmental authority that will decide El Toro's fate. I 
challenge our elected federal officials not to pussyfoot around, and quickly 
lend their cooperation and leadership in a direction that will benefit all 
constituents in Orange County. 
</P>

 * Three years ago I came to live in Southern California to escape the icy 
winters of the East. The sun was delightful but I found that I had lost my 
freedom to travel where I needed, to the closest large cities, Los Angeles or 
San Diego, from where I lived in Laguna Hills. It meant approximately 160 miles 
back and forth on a crowded, dangerous freeway. No system of railroads or buses 
was available in this large, modern state. No safe transportation system 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I read Larry Agran's article in The Times on how the problem might be 
solved. I found it exciting. He describes a solution that would change the El 
Toro base into a National Center for Transportation and Environmental 
Excellence. My hope rose anew. No longer would we remain slaves to the 
automobile and dangerous freeway riding. With trains safely and swiftly taking 
us wherever we needed to go, what a godsend such a place would be!

consideration to his views.

 * I am writing in reference to Larry Agran's commentary (Feb. 6) on the 
conversion of El Toro. Talk about someone blowing their own horn. Here's a 
former mayor of Irvine, writing in a major newspaper, trying to sway public 
opinion. Repeatedly, he stated that no way should a commercial airport be 
built. He indicated that countywide consensus could not be developed in favor 
of an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 I think he is wrong, just like he was wrong in running for President. There 
are a lot more cities in Orange County than just Irvine, and I believe a 
majority of them (a consensus) would agree with me that the best and most 
economical decision would be to convert the military base into a commercial 
airport. He mentioned the noise that the airport would make; military aircraft 
make noise, and El Toro was there before the majority of cities in the south 
part of Orange County were built, so if he didn't like the noise, he had the 
option of living elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Agran did put forth one good idea; that was to include a monorail system 
in the conversion. The residents of Orange County have been asking for a 
monorail ever since Walt built one at Disneyland in the '50s. A major airport 
with rail transportation to outlying cities is a great idea.

Station. 
</P>

 Of course, the Irvine Co. should be the developer. Donald Bren has the vision, 
environmental sensitivity and outstanding team of planners and builders to 
create a world-class conversion model that will generate economic and 
quality-of-life wealth for all Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Agran's public-private land swap concept is a winner!

 * Politicians and land developers are like children in a candy store with 
money in their pockets. Developers see the potential to make money, while 
politicians see the potential for development on land that they can then annex 
into their cities to increase the tax base and thus further their empires. In 
all honesty, I am quite surprised by Larry Agran's position on the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the light of recent disasters that have hit California and the nation in 
the past year, I am surprised that any politician would promote the destruction 
of one of the few airstrips in Southern California that can handle heavy 
transport aircraft in the event of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Between last winter's rains shutting down the rail link to San Diego, the 
recent earthquake's damage to Los Angeles freeways and the terrorist bombing of 
the World Trade Center (in New York), one doesn't have to be very imaginative 
to see that any respectable natural disaster or a few terrorists could paralyze 
Southern California by disabling a handful of major land routes. It seems only 
prudent to preserve a potential "lifesaving" facility in the event of a 
disaster, either natural or man-made. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, on the fiscally conservative side, it would have made sense to mothball 
bases such as El Toro in the event that future world developments might 
indicate a need for such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 When all of the ramifications of turning the base over to the private sector 
are examined, it would probably be cheaper to mothball the facility. After all, 
the Navy does mothball ships and, at times, has recommissioned such vessels in 
time of national need. It seems ironic that since the prime incentive for 
closing bases is a financial one, that the federal government does not take the 
least expensive way out, which would be the mothball route. The toxic materials 
could still be cleaned up by the same mechanism as proposed by Mr. Agran. The 
bottom line appears to be that politicians and developers are birds of a 
feather and they simply want all of the development that they can get. Anyone 
who has lived in Orange County since the 1940s can certainly appreciate the 
rape of the landscape by development and overpopulation.

 * Reading Larry Agran's slant on El Toro reuse explains why he is no longer 
mayor of Irvine and guards were posted to keep him out of the presidential 
primary debates. What puzzles me is why President Clinton hasn't picked Agran 
for some post along with his other mouseketeers from Fantasyland. Could it be 
Hilly and Billy found Jerry Brown and Larry Agran inhaling?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARIES ON BOLSA CHICA; A COUNCILMAN AND A DEVELOPER 
CLASH OVER PLANS FOR WETLANDS; WETLANDS CAN BE RESTORED AND THE DUSTY, DEGRADED 
AREA SURROUNDING IT TURNED INTO A BEAUTIFUL SOURCE OF RECREATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY DUNN, Lucy Dunn is senior vice president of Koll Real Estate Group, 
which is the majority landowner of the Bolsa Chica property. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is Bolsa Chica? Different images are presented by special interest 
groups, but how do these images correspond with reality and with the vision of 
what Bolsa Chica can become? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in reality, Bolsa Chica is 170 acres of restored wetlands at the State 
Ecological Reserve by Huntington Beach, bordered by hundreds of acres of dry, 
dusty and degraded land where a pristine marsh once thrived. Within this 
degraded area are 200 active oil wells, water injection wells, pipelines, sumps 
and tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 But a "vision" comes from what you see with your eyes today and what you see 
with your mind and imagination as a legacy for your children. Tomorrow's vision 
of Bolsa Chica is 1,100 acres of restored wetlands -- eclipsing the Newport 
Back Bay in size -- surrounded by parks, hiking and bike trails and open space. 
</P>
<P>
 This vision can be achieved by implementing the Bolsa Chica Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Myths about Bolsa Chica fall short of describing the current conditions of the 
property and the purpose of the proposed plan. Consider the following examples: 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: "Bolsa Chica is a pristine wetlands in Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: The State Ecological Reserve off Pacific Coast Highway has 170 acres 
of restored wetlands. The balance of the wetlands acres at Bolsa Chica is 
surrounded by an operating oil field and was designated by the state Department 
of Fish and Game in 1981 as severely degraded and in need of restoration. Since 
1981, the site has progressively worsened and the wetlands are in dire need of 
the help of qualified biologists, hydrologists and eco-specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: "Koll is destroying wetlands to build houses." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: The Coalition Plan for Bolsa Chica development by consensus of the 
state, county, city, Amigos de Bolsa Chica and Koll, the landowner, calls for 
an increase in wetlands from 170 restored acres to more than 1,000 wetlands 
acres. The vision for Bolsa Chica returns it to a turn-of-the-century salt 
marsh system with hundreds of diverse species of birds, fish and other aquatic 
life that does not exist there today. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: "Residential development doesn't pay for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: This plan for Bolsa Chica will create 17,000 jobs and contribute $2 
billion to the Southern California economy. Sales taxes, property taxes and 
fees to public agencies will more than compensate for the public services to be 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The public benefits, including trails, parks, fire station, flood control 
improvements and water service improvements -- to be provided at no taxpayer 
expense -- add up to the reality that this plan gives far more to the community 
than it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: "Purchase of the property will save the wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: This concept is frequently repeated by activists seeking to prevent 
development. However, as we unfortunately know, local, state and federal 
governments are coping with significant economic challenges in the 1990s. 
Research by citizens groups and the landowner has concluded that funding for a 
land purchase, let alone restoration of the wetlands, is not available at any 
level of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of raising new local taxes, the landowner is proposing to construct 
new homes on 400 acres of property, which will pay for conservation and 
restoration of 1,100 acres of wetlands, along with major road improvements and 
other needed infrastructure. Why buy something that is being offered for free? 
</P>
<P>
 I invite you to see with your own eyes today's reality, imagine tomorrow's 
vision of Bolsa Chica, then judge with your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, we are offering free tours of Bolsa Chica for interested Orange 
County residents, which can be arranged by calling (800) 773-8673.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARIES ON BOLSA CHICA; A COUNCILMAN AND A DEVELOPER 
CLASH OVER PLANS FOR WETLANDS; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND DUBIOUS KOLL CO. CLAIMS 
ABOUT COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MUST BE SETTLED FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE SULLIVAN, Dave Sullivan is a Huntington Beach city councilman. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Koll Co. justifies its extremely dense Bolsa Chica housing project by 
promising to restore the wetlands. However, Koll officials have stated publicly 
that, if the federal government does not allow them to build on the wetlands at 
the back of the Bolsa Chica (a distinct possibility), they will not restore any 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, we must insist that federal approval is secured before Koll is 
given entitlement for even one building. Otherwise, Huntington Beach could very 
well end up with an excessively dense housing project and no wetlands 
restoration! 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica Coalition partners agreed that Huntington Beach should be the 
permitting agency for the project, since the city surrounds the Bolsa Chica and 
will be vitally affected by the development. 
</P>
<P>
 When it became obvious that the city intended to seriously pursue a thorough 
examination of the environmental and fiscal impacts of the project, the Koll 
Co. unilaterally reneged on the agreement with the coalition and asked Orange 
County to become the permitting agency. 
</P>
<P>
 This breach of faith is profoundly disturbing to the people of Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huntington Beach was the agency in charge, it processed the state 
Environmental Impact Report and the Federal Environmental Impact Statement at 
the same time. The county, now in charge, is processing only the state EIR. 
Under this faulty procedure, the Koll Co. could get approvals for 75% of its 
project (the high-density mesa) without making any commitment to restore 
wetlands. I fear that this might be the company's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll Co.'s flight to the county for approvals will cost the residents of 
Huntington Beach tens of millions of dollars. Up front, the city will lose 
about $65 million in initial building fees to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Huntington Beach taxpayers will pay tens of millions of dollars 
over the years to provide services such as fire, police, libraries and schools, 
as well as water and sewers. Koll Co. supporters are fond of using the phrase, 
"Restoration without taxation." In fact, the county process likely may result 
in "Taxation without restoration" for the people in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll asserts that its project is of great economic benefit to the city. In 
fact, since property taxes fall far short of the costs of service that a city 
must provide, new housing costs a city money. This case is even worse because 
almost all of the property taxes will go to the county. The city will be left 
holding an empty bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Co. has tried to say that the Koll plan for 4,884 homes is the "Bolsa 
Chica Coalition Plan." This simply is not true. The coalition plan does not 
grant 4,884 homes. The coalition plan states: "All final decisions on the type 
and densities in each geographical area will be determined by the county and 
city, through the usual public hearing process." 
</P>
<P>
 What will it cost the city to add water for 12,000 to 15,000 residents? (There 
is less than one day's reserve water supply in our city reservoirs.) How will 
it impact traffic on local streets such as Warner Avenue, Bolsa Chica Avenue 
and Pacific Coast Highway? What about liquefaction in a major earthquake? Is 
this a significant flood area? Will a proposed ocean jetty from the Bolsa Chica 
cause major erosion of the beach, our region's most precious resource? Are the 
wetlands and mesa one integral ecosystem? Can housing coexist adjacent to 
viable wetlands? Will pesticide runoff and house pets kill the birds and fish 
of the Bolsa Chica? These are only a few of the questions to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach will insist that the impacts of this project be thoroughly 
addressed by the county via the same conscientious process that would have been 
followed with Huntington Beach in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after this happens can the scope of the project be intelligently and 
fairly evaluated.

LIFTING OF TRADE EMBARGO HAILED BY MANY VIETNAMESE AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * (Your) Page 1 story last Sunday (Feb. 6) reporting about what was called 
"the exile community's first collective show of opposition to the end of the 
trade embargo," regrettably focused exclusively on the protest leaders and the 
participants to the demonstration -- where "a parade of speakers assailed 
(President) Clinton as a traitor" -- without getting the views of others in the 
community, or at least of the bystanders, and there were many on that busy Tet 
shopping weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, in lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, Clinton also 
announced the establishment of an office in Hanoi to pursue a dialogue with the 
Vietnamese government on the issue of human rights in Vietnam, a decision which 
is hailed by many Vietnamese Americans as a decisive step forward in the 
struggle for human rights and democracy in Vietnam. We Vietnamese Americans who 
joined in the campaign for Clinton in 1992, inspired by his promise to strongly 
support aspirations for democracy, freedom and human rights of the Vietnamese 
people -- and to rebuild a strong economy for my country -- have cause to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is definitely a great victory for the United States and for all 
Vietnamese Americans who are concerned about human rights in Vietnam.

 * The second part of Clinton's announcement to lift the trade embargo against 
Vietnam last week was his decision to establish a permanent liaison office to 
open a human rights dialogue with the Communist authorities in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 That was barely mentioned in recent press reports, and virtually ignored in 
the Vietnamese-language press, and I believe that has contributed to the 
surprising expressions of anger as reported in your stories about last 
Saturday's demonstration in Little Saigon organized by Mr. Diem Do, a leader of 
the National Liberation Front, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political refugee myself, I can easily empathize with many of my fellow 
compatriots who must have felt as if they were abandoned a second time by the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 However, my thinking, and the thinking of many of my friends, is that the 
embargo doesn't seem to have any more leverage left anyway after repeated 
relaxations during the past few years, and that the imminent opening of a 
dialogue with the Vietnamese government on the issue of human rights is clearly 
an important concession by Hanoi and a great victory for all of us.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; COMMUTERS CAN'T BE RAILROADED; METROLINK SUCCESS CANNOT BE 
MEASURED WHEN THERE IS NO CHOICE. RECRUITING A COMMITTED RIDERSHIP WILL TAKE 
REASSURANCES THAT IT WILL BE CONVENIENT, AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We commuters loved the first Metrolink train when it pulled into the hurriedly 
assembled Palmdale station Jan. 24. It relieved our fear of being cut off from 
the world by earthquake damage to our main road south. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, we new Metrolinkers, on whose permanent conversion to mass transit 
the transportation planners are pinning their hopes, have had our share of mood 
swings, not to mention a rise and fall in our numbers. Will we all, finally, 
learn to love the train? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, maybe not. Here's one commuter's account. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 1, no one minded the frigid morning air, the fact that we were still 
half asleep at 5:07 a.m. and the reality that getting back and forth was going 
to be a job in itself. We basked in the glory of the moment! Complimentary 
newspapers were shoved under our arms. Jim Ledford, Palmdale's mayor 
extraordinaire, shouted encouragement from a boarding ramp. We got a hero's 
send-off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the first week progressed, our enthusiasm gave way to a new spirit, the 
kind you see on football fields. Instead of brothers and sisters joined by 
adversity, we began to see ourselves as "get a seat by any means necessary" 
Metrolink warriors! It took a healthy dose of shoving, cursing and bullying to 
get a seat. A well-placed elbow didn't hurt either, and we didn't feel guilty, 
we felt frustrated because the train crawled along and hardly ever got to its 
destinations on time. 
</P>
<P>
 When people started complaining about our rude manners we muttered, "Walk a 
mile in our shoes." Better yet, "Ride a few miles in our rigid, unreclining 
seats," which are so close together your knees are either sticking into the 
aisle or jammed against those of the person across from you. 
</P>
<P>
 We believed it when we read that daily ridership on the Antelope Valley/Santa 
Clarita line was 21,956 -- it was easier to get a parking space at a Lakers 
game than at the Santa Clarita station. Try being sunny and lovable, we urged 
our unseen critics, after getting up at 3 a.m. to catch a train that gets you 
to the office at 7 a.m. even though work is supposed to start at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The honeymoon wasn't lengthened by our having to pay twice what our 
car-commuting fuel bill had been. Yes, it's true, we were a cranky crowd. Mr. 
and Mrs. Congeniality stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as with everything else in life, the rough edges got smoothed out. 
Metrolink warriors were slowly transformed into Metrolink commuters. For one 
thing, the ride improved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When additional car lanes opened on the Antelope Valley Freeway, the sunshine 
patriots deserted the train and got back in their cars. Transit planners 
fretted, but riders smiled because at last we had enough room. The Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's 2-for-1 ticket deal also helped win our loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 There are intangible advantages to Metrolinking as well. There's the sense of 
community that the peaceable form of ridership encourages -- meeting and 
greeting your neighbors in the morning and connecting with your regular 
traveling companions. You can relax and not have to fight the auto traffic. You 
feel you're attacking pollution by keeping your car parked. You are part of 
something big, if it happens: the trend toward mass transit in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But you, of course, are among those still on the train. What about all those 
people back on the highway? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget new pals and social movements. They just want to get to work. These are 
the people who returned as fast as they could to the freeway, reducing the 
Antelope/Santa Clarita line's daily ridership to 12,362 a week ago. They prefer 
to be locked away in their toasty autos, sipping coffee from 7-Eleven mugs and 
not having to worry about getting a citation if they're caught eating on the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 These people need reassurances that Metrolink will be convenient, affordable 
and reliable. I hope the addition of another new station in the Santa Clarita 
Valley and scheduling a third, later train from the Antelope Valley, begun late 
last week, will lure them back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a former resident of New York, where pushing, shoving and bullying on the 
rail system is an art form, I assure you that even the most aggressive and 
obnoxious Metrolink warrior seems like an angel. And even the most die-hard, 
wed-to-the-car commuters will take a second look at the Metrolink if the powers 
that be realize their patronage can't be taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Success cannot be measured by ridership when no one has a decent choice. 
Winning by default won't last. Recruiting a committed ridership will take a lot 
of effort and muscle. Employee incentives by business are one way to make it 
work. So is continued improvement in service. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the way it looks from my train window.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; HARDHEADED ADULTS NEED BIKE HELMETS AS MUCH AS THEIR KIDS 
DO; CHILDREN MUST NOW WEAR PROTECTION, BUT PARENTS SET A BAD EXAMPLE BY RIDING 
BAREHEADED. ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THE NEED FOR IT SHOULD DO THE OATMEAL TEST.

<P>
 Gangs? Can't stop 'em. Molesters? Can't catch 'em. Protecting our kids from 
the evils out there is not one of our society's strong points. 
</P>
<P>
 But once in a while, we do things right -- like last year when we put on the 
books the child helmet law for bicyclists that went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 I pedal a couple thousand miles a year, mostly within the Valley, and I've 
seen a big increase in the number of kids wearing helmets. We can feel proud 
that there will be far fewer bike-riding youngsters admitted to emergency wards 
with head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that increased helmet use among children contrasts vividly 
with the dismaying number of adult cyclists who don't think helmets are for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valley Circle, I passed a family of three helmeted tykes followed by mommy 
and daddy, hair fluttering in the breeze. On Lassen Street near Winnetka 
Avenue, a toddler resembling a Peanuts character peered out from beneath an 
igloo-shaped helmet while safely belted into a kiddie seat. His bareheaded 
chauffeur pedaled on, oblivious to his own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, our society must try to protect our youngsters from head injuries. 
But what about those who should know better? Does society's obligation extend 
to them? 
</P>
<P>
 I can already hear the wailing and gnashing of chain against cog. "Whatever 
happened to freedom of choice? I'm no kid. It's my head. If I want to crack it 
open, that's my business. Besides, I'm no racer -- I never go over 10 miles per 
hour." This last argument is similar to the one proffered by His Mayorship, the 
mountain biker, when called to task after being featured helmetless in a Times 
article last year. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I don't advocate forcing adults to save their skulls if they see no need. 
We know you can't legislate morality -- legislating common sense is equally 
hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
 What Hizzonor and others fail to grasp is that speed is only one factor, and 
not the most important one, contributing to injury. The severe cranial damage, 
the kind that stays with you for years, comes through falling, and is 
independent of bike speed. 
</P>
<P>
 For disbelievers, let's run a scientific experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand beside your bike. Note that your head is about the same distance above 
the ground as when you ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, lock your knees and lean backward slowly. Farther . . . farther. . . . At 
some point gravity takes over. Your only other responsibility in the experiment 
is making sure the first point of contact between you and the garage floor is 
the back of your head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For a more spectacular result, try experimenting with curbs, substituting the 
corner for the flat garage floor. Or you might try a boulder along a mountain 
bike trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Stupid experiment, right? But if you were a properly instrumented crash dummy, 
you would have generated some interesting data: 
</P>
<P>
 * Experiment duration: about 0.5 second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impact velocity: about 12 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cranium contact time: about 1/2000 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cranium deceleration: about 1,000 Gs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cracks in your skull are just a minor irritation compared to the brain 
damage. Since you probably haven't had the opportunity to sneak a peek at your 
brain, the next time you eat a bowl of oatmeal, poke it a little with your 
spoon. That blob makes a pretty good brain surrogate in size and consistency. 
Now pack the blob inside a skull and whack it with 1,000 Gs. The results aren't 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world, 400 Gs cause brain laceration, even without skull fracture. 
Seven hundred Gs cause permanent and significant brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But it'll never happen to you, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the last few years, I witnessed people launched over their handlebars 
when an object jammed their front wheel spokes. When that happens, your future 
hangs on the decision you made in the past, not on what you decide in that half 
second as you accelerate toward the inevitable 12-m.p.h. terminal velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, I wouldn't dream of forcing bike helmets on people who don't really 
see the need. However, my curiosity is aroused when I see a helmetless cyclist. 
I'll bet if I peeked in that person's ear, I'd see a tiny guy in there wearing 
a Quaker hat.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; COSTLY PLAN FOR A LANCASTER HOSPITAL NEEDS SECOND OPINION; 
CITY AGENCY WOULD PAY $11.1 MILLION FOR LAND PROPOSED FOR A COUNTY FACILITY. 
PRICE FAR EXCEEDS MARKET VALUE. AND THE SITE IS LOCATED IN A FLOOD HAZARD AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY GOLUB, Murray Golub is a Lancaster realtor and a director of the 
Antelope Valley Board of Trade. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pity the taxpayers of Lancaster and Los Angeles County -- they're about to get 
skinned again. County officials have determined that a county hospital should 
be built in Lancaster. An agreement has been entered into whereby Lancaster, 
through its Redevelopment Agency, will purchase 74 acres for the hospital for 
$11.1 million. The agency will sell bonds to raise the money, and the county 
will eventually repay the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Lancaster Redevelopment Agency is proposing to spend far 
more for the land than any knowledgeable buyer would pay in today's depressed 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be the first time this has happened. In 1992, the city paid $1.1 
million for 22 acres of wrongly shaped real estate for a Joshua tree preserve 
at Avenue K and 48th Street West. That purchase was made without an appraisal 
at a price far in excess of what any knowledgeable buyer would have paid. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hospital might turn out to be a white elephant. Administrators of the 
Antelope Valley Hospital say existing facilities are grossly underused and 
question the need for this one. In light of this argument, county Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich has delayed action by the Board of Supervisors until a further 
study can be made.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the need for the hospital is established, it should not be at the 
proposed location. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, at 30th Street West and Avenue I, is possibly subject to 
liquefaction and is in a flood hazard area. It consists of poor soil, so 
thousands of cubic yards of soil would have to be hauled in and compacted, at 
considerable cost. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say the price is fair and is based upon a 1992 appraisal. But 
appraisals are just opinions of the appraiser, supposedly based on finding 
sales of comparable properties. The price and demand for land started falling 
in 1989-1990, and that trend continues. The 1992 appraisal is an opinion with 
which it is not only possible but sensible to disagree with. It does not 
reflect the Antelope Valley land market, and it ought to be tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed price is $150,000 an acre. In my professional opinion as a 
realtor in the Antelope Valley for almost 30 years, specializing in land, given 
the use intended it would be extremely difficult to find a buyer who would pay 
as much as $40,000 an acre for that parcel, with its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the property, Presley Development, has taken steps to build 
houses on the land. Unloading it on the taxpayers would give it a triple 
benefit. First, it would walk off with a fat price at a time of depression in 
the housing market. Second, it would no longer have to pay a significant share 
of the payments required as a result of the sale of certain bonds, called 
Mello-Roos bonds, which provided money for roads, water lines, sewers, street 
lights, sidewalks and more than half a mile of storm drain channel that was 
required before the Presley company could build homes in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this purchase proceeds, no matter how you slice this turkey it will be 
county taxpayers who will have to bear the burden of repayment for this folly, 
with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, of course, the county cannot afford adequate police, fire and 
library services. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little effort the agency and the county could find better land at a 
fair price. Realtors and property owners would love to join in the hunt.

NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SLAP THE HAND THAT FEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I opened the Feb. 3 Valley section to find the letter of thanks and 
appreciation to readers and employees of The Times by the Valley Edition 
president, Jeffrey S. Klein.  
</P>
<P>
 I found his gentle words in stark contrast to the pejorative used by a staff 
writer to describe the San Fernando Valley.In his front page article, he 
referred to this large region as "Duh Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a clear and distinct pattern of editorial arrogance in The Times 
these days. If Mr. Klein truly means what he wrote, I hope he will remind 
others at the paper that Valley readers contribute significantly (in 
circulation and advertising) to the financial health of the paper. Please don't 
slap the hand that feeds.

IN UNDER A MINUTE, OUR VALUES CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "I'm fine. We are all fine." 
</P>
<P>
 What does that really mean in Calabasas, the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica 
-- an area of more than 2 million people? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," said 8-year-old Amanda. "I just wish the bed would stop jumping 
and making me scream for my daddy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," said the single mother of two. "I just can't figure out how to 
come up with the nine thousand needed to fix the condo." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," said the homeowner. "There is just this problem of the fireplace 
being in the middle of the house, you know, between two rooms. It doesn't look 
like it will fall further." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine," said the wonderful woman with the wastebasket full of chips, 
representing 40 years of collecting fine porcelain artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine now means that no one in the family was killed, maimed or seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine now means that the house was not condemned. We all know the difference 
between the red, yellow and green signs. Wow! Green! Green is great. Green 
means between only $5,000 and $50,000 in damages that no one can figure out how 
to pay for. Yellow is worse. Red is the ultimate disaster, other than injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In under a minute, our values changed. Within the first 15 minutes, we learned 
what community meant. It was the young people quickly walking the block to see 
that everyone had flashlights (their house is red-tagged). It was the lady with 
extra candles to share (yellow). It was the neighbor with the portable radio 
who actually had batteries! In Calabasas and other cities, it was the dedicated 
staff who had Martin Luther King Day off and yet showed up to help shortly 
after 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine can mean that we understand that all are in stress and dislocation, but 
that we can be OK together.

L. A. HAS SUDDENLY BECOME MORE CIVILIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 * The other morning I was out running as I usually do, and as sometimes 
happens, I needed to use a restroom. Normally, I would have to wait until 
arriving home.Imagine my surprise when I looked over to the other side of the 
street and observed portable toilets by the dozen. They were even very clean. 
How civilized Los Angeles has suddenly become. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been involved with the Canoga Park community in a number of capacities. 
Twice over the past several years, I have made an effort to provide toilet 
facilities at sites used heavily by homeless people and day laborers. I heard 
many excuses as to why they could not be provided -- chiefly because of their 
visual impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have them by the thousand, at every park and public facility in the 
Valley. I hear no complaints. This basic human service should be available at 
all times to all people.

HOSPITAL WAS SCENE OF HEROISM AND BRAVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "Hospital Near Epicenter Proved to be a Safe Haven" (Jan. 31) 
spoke of heroes on duty that night. I am proud to know a few you omitted. 
</P>
<P>
 I work on the rehabilitation unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where 
our patients face fear on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 They struggle, and most succeed, in rebuilding their lives, changed indelibly 
in a heartbeat by a bullet, a drunk driver, a disabling stroke. And yet these 
people showed true courage in a crisis, as did the remarkable staff that early 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As gas fumes filled the hall, nurses Liz Friala, Arceli Vilgera, Connie Luna, 
Fred Chinchilla, Lucia Badilla and Sharon Molina, assisted by other hospital 
personnel, lifted patients into their wheelchairs, mobilizing them to be 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the rehab floor was deemed safe for occupancy, and as dawn arrived, 
it turned into a mini MASH unit, taking admissions from the emergency room and 
patients evacuated from other parts of the hospital. We "washed" our hands with 
alcohol and made rounds by flashlight. All during the long night, rocked by 
countless aftershocks, the patients soothed the staff's jittery nerves, each 
stating, "I'm OK, don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we were near the epicenter of a devastating earthquake, and a shining 
example of human bravery and a commitment to caring.

4-LEGGED QUAKE VICTIMS NEED ASSISTANCE TOO 
</P>

<TEXT>

 * The West Valley Animal Shelter is overcome by runaway cats and dogs. 
Officials threaten to destroy the ones not claimed by owners or adopted . 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has the money to deal with this problem. This is an 
emergency like all the other earthquake emergencies that are getting funded. I 
can't understand the attitude that so much federal, state and private money is 
coming in for "relief," and they say they will destroy animals because they 
can't keep them forever. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have to keep them forever, just long enough for their owners to 
find them, or to be adopted into new homes, or to be taken by animal rescue 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a blight on all the goodwill that is going on now if the 
four-legged victims are killed by the city after they survived the natural 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 If each of us took care of one animal and got others to do it, all the animals 
could be saved.

CANYON OAKS WOULD BE A DEATH BLOW FOR TOPANGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Alexander Cockburn's column "Speculation vs. Democracy in Topanga" (Feb. 3) 
sounded the alarm. May the Board of Supervisors hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Our downstream community would be seriously threatened by the Canyon Oaks 
project, which includes a golf course, country club, sewage treatment plant and 
97 home sites that would be engineered into the steep headwaters of Topanga 
Creek.While subjected to increased flood hazards, the extra runoff and 
"nuisance water" described in the environmental impact report would soon 
convert our intimate, fragile creek environs into a treeless drainage ditch 
spewing pollution into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga and other rural communities in the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles 
have painfully discovered the direct connection between floodway mapping and 
urbanization of the mountains. The result is accommodation of development for 
the upper watershed while exposing the downstream community to economic and 
environmental degradation and, over time, termination. Our community views 
these regulations as having a devastating effect on the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's policy for permitting land developments such as Canyon Oaks to 
increase storm water discharges to natural watercourses lacks proper concern 
for public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 An integrated watershed management plan is the enlightened way to protect 
people and the mountains. If this development should be approved, it will deal 
a death blow to the plan and our existing community below.

OFFICIALS SHOWED POST-QUAKE CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The story "Some Feel Slighted by City Officials" (Jan. 29), quoting me as 
being angry about not hearing from some elected representatives after the 
earthquake, not only missed the point but also eliminated the fact that Rep. 
Howard Berman called the Thursday after the earthquake. This was from a 
temporary headquarters after his offices in Panorama City had been trashed. He 
sent his field deputy, Tom Waldman, to our area to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked around for more than two hours, surveying the damage and talking 
with residents. We realized that we in Valley Village were not as badly off as 
Sherman Oaks or Northridge, but most all the chimneys and block walls were 
down, and of course there was much damage to the insides of homes. Damage 
ranged from about $10,000 to upward of $20,000, a tidy sum for anybody, but 
especially for senior citizens and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Our North Hollywood police officers stopped by to ask about our welfare, and 
they asked us to distribute leaflets with important information. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Councilmen Joel Wachs' and John Ferraro's offices were concerned, we 
did not expect much. A phone call would have been sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems logical to me that the homeowners association presidents, who are the 
eyes and ears of the community, should be contacted as soon as possible to 
establish a communication conduit. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky walked his district in Sherman Oaks, talking with 
our business people and residents. He represents a small area in our Valley 
Village community and wanted to know firsthand what damage we had suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 We are all in this together and may be in it together again. Our neighbors 
have been magnificent and we are proud of the way each and every one of them 
cared about and helped one another.

TEMBLOR TEACHES LESSON ON SCHOOL SAFETY; TINY WILSONA DISTRICT IN THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY OFFERS SOME EXAMPLES OF WAYS TO PREPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly one month has passed since the Northridge quake and, in terms of 
schools and the safety of children, there are some important matters to 
consider. Parents and children in the San Fernando Valley and adjacent regions 
have been fortunate in one very important respect. Neither the Sylmar quake in 
1971 or the Northridge temblor occurred during school hours. It's important 
because few school buildings have been upgraded to withstand major earthquakes, 
and the timing of the next one might be right in the middle of a school day. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of preparedness for that frightening possibility, the tiny, 
three-school Wilsona District in the Antelope Valley is among those that is 
leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very aggressive when it comes to emergency preparedness," said Richard 
Sanders, a supervisor for the Wilsona District. "All schools have their own 
portable generators. We have stored water at each site. We have stored food at 
each site. We're in a very rural area. We know if there's a natural disaster, 
we're not going to get help for a minimum of three or four days." 
</P>
<P>
 That's good thinking. We have certainly learned that roads and highways can be 
severely disrupted by a major temblor. In such an emergency, the schools might 
be required to remain open for several hours after a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also true that small school districts will find it easier to implement 
such measures, while others that sustained major damage in the Northridge quake 
will be ill-prepared for additional expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is an area where parent teacher associations can help. With last 
month's memories so firmly in place, it might be quite reasonable to add 
certain items to your PTA's next fund-raising efforts. A portable generator, 
flashlights and non-perishable food items might be just the thing your child's 
school needs when the next earthquake hits.

MUCH WORK REMAINS TO PREPARE FOR NEXT QUAKE; POLL SHOWS THAT MANY VALLEY 
RESIDENTS WEREN'T READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may be getting tired of reading about the Northridge (or is that Reseda?) 
earthquake but indulge us one more time. The matter we would like to suggest 
involves preparedness. Our piece is based on the findings of a Times poll 
conducted after the temblor and more recent interviews. The issue is 
preparedness. If the following is any indication, we all have a long way to go. 
After all, in the initial moments of the quake, we practically lost our police 
chief -- Willie Williams -- to a falling armoire. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one emergency services coordinator put it best: "I really feel that 
the general public thinks the government is going to be there the minute the 
ground stops shaking. And that's not true. . . . People must understand that 
they need to be prepared, to have their neighborhoods prepared, to talk about 
what's going to happen and where they're going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half of the residents in the Valley and its adjacent communities 
said that they were prepared for an earthquake, according to the recent Times 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of those who responded to the same poll said that they had not taken any 
of the most common recommended steps for protecting themselves from earthquake 
damage before the Northridge temblor hit. Surprisingly few have done much since 
then. It's true that 60% of the residents in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando 
valleys have now taken at least one additional precaution, and that nearly 70% 
have obtained at least one additional emergency item, but that is hardly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, we have compiled a list of questions, based on information 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Governor's Office of 
Emergency Services' Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you taken steps to anchor bookcases, armoires or wall units to the 
walls? 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you placed guardrails on the bookcases and open shelves to prevent 
items from falling out of them? 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you installed cupboard latches to keep them closed when the shaking 
starts? 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you taken any steps to stock up on non-perishable food items such as 
canned goods, and do you have a non-electric can opener in the house in case 
power is lost during the quake? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have a good supply of bottled water? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have flashlights and batteries for a portable radio, and are they in 
an accessible location? Battery-operated flashlights are also good. Flashlights 
that have to be recharged at an electrical outlet can't be recharged until the 
power comes on again. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you written up a family earthquake plan? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you know if your neighborhood, street or complex has an earthquake plan? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is your home bolted to its foundation? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do you have earthquake insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 As a seismologist at Caltech said recently, we are living in a seismically 
active area. Pains must be taken to overcome denial and become as prepared as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you were among those of us who were stumbling around in the dark, 
trying to remember where the flashlight was, or whether we had one, or if the 
batteries were fresh if we happened to find it. Perhaps you were one of those 
folks who suddenly remembered that they hadn't learned how to open the garage 
door when the electrical opener attached to it isn't working. Perhaps you 
recall the helpless feeling of trying to find a grocery store that was open on 
the day of the quake, one that hadn't been stripped of its emergency items by 
the time you arrived? 
</P>
<P>
 We're betting you don't want to have those feelings again, if you can avoid 
it. Perhaps you can, and now is the time to do it.

THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS; THE VENTURA BOULEVARD SPECIFIC PLAN WAS DEALT A 
SEVERE SETBACK BY MOTHER NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drive along Ventura Boulevard in the days after the quake provided a 
snapshot of the considerable damage sustained by businesses there. As Jeff 
Brain, past president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, put it: "We've 
got burned-out buildings, displaced tenants and not a whole lot of places to 
move them." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial struggles those merchants will face in re-establishing their 
livelihoods weighs heavily on an important debate that will be aired again in 
the coming weeks. It involves the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan and its 
quarter-billion-dollar blueprint to tame the boulevard's unruly growth, to ease 
its traffic and enhance the area over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If that already seemed like an ungodly sum of money for one road in these 
tough fiscal times, it ought to appear even more exorbitant now, after the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing mechanism for this plan, which was developed in the relatively 
flush 1980s, involved so-called trip fees. That was based on a rather 
complicated formula involving the number of new car trips generated by new 
projects. But the trip fees were a huge financial bite in the ensuing 
recession. They haven't materialized in the amounts anticipated, and they have 
been protested by businesses and often waived by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A better option that emerged last year called for a lesser reliance on trip 
fees and the establishment of as many as five benefit assessment districts 
along the boulevard that would distribute improvement costs more equitably 
among property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 That made much more sense, but it was also before the quake and a situation so 
grim that the president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. now says that "it 
could be years before these areas are rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Any revised plan for the boulevard will have to take such hardships into 
consideration. The new reality is that the Valley's economy has been severely 
disrupted by a natural disaster. If the boulevard plan is not put on hold 
indefinitely, it will have to be scaled back further still.

WARMING WORDS: PITCHERS, CATCHERS REPORT TO CAMP; BASEBALL: SPRING TRAINING IS 
A TIME OF REBIRTH FOR PLAYERS, TEAMS AND FANS, A TIME WHEN EVERYONE IS DEAD 
EVEN IN THE STANDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All over, it's been one of the worst winters ever. Bitter cold, whipping winds 
and snow, sleet and slush that just won't quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad weather isn't finished yet, but this forecast will warm up anyone 
stuck inside watching the Olympic luge competition: Pitchers and catchers will 
report to spring training this week. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're buried by a blizzard in Boston or Baltimore, don't fret. In just a 
few days, there will be photos from Florida of the Red Sox frolicking in Fort 
Myers and the Orioles stretching in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're caught in a deep freeze in Chicago or Colorado, cheer up. Soon there 
will be shots on television from Arizona of the Cubs working out in Mesa and 
the Rockies loosening up in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, camps can officially open Wednesday. But the bats and balls will 
be broken out before that, because on Tuesday morning, Michael Jordan will 
begin his first real workout with the Chicago White Sox in Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Most baseballers say Jordan has no chance -- some have even gotten on their 
high horses to say he's making a mockery of the game -- but this is part of 
what spring training is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a time of rebirth for players, teams and fans, a time when everyone is 
dead even in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Toronto Blue Jays may be favorites to become the first team to win 
three straight championships since Oakland in 1972-73-74 and Barry Bonds may 
become the first to win four MVP awards. 
</P>
<P>
 But who would've thought last spring that the Philadelphia Phillies would 
reach the World Series, or that Andres Galarraga would wind up winning a 
batting championship? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's easy to say positive things this time of year, but I think 
truthfully we could surprise people," said manager Dallas Green of the New York 
Mets, the worst team in the majors last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to say you can go last to first. It's happened before," he 
said. "So I'm looking forward to spring training, I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so enthusiastic, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look forward to spring training," said Joe Carter, whose home run 
ended the 1993 season. "The only thing I look forward to is going down to 
Florida to play golf. You can't play golf in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Carter leaves his home in Kansas City and arrives in Dunedin, 
Fla., to start workouts with the Blue Jays, baseball will be entering a new 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, teams do not have to finish first to make the postseason. 
Instead, with each league split into an East, Central and West division, a 
wild-card winner will join the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other changes, too. For the first time in decades, Nolan Ryan, 
George Brett and Robin Yount will be missing. They've all retired after Hall of 
Fame careers. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, trades and free agents have reshaped teams, although not nearly 
like last winter, when the likes of Bonds, Greg Maddux, Paul Molitor, Jim 
Abbott and David Cone found new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Baltimore, which added Rafael Palmeiro, Sid Fernandez, Chris Sabo, Lee 
Smith, there wasn't much major movement. Will Clark signed with Texas, Terry 
Mulholland was traded to the New York Yankees and Delino Montreal's DeShields 
was swapped for Los Angeles' Pedro Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Williams, who gave up Carter's three-run homer in the ninth inning in 
Game 6 of the World Series, was sent to Houston. He'll play for rookie manager 
Terry Collins; Tom Trebelhorn was hired by the Cubs in the winter's other 
managerial move. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the camps, the Seattle Mariners will play in their new spring home in 
Peoria, Ariz. They'll share the site this year with the San Diego Padres -- in 
fact, the Mariners and Padres play March 2 in the first major league exhibition 
game of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4, the White Sox, with or without that rookie outfielder named 
Jordan, play their first game, against Texas. The next day, the Blue Jays and 
Phillies play the first of their five spring meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Early March is the time to watch rookies like first baseman J.R. Phillips of 
the Giants, third baseman Tim Costo of the Reds and outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds 
of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-March is the time to see whether Bo Jackson is able to play full time in 
left for the Angels, whether Jose Canseco's elbow has healed for the Rangers, 
and whether Darryl Strawberry's back is better for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Late March is the time Carter waits for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only week I look forward to is the week before the season starts. That's 
when I get serious," he said. "You don't want to peak too early and leave your 
stroke down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Managers Cito Gaston of Toronto, Tom Lasorda of Los Angeles and Sparky 
Anderson of Detroit usually let their veterans work at their own pace, meaning 
their exhibition records don't mean much. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, however, studies show that teams that seem to show dramatic 
results in spring training, like the Phillies last March, often make surprising 
progress once the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, it's happened that way in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 And it all starts for real on April 3 when St. Louis plays at Cincinnati in a 
rare Sunday night opener.

COMMENTARY: SARAJEVO UNDERGOES OLYMPIC TUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind the summit house, the pure white mountain range stretched toward 
Yugoslavia's eastern borders. Silent and white and crystalline bright in the 
morning sunlight, a winter's snow covered the mountains' ridges and craters and 
valleys. Imagine the moon after a blizzard. Just outside the summit house, a 
weather station's skeletal antenna was encrusted with ice turning the tower 
into an eerie stalagmite. We were at the top of the world. We were at the 
summit of Mount Bjelasnica. 
</P>
<P>
 This was 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Sarajevo for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the summit house an hour before the men's downhill ski race. Two 
sportswriters had commandeered a ski-lift chair and made their way to a seat 
alongside Bill Johnson, a California ski bum, blond and handsome and proud to 
say he had never worked at any job more than a month. He was this kind of guy: 
When he said he lived in his Ford Pinto, we believed him. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hour, Johnson would throw himself off the mountaintop and down its icy 
walls at 80 m.p.h. on a pair of slats. We asked how he felt and he said, "You 
ought to be asking the Austrians how they feel. I enjoy sticking it to them. 
They're rattling at the knees." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had it right. He became the first American ever to win the downhill 
gold medal. He said, "It's a dream come true." And now, all these years later, 
we wonder whatever happened to the brash young man whose name is only a memory, 
a memory that comes back because we are on the way to Norway for another 
Olympics, this one 10 years after Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Sarajevo was warm and sweet, a place where Marina Borak, a young 
English teacher from Belgrade, told an American sportswriter, "The world does 
not know where Yugoslavia is before the Olympics. A man in Argentina one time 
said to me, 'Yugoslavia in Africa?' I said, 'No, in Australia.' The Olympics, 
they make Yugoslavia a happy place now." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Christ, the Romans took the land that would become Yugoslavia. Turks 
owned it later. The Austro-Hungarian empire seized it in the 19th century. 
World War I began after a Sarajevo teen-ager, Gavrilo Princip, assassinated the 
foreign ruler, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Decades of factional wars spread a 
national darkness followed by the hell of Hitler. Then came Josef Tito after 
World War II to win with arms the independence that in 1994 has been 
transformed into a new kind of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after Sarajevo's Olympics, I can feel the snowflakes against my 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 It was lovely on the chair lift, floating toward the top of the hill where the 
ski-jump ramp sits. Snowflakes the size and softness of cotton balls touched 
our faces. Floating in snowy space, we felt a beautiful silence. Far below we 
saw people looking up. We saw a pine forest decorated in snow. They had cut a 
landing space in the pines for the jumpers. We would never forget that 
snowscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the Olympics, we walked down Vase Miskina, the busiest street in 
Sarajevo's 500-year-old market district. Though police carried machine guns 
against the possibility of terrorists, they were unfailingly polite. "Loaded?" 
a journalist asked a policeman at 3 one morning. The man made a soft, gentle 
noise of affirmation, as if regretting the truth of his country and the times. 
</P>

 A sweetheart of a place, Sarajevo. Taxi drivers gave back tips they considered 
too large. A supermarket had an English-speaking clerk walk the aisles to help 
tourists. At 2 in the morning, a restaurant owner told his customers to wait 
while he ran two blocks up an alley to fetch them a taxi. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked to an American living in Germany who had driven to Sarajevo. Iris 
Zimmerman started on the Autobahn. He said, "But in Yugoslavia we got on a 
one-lane road with potholes all the way. It hits you like a brick wall. I 
thought, 'My God, what kind of country is this?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But then you get to Sarajevo. It's like their oasis. Everything had been drab 
and dreary until Sarajevo. Here there's color. You don't feel like you're in an 
Eastern bloc country." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years, no time at all, can be forever when those years become terror on 
the hour. Sarajevo today has no color except the color of blood. Mount 
Bjelasnica is an artillery site. The ice-skating palace, Zetra, has been 
destroyed by shelling. The Olympic stadium is rubble. Yugoslavia is gone, 
replaced by Bosnia Herzegovina. Joy is gone, replaced by war. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago we visited Vraca, a memorial to the country's dead from World 
War II. Thousands of names were carved into stone on the place's walls: names 
of Jews and Christians and Moslems taken from Sarajevo to die on madmen's 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Logoriu 6060. Concentration camp dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratista 597. Executed by firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
 From Sarajevo, 9,103 people died in 16 Nazi concentration camps in Yugoslavia. 
We asked a guide about words engraved in stone above Tito's signature. "Tito 
say this war is very bad in history," the guide says. "He say do not let 
tragedy like this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow fell beautifully in Sarajevo 10 years ago. We walked through the Old City 
where Moslem mosques with towering minarets stood alongside narrow streets with 
cobblestone sidewalks. We saw a young man using a dust pan to remove snow from 
his doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speak English?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do the Olympics mean to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Edid Babic didn't know the words. With his index finger, in the dust of a 
gray, gritty, dirty wall, maybe three miles from Vraca, he drew the outline of 
a heart. He turned back to us and smiled.

EARNHARDT FINDS THAT WINNING DAYTONA 500 IS ELUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It should be the simplest of equations: Dale Earnhardt is the best; the 
Daytona 500 is the biggest; ergo Dale Earnhardt must win the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple? Yes. True? Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to Earnhardt's chagrin, the six-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion has 
failed to win stock car racing's Super Bowl event in 15 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them have been agonizingly close. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, Earnhardt was leading with one lap to go on Daytona 
International Speedway's 2 1/2-mile oval but lost a stirring duel with Dale 
Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he crashed with Davey Allison while the two were battling for the 
lead late in the race. The race finished under the ensuing caution flag with 
Ernie Irvan winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Earnhardt led halfway through the final lap only to run over a piece 
of debris coming off Turn 2. A shredded tire nearly sent him careening into a 
wall. He was able to right the car and finish, but the Daytona 500 was gone 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he ran out of gas while leading with two laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough thing to do," Earnhardt said, "come down here and prepare as 
hard as you do over the winter and put all that effort into winning that race 
and then lead the laps and dominate the way we have and then lose it, not once, 
not twice, but three or four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "That weighs on you as a driver, a car owner, a crew chief and a team. We've 
had some devastating losses. It's hard to have to lose and take it. It's tough 
to get out of that race car and face that crowd of reporters all asking you 
what it feels like to run second again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those scars heal," Earnhardt said. "I still remember '90, when the tire 
blew, and '86, when we ran out of gas. I will always remember it. But the pain 
of it all goes away. We've won three (series) championships since we blew that 
tire in '90." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pressure that builds right up to the start of the Daytona race, 
Earnhardt tries to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a championship season, The Intimidator trails Richard Petty's 
record seven season titles by just one. It's a record he covets, as much from 
his respect for the now-retired Petty, stock car racing's all-time king, as his 
determination to keep winning as long as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to make a choice (between winning Daytona and winning another 
championship) -- and I'd hate to have to do that -- I'd take the championship," 
Earnhardt said. "We've worked so hard at winning that race and been so close so 
many times. We've led laps, a lot of laps. We've dominated that race at times. 
So, if we never win, I'll still feel some comfort in knowing we were usually a 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt has recorded eight top-five Daytona 500 finishes, including second 
place in 1984 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Little has changed as preparations begin for the Feb. 20 race. At 42, 
Earnhardt is still in his prime and he likely will be at least one of the men 
to beat, if not the clear-cut favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is we're going to keep coming down here to win the race," he 
said emphatically. "We're bound and determined to . . . defeat that race and be 
a Daytona 500 winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough because of the competition. Every race is tough because of the 
competition, and then you multiply that for Daytona because everybody puts so 
much time into trying to win that race." 
</P>
<P>
 It took three-time Winston Cup champion Darrell Waltrip 17 years to win the 
Daytona 500, in 1989. Until he won it, Waltrip had to answer the same questions 
and take the same heat and put up with the same frustration that Earnhardt has 
lived with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't something that eats at you all the time," Waltrip said. "But it is 
the first race of the year and the focus on it is tremendous. Everybody is 
asking you about it all winter and everything just builds and builds for that 
race. Then, when you don't win it, the questions begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning it is like getting a huge weight off your shoulders. I feel for Dale, 
but I'm going to try to beat him again." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, that perspective showing through again, said, "What all has won 
this race doesn't drive me. I wan to win the Daytona 500 because it's our Super 
Bowl, but also because it's a race and I want to win every race I run. 
</P>
<P>
 "As fortunate as I have been in racing, I don't think it's going to devastate 
me if I don't win the Daytona 500. But I still feel like I have several years 
ahead of me to win and a team that's capable of winning. So, we're just going 
to take our shots at it."

ART; COMMENTARY; CRY ME A RIVER; WE KNOW THAT PABLO PICASSO WAS A WOMANIZER AND 
NOT A VERY NICE GUY. BUT THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY REASONS THESE WOMEN ARE WEEPING. 
THERE WAS ALSO THE QUAKE AND HIS MOTHER AND, OF COURSE, THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR 
</P>

20th Century for the show at the Royal Academy in London.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Guernica," Picasso's great and terrible monument to the Spanish Civil War, 
was in part inspired by the memory of an earthquake the artist experienced in 
1884, at the age of 3, in Malaga, his native city in southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Picasso never forgot the sight of his pregnant mother wearing a peasant 
kerchief and the feeling of being swaddled in his father's cape as the family 
fled from its house. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three years later, in 1937, these sensations found their way into the 
famous grisaille mural as images of torment -- of a woman holding her dead 
baby, of another dragging her own wounded body across the floor, of yet 
another, head upturned, screeching as she falls from a window. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural was the centerpiece of the 1937 Spanish Pavilion at the 
International Exposition in Paris. During the same year, however, Picasso also 
created an extraordinary series of drawings and paintings on the theme of 
weeping women. 
</P>
<P>
 While directly inspired by the artist's complex romantic life at that time, 
they clearly relate to "Guernica's" images of agonized peasant women. These 
smaller works, including a number of widely acknowledged Picasso masterpieces, 
are now themselves the subject of an exhibition, "Picasso and the Weeping 
Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter & Dora Maar," that opens today at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 From the title of the exhibition, we might infer that the artist had been 
responsible for making the subjects weep in real life, but this would be only 
partially true. The Spanish master (1881-1973) may have been one of the 
century's greatest geniuses, but he was also one of its most famous male 
chauvinists. However, the "Weeping Women" represent something more complex, a 
unique fusion of sexist manipulation, empathetic feeling, photojournalistic 
reportage and psychic crisis. The paintings are impositions on, as well as 
interpretations of, real women. Furthermore, they are also generalized symbols 
of the suffering of the Spaniards and physiognomic maps of one man's midlife 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 While only two women are named in the show's title, the show's curator, Judi 
Freeman, formerly of LACMA and currently of the Portland, Me., Museum of Art, 
contends that three real women are reflected in the works in question. Olga 
Koklova -- the unnamed woman -- was a Russian ballerina from a minor 
aristocratic family whom Picasso married in 1918 and from whom he was 
estranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie-Therese Walter was a blond teen-ager he picked up outside the Parisian 
department store Les Galeries Lafayette in 1928 and with whom he secretly had a 
child, Maya, in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 Dora Maar was a dark-haired, politically impassioned intellectual, a painter 
as well as a photographer, with whom Picasso embarked on an affair in 1936. 
Maar's political activism played an important role in the gestation of 
"Guernica." 
</P>
<P>
 Picasso developed a different visual code for each of these women. The show at 
LACMA has been planned to adhere to this organization, with a first room 
devoted to images of Koklova, a second room to Walter, a third gallery to the 
"Weeping Women" and a fourth to Maar. 
</P>
<P>
 Koklova is not on the marquee at LACMA, because by 1937, she was pretty much 
out of the picture in Picasso's life, and her presence in his art was oblique. 
She is depicted in this period as a monstrous, devouring figure. By the late 
'20s, Picasso had begun to show intense hostility toward his wife in paintings 
of an abstracted human head with a vagina dentate in place of a mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The images of women with bared teeth and pointed tongues in "Guernica" may 
likewise be inspired by Koklova's habit of smiling and sticking out her tongue 
at her husband. Picasso's painting "Head of a Woman" (1927), one of the crueler 
works inspired by Koklova in the showat LACMA, depicts a desiccated hieroglyph 
of a yawning mouth in profile with four sharp prongs for teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walter portraits are the absolute embodiment of non-threatening womanhood 
and sensual bliss. They are among the most sexually explicit works in his 
oeuvre . "The Studio" (1934) shows a pinkish female nude in an uninhibited 
swoon (Walter was famous for her naps), while the figure of a male artist 
paints a small canvas of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 This bucolic mood began to sour when Picasso moved Marie-Therese and Maya to a 
villa outside Paris that was lent to him by his old dealer Ambroise Vollard. By 
this time, Picasso was also beginning to get bored with his blond nymphet, and 
her portraits from 1936-37 start to look static. Her code of colors (green, 
violet, yellow) and metaphors, vegetal and sappy, don't really evolve in this 
period, which is one clear indication of Picasso's waning interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The persona of Dora Maar undergoes the most radical transformation in 
Picasso's portraits of this period. During the late 1930s, the real erotic and 
intellectual joust was between Maar and Picasso, and it is no coincidence that 
in 1940 he depicted her in a big painting, "Woman Dressing Her Hair" (not in 
the LACMA version of the show), with a sword for an arm. When he first met Maar 
at Cafe des Deux Magots in 1936, she is said to have been throwing a sharp 
penknife down between her fingers into a wooden table. In Picasso's portraits, 
she starts out as a good-looking girl with short black bangs and carefully 
manicured dark-red nails. Gradually, she becomes a barely legible character 
enmeshed in spidery lines. Later she is depicted as entirely encased in tight 
basketwork coils. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the inaccuracies in the biography "Picasso: Creator and Destroyer," 
published in 1988, author Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington had a point when 
she wrote: "Dora, beautiful and brilliant, was transformed by Picasso into the 
Weeping Woman, her face distorted in torment. The goddess was turned into a 
doormat." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last portraits Picasso made of Maar in 1942 during World War II 
shows a relatively straightforward likeness of an emotionally devastated 
person. Maar, born Henrietta Theodora Markovich in Tours, France, in 1907, was 
half-Jewish on her father's side, yet Picasso somehow arranged for her to 
remain in Paris during the Occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, the Spaniard took up with another young woman, Francoise Gilot, and 
his imagery changed again. Maar suffered a severe nervous breakdown, was 
hospitalized and given electroshock treatments and recovered only after 
extensive analysis with eminent French psychiatrist Jacques Lacan. Picasso 
himself admitted: "For me, (Dora Maar) is the weeping woman. For years I gave 
her a tortured appearance, not out of sadism and without any pleasure on my 
part, but in obedience to a vision that imposed itself on me." 
</P>
<P>
 While mirroring Picasso's love life, the "Weeping Women" also reflect events 
on the world stage. They were made at the time of intense bloodshed during the 
Spanish Civil War and they anticipate the even greater horrors of World War II. 
There is a mood of universal anguish about these images, as well as a 
specifically nationalist message in these icons of females often coiffed in 
elaborate mantillas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is noteworthy that other Spanish artists, such as Joan Miro and Julio 
Gonzalez, depicted weeping peasant women at exactly the same time, and their 
works were also exhibited in the Spanish Pavilion at the International 
Exposition. Picasso's "Weeping Women" should thus be understood as part of a 
larger apocalyptic groundswell in the late 1930s. Reduced to an almost animal 
state, rending their handkerchiefs with their teeth, these women are Picasso's 
unforgettable vision of world panic. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, in a very real sense, the "Weeping Women" are also about the 
artist's own midlife crisis. For several months in late 1935 and early 1936, 
after Koklova had seals put on all of his property, Picasso almost stopped 
working altogether, except for some stream-of-consciousness writing. He was 55 
years old, a new father and starting to juggle a couple of new affairs with the 
wives of friends before he got involved with Dora Maar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish Civil War erupted in July, 1936, and although Picasso made no 
attempts to visit his native country, the situation filled him with sorrow. 
When Maar came on the scene in late 1936, she galvanized a very famous man who 
was in a bad slump. Through her old boyfriend, writer Georges Bataille, Maar 
found Picasso a new studio in which to paint "Guernica." 
</P>
<P>
 She energized him with her left-wing political opinions. She photographed the 
mural as it developed and she even painted bits of it herself. She got Picasso 
out of his midlife crisis, and "Guernica" should be seen as their conceptual 
collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 Dora Maar is still living in Paris. (Koklova died of natural causes in 1955, 
and Walter committed suicide in 1977.) When curator Freeman interviewed the 
85-year-old recluse at her apartment, she agreed to talk but only off the 
record. Her contribution thus remains undocumented in the catalogue, and Maar 
is not a lender to the show, although she still owns a key "Weeping Woman" 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently she has been the subject of a consuming memoir by James Lord, 
"Picasso and Dora, a Personal Memoir" (1993), and a selection of her 
photographs were included last year in the Getty exhibition "Women on the Edge: 
Twenty Photographers in Europe, 1919-1939." What little I've seen of her work 
suggests that the time is ripe for a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest work on view at LACMA is a small, brightly colored oil on 
canvas dated Oct. 26, 1937, on loan from the Tate Gallery in London. In this 
famous painting, a woman bites her handkerchief, which in turn becomes a veil 
enshrouding one of her hands. British Surrealist Roland Penrose bought this 
work out of Picasso's studio when it was barely dry. 
</P>
<P>
 About this painting, Penrose later wrote: "It was as though this girl, seen in 
profile but with both the dark passionate eyes of Dora Maar, dressed as for a 
fete, had found herself suddenly faced with a heart-rending disaster." 
Recently, David Hockney, whose homages to Picasso are legion, acknowledged 
being smitten by this very painting when it was shown in London in the 1950s 
and '60s. In the LACMA catalogue he recounts: "The first image I ever saw of 
Picasso's work was the 'Weeping Woman.' I can never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 With this icon to a sobbing woman, Picasso created a new mythic creature as 
archaic in its way as the Minotaur, which the artist also used as a mythic 
self-image in paintings and drawings of the 1930s. He invented a whole genre, 
precariously balanced between tragedy and comedy, that might be called the 
Sardonic Sublime. In these images, the women have eyes like bathtub boats that 
pour out rivers of tears. Picasso's Maenads, who rip their handkerchiefs, 
inspire pity, terror and catharsis, but in another mood, they might also 
provoke laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Freeman doesn't trace the afterlife of the "Weeping Women" in the 
catalogue, Picasso's Sardonic Sublime casts a long shadow on 20th-Century art, 
influencing Willem de Kooning's grinning women and Francis Bacon's grimacing 
baboons, Andy Warhol's vampiric icons of Marilyn Monroe and even contemporary 
artist Rona Pondick's false-teethed sculptures. (In retrospect, Dora Maar may 
even be one of the original "Bad Girls," a label used to describe the current 
transgressive feminist art featured in the bicoastal exhibition "Bad Girls" and 
"Bad Girls West" at the New Museum in New York and the Wight Art Gallery at 
UCLA, respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Picasso and the Weeping Women" is a great subject, and, in fact, Freeman even 
managed to scoop the grand old man of Picasso shows, William Rubin at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York, who is planning his own exhibition of Picasso 
portraits for MOMA in 1996. With its weird, lachrymose title, Freeman's small 
show of about 60 works represents a new beginning for appreciating Picasso in 
the 21st Century. Rubin's larger exhibition will probably be the swan song of 
the old patriarchal, art-historical approach. 
</P>
<P>
 It is both to Freeman's credit, and a slight weakness in her argument, that 
she doesn't come down harder on Picasso's sexism in her catalogue. But her 
partially feminist approach makes convincing sense, interwoven as it is with 
close formalist and psychological readings of the day-by-day progression of one 
motif, the crying head, during 1937, an anxious year for the world and a 
crucial one for Picasso's art.

POP MUSIC; LET'S POUND THE PAVEMENT; WITH A MIX OF ABRASIVE NOISE AND HIP 
TUNEFULNESS, THE STOCKTON QUINTET HAS CLICKED WITH COLLEGE RADIO, CRITICS AND 
TEENS AROUND THE WORLD. BUT CAN THESE INDIE UPSTARTS KEEP SWERVING AROUND THE 
POTHOLES OF THE RECORD BIZ?

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can call Pavement the Nirvana of art rock, but be prepared for the 
Stockton quintet to hate the title. 
</P>
<P>
 While Nirvana introduced punk to the mainstream by fusing the abrasive genre 
with pop, Pavement meshes catchy melodies with experimental noise for the 
average kid who didn't attend art school. The group's sweet 'n' sour sound 
hasn't earned them millions yet, but it has made Pavement college rock's newest 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew our music was good, but we didn't think it was way up there," says 
Pavement guitarist and singer Scott Kannberg, still reeling from the success of 
the group's 1992 debut album, "Slanted and Enchanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The album made the Top 10 of the college radio airplay charts and was adored 
by critics. It finished second to rap heroes Arrested Development in the 
Village Voice's annual poll of the nation's rock critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really took us for a loop. Now we all have big egos and drive big cars," 
said Kannberg with a bit of sarcasm -- he recently bought a used Saab with 
peeling paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Kannberg sounds about as much like a rock star as Rod Stewart does a starving 
artist. His boyish voice cracks occasionally, and his relaxed drawl pauses with 
the same kind of spacious lulls that mark Pavement's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pavement is not a real band, it's more for fun," claims Kannberg, who started 
the project in 1988 with singer and guitarist Stephen Malkmus. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Pavement's members are so spread out -- Kannberg in San Francisco; 
bassist Mark Ibold, drummer Steve West and Malkmus in New York, and second 
percussionist Bob Nastanovich in Kentucky -- that they meet only when recording 
or touring. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to believe that the band is merely an enjoyable hobby, 
considering the hard work its members have put in over the last six years. 
Pavement has made more than 10 obscure singles and EPs, two full albums -- 
counting its new release "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" (see review, Page 64) -- 
and appeared on compilation albums while cultivating its unique sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's fluctuating, off-key vocals, mix-and-match lyrics, sci-fi sound 
effects and lopsided melodies have won an avid fan base and established it as 
the hottest band in the "indie" world. Major record companies, sensing the 
second coming of such lucrative alternative market acts as Smashing Pumpkins 
and Nirvana, scrambled to sign the band, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Pavement has chosen to stay with the independent New York label 
Matador Records, avoiding the monetary pressure that comes with a big label 
deal. Kannberg also feels that with Matador the band has more control over its 
music and can continue its unconventional approach. Besides, even without 
big-label benefits such as videos and mainstream radio play, Pavement's 
popularity continues to increase, here and abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan, it's like Pavement is Duran Duran or something," says Kannberg, 26. 
"We did this record-signing session at Tower Records in Tokyo and I'd say that 
three-fourths of the people that came were 16-year-old girls still dressed in 
their school uniforms. In the background, they were playing our compilation 
record, which is pretty abrasive, and the girls just sang along."  
</P>
<P>
 It's not just Japan that looks forward to the arrival of Pavement. Australia, 
England, Europe and America will be stops in their upcoming tour, scheduled to 
hit Los Angeles in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Crooked Rain, due in stores on Monday, the guitars still hum like blown 
transformers and Malkmus' vocals still bend into impossibly awkward positions, 
but a clean production replaces the old sizzling distortion, and the songs 
themselves are more fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic melodies are kind of the same," explains Kannberg, "but there's 
more to them now lyrically and musically. 'Slanted' was more punk-rock. This 
one's more classic rock." 
</P>
<P>
 But classic rock doesn't mean Pavement is headed down the road to eternal FM 
radio play and duets with Sting. A career in rock 'n' roll is not an ultimate 
dream for Kannberg -- in fact, it's more like a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to school to be an urban planner, but put it on hold to be in 
this band. Whenever this ends, I'm not going to end up like David Crosby. I 
don't see myself going on and becoming a musician for life because I don't find 
that very interesting. I like to write songs and stuff, but I don't want to do 
it over 30 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depresses me seeing these old rockers doing it. The music they put out is 
so terrible. Neil Young can do it, but, like, Elton John? I saw him on TV the 
other day and it was so bad. And Don Henley -- hideous!" 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Kannberg embraced the punk, electronic and new-wave sounds of 
the Buzzcocks, Kraftwerk and the Cars. Devo was a big favorite before he got 
into such L.A. punk bands as Black Flag, X and the Circle Jerks. He later 
gravitated toward independent rock pioneers Husker Du and Dinosaur Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 He met Malkmus in high school in Stockton and they started their first band in 
1985, sharing a fondness for the dramatic mood-rock of England's Echo & the 
Bunnymen and the minimalist noise of L.A.'s Savage Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved away to college, coming home on occasion to experiment with guitar 
feedback and synthesized noise. Eventually, the clamor became the blueprint for 
Pavement. In 1989, the duo spent $800 to record their first single in a garage 
studio owned by Gary Young, who soon joined them as Pavement's first drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio was picked up by the obscure Chicago label Drag City, and after 
several EPs and singles, Pavement was signed to Matador. Ibold and Nastanovich 
joined, and Pavement released "Slanted and Enchanted" in 1992. Drummer Young 
left last year, and Steve West took his place just in time to record "Crooked 
Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Though influences on the new album range from lounge-lizard suave to weepy 
country to coarse punk, Pavement's imperfect execution bonds the disparate 
genres into a cohesive sound. The continuity didn't come easy. The album's 13 
songs were selected from 35 the group recorded. Some of the leftover tunes will 
appear on singles and EPs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a different feel recording this time around," says Kannberg. "It 
seemed easier before because we did it in Stockton and it was real comfortable 
just to drive from our houses, and 10 minutes away was Gary's studio. There 
were no time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go in the studio and whatever came about came about. We never cared if 
there was too much feedback on a song. This time, we had deadlines and we 
actually wanted it to sound better than our other records. We like the other 
records, but we can see the flaws and it bothers us."  
</P>
<P>
 Not that it's likely to become a perfectionist band. Pavement, its roots in 
the do-it-yourself spirit and raw approach of the punk era, has happily scraped 
along on no money, practicing in living rooms and recording in garages. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lifestyle and ethic that Kannberg still holds dear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent in the studio on the majority of 
music these days, and you can make a good record for a tenth of that. The music 
industry has gotten so sick. For instance, we never wanted to do videos, but we 
decided to do one 'cause it might be kind of fun, maybe. They were saying we'd 
have to spend about $100,000 for it to be MTV material. We were like, 'Give us 
a break!' So we ended up compromising and spent $15,000, which was still too 
much, in my opinion. It's not finished yet, but hopefully it will come out all 
right. I'm kind of scared." 
</P>
<P>
 There's reason for Kannberg to be scared. It's hard to imagine a video that 
could do justice to match Kannberg's and Malkmus' lyrics -- mismatched words 
that bounce off one another like mad poetry. "Sleep with electric guitars / 
Range roving with cinema stars / I wouldn't want to shake their hands / 'Cause 
they're in such high protein land," sings Malkmus on the new album. On "Slanted 
and Enchanted's" "Trigger Cut," he deadpans, "Lies and betrayals / 
fruit-covered nails / Electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Kannberg, "I like not really knowing what the lyrics are about. You can 
interpret them however you want. If we used basic words that were thrown out 
every day, it wouldn't be as good as it is. The lyrics are less obvious than 
what the Stone Temple Pilots might sing to you."  
</P>
<P>
 Kannberg is unhappy that Pavement gets lumped with such dissimilar bands as 
those grunge-rockers under the umbrella term "alternative rock." But he's not 
about to begrudge the high-profile San Diego band or its MTV peers their 
hard-won fame, because Pavement's aims were different from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our original intention was to go into the studio and just fool around with 
weird synthesizer noises and tunings," he says. "Not a lot has changed. But 
then again, I guess it has."

COVER STORY; THE STRANGEFRUIT MISSION; THEIR SOUND IS A STRANGE BREW OF METAL, 
PUNK, RAP AND HIP-HOP. WHAT ARE THESE SIX WOMEN TRYING TO PROVE? NOTHING, 
EXCEPT THEIR RIGHT TO BEND THE RIGID DEFINITIONS OF JAZZ AND TO CHALLENGE THE 
GUYS WHO RULE THAT WORLD 
</P>

<P>
 A confetti of sound drenches the northernmost stretch of Hillhurst Avenue. 
Jagged shards of notes -- belligerent dissonance -- interrupt Sunday's rhythm. 
A messy line forms at the lip of the sidewalk, just in front of Art N' 
Barbee's, a folksy-cum-tony Los Feliz 'cue joint, hidden from the street by a 
weathered wooden gate. At the entrance, a woman carefully pins small red bows 
-- like a prom corsage -- onto lapels of men and women in church linens, or to 
the grungy Ts of consciously mismatched bohos. Ears and eyes eagerly angle 
toward the sound, curious about what is fast whipping up into some sort of a 
sonic blizzard this warm afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 From beneath a flower-adorned canopy springs the source of the raucous racket. 
Six African American women swing from free-form metal to sinewy hip-hop to 
their own turn of phrase in the language of jazz. Guitarist Maria Hobbs is 
shredding notes, her long brown ponytail swaying not in meter with the music 
but in time, it seems, with her own interior tone poem. Percussionist Evonne 
Williams, lost in overalls several sizes too big and with a bandanna 
controlling short dreadlocks, pounds out a complex rhythm thicket. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go , girls!" shouts a woman with a short, angular coif sitting toward the 
edge of the patio. She lifts a plastic glass of white Zinfandel in toast. 
</P>
<P>
 Alto saxophonist and leader Ngozi (Goz) Inyama looks toward the voice, then 
nods. This sisterly endearment makes them all smile. For a moment, instead of 
lyrics, there is laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an inside joke, a "girlene thang." The word girl is loaded on the lips, 
taboo for Strangefruit, the L.A.-based sextet that fell together about a year 
and a half ago through a series of informal Inglewood garage-style jam sessions 
that served up everything from kinetic freestyle to warmed-over Motown. The 
term -- and any variation on it from gals on down -- gives them pause. As do 
the brotherly slaps on the back that the boys from the bands -- mentors to 
their journeymen peers -- offer with their effusive verdict at set's end: 
"You're pretty good for girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorylien M. Jenkins, keyboards, 24; Jai Brooks, drums, 28; Tara Thierry, 30, 
bass; Williams, percussion, 27; Hobbs, guitar, 29; Inyama, 28, sax -- all 
resemble the "girls" you'd pass on Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue, the scruffy but 
self-confident ones in denim and Doc Martens (long before they made their way 
onto Nordstrom's shelves) lingering outside of Rasputin Records, cracking open 
CD seals, impatient to devour the liner notes then and there. 
</P>
<P>
 For a little over a year, Inyama and crew have been proudly asserting their 
sonic wild style, circulating their demo tapes and playing at benefits (like 
the one at Art N' Barbee's) and cozy venues around the city, including Leimert 
Park's World Stage and West Adams' Club Fais Do Do. They've enchanted the 
university set and craftily infiltrated non-commercial airwaves as part of 
public radio station KCRW-FM's evocative world mixes and can be found amid the 
edgy and unstructured playlist at Loyola Marymount University's KXLU-FM. The 
ensemble prides itself on its "free-styling" approach to jazz's standard 
repertoire. "We arrange tunes," explains Inyama, "the way we feel them." 
</P>
<P>
 From ambient childhood soundscapes that included fluttering flamenco guitars, 
Philly Soul horns on 8-tracks and the stately strut of New Orleans jazz (not to 
mention an occasional double shot of undiluted punk), Strangefruit has set out 
to create a fetching conflation of metal, punk, rap and hip-hop, and to spit it 
out with a heap of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's grunge-rock-spawned and feminism-informed Riot Grrrls, whose 
counterculture anthems can be heard on disc or read in muddily reproduced, 
self-published 'zines, have nothing on these self-assured women bent on 
reworking (and thus wreaking havoc with) the dusty lexicon of jazz. They are 
fast retooling that lexicon into what they call industrial jazz alternative 
hip-hop -- "not a fusion of," they stress, but "an expression of" their wide 
array of styles and influences and moods. 
</P>
<P>
 For women, the locks on the rock world's doors are pretty simple to spring, 
compared to access to even the fringes of the world of jazz. In the boom years, 
bop, post-bop and cool school combos only saw fit to let plush-lipped beauties 
grace the covers of the latest Blue Note or Pacific Jazz opus. And with the 
exception of torch singers who, when they weren't sealed in sequins, sometimes 
sat behind a baby grand, the circumference of the spotlight remained the only 
real place of prominence. Aware of this history, the members of Strangefruit 
assure all who listen that they simply want to borrow a few accouterments in 
order to create a vast musical region of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But the afterimage remains. Inyama knows this to be true. She sometimes reads 
it in the startled glimpses of club denizens when the members of the band pull 
instruments from their cases. She hears it in surprised hoots and hollers when 
at set's end their musical voices bloom complex, distinct and assertive. 
</P>
<P>
 But their most loyal audiences, Inyama says, bask in the fluidity, the 
unexpected changes in pace and form: the way one might spin CDs by mood on a 
Saturday -- from a Bach mass, to a Monk doodle, to a neo-Beat Generation 
meditation -- Digable Planets-style. Strangefruit's growing cult status and 
devoted followers of varying hues and musical penchants have surprised even the 
band itself. Everybody, says Williams, "from hip-hop artists all the way up to 
older jazz musicians and white liberals. I mean we have young cholos telling us 
that they love us . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "And," boasts Inyama, "that they want to tag our names." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidestepping the inevitable pigeonholes eats up a lot of valuable time. These 
women squirm out of the grasp of labels as if they were steel shackles. The 
musical goals they have set for themselves require the utmost in discipline, 
keen ears and a nose for the new. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music maintains an integrity," says Thierry, a native of Louisiana who 
attended jazz workshops in New Orleans with drummer Tony Williams and 
avant-garde saxophonist Kidd Jordan. " . . . We get ready to play this 
straight-ahead tune, then we play this rock tune. . . . You can follow along 
with it, but it's not like spoon-feeding pablum or something." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's why we sound the way we sound and why people can't lock us down to 
either that or the other," Evonne Williams explains. "Because everyone has 
their own personal music in their study background, a place where they feel 
most comfortable. We mesh it all together and make it Strangefruit." 
</P>
<P>
 The band operates as a hothouse workshop, their practice sessions a laboratory 
to dissect hunches and fuse hybrids. They blur the lines of disciplines, of 
playlists. Like a radio that is stuck in scan mode, their music sweeps a wide 
range of possibilities: the ultra-smooth rap anthem "Bohemian Negritude" 
trumpets nonconformity backed by the steady cadence of African pride; "Maria 
Madness," a hard-driving, thorny instrumental, is shot through with glinting 
mementos of guitarist Hobbs' lengthy trail of rock avant-garde influences from 
guitarists Steve Vai to Mike Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," Thierry says, "we like anything that sounds real." 
</P>
<P>
 There are echoes of eras and disparate environs strewn throughout their work 
-- from the elegance of etudes to rap's smug attitudes. Before Strangefruit, 
Williams, rapping since '79, had been angling toward a hip-hop career. Easing 
into a playlist that borrows more than just a pinch of jazz was a problem for 
her at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the straight-ahead stuff is nice, but when I first got in the band, 
it was like, 'Aw, I hate this stuff' because I had never been there and it was 
kinda boring for me. (I felt) there was not a lot for me to do, but I've 
learned now that there is." 
</P>
<P>
 For Thierry it has been a chance to move from abstracts to concrete: "It was 
really cool because I had done a lot of practicing and a lot of studying and 
hadn't really been able to utilize the stuff," she says, describing her musical 
proclivities as "outside." "Learning how the bass interacts with the guitar and 
all of that, to me the purpose of the group is that we're together to get 
better musically." 
</P>
<P>
 With a sound that dramatically transforms from room to room, from 
straight-ahead to straight-up "out," they've also found that seamless 
versatility has been both a hindrance and a blessing. Even free-form musical 
chameleons have to negotiate at least a modicum of democracy. Not everybody 
wants to play straight-ahead jazz all the time, nor does wandering the many 
chambers of deep house music meet with unanimous approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessarily jazz that we're after," Inyama finds herself 
persistently clarifying. "It's all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's sound perplexes scouts, hard-nosed club owners, and Tynant-sipping 
A&R types, who would like to bottle the energy attractively but are at a loss 
as to how they can fully capture (and attractively market) its effervescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "First they say, 'You guys sound great, but our marketing department is going 
to have a cow,' " Inyama says. "We may seem to be a marketer's nightmare, but I 
also see it as a marketer's challenge. They have to be that much more 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Club dates, like the upcoming shows at 5th St. Dick's on Wednesday and the 
Whisky on Thursday, keep the group buoyant as negotiations continue -- 
Strangefruit is in and out of posh offices all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a spec deal in the works with a production company that will pair the 
band with JMD of the band Underground Railroad (another outfit exploring that 
hip-hop-jazz conflation) for some studio time. There's been talk as well about 
releasing a self-produced EP. " 'Cause," Inyama says with a laugh, "we can't 
get no love from the record company." 
</P>
<P>
 Says World Stage manager Don Muhammad, who has observed the band's steady 
growth: "They've developed very fast for a group as young as they are. Their 
following is amazing, mostly because they are able to blend their music so that 
it appeals to all ages -- a little hip-hop, fusion, jazz. Because they are so 
diverse, I think they'll go a long way. Their (popularity) grew out of the 
demand for that kind of group." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds: "We've been bombarded with requests to bring in more women. And 
they made their presence known." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways Strangefruit is the logical extension of Generation X's thirsty 
exploration of the many tone colors of jazz. The sextet is not so much a 
"nightmare" as an alluring patchwork: products of supermarket-style record 
stores, the lifestyle-in-a-bite look at the world via MTV and the wide span of 
public radio's global reach, which brings music of remote worlds to our night 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-hop's insatiable grazing through the ages is largely responsible for 
sending New Jacks and Jills feverishly raiding their parents' disintegrating 
stacks of Verve LPs to locate those slammin' samples. They aspire to add a note 
or two of urbane sophistication to their street-tough rhymes. But what makes 
Strangefruit's row that much tougher to hoe are the politics of gender and a 
marketing machine that doesn't know what to do with women (especially black 
women) who play the hell out of "non-traditional" instruments (horns and 
guitars) and don't use sex to convey (read: sell) their message. 
</P>
<P>
 The female rocker has many a time stormed the stage in leather, guitars 
clanging. The Queen of Soul has seen at least a score -- from balladeers to 
rappers -- try for the crown. Neither sexpots nor coquettish vixens, 
Strangefruit, with its members' dreadlocks, flattops and dusty work boots, 
occupies an orbit that no other local combo has traversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't make us another SWV or En Vogue," Inyama says of the marketers. 
"They can't put a 40-ounce (bottle of malt liquor) in our hands and put us in 
some miniskirts, and so they're lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Strangefruit is far from the first to attempt to storm that wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Some antecedents are not so difficult to trace: Billie Holiday, whose halting 
phrasing made famous the torch song from which the group takes its name, 
surreptitiously communicated her prowess through the arc and reach of an 
orchid-like voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Locating the trail to others is a bit more complex. Case in point: All-women 
ensembles like the traveling orchestra the International Sweethearts of Rhythm 
(formed in 1937 by Laurence Clifton Jones) were shadowed by the notion that it 
wasn't just the critics who saw them simply as a flash-in-the-pan novelty: "The 
Duke and the Count took patronizing pleasure in the Sweethearts' success," 
Rosetta Ruitz wrote in her liner notes for the ensemble's eponymous compilation 
released in 1984. "They sometimes watched from the wings and were happy" but 
more aptly surprised that "the sisters could cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 In jazz hip-speak the term cut has a couple of weighty meanings. The first: to 
make the grade. The second: a challenge, to outdo. In their first year, the 
members of Strangefruit can already speak with a veteran's experience about 
negotiating both interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Echo Park-adjacent rehearsal and living space, the women sit around the 
kitchen table playing dominoes, smoking cigarettes and trading war stories. 
Video games bleat in the background. Their instruments lie in a silent heap in 
another room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy I know was talking about some players," Williams remembers. "He 
said: 'Oh, those guys play like girls!' And I said: 'Thank you very much!' Then 
he said: 'No, but you guys don't play like girls.' Oh, we don't? But we are." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know that I went to a gender school of music," Jenkins cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearing up for another week of rehearsal and gigging around town, they most 
times try not to let the gender politics sweat them, and they are quick to say 
that the hurdles are certainly not exclusive to the world of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough to try and penetrate this predominantly male world -- 
period," Williams clarifies. "Whatever you do, no matter how good you are, 
there's always going to be some jerk trying to shoot you down. In this business 
or any other." 
</P>
<P>
 They've chosen not to give into the limits of convention. Still, those in the 
audience expect a voice, a singular woman's voice, to take them through 
uncharted territory, bridging the changes. It is hard to break the mold of the 
sure-throated yet somewhat ethereal torch singer who fronts the band; 
Strangefruit doesn't fulfill that fantasy. And with musical statements as 
sturdy as steel beams, these women are aiming to be hard as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sang what I wanted to scream. That primal scream kind of thing," says 
Natasha, an oboist and Juilliard graduate who has been long wandering L.A.'s 
sometimes indifferent club scene. "They're fabulous . . . because you can't put 
them in a box. As black women we express all kinds of stuff. I like Irish 
traditional music. I love rock 'n' roll, heavy metal, country-western, and as a 
black woman I'm told that I can't do that. When I heard 'Bohemian Negritude,' I 
was jumping up and down in the kitchen with my broom . . . thought I was Mick 
Jagger." 
</P>
<P>
 Their most enthusiastic and unconditional support has come from women. With 
Billie Holiday as spiritual guide, they assign other women prominent places in 
their paradigm for success. They hope to learn from Madonna's business savvy 
and to possess the freshness and fortitude of the jazz "race women" who have 
preceded them -- as well as those who are gigging in the trenches right 
alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of women who are really excellent players, who have helped 
forge the path," Thierry explains. "Natasha is one. (Bassist) Nedra Wheeler 
another. . . . Both of them really have been supportive and really helpful. The 
conversations -- 'Your sound is coming along.' Nedra shoving her bass at me and 
telling me to sit in. Or Natasha offering suggestions about . . . 'tightening 
it up here.' All of that stuff is really helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 But wrestling with the mechanics is only one very slim segment of the process. 
And the truth of the matter is that altering perceptions on the stage is 
oftentimes more difficult than off. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent night the band is primed for a friendly jam session; ready, like 
any other set of young, hungry musicians, to find their way through the notes 
into the farthest reaches of a sinewy melody and ultimately embrace it, then 
finally make it their own. Yet when the instruments emerge, the women feel the 
steady gazes, the almost audible "Wait . . . let's see . . . " stare. A young 
man fronting the ensemble, no more than 21 or 22, begins the jam. The women 
follow the flow. An easy ride. But somehow, somewhere, they hit an unexpected 
snarl. Some dip in the darkness. Then another. They rise from some place out of 
notes in the blues hues. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime afterward, somewhat rattled, the women huddle and reflect. They try 
their hand at reading minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had his vision," Inyama says, "with or without our group." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just really controlling," Jenkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Macho," Williams quips. Then there is the laughter. The same sturdy laughter 
that sprinkled the patio at Art N' Barbee's. 
</P>
<P>
 A little bit ago that incident could have been a setback, a dangerously 
"stunting experience," says Inyama, who is learning like the others to let 
those moments ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," Thierry says, her soft voice rising, whittling it all down to 
basics, to what reigns supreme: "I'm just trying to hang with them changes!"

COVER STORY; THERE'S NO GENDER TO THEIR JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To slightly alter a popular lyric of a time, the past has presented us with 
standard-issue images of women in jazz that are often a little too cute for 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the '40s, all-female jazz ensembles were a splashy novelty, as the 
war effort siphoned off tenured male musicians, spiriting them away from their 
prominent big-band gigs and marooning them across the country or overseas. 
Women who could rise to the occasion stepped up for their 15 minutes: "Pretty 
girls" lifting instruments not traditionally associated with women -- 
saxophones, trumpets, noisy drum kits or an upright bass to keep an ensemble's 
heartbeat. Photo upon photo circulated of young women "goofing," eyes popping, 
struggling under the weight of not just the instrument but preconceived notions 
and stereotypes as well. Most times it was almost impossible to get critics to 
look beyond the frothy dresses, elaborately ratted hair and high heels to hear 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays -- with the possible exception of performers such as saxophonist 
Candy Dulfer, who are often played up as soft-focus sexpots -- artists like 
pianist-composer Geri Allen, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, vocalist-guitarist 
Cassandra Wilson or those of the old guard (such as saxophonist Vi Redd, 
pianist Alice Coltrane, and composer-arranger Melba Liston) have boxed 
themselves out of the limiting category of "women in jazz." They are musicians 
who demand to be judged on their merits as artists first, the issue of gender 
something not to be factored into ability and musicianship. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rock world's Riot Grrrls, who vehemently refuse to be ghettoized or 
trivialized (and ultimately banished to the neat pigeonhole "woman musician"), 
many women who diligently make their way through the jazz world choose not to 
linger on issues of gender or acceptance. The efforts and energy center most 
often on mastering the music, and ultimately the desire to reside at the top of 
their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Most desired is the moment when gender classification will only be an 
afterthought, if that at all. Fortunately, the presence of female players on 
the scene has increased multifold, so that seeing a woman press a trumpet to 
her lips doesn't quite cause the kind of stares, for example, that Clora Bryant 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, 66, who refers to herself as a "trumpetiste" ("It sounds a little more 
feminine," she explains), began playing in a marching-swing band in her 
Denison, Tex., high school just about the time World War II started. "My 
brother had just gone in the service in '41. He played trumpet -- my mom and 
dad were too poor to buy anything else." So Bryant picked up his cast-aside, 
learning her scales from an uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Bryant attended UCLA as a 
music major. But she decided to drop out after two years, feeling too restless 
to just mark time in a classroom when the city was lit up with jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 She became a regular along Central Avenue and was often seen at clubs like the 
Alabam, the Last Word and the Downbeat. She played behind Billie Holiday, 
Wardell Gray and Frank Morgan and pulled out her horn without hesitation at jam 
sessions with the likes of Dexter Gordon. Somewhere in there she also found 
time to do stints with several "girl bands," even sitting in one week in 1946 
with the Sweethearts of Rhythm at downtown L.A.'s Million Dollar Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd make all the jam sessions. And at first I'd hear the musicians say, 'She 
plays like a woman,' " Bryant remembers, "but after a while, they said I played 
like a man -- whatever that means." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, Bryant says, she didn't run into too many obstacles back then. 
Much of it she attributes to her own tenacity to make herself a ubiquitous 
figure on the circuit as well as to the confidence and generosity of the male 
musicians she most often found herself surrounded by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a point to know all the young guys -- Max Roach, Clifford Brown. . . . 
Dizzy (Gillespie) was my closest friend and mentor. (They) saw that I was 
serious," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, Bryant believes, the local climate is a little different, the road 
to success tougher to scale: "Seems like the men are more insecure, (since) 
there are more (women) who are serious. During the war it was a little 
different. We weren't really much of a threat. But now they are intimidated, 
when (women) can take jobs from them." 
</P>
<P>
 That shift, Bryant observes, began in the '70s, "when rock came in and the 
studio guys came out. That's what turned it around. Now that's my opinion you 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand dame of the piano Dorothy Donegan concurs. At 77 she finds, even still, 
that jumping race as well as gender hurdles is not simply frustrating but 
perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double whammy -- being black and a woman too," Donegan says. "Men 
don't want me on the bill. . . . They feel they get overshadowed." Donegan 
believes that it is often a contest of ego and presence. "(The men) figure they 
need me like Custer needs more Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 Donegan, who in the '50s was an elegant fixture at posh watering holes like 
Ciro's and the Mocambo during Hollywood's night-life glory years, also recorded 
for several labels, including Decca, Capitol and the now-defunct MGM (although 
Capitol, she says, was the only company to release the sides). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet still she feels a little bruised by the neglect and deferential treatment 
of others. Despite that, she's had tenacious staying power, still playing club 
dates around town at Catalina Bar & Grill and Vine St. Bar & Grill. 
</P>
<P>
 She advises any woman who decides to develop her chops on the jazz side to set 
up an all-important safety net: 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the education, stay home with Momma so someone is paying the rent. You 
have to take care of more business now, because music is a business now. You 
have to be a showman and a musician. You can't just sit up there, you have to 
start the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Nedra Wheeler's been packed and ready for that revolution. She speaks 
of a change in the wind locally, due largely to the community of musicians 
around Leimert Park's World Stage and jam session nucleus-cum-coffeehouse 5th 
Street Dick's. Wheeler, who quite deftly dodges age and gender pigeonholes, has 
been honing her craft and thriving in Southern California's burgeoning jazz 
scene, a scene many denizens say resembles the verve and spirit of L.A. in the 
'50s and early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler, a CalArts graduate boasting a 24-page resume, has toured and 
performed with artists Kenny Kirkland, Jeff Watts, Cedar Walton, Pat Benatar 
and Freestyle Fellowship. Consequently, she hasn't the time to think about 
whether her gender poses an obstacle. She's instead immersed and busy with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to think about it," Wheeler says. "The music is a priority. I 
didn't concentrate on gender as much as I did on music." To do so, she says, 
"would be falling into a trap. I recognize that there are difficulties about 
most things in life. But I have to continue my journey in spite of obstacles -- 
whatever they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The community within and surrounding the World Stage and 5th Street Dick's, 
Wheeler says, has been tremendously supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those places in particular had an enormous impact -- communitywide," she 
says. And for bands like Strangefruit, she says, the musicians find themselves 
around people they know and have grown to trust. "They're practicing in a place 
where people (care) about the music . . . where people can develop their 
creative ability." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wheeler herself, who long ago digested some advice very much like that 
dispensed by Donegan, despite her flourishing career, she is starting to look 
into writing and teaching as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say it was all smooth, but it's not all sad either," Wheeler says. "I 
haven't had too many problems. . . . And I feel fortunate because people I work 
with really talk in terms of music first." 
</P>
<P>
 Do other things to maintain your art, she advises, and trust those who paved 
your way or steadied you in your path: "My junior high school teacher is still 
looking out (for me)." And the specter of gender aside, "God knows, when you 
are a musician you need all the support you can get."

 Opera and film might not seem as if they belong together. They are, 
respectively, our most exclusive and most democratic art forms. One was born 
from an aural impulse; the other, visual. One has the ability to capture the 
inner world through music; the other to photograph the outer world. One tends 
to operate on psychological time; the other's orientation is more narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet try to keep them apart, so infatuated are the two media with each other. 
The relationship began almost with the birth of film -- amazingly, a number of 
silent films were made of operas, while movies began influencing operas and 
opera staging early in the century -- and it has continued, however gingerly or 
clumsily, ever since. Today, however, the traffic in both directions between 
sound stage and opera stage is practically a clogged freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers film opera and also direct it on stage. Opera directors put film on 
the stage and make movies. Composers write operas about film stars and turn 
films into opera. Opera stars appear in movies; movie stars make occasional 
guest appearances on the lyric stage. Opera is used in movie soundtracks, which 
attracts new audiences to recorded opera, and sometimes even the opera house. A 
burgeoning video market for filmed opera is starting to replace, not just 
supplement, audio recordings for experiencing opera at home. Even the opera 
house itself has become increasingly informal and unintimidating, essentially 
more movie theater-like, with diminished dress codes and the use of 
supertitles, adapted from the subtitles of foreign films. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few examples of what has been going on lately: Herbert Ross, the 
Hollywood director of "Turning Point" and "Steel Magnolias," was responsible 
for the production last fall of "La Boheme" opening this Los Angeles Music 
Center Opera season; the ever outrageous Ken Russell directed Strauss' "Salome" 
in Bonn, Germany, basing his production on the film version he once made of the 
Oscar Wilde play; and the director of German art films, Werner Herzog, created 
a new production of Wagner's "Der Fliegende Hollander" ("The Flying Dutchman,") 
for the Bastille Opera in Paris. Meanwhile, Dominick Argento recently unveiled 
his latest opera, "The Dream of Valentino," in Washington. (Its final 
performance is today; next season it moves to Dallas and also will be broadcast 
on PBS.) 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the most-hyped opera occasions in New York thus far this season have 
been the world premiere of Ezra Laderman's "Marilyn," a literal soap opera 
about Marilyn Monroe; a production of Philip Glass' latest opera, "Orphee," 
which is a musical setting of the screenplay, complete, from Jean Cocteau's 
1950 film; and the first American screening of a restored version of a silent 
film of Richard Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier," for which Strauss wrote a special 
orchestral score and which the American Symphony Orchestra played as 
accompaniment to the projected film. 
</P>
<P>
 And now at the neighborhood cineplexes. One of the more talked-about scenes in 
a current film happens to be that of Tom Hanks, in "Philadelphia," swooning to 
the voice of Maria Callas singing an aria from "Andrea Chenier." Meanwhile, 
Martin Scorsese opened his "The Age of Innocence" . . . where else but at the 
opera? 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of thing has been going on for a long time. The glamorous soprano 
Grace Moore was breaking down operatic barriers as early as 1934, thanks to her 
popular film "One Night of Love" (which, incidentally, was directed by a 
composer, Victor Schertzinger, who also wrote the title song). In the '50s, the 
Russians were filming "Prince Igor" as if it were "Ben-Hur." One of that era's 
greatest Italian filmmakers, Luchino Visconti ("Death in Venice," "The 
Leopard," "The Damned"), was also equally famous as an opera director, and is 
especially remembered for his productions with Maria Callas at La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of factors have come together now to make the interaction between 
the opera and film worlds much livelier than ever before. One is the growth of 
the home video market. Another is the abatement of European art films, which 
has sent such directors as Herzog and Lina Wertmuller (who directed a 
controversial "Carmen" in Naples a few years ago) looking for other work. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, of course, can predict where all this operatic cinema and cinematic 
opera will lead. But film inevitably will continue to assert greater and 
greater impact upon how opera will be made, staged and experienced; movies are 
too powerful a force in our culture not to. The influence opera will exert on 
the movies will likely be far less critical, but it may not be negligible. More 
important is the question of whether the consequences, in both directions, will 
be artistically rewarding or regressive, since there is tremendous potential 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what passes for artistic interaction between opera and movies is, of 
course, nothing but glitz, each media viewing the other enviously. Opera, so 
expensive and always on the lookout for new money, can always use some 
Hollywood attention; Hollywood has the money and glamour but every so often 
likes to justify itself with a modicum of the class and elegance that opera can 
bring to it. When opera is used as soundtrack, for instance, it is often just a 
classier means to the same sentimental ends that typical Hollywood 
schlockmeister composers produce, only better done. Such opera composers as 
Puccini or Giordano (who wrote "Andrea Chenier") were special masters at 
melodramatic sentimentality, and they had no small impact on generations of 
film composers. Better still, they are in public domain -- so the appearance of 
their scores on current celluloid may have little to say about the actual 
merging of opera and film. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here there can be surprising repercussions. One of the most 
celebrated uses of operatic music in film was Francis Ford Coppola's employment 
of Wagner's "The Ride of the Valkyries" in "Apocalypse Now" as arresting 
accompaniment for the helicopter strafing of Vietnam. The scene is shocking 
thanks to the music's puissance alone, notwithstanding what it represents in 
wartime context, given the Nazis' appropriation of Wagner. But the music here 
works especially well because it is the actual music Robert Duvall is listening 
to while piloting his warship. (Similarly, Callas' singing in "Philadelphia" 
becomes foreground, with Tom Hanks listening, and responding, to it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a new production of Wagner's "Die Walkure," staged by Lyric Opera of 
Chicago this season, director August Everding has credited this scene from 
"Apocalypse Now" as an inspiration for his own opera house staging of "The Ride 
of the Valkyries," which includes aerial versions of Wotan warrior-daughters 
lobbing comets as they leap on trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
 But just because a Coppola might use opera music effectively in film doesn't 
necessarily translate to film directors automatically having something to offer 
on stage. In fact, given the contrary demands of film and opera, just the 
opposite can easily be the case, as evidenced by Coppola's own cautious 
operatic debut staging Gottfried von Einem's "The Visit of the Old Lady" in San 
Francisco in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 What film directors do seem to offer is the ability to bring narrative 
techniques to the stage, which can be popular with an audience wanting easy 
accessibility, even if it is at the price of what opera does best, which is to 
allow characters time for reflection. The history of opera is not exactly as 
noted for wonderfully plotted librettos as it is for memorable characters and 
for profound insight gained into the human condition. But the necessity of 
narrative and of visual sophistication cannot be overlooked as more and more 
live opera productions at major houses are designed with an eye for 
distribution on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more successful filmmakers turned opera director turned video 
director is Liliana Cavani, a current favorite of conductor Riccardo Muti at La 
Scala. Although she once, in a forgotten 1977 film, "Beyond Good and Evil," 
depicted German philosopher Nietzsche dreaming a nightmare ballet between Good 
and Evil, she has been far more conventional on the La Scala opera stage. In an 
award-winning video she directs of her production "La Traviata," recently 
released by Sony, she offers an elegant and clearheaded period drama that looks 
just right, in a "Masterpiece Theatre" sort of way, on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite also holds, however, when a filmmaker decides to bring 
wide-screen spectacle to the opera stage, as Franco Zeffirelli has famously 
done at the Metropolitan Opera. Zeffirelli's productions, as Patrick Smith 
notes in a recent Opera News editorial, have become a New York tourist 
attractions on a par with such Broadway extravaganzas as "Miss Saigon." The 
sets, like those of a '50s Hollywood biblical epic, are the attraction at the 
expense of all else. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally an ambitious filmmaker will actually accomplish something truly 
cinematically adventurous and rich on stage, which in turn will look just awful 
on video. In his one occasion of staging opera, Russian director Andrei 
Tarkovsky offered a magnificent vision of a decaying post-apocalyptic Russia in 
his interpretation of "Boris Godunov" that continues the themes of his late 
films, like "The Sacrifice." Unfortunately that production -- created for 
Covent Garden a decade ago, when the filmmaker was exiled from his homeland as 
a dissident artist, and later brought to post-Perestroika St. Petersburg after 
Tarkovsky's death -- has not been well served at all on video. In a new London 
release, directed for television by Humphrey Burton, practically none of the 
full stage picture or the director's alarming vision survives intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area where success is rare is the true opera film. Several attempts 
have been made to film opera on a cinematic scale -- with outdoor locales, big 
battle scenes, sound effects, screen actors lip-syncing prerecorded opera 
singers, the works. A few of the more sensitively and imaginatively done ones 
have been popular, most notably Ingmar Bergman's lyric and musical "The Magic 
Flute." (Bergman is another film director who works periodically on the opera 
stage.) But it always requires a rare cinematic poetry to overcome the hazards 
of cinematic detail, which, along with the dubbing, so often make filmed opera 
look simply foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what really spoils most attempts at making such opera films are the 
sound effects: The enhanced sonic reality is often more magic-destroying than 
any picture, or any off-putting close-up of a singer's quavering epiglottis. 
And so, perhaps it is not as surprising as it might first seem that the most 
interesting and the most radical influence film has had on opera has been from 
silents -- an influence that continues unabated to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual silent films of operas, whether something like Ernst Lubitsch's 
"Carmen" or the "Rosenkavalier" adaptation that extends the plot, were little 
more than historical curiosities. But if they work at all, it is because 
silents can more readily adapt to musical time than can talkies, which are 
paced by theatrical dialogue. The camera can take its time to get long, long 
reaction shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Silent films, one needs always remember, were never silent. They were always 
shown with live musical accompaniment, and frequently shot to live musical 
accompaniment, with musicians on the set providing mood music. (Strauss even 
played his "Rosenkavalier" score on the piano during shooting of the film.) 
</P>
<P>
 The balletic movement, the leisurely time frame, the mime of silents can, in 
fact, be seen as an important influence on two of the most venturesome American 
opera directors: Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has closely studied the timing of Charlie Chaplin, in particular, and 
Chaplin reputedly had been an admirer of Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellars has been increasingly using film or video on stage. In a new video 
production of Kurt Weill's "Seven Deadly Sins," taped last year in Lyons with 
Teresa Stratas (though not yet seen in this country), Sellars continually 
jump-cuts between film and stage footage. Sellars has also gone so far as to 
attempt a silent film, "The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez," starring Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, though without much critical success. 
</P>
<P>
 And two of the most creative opera films ever made are also directly inspired 
by silents. Speaking on an alternate soundtrack of a recent Criterion laser 
disc release of Michael Powell's gorgeous 1951 film, "The Tales of Hoffmann," 
none other than Martin Scorsese describes how Powell shot the film as if it 
were a silent, using the music to control the speed of each shot, but Scorsese 
also emphasizes just how thoroughly he has studied the film and the important 
impact it has had on his own work -- "Raging Bull" in particular. Powell, whose 
previous film had been "The Red Shoes," also relied much upon dance to create a 
fanciful world that cinematically extends the stage rather than replaces it 
with the screen. In a more avant-garde manner, Hans Jurgen Syberberg did much 
the same thing with a highly stylized, Brechtian version of "Parsifal," made a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Silents have even had impact on operas being written. One of the most 
successful new American operas of recent seasons, William Bolcom's "McTeague," 
premiered in Chicago last year, was inspired not just by Frank Norris' book, 
but by "Greed," Erich von Stroheim's film of it. As evidence of this, film 
director Robert Altman, who directed the opera production and collaborated on 
the libretto, made a recent documentary shown on PBS that intercut scenes from 
the film with the staging, showing not only their similarities but that there 
were moments when the opera could be credibly played in sync with the silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a bold approach is being taken even further still by Philip Glass. 
Following "Orphee," Glass is currently setting another Cocteau screenplay, that 
for his most famous film, "Beauty and the Beast." But this time he is writing 
the opera to be performed along with film. While the film is projected (without 
its original soundtrack), singers and an instrumental ensemble will perform a 
concert opera in synchronization to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meant as an opera that Glass can tour with his ensemble, without any of the 
hassle of transporting a production, and also meant to capitalize on the 
ever-powerful combination of film and live music, Glass is proposing something 
that is neither opera film nor filmed opera. Rather it is to be a complete 
merging of the two into a single experience. Look for it at your local concert 
hall next year as we enter the postmodern future of opera -- virtual opera, 
silent and sung.

MOVIES; DARKNESS AND LIGHT OVER TUSCANY; FOR 40 YEARS, ITALY'S TAVIANI BROTHERS 
HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO IDEALISTIC FABLES THAT SHED LIGHT ON DARKNESS 
</P>

 "Nostalgia doesn't interest us, but memory is a different matter," says 
Italian filmmaker Paolo Taviani, whose new movie, "Fiorile," made in 
collaboration with his brother Vittorio, travels into the past to tell a rural 
Italian folk tale that they hope sheds some light on life in Italy today. 
"Memory must be nurtured because coming to grips with the past makes it easier 
to decipher the reality we live in now." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Fiorile' pivots on the idea that we must pay for the sins of our ancestors, 
and beliefs of this sort are typical of folk tales," adds Vittorio Taviani of 
the film, which opens Wednesday, "but I believe the will of man can be stronger 
than any curse." 
</P>
<P>
 An unabashedly idealistic film, "Fiorile" -- like all the Tavianis' work -- is 
infused with issues of class struggle, and juxtaposes the stately rubble of the 
past against utopian visions of the future. Acknowledging the politically 
charged Italian Neorealist school of the '40s and '50s as the main influence on 
their work, the Tavianis expand on the stark Neorealist tradition by dressing 
it up with theatrical metaphors often drawn from history. However, the populist 
beliefs central to Neorealism remain at the heart of their work. Though 
"Fiorile" was recently dismissed by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane as 
being "flawed with a rather broad streak of ideological sentimentality," the 
Tavianis' idealism is viewed by many as the great strength of their work, and 
it's something for which they make no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two forces at work in this film," says Paolo, speaking through an 
interpreter during an interview at a Hollywood hotel, "and it moves through the 
clash between these two energies; there's the negative force of gold, and the 
force of those who oppose it in the name of love. And we're not just speaking 
here of the love between a man and a woman, although that's an important part 
of the film; we refer also to the love of the idea of a different and better 
world. For Jean, the young hero who appears early in the film, the memory of 
the principles of fraternity and justice is very prominent in his mind, and 
this memory represents another kind of love." 
</P>
<P>
 The same could be said of the Tavianis, who were born in San Miniato, Italy 
(Vittorio in 1929, Paolo in 1931). The sons of a lawyer who rejected the 
Catholicism that dominated Italy at the time in favor of more liberal ideas, 
the Tavianis' early childhood was cultured and relatively idyllic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first experience with the spectacle of entertainment wasn't film -- it 
was the dramas of Verdi and Puccini," Vittorio recalls. "As children, if we did 
well in school, our father would reward us with a trip to Florence to see an 
opera. I can remember seeing the red stage curtain go up and suddenly a torrent 
of emotion would be unleashed before my eyes -- it thrilled us completely, and 
when we returned to our little town we'd dress up in rags and play out our 
child's version of what we'd just experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 While in their early teens, the Tavianis' lives were disrupted when World War 
II descended on their small village in 1944. Their memory of the destruction 
wrought on the village by the Nazis was to be the subject of their most 
critically acclaimed film to date, "The Night of the Shooting Stars." The seeds 
for that film, however, were planted in 1946 when they had an experience that 
was to change their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were teen-agers, just by chance we happened into a movie theater," 
Paolo recalls. "Several people were leaving as we were going in and they told 
us, 'Forget it, it's a really boring film,' but we went in anyway and found 
ourselves confronted on the screen by the war exactly as we'd lived it just a 
few years before. The film was Roberto Rossellini's 'Paisan,' and seeing it 
made us realize that through art we can gain an understanding of our 
experiences that's greater than what we derive from living them directly. By 
the time we left the theater we'd decided to dedicate our lives to making 
movies. Living in the provinces as we did, we knew this was going to be hard -- 
we were the sons of a lawyer so we were expected to be lawyers. Nonetheless, we 
made a pact that for 10 years we'd try to make movies, and if in 10 years we 
hadn't succeeded, we'd kill ourselves!" 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we started writing about film for trade papers, saw every film that came 
through town, and saw lots of American movies," says Vittorio, picking up the 
story. "John Ford was the most important American director for us -- we were 
fascinated by the relationship he creates between his characters and the 
immense landscapes that surround them. Ford simultaneously exalts his 
characters and dwarfs them in their relationship to nature; he seems to say 
that although what man knows is very important and wonderful, what he doesn't 
know is infinitely greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were growing up America seemed very far away, and we envisioned it as 
a place where strange technological things happened," he adds. "I remember the 
first time we saw an American -- we ran into two U.S. soldiers on a little 
country road who were part of an advance party, and they were brushing their 
teeth with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They seemed like creatures 
of great simplicity and strength, and it was like encountering an entirely new, 
oddly childish breed of people. It was wonderful -- American culture seemed so 
young." 
</P>
<P>
 Completing their first film in 1954, a short titled "San Miniato, July 1944," 
(later to be expanded into "Night of the Shooting Stars"), the Tavianis went on 
to release "A Man for Burning" in 1962 and "The Marriage Outlaws" in 1964. They 
didn't begin to hit their stride until 1967, however, with the release of "The 
Subversives," which combined documentary footage of a prominent Communist 
leader's funeral with the stories of four people who are profoundly affected by 
his death. Two years later they completed "Under the Sign of Scorpio," which 
was followed in 1971 by "Saint Michael Had a Rooster," a tale of social 
conflict in Italy at the end of the 19th Century inspired by a Tolstoy story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tavianis didn't make it to America until 1977 when their seventh feature, 
"Padre Padrone," the tale of a young Sardinian who survives a traumatizing 
relationship with his domineering father, premiered at the New York Film 
Festival. "I remember thinking that young New Yorkers would have a hard time 
relating to our story of a poor shepherd who lives alone in his hut," recalls 
Vittorio Taviani of the film, which was their first to win an international 
audience. "But after it was over, many young people came up to us and said, 
'This man's loneliness in his little hut, and his need to communicate, are the 
same as our loneliness in our apartments.' " (The Tavianis have made just one 
film in the United States: "Good Morning Babylon" (1987), the story of two 
Italian artisans who come to America to work in the movies during the early 
days of Hollywood.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Tavianis have looked to Italian fables for source material for the bulk of 
their films, and "Fiorile," a romantic fable spanning several generations of an 
Italian family, has roots there as well. The film opens with a shot of a sleek 
automobile gliding down the highway through present-day Tuscany; Luigi 
Benedetti (played by Lino Capolicchio), his French wife (Constanze Engelbrecht) 
and their two children are en route to visit a reclusive grandfather the 
children have never met. From that simple beginning, the film time travels into 
the past and blossoms into a fable revolving around the idea that history 
repeats itself, and love and money are eternally at war. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a story our mother used to tell us when we were children, and she 
heard it from her mother who heard it through her mother -- it was always 
through women that this particular story was told," Paolo points out. "This 
story supposedly took place near our little village in Tuscany, in a peasant 
hamlet at the end of the 17th Century when Napoleon's troops passed through the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were struck by this story when we were children, and we thought of making 
a film based on it for many years," he continues. "Two aspects of the story 
were compelling to us: the injustice of a young innocent who is killed, and the 
devastating force of money. This story returned to us quite vividly a few years 
ago because Italy went through a period in which the shadow of pervasive 
corruption was over us, and the stink of dirty money was in the air. The 
governing class had made power into a myth and was promoting the idea that the 
only thing that matters in life is getting ahead and scratching out your own 
share of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to try to throw a little light on this darkness by making a film 
based on this old tale about the devastating effects of money, and that's how 
the film was born. In making a film, we always begin with concrete realities 
that concern our personal lives," he adds, "then we break from that concrete 
reality and throw ourselves into the great space of imagination and fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest bit of poetic license the Tavianis grant themselves with 
"Fiorile" is in leap-frogging their story from one century to the next as it 
charts the star-crossed fortunes of the Benedetti family; the linking device in 
all this episodic time travel is that car cruising through present-day Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first images that came to us when we began working on the film was 
the idea of a car traveling from France to Tuscany," Vittorio says. "We 
envisioned this car as a kind of spaceship or vehicle for time travel, like 
something out of a book by Jules Verne, and the car gave us the rhythm of the 
film, which is conceptually scored to the rhythm of a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The central challenge of this film was finding a way to combine several 
different characters and time periods into a single story, and the car moving 
through time and space opens up the idea of a story with various chapters that 
allow us to see the relationship between the past and the present. The children 
in the back seat of the car listen to their father speak, and through the eyes 
and ears of their imagination we see these chapters from the past come to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the oral tradition of folk fable central to much of the 
Tavianis' work, one wonders what the fate of such stories will be as mass media 
gathers ever more steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural legacies always run the risk of being devoured by new means of 
communication, but there will always be people who struggle to defend these 
traditions," Paolo says. "Moreover, a great anthropologist once said that the 
human race has 33 narrative lines that are repeated one generation after the 
next, and what this means is that a story you might invent in L.A. today is 
probably based on an old story. The way you tell it might make it modern, but 
its tie with the past is nonetheless present." 
</P>
<P>
 In talking with the Tavianis, one is struck by the fact that they virtually 
never disagree when it comes to the themes and ideological core of their work. 
One wonders, however, how this partnership actually functions on a set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's often the case that several different people will work on a screenplay, 
so that aspect of our collaboration isn't unusual," Vittorio says. "When we're 
actually shooting, we simply divide the work in half. Say we have 10 set-ups to 
do in a day -- Paolo will direct five, then I'll direct five, because the crew 
must have a single point of reference. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this point we've developed an almost telepathic kind of communication and 
on the set all it takes is a look to communicate that something isn't working," 
he continues. "We're two very different characters when we play tennis, but 
when we're making films we're in perfect harmony. The creative relationship we 
share would be difficult if we were painters, but one of the unique things 
about film is that it's a collaborative form that requires many different 
forces to unite." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurosawa has said that whenever he's shooting a film he keeps a copy of 'War 
and Peace' on his night table, and every evening he reads a few pages, and we 
do the same thing," adds Paolo in conclusion. "Some people read the Bible -- we 
read Tolstoy. His wonderful writing makes us feel less alone, and reminds us 
that in other times, under other skies, man has sought the truth."

<P>
 There is an old Hollywood adage, which may or may not be true, that says an 
actress is more than just a woman; an actor is less than just a man. A similar 
adage may or may not be true of figure skaters: a female figure skater is more 
than just an athlete; a male figure skater is less than just an athlete. Male 
figure skaters tend to have more in common with Fred Astaire than Carl Lewis. 
They don't look like athletes. They are willowy and thin, like Astaire, or 
compact and slight, like Joel Grey. They flit around the ice like sprites, 
spinning and leaping with grace, lightness and, especially, style, which is 
more important than athletic strength. In fact, figure skating may be the only 
sport where a competitor's "technical merit" -- the ability to skate fast, say, 
or leap high -- counts less with judges than "artistic impression." Officially, 
both standards are scored and carry equal weight, but it is not uncommon for 
judges, who are subjective, like dance critics, rather than objective, like a 
track-meet stopwatch, to subtract points from a competitor's score because they 
don't like his hairstyle, or the music he's skating to, or maybe even the 
spangled costume he's wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 And male figure skaters don't have a typical athlete's attitude toward their 
sport. Most athletes train to win for years. Figure skaters train for years to 
win once. All of their training, and all of their competitions, are essentially 
one long warm-up for a single contest: the Olympic Games. The prize is so 
important that U.S. women's front-runner Nancy Kerrigan was brutally mugged to 
enhance her rival's chances (see sidebar). The pressure is so unbearable that 
it has been said no figure skater ever won a gold medal with his or her best 
performance. Instead, the gold goes to whoever succumbs to pressure the least 
and skates less badly than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 After a figure skater wins a gold medal, he becomes rich and famous and is 
expected never to compete seriously again. After all, he can hardly surpass his 
gold medal. At best, he can only duplicate it. And if he doesn't, if he loses 
his next Olympic competition, his gold medal will be devalued. Figure skaters 
may be the only athletes who are so terrified of loss (which propels most 
athletes to their next competition) that they stop seriously competing after 
their biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But they can't actually retire at, say, 24; they still have to skate ; they 
just don't have to compete . So they become, instead, skating performers, 
entertainers, in one of those circus-like ice shows that feature Olympic 
champions alongside Snoopy and Mickey Mouse. They have only to glide onto the 
ice, perform a few of their famous moves and then exit to applause and 
adulation. It is expected of gold medalists that they will trade on their 
Olympic fame for wealth. It is expected that they will become self-parodies, 
that their talent will rust from disuse until, finally, they have to be 
replaced, at 30, say, by a newer, younger gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Boitano might have been such a skater. He won a gold medal at the 
Olympic Games in Calgary in 1988, at the age of 24, with a performance so good 
it may have defied the conventional wisdom. "I had heard that everyone had won 
the Olympic gold and not skated their best," he said then. "I did it. That's my 
best." He has been called the preeminent male figure skater of his generation, 
maybe of all time. And he has been described, again and again, with words 
usually reserved for athletes: "powerful," "strong," "ultimate competitor."  
</P>
<P>
 Which may be why, after his Olympic medal, he refused to do the expected. He 
retired from amateur competition and became a pro (in endorsements, touring 
fees and pro prize money, he began taking in more than $1 million a year). But 
he refused to join an ice show. "Hey," Boitano has said, "you might be 
Huckleberry Hound. I know some guys who were champions, and they were in these, 
like, loincloths. Can you imagine coming out in a loincloth every night? I'd be 
out of place. There'd be fluff ahead and fluff behind." 
</P>
<P>
 So, instead, Boitano created his own ice shows, some with female counterpart 
Katarina Witt (who had defied custom and returned for a risky shot at a second 
gold medal -- and won). At the time, Witt was appearing in a show called 
"Holiday on Ice." It required that she float above the rink in a hot-air 
balloon. "Please," she cried to Boitano on the phone. "Get me out of this!" 
Together, they created performances that Boitano considered "athletic 
entertainment." Time magazine deemed one of them, "Skating II," "an ice show 
for thinking adults." Another, "Carmen" on ice, won them both Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that wasn't enough for Boitano. "He had a hard time leaving the world 
of competition," says his coach, Linda Leaver. So Boitano continued to compete 
in professional figure-skating events. He won 10 professional championships 
after his Olympic gold medal. In lots of sports, that would be considered a 
heightened achievement compared to his amateur Olympic victory. Professional 
competitions in other sports (the Super Bowl, the World Series) are deemed 
vastly superior to their amateur counterparts (the Rose Bowl, the College World 
Series). Professional figure-skating competitions, however, are often a mix of 
true athleticism and the kind of kitschy, crowd-pleasing antics professionals 
pick up, like ticks, from their ice-show experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 His "retirement" frustrated Boitano almost from the moment it began. He knew 
that he was skating better than ever. "His jumps were higher; he was skating 
faster; there was nothing in his skating that wasn't better," says Leaver. To 
prove it to the world, and himself, Boitano petitioned the International 
Skating Union in 1990 to open the sport to professionals and amateurs alike. 
When eligibility was relaxed for the 1992 Games -- but not enough to include 
Boitano -- he kept pushing, hoping for another chance. "If you're a real 
skater, you'll always wonder if you still have it," he said. "I'd like to be 
known for skating when I die, and I can't unless I put it on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, it seemed, didn't fear losing, nor did he fear that his gold medal 
would be tarnished if he proved unsuccessful in future Olympic Games. "I may 
have the worst night of my life," he said, "but even if I were to lose, I think 
there's a message (in) that . . . about wanting to do what you want to do and 
not being scared of the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Such bravado had already meant six years outside amateur competition and a 
public tussle with the skating hierarchy. It would also mean 18 months of 
grueling training and, finally, an ego-bruising fight for a spot on the 1994 
U.S Olympic Team. But in the end, he did what he wanted to do. Four days from 
now, Boitano, 30 years old, injury prone and competing against the best men's 
field in recent memory, will once again "put it on the line" at the Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 BOITANO HAS WHITE SKIN STRETCHED tightly over a prominent forehead and an 
angular, bony face. He looks like an ascetic, a 13th-Century monk out of "The 
Name of the Rose." His black hair is receding, which is why he now cuts it 
short. Judges and skaters, who remember his long, fluffy 'do from '88, are 
quick to comment on it -- "Brian, what happened to your hair!" -- as if his 
hair, like Samson's, would somehow affect his skating. He has also gained 
weight, which is why some judges have told him he looks fat. He is big, for a 
figure skater: 5-11, 165 pounds. He has the flaring, muscular thighs of a 
sprinter or a split end in football. 
</P>
<P>
 At competitions, when the skaters practice in groups together on the ice, he 
looks like a big, predatory bird surrounded by hummingbirds. Their skates seem 
barely to touch the ice, but Boitano plows forward, digging in his skates as he 
makes huge figure eights the length of the rink. He moves with his head down, 
shoulders slightly hunched. The other skaters stay stiffly upright, their eyes 
looking up toward the top row of seats, like actors playing to the back of the 
house. As Boitano builds up more and more speed in his figure eights, he begins 
to smile, luxuriating in the sheer physicality of skating fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the skaters gets his own practice time on center ice, while the 
competition works out around him. One at a time, they run through their 
routines, beginning to end. When they miss a jump, hands touching the ice for 
balance, they glance into the stands, seeking out trainers, parents and agents: 
the entourage. Then they glide toward their coaches, seated at a long table 
with other coaches, close to the ice, for long words of advice and 
encouragement: "Excellent! Excellent!" says a coach, handing over an Evian and 
a Kleenex. "Just remember to keep your body straight." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when center ice is his, Boitano only skates small parts of his 
routine, 30 seconds here, 20 seconds there, one leap, and then he circles 
slowly around the rink, his head always down, contemplating what he has just 
done. There is no entourage, and on those rare occasions when he stops by his 
coach, they barely speak. Maybe a word or a nod, and Boitano is off again, 
skating in his own private world.  
</P>
<P>
 For years, Boitano was considered "the most powerful and technically exact" 
skater of his generation, according to choreographer Sandra Bezic, who helped 
create Boitano's winning routines in 1988. He was a perfectionist when it came 
to technique -- tight spins, deep edges, straight body -- and the best jumper 
of all time. Sports Illustrated claimed he spent "more time in the air than on 
the ice." Leaver says that sometimes he'd lose points with judges because "he 
jumps so easily." At the World Championships in '83, Boitano became the first 
male figure skater ever to successfully complete six different triple jumps in 
competition. He finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, Boitano skated like a robot. Which means that, however 
graceful his deep edges, he wasn't an artist . He was "stiff," says Bezic. "He 
didn't give his heart." Instead, Boitano preferred to win on purely athletic 
grounds. And he did win. He was four-time U.S. champion and defending gold 
medalist going into the World Championships in 1987, the prelude to the '88 
Olympics, when he lost in a crushingly close battle with Canadian champ Brian 
Orser. "The judges want what they want," Boitano said then. "I want what I can 
give." For 1988, Boitano hired Bezic, who designed a routine for him that, 
according to her, allowed him to "hide behind a character" as a town bully and 
a Napoleonic soldier. ("Sandra had a hard time making me arrogant," he says.) 
For the first time in his career, the skating world was talking about Boitano's 
powers of interpretation, his emotion. In Calgary, against Orser, the 
Napoleonic soldier struck gold. 
</P>
<P>
 After his Olympic victory, Boitano was more resigned to making his peace with 
the judges. "I learned to ask their opinion," he says. "That's the way life 
works."  
</P>
<P>
 But Brian was not so acquiescent when it came to the skating establishment's 
refusal to allow him back into amateur competition. In 1990, the International 
Skating Union ruled on the pro question, making some, but not all, 
professionals eligible again. Any skater, like Boitano, who had participated in 
non-sanctioned competition was still barred. Boitano made no secret of his 
frustration and his sense of betrayal. "I didn't pound on tables," he says now, 
"but I constantly began to talk to the press about this." 
</P>
<P>
 In a column in Newsweek in 1991, he explained why he didn't just stay an 
amateur in order to compete: "My family had generously supported me for 16 
years. It was time to stop relying on them." But he also made it clear that he 
had expected to be able to skate in the next Olympics anyway. "ISU officials 
assured me," he wrote, "that my career path would not bar me from entering the 
Olympics when eligibility requirements were relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, most observers thought that the sidelined 
Boitano could have won another gold medal and added some much-needed luster to 
a ho-hum American team. "The talk from everyone was that I was skating so well, 
I would have won the '92 Olympics," he says. A few months later, the ISU 
revised its regulations again, allowing all professionals to regain their 
amateur eligibility. The press quickly termed it "the Boitano Rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the skating world celebrated. American Mark Mitchell, silver 
medalist in the '93 U.S. Nationals, and Canadian champion Kurt Browning, who 
had placed a dismal sixth in Albertville, complained publicly that Boitano had 
already had his shot at Olympic glory (and the wealth and fame it brought), so 
now it was their turn. Boitano's desire to return to Olympic skating "rubs a 
few people the wrong way," said Scott Hamilton, a U.S. gold medalist in '84. 
"He might take a spot away from somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano responded, "This is not a dance recital, it's a competition. If they 
want to win the spot, then defeat me." 
</P>
<P>
 In June of '93, Boitano's application for reinstatement was officially 
accepted. In order to make the U.S. Olympic team, he would need to come in 
first or second at the U.S. Championships in January. Bezic again would be his 
choreographer. By then, Leaver, Bezic and Boitano had already tried out the 
short program that he would take to the nationals and, they hoped, to Norway. 
(Skaters perform two routines in competition, a "technical" or "short" program 
that must include prescribed moves, and a 4 1/2-minute "long" or "free" 
program, worth two-thirds of the final score, that is almost entirely of their 
own devising.) 
</P>
<P>
 They were also at work on a new long program, and, once again, they settled on 
a character for him to play, but this time it wasn't much of a stretch. To 
Aaron Copland's "Appalachian Spring" and "Lincoln Portrait," Boitano portrays 
an American pioneer -- "It's the story of going west," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the story of a pioneering skater? "I'm playing myself," he says. "In the 
slow middle part, I fold my arms in front of my chest, surveying all my hard 
work. I'm proud of what I see. As far as my skating, this routine allows me to 
hit a lot of triple jump combinations. The bottom line with all athletes is, 
they have to hit the triples." Boitano always comes back to the jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Skate America in Dallas in October was Boitano's first warm-up for the 
Nationals, and his first amateur competition since March, 1988. He came in 
second to Viktor Petrenko, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist, but he was 
definitely back. (The Nationals "seem like little more than a formality," said 
the press.) Then at the U.S. Pro-Am Figure Skating Challenge in Philadelphia in 
December, his final warm-up before the Nationals, Boitano blew away the 
admittedly spotty competition, amassing the most points of anyone in the event 
and landing six triple jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the showmanship that might be expected at a pro-am event, Boitano's 
muscular and more serious style stood out clearly. No spangles for him; he took 
to the ice in tights and a billowing silk shirt, both in basic black for the 
crucial long program. And while his competition mugged for the crowd (Scott 
Hamilton hit his signature back flip and greeted his coach with a high five), 
Boitano held onto a game face, breaking it only when he took his bows, as the 
applause -- a little grudging after the antics of the others -- turned into a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who took second place in the competition, answered as many questions 
about Boitano's comeback as his own performance. "He seemed nervous," Hamilton 
told reporters. "He has nothing to be nervous about. Jumps are the do or die, 
and he's the best jumper I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Russian coach sniffed: "All Brian does is jump. Today, all the other 
skaters can jump. It isn't so special anymore. (In Norway), the others will 
beat him on artistic expression."  
</P>
<P>
 When Boitano stood in front of the press microphones, the reporters went into 
attack mode. At Skate America, midway through his long program, he had included 
a spread-eagle that took him from one end of the rink to the other. In 
Philadelphia, that gliding move was interrupted with yet another jump. One 
reporter asked why he made the change. Boitano began to answer, then stopped. 
"I want to get it right," he said in his soft, slightly spacey voice. "The 
judges suggested I put another jump in the slow middle of my performance. I'm 
willing to play by their rules. I mean, am I going to make a statement, or 
win?" 
</P>
<P>
 They asked him about his nagging injuries -- groin, hip, knee, back. "It's 
just about pain, not loss of strength," he said. "I don't worry about them, or 
the competition. I just concentrate on doing my own thing, on staying in my 
bubble of concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, without prompting, he went on. "I have control over that voice 
inside me that makes me nervous," he offered. "Oh my God, yes, I'm nervous. I'm 
nervous! The competition at the Nationals is going to be great ! They're all 
great ! But I won't chicken out. I won't not take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 LINDA LEAVER IS LATE. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO arrive at the Iceland skating rink, 
east of San Francisco in Dublin, Calif., 45 minutes ago to answer questions 
about Boitano. Instead, the rink is deserted, except for a lone hockey player, 
a teen-age boy skating past a sign on the wall that reads "Home of Brian 
Boitano, 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist." 
</P>
<P>
 When Leaver finally shows up with Boitano, she offers this apology: "I had to 
wait in line for Brian's Christmas present." She is smiling, as if all the 
world revolved around her protege.  
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, who has been doing calisthenics in the lobby, looks over, annoyed, 
and begins lacing up his skates. "Linda, you talk while I practice on my own," 
he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Boitano was 8 years old when his mother took him to an Ice Follies show in San 
Francisco, north of their hometown of Sunnyvale. Soon after, Boitano abandoned 
his roller skates and went to the Sunnyvale Ice Palace, where he met Leaver. 
After their first lesson, Leaver went home and told her husband, "One day Brian 
will be a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Leaver and Boitano is an odd one in the 
figure-skating world. She is less his Svengali than his junior partner. When 
they first met, Leaver did not have the background of most other high-powered 
coaches, many of whom were once champions. She had given up skating in college 
to devote herself to her family and coaching at the ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I had any reputation as a coach when I met Brian," she says 
today. "But Brian was so coachable. He told you honestly what his fears were. 
He builds his own set of standards and tries to equal or succeed them. And he 
has a love for skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano calls Leaver the most technically expert figure-skating coach in the 
world, and more. "She's the best," he says. "She doesn't tell me what to do, 
she tries to make me be independent." It started when he was a youngster. "I'd 
say, 'Tell me, Linda. I'm scared to death.' And she'd say, 'You'll know what to 
do when you're out there.' " It wasn't long before he internalized her 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship has its sore spots, however. Off the ice, she insists on 
doing everything, from coaching to making airplane reservations to organizing 
his fan club. Sometimes she overextends herself, as she did this day. "When she 
messes up," Boitano says, "I tell her to get an assistant, but she won't. She 
just promises it won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 While Boitano skates his routine, Leaver keeps glancing at him. "Maybe some 
skaters have caught up to Brian's jumping," she says. "But people take his 
jumping for granted now. He's constantly being compared to himself. They expect 
him to do things he hasn't done before. Oh! Look at that! A triple axel. 
Awesome! 
</P>
<P>
 "At 14," she resumes, "all Brian wanted to do was go fast and jump. I told 
people he had creativity and it would come out in time. Now, he's just right. 
Look! See the way his hands float up instead of just coming up. He feels the 
music now. I can feel what he feels on the ice. He's gone that next step from 
just jumping. He still sends chills down my spine," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Boitano finishes, after an hour and a half, his face is flushed. "Oh, I 
had a great time," he says. "I felt strong." He has changed into his usual 
off-ice uniform: sneakers, a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes and baggy 
sweats. He heads for his car, a white Volkswagen, and the 40-minute drive to 
San Francisco, where he lives. This afternoon, he has appointments with an 
acupuncturist and a physical therapist. On the drive, he talks about his 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in this perfect suburban town," he says of Sunnyvale. "All these 
tract homes." Boitano is the youngest of four children. His father, Lew, is a 
dapper, gray-haired retired banker. His mother, Donna, worked briefly as a 
bridal consultant. "It was so typical," Boitano laughs. "But I had a great 
childhood. I was very independent and had a great imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Some articles claim Boitano spent most of his childhood in his room, spinning 
out fantasies, as if to presage his life as a figure skater. The lonely, 
misunderstood artist. But Boitano says those stories are not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a typical boy," he says. "I played Little League baseball. My father 
was the coach. He wanted me to be a baseball player, too. He never showed it, 
but I always felt he was disappointed when I became a skater."  
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to envision the dreams Lew Boitano had for his son. In his 
youth, Boitano Sr. had played professional ball for the minor-league San Jose 
Bees. So he and his son played catch -- a Norman Rockwell painting, dad tossing 
the ball, his son catching it and firing it back. Only Brian Boitano, one can 
imagine, did not fire it back the way his father hoped, and his father realized 
his dreams for his son would go unfulfilled.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something different," says Boitano. "On my own, where I 
couldn't bank on teammates to help me through. I wanted something that relied 
on speed and power. You know, jumping on the ice is like flying at 35 m.p.h., 
except that you're in control." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his father's disappointments, Boitano has always claimed he had the 
perfect skating parents, supportive but unobtrusive. They couldn't wait for him 
to drive so he could chauffeur himself to the rink. They treated his skating 
with the benign neglect of people who did not understand it. To this day, they 
rarely attend competitions (although they will travel to Lillehammer), and they 
decline to be interviewed about their son's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano began to make a name for himself as a teen-age skater (his first 
victory was when he was 8, in a "pixie derby boys" competition). As he 
progressed, Boitano began to resent all the criticisms that he was just a 
technical, proficient, powerful skater, without artistry. "If I was a robot on 
the ice," he says, "it was because I let them make me into one. I was naturally 
passionate, but I could see passionate people weren't making it in skating. 
They don't let you have any joy." He pauses, then adds, "No, that's wrong. You 
don't let yourself have any joy. I had to be a robot because what I was trying 
to do needed to be so technical. I wish I was more passionate in life, but I 
let skating take that away from me. The judges were hard on me. They were hard 
on everybody. When I was 14, a judge told me I'd never make it. This invades 
your psyche. You re-evaluate yourself. Why am I doing this? Money? Fame? I 
searched my soul. Finally, I realized I was doing it because I was good at it 
and I loved it."  
</P>
<P>
 Boitano loves to talk. Since his Olympic training began, Leaver has been 
warning the press away from her charge, so as not to impair his concentration 
or compromise his training. When she shooed him past a writer at the hotel 
during the Philadelphia competition, Boitano sent her back a few minutes later 
to invite the writer to join him and his parents for breakfast. Lew Boitano 
talked golf ("Oh puh -leeze," Boitano said, "you play 36 holes for what?"). 
While his mother sat unsmiling, Boitano leaned over the table and whispered to 
the writer, " So , you interviewed Traci Lords. When my parents aren't around, 
you've got to tell me all about her." He grinned, rubbed the palms of his hand 
together, shoved them between his knees: a typical Boitano gesture. When he 
gets excited, like a child, he can't contain himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to say, 'Oh my God! He's the best!' " he says without guile. 
"But I don't want to be treated like a star. Ugh. I hate that. Glitz and all 
that celebrity. You know, people in the Green Room vying for attention. 'I'm a 
really simple person, even though I make a lot of money, blah blah blah.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For virtually all of his life, he has focused totally on skating. Walking 
along a street in San Francisco's North Beach one night, searching for an 
after-dinner espresso, Boitano mentions that someday he would like to open a 
restaurant. But when? He's too busy -- skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a seat at a crowded sidewalk coffeehouse, Boitano goes unrecognized. 
Once the espresso is served, he begins to talk about his insecurities, his 
dreams. He's afraid he's devoted so much of his life to sport that he's missed 
out on a formal education. "But I know a lot of guys with a college education, 
and they're still clueless." 
</P>
<P>
 And he spins dreams much wilder than owning a restaurant. "I'd like to buy a 
ranch in the Napa Valley and raise animals. Like a zoo. I'd even milk cows." He 
laughs at the thought of himself milking a cow. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's right back to skating. "I'd have my own ice rink," he says, "and 
after I chased the cows off the ice, I'd skate for my friends. I could do it on 
my own terms. As an athlete, not an artist. I don't consider myself an artist, 
but an athlete. I could have been a sprinter. It's all in the heart. Most other 
figure skaters couldn't be anything but skaters. I'm an athlete who happened to 
skate. The judges say I'm not artistically the best. But when I hit a triple 
jump and they say it's beautiful, I go, 'Ha! There!' I please myself. God, 
sometimes I wish I was a little guy. They're so light and quick. I'm too big. I 
hit the ice like a ton of bricks." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs, then says seriously, "What I'm trying to do with my skating is show 
the more masculine side of figure skating. That's why I never wear costumes. 
It's not athletic to wear beads."  
</P>
<P>
 He raises an eyebrow, and adds, "Do you know, Scott Hamilton once dropped his 
pants on the ice? The fans loved it." He shakes his head. "My fans are mostly 
women between 16 and 69. I want to change that image of my sport. I want guys 
to appreciate me for being an athlete."  
</P>
<P>
 AT THE U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS IN Detroit, Boitano is the first of the truly 
competitive skaters to take the ice, at 9 p.m., live on national television. 
The night before, he won the technical program, barely beating 21-year-old 
Scott Davis, from Great Falls, Mont., the defending U.S. champion. In the eyes 
of the press, hooked on a comeback story, Davis has already been relegated to 
second place. The headlines in the sports section of the Detroit Free Press, 
giving the game to Boitano, read: "Who's No. 2?" Some skating experts, however, 
thought that Davis actually had skated better than Boitano in the short 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is handsome, with sandy-colored hair and freckles, and could pass for 
Tom Sawyer. In fact, he was often seen around the lobby of his hotel in Detroit 
with a girl who could pass for Becky Thatcher. The two, scrubbed-looking and 
fresh-faced, held hands wherever they went. Davis' dad, a football coach, is 
yet another father who was reportedly not happy when his son became a figure 
skater, but Davis has come a long way in a short time. Once, he idolized 
Boitano. In Detroit, however, Davis does not seem awed by his hero. He has the 
easy arrogance of youth, no matter what the press is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, in black again, skates onto the ice to "Appalachian Spring" and 
immediately hits the first of seven planned jumps. The audience cheers, and 
then, as Boitano hits jumps Nos. 2 and 3, the excitement and tension build. He 
hits the fourth jump so powerfully, it seems he could easily rotate four, not 
three times, before landing. On No. 5, he makes a barely noticeable slip. The 
audience is holding its collective breath now. Boitano leaps for his sixth jump 
and, in midair, realizes he can't pull it off and performs just 1 1/2 turns 
before he lands. He hits the seventh triple without a hitch.  
</P>
<P>
 He finishes at center ice, spinning to a blur and a thunderous standing 
ovation. At the "Kiss and Cry Corner," where the skaters and their coaches wait 
for the scores in full view of the TV cameras, he talks to Leaver about his 
performance as the scores come up, mostly 5.7s and one 5.6 (out of a possible 
6.0) for technical merit, and mostly 5.8s for artistic impression. They are 
good scores, but there is room at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 When Davis skates, he looks looser than Boitano, more emotional in the face of 
Boitano's natural austerity. After each jump, he smiles, while Boitano's face 
gave away little except intense concentration. Davis' jumps are not as powerful 
or as high as Boitano's, but he hits them all, one after another, and draws the 
audience to him. Davis looks hungry for a victory tonight, and the audience can 
sense it. His routine is choreographed to "West Side Story," and he is right in 
character -- a finger-snapping gangster from a more innocent time. When he hits 
his final jump, the audience rises like a huge beast and roars its 
appreciation. Davis pumps his fist like an athlete who has scored a touchdown 
and skates over to the Kiss and Cry Corner. When his scores are announced, 5.8s 
and 5.9s, it is apparent that he will defeat his onetime idol. 
</P>
<P>
 Late that night, in the bowels of the arena, Boitano is waiting to go into the 
interview room to face the media. Dick Button, the former figure-skating 
champion, now a TV analyst, goes over to Boitano.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought you skated well," Button says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did too," says Boitano. "I was real nervous. There was so much pressure on 
me." Boitano has been telling the world all through his comeback that he wanted 
to take the risk of competition, that it was the opportunity to take that risk 
that he had really been fighting for, win or lose. But now, it's clear just how 
fiercely he wanted the chance and the win. His smile is at half wattage, his 
ascetic face looks drawn. He had said before the finals, "I really want to win. 
If I do, I'll be so happy I'll practice the day after." Now that he hasn't won, 
he says he has no plans to practice tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 When Boitano enters the interview room, he takes a seat beside Davis, who is 
already explaining to the media that he skated conservatively tonight after he 
saw Boitano's missed triple axel. Then he says, "It seemed like a dream to 
receive such an ovation" when competing against Boitano. His coach, Kathy 
Casey, is not so magnanimous. She says she was angry at the headlines that had 
already given Boitano a victory before he skated.  
</P>
<P>
 When questions are directed toward Boitano, as always, he doesn't dissemble. 
His disappointment is clear. "I'm not happy someone else came in first," he 
says. "That stupid triple axel!" 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning, a number of TV news crews set up their cameras in the 
lobby of the Westin Hotel. They are not there to record Boitano's entrance, or 
even Scott Davis' -- their successes and failures have paled next to what will 
become The Biggest Story Ever in Ice Skating, the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. 
When Boitano appears in the lobby, in baseball cap and sweats, he is unnoticed. 
He goes over to a couch and, staring at the TV cameras, says, "Wasn't that 
terrible about Nancy? There are really bad people in this world." 
</P>
<P>
 He turns his back on the cameras, once again intently focused on his own 
skating. He escaped one of his fears -- "cake all over my face" -- by making 
the team. "I proved my comeback was serious," he points out. Then: "Maybe I'll 
do better as an underdog." Boitano knows the competition in Norway will be 
tougher than last night's. Besides Davis, the field will include current world 
champion Kurt Browning, reigning Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine, 
and Elvis Stojko, silver medalist at the 1993 world competition and, like 
Browning, a Canadian.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been my best when I'm in the lead," Boitano muses. "I'm good, but 
I'm not great when I'm ahead. It's just that I'm always better when I'm 
striving for things. Now maybe this will build a fire under me."  
</P>
<P>
 AFTER CALGARY, ON AN EXHIBITION tour in Milan when Brian was skating's king, 
he met another golden boy, Alberto Tomba, the Italian slalom skier. "He snubbed 
me and turned his back," Boitano says. It's not difficult to figure out why. 
Tomba is a big, muscular, handsome man who reeks of jock. When Tomba met 
Boitano, he saw just another male figure skater, a man in a sport he did not 
respect. An amiable man, with childlike gestures, breathy enthusiasms and a 
soft, lilting voice. And Tomba misread all of it as a sign of weakness as an 
athlete and a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be further from the truth. Boitano gives the lie to the belief 
that manhood and true athleticism lie in a host of superficial, macho 
mannerisms rather than in the true character beneath them. Boitano may giggle, 
he may not slap a friend on the shoulder very forcefully, but beneath those 
gestures lies a man with the character to compete purely in his sport and 
excel, for the sheer joy of it, under the most intense, immediate pressure any 
athlete could ever face. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last Winter Olympics, in Albertville, Boitano was forced to sit in the 
stands and watch. It does not take much of a stretch of imagination to see him 
there, rubbing his palms together, jamming them between his knees, not in 
excitement, but rather in frustration. Which was why, later that night, after 
the Albertville rink was dark and deserted, Boitano and Katarina Witt glided 
onto the ice -- two former champions skating their own private program. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lillehammer, the spotlight will once again be his.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's only 4 1/2 minutes," says Boitano, "and you just have to turn it on 
under pressure when the light hits you. You can't make a mistake. You can't say 
I'm not ready. And if you slip and fall and want to get off the ice, you have 
to argue with yourself to go on. You have to say , 'Shut up, for Chrissakes, 
and concentrate."

THE OTHER COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michele Kort

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if the events of Jan. 6 at Detroit's Cobo Arena had not occurred, the 
1994 Winter Olympics might have been considered a comeback for figure skater 
Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan won a bronze medal in the 1992 Winter Games, but dropped to fifth 
best at the 1993 World Figure Skating Championships in Prague. In the rarefied 
air of elite sports, a mere slip in the standings -- especially when one is 
expected to rise -- is seen as a slide of unnerving import. After her flawed 
long program at the Worlds, Kerrigan was caught moaning, "I just want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 But that reaction would be nothing compared to her piercing response -- "Why 
me?" -- after being struck just above the knee by a baton-wielding assailant 
during the week of the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in January. Kerrigan 
had recovered from the Prague setback with the help of a sports psychologist 
and high-intensity training, and she went to Detroit favored to win the U.S. 
title and, consequently, the front-runner's spot on the U.S. Olympic team. 
After the attack, she was placed on the team by fiat. But it was not at all 
certain that the 24-year-old would be ready for the Games, which opened 
yesterday in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical challenge would be the easy part. No bones were broken, no 
muscles torn. And Kerrigan had access to the best rehabilitation equipment and 
methods. Even before she was back on the ice, she let the press watch her 
working out in a pool and the gym. By three weeks after the accident, she had 
started doing triple jumps at her hometown rink, on Nancy Kerrigan Way in 
Stoneham, Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's psychological fitness would be a bigger question. In interviews, 
she has quietly admitted to suffering knee-clutching nightmares and even to 
being startled at a party when she turned quickly and glimpsed someone holding 
a bag of potato chips close to her head. But Paul Wylie, Kerrigan's training 
partner and 1992 Olympic figure skating silver medalist, declared in Newsweek, 
"Nancy Kerrigan is no weak sister. This hasn't thrown her for a loop." And her 
mother, in a TV interview in late January, turned quickly from tearful emotion 
to dry-eyed resolve when asked if she thought her daughter should retire. "Oh, 
no," Brenda Kerrigan answered, "that's not what this family is about. That's 
giving up . . . no way!" Even Kerrigan said that she'd put past distractions 
behind her. "When I'm on the ice, nothing really affects me," she said in the 
same interview. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kerrigan worked to return to form, Tonya Harding, winner of the national 
championship after Kerrigan was forced to withdraw, lost her balance. Harding, 
23, also had been poised for a dramatic comeback. In 1991, she had outscored 
both Kerrigan and gold-medalist-to-be Kristi Yamaguchi to win the U.S. 
Championships, landing a gravity-disdaining triple axel jump, which only she 
and Japan's Midori Ito, among the women, have pulled off in competition. In the 
1992 Olympics, though, Harding finished a medal-less fourth, crashing the two 
times she attempted the 3 1/2-rotation jump. 
</P>
<P>
 As four men -- Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, her sometime bodyguard 
Shawn Eric Eckardt, alleged Kerrigan knee-bruiser Shane Stant and Stant's uncle 
Derrick Smith -- were arrested and charged for conspiring to harm Kerrigan, 
accusations swirled about her own involvement in the plot. Harding issued 
denials and continued to train. As of press time, she had not been charged and 
remained on the U.S. Olympic team but that could change up until two days 
before competition begins. (If she is removed from the team, 13-year-old 
Michelle Kwan of Torrance will skate instead.) 
</P>
<P>
 No matter whom Kerrigan has to compete against, it seems that she can't lose. 
If she wins another Olympic medal, especially gold, the fairy-tale comeback 
will be complete. But even in defeat, she'll be crowned by the press and 
marketers for her Hepburnlike beauty and resilient spirit. As sports agent 
Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert put it bluntly: "She went from an A-minus 
superstar to a spectacular superstar with one whack." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's Campbell's Soup commercial is already in heavy rotation in Los 
Angeles, and the skater took a quick trip here in late January to film a Reebok 
spot, which will debut during the Olympics. Dave Fogelson, spokesman for the 
shoe company, wouldn't give specifics of the script. But the general theme? 
"Overcoming obstacles," he said. Michele Kort

OUT FRONT; A PHOTOGRAPHER FINDS BEAUTY IN EVERYDAY LAWN ORNAMENTS, AND IN THE 
CREATIVE SPIRIT THAT DISPLAYS THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Myles Aronowitz, Myles Aronowitz is a still photographer for the film 
industry. He lives in Nyack, N.Y.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some years ago I took a trip across New York State that brought me to 
Richfield Springs, a depressed little town. I came to one of those lawn 
ornament places, a roadside dealer that makes and sells them, and I wandered 
around to the back where the statues were sitting. They're all concrete and are 
cast by workers, who set them out to cure for several days. They were all lined 
up on pallets, and the image of all those figures just hit me. The project I'm 
doing, taking photos of statuary, figurines and lawn sculpture, somehow clicked 
at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 When you see two dozen frogs and 25 madonnas jumbled together, at first glance 
it looks arbitrary, but then you realize that someone ordered them. There is 
real beauty in not only the patterns but in these odd combinations of icons and 
images from different cultures and walks of life, everything from highbrow to 
strictly religious figures, with the kitschy and cartoony stuff all mixed in. 
And the way the light hits the unpainted statues is beautiful. I've been back 
to that place a number of times, but from that point on, I was interested in 
these things along the road and in front of people's houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Your average lawn ornament is not that interesting unless it's with other 
statues in an unusual arrangement or in a setting that makes you look or think 
twice about what you're seeing. I tend to be drawn to those arrangements, or a 
single lawn ornament in a surreal landscape that makes you wonder about the sky 
and the earth. As far as the people who set them up, I've met a number of them 
and they're -- how shall I put this? -- definitely joyous in what they do.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people actually make these objects by hand and cross over into the 
category of "outsider" artists. In one image I made in Long Island, there is a 
bathtub and inside it sits a dummy with a mask on. It's almost like a set for a 
play, but it's outside and alongside the road. And you're just not sure what 
the intention is. The owner of the house said he changes the display now and 
then. It was obviously very personal, and I think that it was just his way of 
being neighborly and sharing something of himself with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What I see is that there's a creative part in people that wants to express 
itself publicly. In my work, my interest has been to seek out the more 
intriguing and perhaps bizarre arrangements that can reveal a whole visual 
dialogue filled with irony, puns, mystery and humor.

LOGGERS, WITCHES, AND THE DEATH OF A NAVAJO ECO-WARRIOR; ANGERED BY THE RAPE OF

 1. MURDER? -- When the New Mexico State Police finally found Leroy Jackson, 
his 5-foot, 8-inch frame was scrunched onto the narrow, 3 1/2-foot-long jump 
seat in the back of his white Dodge utility van. A blanket covered his entire 
body, even his face. Blood that had seeped from his nose stained the pillow 
under his head and the seat beneath it. But for his shoes, he was fully 
dressed, wearing gray pants and a gray sweat shirt from a 10-K race he had 
recently run. His body was disfigured from days of decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a Navajo environmental activist who made his living trading in Indian 
rugs and jewelry, was last seen alive in Taos on Friday, Oct. 1, at dusk. The 
next day he was supposed to meet his wife, Adella Begaye, at a fair in 
Shiprock, about three hours away, but he never arrived. Jackson often spent 
days on the road, so Begaye tried not to panic. But on Tuesday, Oct. 5, Jackson 
missed a long-scheduled flight to Washington, D.C, where he was to protest a 
recent attempt by local Bureau of Indian Affairs officials to exempt the Navajo 
reservation from an impending federal decision to list the Mexican spotted owl 
as an endangered species. The owl was going to be Jackson's trump. With it he 
would save the reservation's shrinking yellow pine forest. Begaye knew that 
there was no way Jackson would have willingly missed the trip. She called the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, a civilian air patrol spotted the van on Highway 64, a remote 
mountain road. The state police dispatched Officer Ted Ulibarri, who found the 
white van parked at a rest stop about 50 miles due west of Taos. It was locked 
and its windows, all of which were intact, were covered by curtains, drawn from 
the inside. A quick check of the license plates told him whom he had found. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albuquerque, Patricia McFeeley, an 18-year veteran of the state's Office of 
the Medical Investigator, found no signs of trauma, no marks indicating blows 
of any kind, no stab wounds, gunshots or needle pricks on Jackson's body. She 
did find traces of marijuana, a small dose of Valium and, finally, the apparent 
cause of death: an overdose of the synthetic narcotic methadone. Their theory: 
Jackson suffered from migraine headaches. A friend or acquaintance had given 
him some methadone to take as an experimental remedy. About 25 minutes out of 
Taos on the night of Oct. 1, he felt the blinding pains. He took the drug. 
After about 20 minutes, as it entered his bloodstream, he became irresistibly 
sleepy. He fought the drowsiness long enough to find a rest stop, pull over, 
close the curtains, move to the back of the van, pull off his shoes and cover 
himself with the blanket. He never woke up. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's friends and family are skeptical. Since 1990, Jackson had waged a 
concerted and successful campaign to protect the sacred forests of the Chuska 
Mountains against intense logging. He had raised uncomfortable questions about 
his people's financial dependence on the exploitation of their dwindling 
natural resources. Where, he had asked, were the sizable profits really going? 
Although he urged Navajos to "Walk in Beauty," the ancient way of living in 
harmony with the land, he did not hesitate to employ the white man's methods -- 
environmental impact statements, press conferences, demonstrations -- to get 
his way. Eighty-two sawmill workers had been laid off as a result of his 
efforts. More jobs were at stake. There had been death threats. And, just as 
worrisome to the religious Navajos around Jackson, there had been signs of 
witchcraft directed against him, perhaps a punishment for employing the owl, an 
evil augury among his people. Controversy followed him, intensifying as he 
became a national figure in the environmental community. He appeared to be on 
the verge of a decisive victory. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 2. STUMPS AND SLASH -- Jackson was a handsome man, with the sharp features of 
his fierce Athabascan ancestors. Although a full-blooded Navajo, he lived much 
of his life off the reservation. Born in Shiprock, he moved to Flagstaff when 
he was 7, then to Albuquerque and completed high school in California while 
living with his uncle in Downey. He spoke English better than his native tongue 
and had taken college-level mechanical engineering courses, although he never 
got his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 He met Adella Begaye while she was an undergraduate at the University of Utah 
and he was working construction. She liked him because, unlike many Navajos who 
had only lived on the reservation, "he was smart, in a street-wise sense." He 
liked her, she remembers, "because I still knew the traditional ways." They 
married in 1976 and during their first years together, they pursued their 
careers while living in Tucson and Salt Lake City. But after Begaye gave birth 
to their third child, the couple grew disillusioned with city life and decided 
that it was time to return to the reservation. Eventually she got a job with an 
Indian health center in Tsaile, Ariz., a village of 1,000 nestled in the Chuska 
Mountains, which span the upper Arizona-New Mexico border. "It was an untouched 
area," Begaye recalls. "We still had pure water and pure air. Space. Solitude. 
We would go for long walks in the woods. Or he would run in the mountains. That 
was his contentment." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, Tsaile is near the Begaye family's ancestral hogan, as 
the traditional Navajo dwelling is called. The Begaye property is a five-minute 
drive off the main road, at the end of a rough dirt track. The forest opens 
there into an immense clearing at the base of Tsaile Butte -- a dramatic 
outcropping of red rock reminiscent of the mountain that obsessed Richard 
Dreyfuss in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Dusty blue-green sagebrush 
covers the ground. For four decades, Begaye's mother has brought her sheep here 
in the summer. Jackson and his wife loved to sleep out under the stars in the 
quiet seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The human contribution to the landscape is modest: two pens, for sheep and 
cows, made of rough posts, an outdoor cooking area, and the hogan, constructed 
in the traditional manner -- a hexagon about 15 feet in diameter, made from 
stacked logs, chinked with mud. The hogan is a place of meditation and family 
gathering. When Begaye and Jackson's oldest child, Shelley, turned 14, the 
family held her coming-of-age ceremony, the Beauty Way, here. Here they chanted 
the Blessing Way, the most sacred Navajo ceremony, to help Begaye achieve 
spiritual equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue paint marks appeared on the trees around the hogan in the fall of 1989. 
Begaye knew what that foretold: The trees had been selected by the tribe for 
cutting. She was unprepared, however, for the aftermath. When she returned to 
the hogan in the spring, "it looked like pictures of a war zone," she says. As 
far as the eye could see, the loggers had left behind huge mounds of "slash," 
the debris of bark, branches and limbs that results from cutting. The slash 
prevented sheep from grazing, created a fire hazard and blocked foot paths, a 
special problem for Begaye's elderly mother, who tripped and broke her rib 
while trying to navigate the piles. Only stumps were left where there had been 
majestic yellow pines at least 200 years old -- the trees the Navajo call 
"grandfather." Begaye could hear the damage, too. "When you are up in the 
mountains that is the first thing you notice when you get up early -- all these 
birds singing. And that disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the way it is supposed to be," Jackson told her. However 
untraditional a Navajo Jackson may have been in some respects, he valued the 
harmony with nature that defines so many of his people's distinctive ways. Many 
Navajos still offer prayers to the trees when they feel upset, out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson understood this relationship, though he did not fully share it. He 
decided to speak for these traditions, even if it meant relying on outsiders, 
even if it meant using the profane to protect the holy. "Trees are sacred 
offering places," Jackson said in one of his last interviews. "This fight 
against the cutting is in defense of our beliefs and the beliefs of the 
elders." 
</P>
<P>
 3. TIMBER -- The Navajo reservation covers almost 17 million acres -- an area 
roughly the size of West Virginia -- in western New Mexico, eastern Arizona and 
a small part of southern Utah. It is a vast, semiarid tract, punctuated by deep 
canyons, monumental buttes and what experts consider a most improbable pine 
forest, something of a freak of nature for a region that gets so little rain. 
The ground below is rich in oil, uranium and coal. Administered as a beneficial 
trust by the U.S. government, the land provides what little there is of a 
Navajo economy. Like many another Third World country, the Navajo Nation's 
chief local source of income is the sale of its natural resources. This year 
the tribe's budget is $250 million. Payments mandated under treaties with the 
federal government account for $158 million, but of the $92.4 million that the 
Navajos generate themselves, $80 million comes from natural resources revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navajo Nation is poor by U.S. standards. Average per capita income is 
$4,106. Half the Navajos have no running water and one-third have no 
electricity. Almost 75% have no phone. By the most conservative estimates, the 
unemployment rate of the 200,000-person Navajo Nation is 35%. And yet the 
Navajo birth rate is almost three times that of the rest of the United States. 
The reservation's boundaries are fixed, so with each new baby the pressure 
grows to extract yet more wealth from the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navajo forests have been logged since 1880, at an average annual yield of 
about 13 million board-feet (one mature ponderosa pine is about 400 
board-feet). In 1958, the BIA and the tribe created Navajo Forest Products 
Industries, a sawmill that would use the reservation forest to employ Indians 
and to turn a profit. When the sawmill went into operation, demand for logs 
skyrocketed. Until last year, the company logged, on average, just under 40 
million board-feet a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though run as an independent business, it is owned by the tribe, which also 
dictates how much wood will be cut and selects the trees. It hires loggers and 
processes the felled trees into industrial grade lumber, mostly for door and 
window frames, and into pulp for paper mills. Often described as a model Indian 
development project, the company had 640 employees at its peak in 1978, its 
most profitable year, and was the single largest private employer on the 
reservation. That year, it provided $4,248,000 in payments to the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Ed Richards argues that the forest is healthier from this 
pruning. With his smooth brown skin, silver hair and powder-blue Polo 
windbreaker, Richards looks somehow out of place at the mill. He is half 
Navajo, but the other Indians refer to him as belanga, which is Navajo for 
white. "There are more trees now than before NFPI started cutting," he insists. 
"That's because the big trees formed an upper canopy and blocked out a lot of 
the light. We take out those big trees, and at first it looks horrible, but you 
come back in three years and all these little guys are sprouting up." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards isn't the only who argues that cutting down old trees is good for the 
forest and the Navajo. Peter MacDonald, then the chairman of the tribe, sued 
the BIA in 1983 for mismanagement of tribal resources, arguing that the BIA had 
let perfectly salable timber grow old and rot. In 1986, the U.S. Claims Court 
agreed, awarding the tribe $925,000 in compensation. The forest, it would seem, 
was being under-harvested. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson never bought the official line. He believed that the forestry company 
was sacrificing the health of the forest for profit. Alarmed by estimates that 
only about 5% of the old-growth ponderosa pines, the grandfather trees, were 
left, Jackson asked Lane Krahl, an independent forestry consultant, to inspect 
the land. Krahl was then under contract with the Forest Trust, a Santa Fe-based 
group that provides technical support to environmental activists. He calls what 
he saw in the Chuskas "the most intensive logging in the Southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 "The company's goal was timber maximization, profit," says Krahl. "They were 
actually doing their job well. It was just that there were no forests in their 
minds, only trees. And not trees, timber." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Hitt, a close ally of Jackson who works with Forest Guardians, another 
Santa Fe environmental advocacy group, says, "Old-growth trees are an integral 
part of the forest's regeneration system. They stand for several years after 
they die and are home to owls and birds. Then after they fall to the ground, 
they are home to another set of creatures, seed and fungus carriers, that are 
integral to the forest perpetuating itself. . . . If the tribe keeps logging 
like this, they will kill the forest. In the years ahead, there will be nothing 
left but biological desert" 
</P>
<P>
 4. STAKES -- After NFPI logged the Begaye property in 1990, Jackson joined 
Dine (Navajo for "the people") Citizens Against Ruining our Environment, a 
nascent, loosely organized environmental umbrella group. Under their banner, he 
almost single-handedly led a successful anti-logging campaign. He worked 60- to 
80-hour weeks, operating from his cluttered kitchen, his fax/telephone sharing 
scarce counter space with ceramic canisters shaped like chili peppers. He spoke 
-- in terse, staccato sentences interrupted by long pauses -- at countless 
conferences and local meetings. He built a network of hundreds of allies. He 
organized a run for Earth Day. He educated himself in the jargon of forestry: 
basal area, commercial forest base, stumpage, slash. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1992, Dine CARE made only a slight impact. The Tribal Council met with 
its members rarely, paying only lip service to their urgent appeals. But in May 
of that year, Dine CARE filed an administrative appeal with the BIA to prevent 
the tribe from making its next timber sale, compartment 34 of Ugly 
Valley/Whiskey Creek, without an environmental impact statement. Eventually, 
the BIA rejected the appeal. But for nearly three months, a BIA administrative 
stay kept the loggers at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, appreciating the vulnerability of its logging operation, the tribe 
moved to address these new legal and environmental concerns. President Peterson 
Zah met with Dine CARE. He appointed a task force with members of the Navajo 
Forestry Department, NFPI and Dine CARE. The tribe scaled back by half the 
amount of logging to be done in Whiskey Creek, from 36 million to 18 million 
board-feet. Further, when the tribe prepared its next timber sale at Tohnitsa, 
it anticipated Dine CARE's reaction and announced that it would not log in the 
most sensitive areas of the ecosystem. "They had made so many changes in (the 
conditions of) that sale," says Krahl, "that I said we could no longer go to 
court and argue this wasn't sustainable forestry." Most importantly, the tribe 
delayed publication of a long-overdue 10-year forestry plan, possibly out of 
fear that it wouldn't hold up to a challenge in federal court. The tribe is 
still waiting to see whether the BIA will pay for the environmental impact 
statement, which can cost as much as $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson soon drew the wrath of NFPI, which "had led the loggers to believe 
that they could keep cutting like this forever," Begaye says. "When we showed 
that they couldn't, they made Leroy a scapegoat." During the summer of 1992, 
while Dine CARE was holding up the Whiskey Creek timber sale, the company 
warned that layoffs were imminent. The loggers held angry protests outside the 
mill. One sign read: "Leroy Jackson Keep Your Hands Off Our Jobs . . . Or 
Else." At another rally, an Associated Press reporter said, the loggers hanged 
Jackson in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was far from indifferent to the loggers' plight. "Leroy was personally 
affected by this issue," Hitt says. "The jobs weighed heavily on his 
conscience." Friends say he was always thinking up alternative businesses, such 
as a furniture factory, to create new jobs for displaced workers. He urged the 
task force to use timber profits for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 And he tried to explain his cause to the loggers. Just weeks after Richards 
announced that the mill would have to lay off 82 workers, Jackson invited 25 
loggers to his hogan in Tsaile. Some began to understand, even sympathize. 
</P>
<P>
 Although logger anger still ran high, local wisdom holds that the perpetrator 
of so sophisticated a murder must have had more at stake than a low-wage job. 
In investigating the tribe's logging practices, Jackson had discovered that 
NFPI was in debt, by perhaps as much as $8 million. Richards acknowledges that 
the company is in debt, but for only $2.8 million. He says the debt developed 
when the logging operations were interrupted by the environmentalists. James 
Carter, the BIA forester who must approve the company's logging plans, suggests 
that the real cause of the debt, whatever its size, is merely mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson suspected more -- and pressed for an audit of the company. He had 
no proof of corruption, but that would be a natural assumption in light of the 
high-profile crimes that had recently marred Navajo affairs. In 1989, then 
tribal Chairman Peter MacDonald was convicted of taking tens of thousands of 
dollars in bribes from contractors in return for rights to mine and drill on 
the reservation. After MacDonald was deposed, Leonard Haskie was appointed 
interim president. This past July, Haskie was indicted by a federal grand jury 
in Phoenix for accepting bribes worth almost $40,000 from two lumber companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jackson's prodding, the tribe agreed to investigate NFPI. A month after 
Jackson's death, the tribal comptroller issued a preliminary report on the 
financial operations of the mill. The tribe decided that a full audit was 
warranted. The audit is now under way, but it is uncertain when it will be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the implications of Jackson's work extended well beyond NFPI. Informed 
observers believed that oil and coal interests would be Jackson's next target. 
His continued success would certainly have come at the expense of natural 
resources extraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Thal, director of the Southwestern Center for Resource Analysis at 
Western New Mexico University and a resource consultant to the Navajo, 
explains: "What is happening on the reservation in terms of issues like timber, 
grazing and water rights is a microcosm of the Southwest. But the struggle is 
fiercer here because the land use is so intense. The Navajo use every inch of 
their land. But the precious areas have increasingly become of concern to the 
urban Navajos. This burgeoning environmental movement is really going to change 
how resources are managed." 
</P>
<P>
 5. MISSING PIECES -- The case for Jackson's having been murdered hinges on a 
few pieces of inexplicable evidence. The testimony of Dr. David Lang, for 
example. Lang lived across the street from Jackson and Begaye in Tsaile and was 
part of the search party formed to look for Jackson. He was assigned the 
stretch of Highway 64 between Tierra Amarilla and Taos. At 11:30 a.m. on 
Wednesday, Oct. 6, a brilliantly clear day, he passed the rest stop where 
Jackson's van was found four days later. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lang, coming from the west on this nearly deserted road, a white van among 
the copper autumn leaves and evergreens should have stood out like a neon sign 
-- not least of all because he was looking for it. But Lang, who remembers the 
rest stop and can describe it down to the A-frames and the dirt road, didn't 
see the van. If the van wasn't there Wednesday, where was it? And if Jackson 
had died on the previous Saturday, as the police believe, how did his van get 
to mile marker 94 eight days later? "It is a puzzle that keeps me awake at 
night," Lang says. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have a witness, an ophthalmologist, who says he saw a white van at the 
rest stop on that Saturday. Police gave credence to the ophthalmologist because 
he could recall the precise location of the van. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other troubling details. The police found only one set of car keys 
on Jackson, although Begaye insists that her husband carried a second set with 
him. What's more, she says, the position in which he was found was very much 
out of character. He didn't like to sleep scrunched up, and when he napped on 
the road, he always did it in the front seat. She also maintains that he never 
would have pulled the blanket over his own face. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the problem of the methadone. Sal Damiani is the chief 
administrator for the 23 clinics of Beth Israel Medical Center's methadone 
program in New York City. Methadone, he explains, is used primarily to treat 
heroin addicts and federal regulations require clinics to dispense the liquid 
medication in carefully labeled single-dosage vials. The methadone that 
presumably killed Jackson was found not in a vial, but in a prescription pill 
bottle in a dashboard compartment of his van. There were no fingerprints on the 
bottle, not even Jackson's. The only thing the torn prescription label revealed 
was that the bottle had originally contained an antihistamine for allergies. 
There was no information about patient, doctor or pharmacy. Had the methadone 
been in its original vial, the police would have been able to trace it to the 
clinic that supplied it and, thus, to its intended recipient. In short, there 
remains no physical evidence that would have provided leads to the source of 
the methadone. 
</P>
<P>
 The police theorize that an acquaintance gave Jackson the methadone. But 
according to Damiani, patients are given a thorough orientation before 
undergoing treatment with methadone because the drug can be toxic. It is 
unlikely, therefore, that a methadone user would have given Jackson more than a 
single dose without realizing the danger involved. A friend offering it as an 
experimental remedy for his migraines would certainly have warned him of the 
risks. Would Jackson, traveling on a lonely road at night, have gambled with 
his life by gulping a dangerous, unknown quantity? 
</P>
<P>
 On this question of character, his friends and family say absolutely not; 
Jackson, they contend, didn't even smoke pot. The marijuana found in his body 
might contradict them, but McFeeley, the medical examiner, confirms that 
Jackson was no drug abuser: The trace amount of pot in his body, she says, 
suggests non-habitual use. Moreover, Jackson had comfortably used the same 
combination of drugs, Valium and Tylenol 3, to relieve his migraines for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Could someone else have put methadone in Jackson's food or drink, unknown to 
him, while he was in Taos, as friends speculate? Perhaps. Methadone's taste, 
while slightly bitter, is easily disguised in a strong drink. Clinics use Tang, 
but in coffee or beer it would be undetectable. The investigation is now 
focusing on who gave Jackson the methadone. 
</P>
<P>
 A final puzzle about the methadone points to another hypothesis for Jackson's 
death, one embraced by the more religious Navajo among his followers. Damiani 
says that if a person with no tolerance for the drug were to ingest a lethal 
amount, the reaction could be violent. "He probably would have been nauseous 
and thrown up," he says. But the police saw no signs of a violent reaction. 
Medical examiner McFeeley admits that the methadone levels in Jackson's body 
were barely above the threshold of toxicity. She explains that it is the only 
potentially lethal drug she turned up. Some Navajo suspect a cause that no 
belanga doctor could discover. 
</P>
<P>
 6. WITCHES -- After her husband's death, Begaye had a vision in which she saw 
Navajos and white men conspiring to kill him. The white men were paying the 
Navajos for their magic. She maintains that this is how she learned that 
antizi, witchcraft, was responsible for his death. There had been other signs. 
Begaye's mother saw a coyote -- an omen, like the owl that became the emblem of 
Jackson's movement -- before his disappearance. Lightning had appeared over the 
house. And Jackson's migraines had been coming more frequently in recent 
months. A medicine man, sensing some sort of sorcery, had prescribed a prayer. 
But Jackson had not found the time for the traditional remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Witchcraft may seem an improbable MO for a murder. But it is an integral part 
of Navajo lore, and is still thought to have followers within the tribe. They 
are thought to cast spells by giving their victims a poison powder made from 
choice parts of corpses like whorls of fingertips or by shooting them with tiny 
beads made of human bone. By taking a victim's saliva or feces or hair to a 
burial site and praying over it, witches are said to be able to induce long, 
painful illnesses. Some are skinwalkers, who can change themselves into 
were-animals, taking the form of giant wolves or coyotes and running at blazing 
speed across the moonlit desert plains. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinwalkers can also be mere humans who dress themselves with animal heads and 
skins and perform ceremonial rituals. Capt. John Schaaf, of the Gallup City 
Police Department, has encountered these spectral beings on his frequent visits 
to the reservation. "I've seen 'em at night, naked, wearing nothing but 
turquoise beads and an animal skin," he says. "It'll make the hair on the back 
of your head stand up." 
</P>
<P>
 If that skeptic of the supernatural, Lt. Joe Leaphorn, the protagonist of Tony 
Hiller-man's detective novels, were real, his boss would be Edison Begay, chief 
of the Navajo Department of Law Enforcement. Begay has no time for the baffling 
homicides that plague Leaphorn, though. He worries more about problems imported 
from the inner cities, like gang warfare and drugs. Nevertheless, he offers me 
this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, his mother brought her sheep to their grazing ground about 50 
miles northeast of the Navajo capital of Window Rock, Ariz. She woke up one 
morning to find 10 of them dead. Their necks were broken, their entrails were 
spread upon the ground and their anuses and testes had been cut out and carried 
off. Around the pen, she found the tracks of a giant wolf. End of story. "So 
was it a were-animal or a skinwalker?" I ask finally. "I dunno. Maybe," the 
chief of police says. 
</P>
<P>
 More traditional Navajos do not readily talk about witchcraft. It is hard to 
know if Begaye is being completely forthright about her suspicions. Believers 
have been taught that if they speak knowledgeably of witchcraft, others will 
suspect them of practicing it or, worse, that the malevolent beings might take 
revenge on them. Begaye turns off my tape recorder when she speaks of it, and 
her words are cryptic. I interpret her roughly to mean: There are evil forces 
in the world and people who know how to manipulate them to perform wicked 
deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 7. TRADITIONS -- There are 30 miles of rutted, dirt road on the way to the 
south rim of Canyon de Chelly, a vast gorge in the center of the reservation. 
Here, hidden amid the scrub brush and the ramshackle dwellings of his patients, 
medicine man Alfred Yazzie is performing a nine-day healing ceremony called the 
Night Way. The ceremonial hogan is in a dusty clearing surrounded by old, 
run-down pickup trucks. Fragrant cedar logs burn slowly outside. Inside, Yazzie 
makes sacred sand-paintings. No belanga allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the medicine man finally emerges, his appearance is something of a 
surprise: pressed jeans, a crisp plaid shirt and close-cropped hair. Yazzie, a 
former police chief who graduated from the FBI Academy, didn't know Jackson 
personally, but he had heard of the activist and approved of his protests. He 
describes Jackson as a champion of "the old people, whose rights were being 
trampled and who thought they could do nothing about it. He stood up for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yazzie explains that the Chuska Mountains are the male deity of the Navajo. 
For many ceremonies, herbs must be gathered from these mountains and mixed with 
herbs from the female deity, Black Mesa. Herbs from the Chuskas are also used 
to make special medicines for men. "Sometimes, NFPI comes through and bulldozes 
everything and the people who gather herbs are angry, but they have no voice 
with the Tribal Council," Yazzie says. Jackson "tried to be their voice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Navajos need to go back to more traditional ways, to Walk in Beauty," he 
tells me sadly. "To live in harmony with the surroundings, you don't bulldoze a 
mountain or kill a tree for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind us, three women dressed in traditional garb bring trays of food and 
six-packs of Mountain Dew into the hogan. It is time for lunch. I am invited to 
a communal kitchen and offered thick Navajo fry bread and a bowl of oily mutton 
broth filled with crunchy wild corn. The floor is dirt, and I eat with plastic 
utensils, a radio playing in the background. The young woman serving me wears a 
Chicago Bulls "Threepeat" T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Even here, in the most remote corner of the reservation, the outside world is 
omnipresent. It is Yazzie's nemesis, the taunting, successful rival of a lost 
way of life. Leroy Jackson's spirit hovers here, too, regretting the poverty, 
fearing the change. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems now that there will probably never be a conclusive explanation for 
Jackson's death. In three short years of activism he accomplished much -- 
reducing by half the amount of timber taken from the forests and raising 
questions of sustainability that will not soon go away. His death has brought 
national attention to his life's cause and solidified his supporters, who have 
pledged to pursue his work. If nothing else, environmental groups like Hitt's 
Forest Guardians are continuing the legal battles precipitated by the activist, 
pressing to force the tribe to treat the spotted owl as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson's death can only be described as a tragedy. And not just because 
he died in his prime, leaving behind three children, or because the future of 
the Chuska forest is far from assured. The sad truth is that he was winning the 
battle, but losing the war. In a half century, it is possible that no one on 
the Navajo Reservation will Walk in Beauty. Living in harmony with the land 
means giving up too much. And, then, when the Navajo no longer offer prayers to 
the trees, what purpose will the forest serve? As Jackson had warned other 
Navajos, "I have seen the stores in Oakland where they buy tapes of rain in the 
forest. Do we want to be like that?"

<P>
 In David Mamet's "Oleanna," an undergraduate named Carol comes to the office 
of a professor named John, whose class she is failing. The fallout from the 
unextraordinary exchange that follows goes on to destroy his life and expose 
her as -- well, we'll get to that. When the play had its premiere in 1992, it 
seemed to address the country's obsession with the Clarence Thomas hearings; 
now, the Bobbitt trial will do just as nicely. The lessons of "Oleanna" are 
unusually malleable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's high praise to say that the play, which opened Feb. 4 at the Tiffany 
Theatre, is much more entertaining than all of the considerable and colorful 
controversy it has stirred. In yards of news and magazine print, everyone had 
something else to say: A feminist historian saw the play as further proof, 
after Strindberg's "Miss Julie" and Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," that misogynists 
can create great roles for women, while a reporter called "Oleanna" Mamet's 
attempt to erase the brand of misogyny. A pop psychologist complained that the 
play makes people feel good about violence directed toward women, while a 
cartoonist saw the violence as cathartic. A Barnard student said Mamet makes 
the case that men are predatory and women victims, while a New York Times 
critic saw Carol as a woman who fights back and wins. 
</P>
<P>
 This all must be deeply gratifying to David Mamet. The tension and the fun of 
the play come from seeing two people misread each other and hearing them 
mishear each other. Almost immediately they reveal themselves: John is a phony 
who pretends to know the meaning of a phrase and gets caught; Carol is both not 
as dumb as she claims and completely incapable of telling reality from her 
masochistic fantasies (she claims he called her stupid when in fact we all 
heard him say, "You're a very bright girl"). 
</P>
<P>
 With his usual chutzpah, Harvard law professor and commentator Alan Dershowitz 
has called "Oleanna" "an adversarial play about men and women seeing the world 
differently." It isn't, really. Very few women will identify with Carol, the 
wayward student. In the New York production, she was seething from the moment 
the house lights went down. She had the look of a lab animal. She was icky. To 
Carol, everything is an affront -- both being ignored and being reached out to. 
And, in the end, Carol is malicious, militaristic and possibly psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
 No. This is an adversarial play about what many men fear from the modern 
world. Mamet sets John up for a fall in the grand Hitchcockian tradition -- 
he's a complacent, almost bumbling Everyman who doesn't have a clue as to the 
complexity of danger in the world, and who finds out. 
</P>
<P>
 John's faults are more common. He is both frustrated and self-satisfied. He is 
on the telephone a lot, but he only gets to spurt out half-sentences, 
half-words. Someone (his wife!) is constantly cutting him off. With Carol, at 
least in the first act, he can expand and become the pompous windbag that he 
is. He can ramble on to this apparent cipher about his childhood miseries, his 
theories on education. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he shows her dozens of tiny insults, everyday insensitivities -- he keeps 
her waiting longer by taking notes after a phone call, he answers his own 
questions, he makes the arrogant assumption that his confession that he once 
thought himself stupid will be shocking. And that's how he stumbles into this 
minefield of female resentment -- centuries and centuries of it, much more 
dangerous than anything Hitchcock could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Did John make a pass at Carol? There are a couple of moments that hang in the 
air. Most women would have filed them under "he's interested; he's opened an 
avenue for deeper interest," and that's it; Carol's most insidious quality is 
that she doesn't object sufficiently at the time of the offense. She festers 
and fumes, and only later after she regroups with her "group" -- an unnamed 
scary collection of feminist radicals -- does she make an accusation. This 
implies she's being manipulated or she's manipulating him; take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his group, the heads of the unseen institution for which he works, 
is apparently unable or uninterested in helping him. He has no moorings, no 
support, no old-boy network in the great wide world. And that is the fear that 
is also selling Michael Crichton's new bestseller, "Disclosure," and that is 
fueling newfangled resentments from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 When the play was published, Mamet did not take the chance to provide a 
preface. (Crichton, on the other hand, tells us in an afterword that his book 
is like a Rorschach blot and that the value of a Rorschach test lies in what it 
tells us about ourselves. Thanks, Mike.) Why take the mystery out of a work of 
fiction when there are critics to do that? But beyond the playwright's 
prerogative, one senses an impishness, an impulse to exploit the Zeitgeist 
without really contributing to our true understanding, or even to his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" is not about a woman's anger, because in the end Carol must be 
dismissed as evil or unhinged. Did Mamet have to go that far? A playwright is 
under no obligation to fully represent both sides, to create a good woman -- 
how boring that would be. But one wonders why he would expertly raise 
fascinating questions only to have them collapse. And one can only assume that 
something in him loves the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna's" ending is as riveting and inflammatory as the subject it 
addresses. After the final altercation between John and Carol, she delivers the 
play's last line. It is an unreadable "Yes, that's right." The night I saw it, 
the man behind me was quite certain he heard her say, "You're right." He 
assured his wife that this was what was said. She seemed to believe him.

TIMES EDITORIAL; THE NEXT LOS ANGELES: REINVENTING OUR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life is a series of collisions with the future, wrote one Spanish thinker; it 
is not the sum of our pasts, but the sum of our yearnings for what we may 
become. On January 17, Los Angeles collided with its geological past. That 
shattering Northridge quake can, paradoxically but triumphantly, point the way 
to a stronger future here. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special section in today's Times, entitled The Next Los Angeles, many of 
the most provocative plans for the future of Southern California have been 
detailed by scientists and policy-makers, by futurists and regular citizens. 
Some plans would require enormously bold change; some would demand little more 
than common sense and strong hearts -- the best of what Los Angeles was built 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 No city born of a desert can live without dreams. From its days as a dusty 
pueblo, Los Angeles has attracted many of America's most spectacular dreamers. 
Those visionaries' talent for creation brought us the city of today, with all 
its flaws and glory and now entrenched interests. But just as the shock of a 
heart attack can spur a patient to reconsider and reform his life, so the shock 
of the Northridge quake can be a warning and a summons to Los Angeles: The 
future requires vigor and innovation. For Los Angeles the last four years have 
brought a Biblical set of misfortunes, fire and riots and recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But history shows that, for great cities, misfortune can ignite brilliant 
accomplishments. Consider San Francisco after the great earthquake of 1906; 
consider London after World War II. The problems of the cities did not 
disappear in their catastrophes. But the will and the willingness to innovate 
were stirred, in part by desperation, in part by the desolation of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of The Next Los Angeles is to stir the debate and dialogue about 
our region's future -- about its governance and its classrooms, its freeways 
and its industries and the changes they, and we, inevitably face. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent is not to endorse specific proposals but to invigorate the dreams 
and not the despair. By character and by custom, a newspaper celebrates its 
city's victories, shines a spotlight on its flaws, analyzes its predicaments. 
More rarely, a newspaper lays out a set of landing lights for the future. Here 
and in future dispatches, the Los Angeles Times will do just that. Our own 
future as well as our fabled past are intimately bound to this region of sun 
and mountain and ocean. Here we take our stand: innovate or languish. In the 
evolution of cities, as of species, there can be no other course.

<P>
 QUAKE SAVIOR: If your home was seriously damaged by the quake, CalDap may be 
your savior. Who? CalDap. It's the California Natural Disaster Assistance 
Program, and it offers financing to repair or replace single-family homes or 
rental units hit hard by the temblor. . . . CalDap has a proven good track 
record in major disasters.(K1) 
</P>
<P>
 BEHAVIOR SHIFT: Back before the Northridge earthquake, most folks would sell 
their children -- well almost -- for a convenient covered parking space near an 
elevator . . . But since so many parking garages collapsed during the quake, 
there's been a mini-rush for a spot on the top deck and other open-air spaces 
-- anywhere that's not under a floor that some fear could collapse in the next 
shaker. (B6) 
</P>
<P>
 DUBIOUS RANKING: The millions of dollars of destruction at Cal State 
Northridge during the Jan. 17 earthquake appears to top the list of disaster 
damage to befall American universities . . .(B3) The apparent runner-up -- 
Coral Gables campus of the University of Miami, where Hurricane Andrew caused 
$12.5 million in damage. However, if any Civil War era cadets were still 
around, they might argue that the Virginia Military Institute, which was 
destroyed by a 7.7 quake in 1886, deserved the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 ANTELOPE ALL-STAR: OK, so maybe he doesn't rank up there with Denny Crum and 
Robin Yount -- two former Valley sporting legends. But Isiah Rider, who played 
one year at Antelope Valley Community College, is well on his way.. . . Rider 
made the rookie team of this year's NBA All-Star game festivities. In the 
1990-91 season, he averaged 33.6 points for Antelope Valley.

HERMANN JOSEF ABS; BANKING LEADER HELPED REBUILD W. GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hermann Josef Abs, 92, banker who served the Nazis and helped rebuild West 
Germany. Abs was head of Germany's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, for 
many years and remained its honorary chairman at the time of his death.On the 
bank's board at the outset of World War II, he became a member of the advisory 
board of the Nazis' Reichsbank. He was briefly interned after the war but later 
played a major role in Allied efforts to reconstruct West Germany's economy. As 
an adviser to Konrad Adenauer, the first postwar chancellor, Abs organized the 
agency that put U.S. Marshall Plan aid to work. Abs insisted that he had aided 
Jews during the war, organizing the Deutsche Bank takeover of the Jewish-owned 
Mendelssohn Bank in 1939 at its leaders' request. But Jewish leaders continued 
to question his wartime efforts on behalf of the Nazis, and in the mid-1980s 
Los Angeles' Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies strongly criticized 
Pope John Paul II for appointing Abs to advise the Vatican Bank. On Feb. 5 in 
Berlin.

SCOTT HARRIS: THE THEOLOGICAL GROUND IS STILL SHAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Bellue of Hollywood writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you, Scott Harris, for your story titled, "In Stressful Times We 
Question God, but Turn to Mom." It should have been titled, "In Stressful 
Times, Even Moms Should Turn to God."  
</P>
<P>
 Even the "Christian" you alluded to, Lita, is off - base, saying people should 
"be good inside." They cannot. "All have sinned," the Bible says, and "No man 
is good." That's why all people need forgiveness. And that's why God allows the 
world to be shaken up sometimes, to get the attention of people like you.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing about the Almighty: He sure strikes a nerve. Or, if you prefer, She 
does. If He/She wanted to get my attention, He/She succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 If these words seem a bit irreverent for a Sunday, I would only ask that 
He/She forgive me. And it is in the same spirit, a faith in forgiveness, that I 
now return to the traditional He. 
</P>
<P>
 Theology isn't easy, a point underscored by reaction to the alleged "act of 
God" that occurred on Jan. 17. I say alleged not only because there is some 
question about God's existence, but also because some believers doubt that He 
is in any way responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people call themselves believers, but their gods have different faces. In 
The Times' Voices section on Feb. 7, clerics offered a variety of answers to 
the question: "Was the temblor God's 'judgment'?" Some said yes, some said no. 
The reaction to my Jan. 20 column suggests that God is interpreted in many 
ways, which may be why it's considered impolite to discuss religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The column concerned a conversation between my friend, Lita, and her 
7-year-old son, Leslie. In his letter, Steve Bellue cites a headline that 
appeared in the Metro edition. In the Valley edition, the headline was "God, 
Nature, and Shaken Bodies and Souls." 
</P>
<P>
 "How can God let those things happen?" Leslie asked his mother. He wanted to 
know why God allows innocent people to suffer. "Arbitrary" is not a word in 
Leslie's vocabulary. But that is what troubled him -- the arbitrariness of it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of parents must have heard similar questions. Those conversations 
illustrate the struggle we all face trying to find morality in a universe that 
observation suggests is utterly amoral. 
</P>
<P>
 Lita essentially told her son that "God is tired from bad people" and wants 
people to change their evil ways. Innocent people suffer, she told Leslie, as a 
warning to everybody. This seemed to satisfy Leslie, who explained to me: "God 
didn't want to do this, and He feels sorry. But He had to do it so the people 
will change a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't surprise me that Lita's words troubled some readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Bryden of Glendale writes: I hope that Lita will reconsider and perhaps 
introduce her son to a benevolent God, not a frightening, punishing one. What 
might Leslie think would happen the next time he has a mean thought or does 
something he was told not to do. In his child's mind . . . perhaps the next 
earthquake would be his fault. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Please, let's be careful of the lessons we impart to children. Whenever we 
can, let's empower them with facts to explain physical phenomena and teach 
morality as a separate subject. We don't want to give God such an angry, 
violent face, do we?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To which John C. Taylor of the Fairfax area adds: 
</P>
<P>
 What I find disturbing is that Lita is apparently trying to promote the image 
of a vengeful and cruel deity to her son under the guise of a Christian 
education. Leslie picks up on the concept right away; God kills innocent people 
in an attempt to make sinful ones behave. This is the kind of viewpoint that 
would feel comfortable with the notion that God created AIDS to punish 
homosexuals, libertines and drug users.  
</P>
<P>
 This idea of natural disasters being a sign of divine displeasure is certainly 
as old as faith itself. . . . To present this tenet to children as a means of 
encouraging moral behavior is to control them through fear.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 These are perspectives I tend to share, though I'm not worried about Leslie's 
moral education. I know his parents, and however God is presented will 
ultimately matter less than their daily guidance and example and Leslie's own 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us, at some point, wrestle with the kind of question Leslie raised. 
God, we are told as children, created Man. But Man, we grow up to suspect, 
really created God. This is a journey Leslie will make in time. Would a 
dissertation on tectonic plates or, for that matter, the AIDS virus really 
satisfy a child who asks, "How can God let those things happen?" Would it 
satisfy an adult's question? 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Lita would be happy to know that other readers seem to agree with 
her perspective of the earthquake, portraying it as a kind of cosmic wake-up 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Lucas of Montebello writes: 
</P>
<P>
 God, in His mercy, is trying to tell us something -- get your act together, 
leave the darkness, choose the light, change our evil ways.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Of everything that Lita told Leslie, the words that stuck with me were these: 
"We have to really be good inside. Because whatever happens, we have to be 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a mother telling her boy about the fragility of life and the 
fickleness of fate. To be good, she explains, is to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready -- but for what? 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, spirituality is built on a foundation of questions, not 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of writing this column, I remembered a passage from an article 
that Dr. Clinton E. Tempereau, chief of psychiatric services at the Sherman 
Oaks Burn Center, wrote for The Times last November: 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a 17-year-old who lost her face and hands in a car fire. Two years 
later, the day after her 12th reconstructive surgery, she looks up at me: 
'Doctor, do you believe in God?' I answer: 'For as long as I can remember, I 
have stood in awe of the unknowable.' She smiles. 'So you're saying 'yes.' ' 
And she drops off to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 One night a few years back, I was asked the same question while strolling on 
the Seal Beach pier with a woman. The question came from a gray-haired 
panhandler, unsteady with drink. My answer wasn't as eloquent as Dr. 
Tempereau's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer just came out. I'd never thought about God that way before. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people will find this answer disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 But if He exists, one trusts that He appreciates honesty. 
</P>

UCLA PUTS SPIN ON WIN; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DESPITE 23 TURNOVERS IN SLUGGISH 
76-66 VICTORY OVER WASHINGTON STATE, HARRICK SAYS TEAM IS FINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repeat after me, said Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with the UCLA basketball team. . . . There's nothing 
wrong with the UCLA basketball team. . . . There's nothing wrong with the UCLA 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Feel better about the Bruins now? 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick wants you to know that if you want to criticize him and his team, 
fine. He'll just cover his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't listen to anybody," Harrick said after Saturday's 76-66 victory over 
Washington State. "Every time you play, somebody has a snide comment or 
something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 His reaction: "I didn't hear it, but I do hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that clear or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a moral to this story, Harrick said. Actually, it is more like a 
moral to this fable. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this job, you have to worry about the elephant: your team," he said after 
his 300th coaching victory. "You can't think about the ants: everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that the elephant won Saturday afternoon. UCLA beat the 
ant, played by Washington State, before 12,017 at Pauley Pavilion, in much the 
same kind of unevenly played game that Bruin followers have come to recognize 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Washington State, 15-8 overall and 5-6 in the Pacific 10, was 
seeking its first victory on UCLA's home court since, well, forever, and was 
attempting to do so without its top player, the Cougars hung pretty tough most 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was winnable for us," Cougar Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "I'm kind of crazy 
and off the wall anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 It did look slightly winnable, even without Mark Hendrickson, who has a stress 
fracture in his right leg and did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Bruins were struggling, Ed O'Bannon said it is important to note 
that they won, just as they did against Washington, and are 17-2, 10-1 in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just won two games, so I guess we're in pretty good shape," he said. "It 
seems like UCLA goes through lulls every year. I hope ours is over." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Harrick, who really doesn't want to hear too many make too much out of 
team that has won 17 of 19 games and is leading its conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyus Edney led the UCLA offense with 20 points, including three 
three-pointers, as well as nine free throws and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon matched brother Ed's total of 13 points, and Ed had 11 
rebounds. But the Bruins continued to be careless with the basketball. They 
committed 23 turnovers, the same number they had against Washington and the 
third consecutive game of throwing the ball away at least 20 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those things," said Shon Tarver, who had a team-high six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had one of those other things, a mini scoring streak in the second 
half, to get an advantage they never relinquished. They broke a 38-38 tie with 
a 16-5 run that began on Ed O'Bannon's 14-foot jump shot from a left-side angle 
and ended on Charles O'Bannon's tip-in of his own missed shot. 
</P>
<P>
 So UCLA led, 54-43, which looked pretty nice, but was nonetheless surprising 
because the Bruins had six turnovers in that seven-minute stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed pretty clear that UCLA was going to win despite itself. This isn't 
bad strategy against the Huskies and Cougars of the world, but it probably 
won't work next week when UCLA plays at Arizona State and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we're going to snap out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State got no closer than seven points afterward. Fred Ferguson 
scored 16 points, but played only 26 minutes because of foul problems. 
Washington State shooters were only six for 20 from three-point range as the 
Cougars ran their road record against UCLA to 0-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon's rainbow three-pointer with 22 seconds left was UCLA's sixth in 
11 attempts and revived the Bruins' recently moribund perimeter shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 As for reports of UCLA's demise, well, Harrick said it's a little too early 
for that. He pointed out that UCLA won despite adding Kevin Dempsey to an 
injury list that already includes Rodney Zimmerman's back problem, Edney's sore 
wrist, Charles O'Bannon's sore hand and George Zidek's sore ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey has an ulcer and is taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his first ulcer, said Dempsey, and it's courtesy of UCLA basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing in L.A. will do that to you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephants are restless.

CAPITALS QUIETLY WIPE OUT KINGS, 6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals didn't march into the Forum Saturday night bragging 
about being better than the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of 16,005 spectators on hand could have told them that after 
Washington crushed the Kings, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours earlier, the Kings, angry at statements by the Mighty Ducks 
that they were superior to the Kings at even strength, had responded 
emotionally on the ice with a clutch victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday night, the Kings showed little of that strength and no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't very good," King Coach Barry Melrose said. "I don't have any 
excuses. It was a team effort. I can't think of any player who excelled. . . . 
A lot of players didn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose wasn't about to fall back on the excuse of an emotional letdown after 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a professional," he said, "you play hard for 84 games. We didn't do 
that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wondering how the Kings, Stanley Cup finalists a year ago, could have 
dropped below the last playoff spot this season, need only have attended 
Saturday night's game to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a team that has made its goalies feel like clay pigeons of late, a 
team whose defensemen too often seem to disappear behind their own blue line, a 
team that does its only consistent checking at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's loss, one of the most dismal of the season, dropped the Kings 
to 21-28-6, leaving them three points behind the San Jose Sharks, holders of 
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings scored the first goal of the night, Warren Rychel getting his eighth 
of the season a little over nine minutes into the game, then gave up the game's 
remaining six goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings had been outshot, 100-46, in their previous two games, both 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saturday night was no different, except for the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were outshot, 15-3, in the first period, 32-13 over two periods and 
41-23 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb Stauber, the Kings' backup goalie, had gone nine games without a start 
before finally getting one Wednesday night. He made the most of it, beating 
Chicago despite facing 51 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday night, Stauber, the starter again, couldn't hold the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington scored twice in the first period, Craig Berube's sixth goal of the 
season followed by Kevin Hatcher's 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hatcher goal came on a sequence that summed up the night for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute, Wayne Gretzky, who had two goals and five points the night before, 
was streaking down the ice with the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 When goalie Don Beaupre came out to challenge, Gretzky slid the puck around 
Beaupre and was staring at a wide-open net. 
</P>
<P>
 But stare was all he could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky slipped as he tried to control the puck, and the Capitals had no such 
difficulty at the other end, Hatcher scoring on Stauber's glove side. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington blew it open with four goals in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he replaced Stauber with Kelly Hrudey in the final period, Melrose 
wasn't about to lay the blame on his starting goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't Robb Stauber," Melrose said. "The guys were horrible in front of 
him."

NHL ROUNDUP; LEMIEUX MAKES HIS USUAL RETURN FOR PENGUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing in his first game since Nov. 7, Mario Lemieux had a goal and an assist 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help, but it seldom does. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sixth time in Lemieux's 10 seasons that he has returned from an 
absence of more than 10 games, and the Penguins are 1-5 in those games, 
including Saturday's 9-3 loss to the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pittsburgh's fourth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux, who said he played pain-free after being out for 50 of the Penguins' 
55 games because of back problems, has had at least two points in each comeback 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hesitant," Star Coach Bob Gainey said. "You'd see a flash here and 
there, but he's a long way from being in game form." 
</P>
<P>
 True, Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't handling the puck the way I used to in the past," he said. "That's 
to be expected. It's probably going to take me a while to adjust to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 5, New Jersey 3 -- Cam Neely scored three goals in 4:02 of the first 
period and goaltender Jon Casey won his sixth game in a row for the Bruins at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, New York Islanders 3 -- Dave Lowry had two goals and an assist as 
the Panthers won at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 3, Tampa Bay 2 -- Geoff Courtnall scored twice and Dave Babych 
scored the game-winner for the Canucks at St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 4, Ottawa 3 -- Mike Gartner scored two minutes 37 seconds 
into overtime to lift New York at Ottawa, which has not won in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, St. Louis 4 -- Darren McCarty scored with 1:44 to play in overtime 
at St. Louis as the Red Wings won their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 5, Edmonton 2 -- Igor Chibirev scored two goals and added two assists 
to lead at Edmonton as Hartford finished a six-game trip with a 3-2-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 3, Toronto 2 -- Gary Roberts scored the game-winning goal with 1:53 
remaining as the Flames won their sixth in a row by overcoming a 2-0 deficit at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Quebec 2 -- Mathieu Schneider scored twice and Kirk Muller added a 
goal and an assist for the Canadiens at home.

AMID THE SILENCE, ROOKIE ALLEN MAKES A LOUD NOISE AT DAYTONA; AUTO RACING: HE 
STARTLES MOST BY WINNING THE POLE FOR NEXT SUNDAY'S NASCAR RACE AS OTHERS 
REFLECT ON BONNETT'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When rain delayed the start of Daytona 500 qualifying half an hour Saturday, 
it was as if the heavens were asking for a few moments of silence in the memory 
of Neil Bonnett. 
</P>
<P>
 The death Friday of one of racing's most beloved figures cast a pall over 
Daytona International Speedway, overshadowing one of the most tense and 
unexpected rounds of qualifying in Winston Cup lore. Bonnett was killed when 
the car in which he was practicing crashed head-on into the Turn 4 wall. 
</P>
<P>
 NASCAR officials, after inspecting the scene, called it driver error, but that 
didn't matter. It still brought grief to the stock car racing fraternity and 
fans who had become familiar with the Hueytown, Ala., driver as a TV 
commentator the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 When Loy Allen Jr., a little-known rookie driver from Raleigh, N.C., stunned 
his elders by taking the pole for next Sunday's 500 from six-time Winston Cup 
champion Dale Earnhardt, it should have brought a moment of celebration, but 
it, too, evoked mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 27, drove the orange and white Hooters Ford around the 2.5-mile trioval 
at an average speed of 190.158 m.p.h. to edge out Earnhardt's 190.034 and 
become the first rookie driver to win the pole in the 35 years of the Daytona 
500. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was driving in the colors made famous by the late Alan Kulwicki in 
winning the 1992 NASCAR championship. Only 10 months ago, Kulwicki became the 
first of three prominent Winston Cup drivers to be killed in less than a year. 
He and Davey Allison, the 1992 Daytona 500 champion, were killed in aircraft 
accidents, Allison in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in shock about the whole thing," Allen said after sweating out 
Earnhardt's late attempt to win the No. 1 starting position. 
</P>
<P>
 It was such a shock to his sponsors that they tried to stick patches on his 
uniform at the last minute before he appeared for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, 42, who has given racing advice to his young North Carolina 
neighbor, was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hat's off to Loy Allen," Earnhardt said. "A lot of people might have been 
surprised, but I knew he'd be fast. I hate he got the pole. I really wanted it, 
and I thought we had a good shot at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who started second (Dale Jarrett) won it last year, so maybe that's 
the place to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, winner of six Winston Cup championships, 59 races and more than $14 
million, has not won the Daytona 500 in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, Bonnett's closest friend among the driving fraternity, left 
immediately to fly to Alabama to be with Bonnett's widow, Susan. Before 
leaving, Earnhardt and car owner Richard Childress, who had provided Bonnett 
with race cars for his comeback last year, issued an emotional joint statement, 
remembering him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill France Jr., NASCAR president, said of Bonnett: "He was one of the most 
likeable men I've ever known. In fact, I don't think I ever met anyone who 
didn't like Neil. Our hearts and prayers are with Susan, David and Kristen." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who were at Ontario Motor Speedway in November 1977 when Bonnett won 
his first superspeedway race, the Los Angeles Times 500, one of the most 
enduring and endearing memories of Bonnett is of him putting his daughter 
Kristen, then 3, in a gigantic silver loving cup and holding her aloft to the 
cheering crowd in victory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Bonnett will be held tonight at the Central Baptist 
Church in Daytona Beach, with funeral services Monday at the Garywood Assembly 
of God in Hueytown, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who emerged as a promising driver when he won the World Karting Assn. 
championship in 1982, also won the pole for the ARCA 200, a Speed Weeks support 
race that will share today's spotlight with the Busch Clash for 1993 pole 
winners, plus wild-card driver P.J. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualifying speed for the ARCA race, 190.219 m.p.h., was faster than for 
Allen's Winston Cup car, primarily because of a more forgiving restrictor plate 
rule. Allen is the first driver to sit on the pole in both Daytona races. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Busch Clash, a 50-mile sprint for $280,000, will mark the first and 
last appearance of Jones in the Harry Melling Ford. Jones and Melling public 
relations director Alexis Laras quit the team Saturday after a dispute with 
team manager Harry Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tested three cars for Melling in January with the idea that I was going to 
be their driver all season," Jones said. "When I got here to prepare for the 
Daytona 500, I was told (by Hyde) that instead of a one-man team, I was going 
to share the team with another driver (Joe Ruttman). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel Melling Racing was ready for a two-car team. In fact, they 
didn't have enough engines and equipment to properly run a one-car team. I saw 
no future for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will drive their car in the Busch Clash. After the race, that will be it 
for me with Melling. I'm doing the clash for Anheuser Busch and NASCAR. It's an 
embarrassing situation for everyone. I want to go out with some class and do 
this for them. The ones I feel most sorry for are the crew. They worked really 
hard to have a good race car for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who will be a development test driver for Dan Gurney's Toyota Indy car 
project this year, got into the Busch Clash when his name was drawn from a 
group of drivers who were the fastest second-day qualifiers last year.

MORNING BRIEFING: HIS COACH DISCOVERS THAT WARD IS TOO GOOD FOR WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Ward, the Heisman Trophy-winning Florida State quarterback, still 
hasn't said whether he intends to pursue an NFL or NBA career.  
</P>
<P>
 A recent check showed that Ward had started all eight basketball games he has 
played for the Seminoles, was averaging 35 minutes a game, shooting 36% from 
the field and 30% on three-pointers, and averaging 9.6 points. He had 41 
assists and 21 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie says all options are open," a Florida State spokeswoman said. "And he 
has said it's possible he'd play in the NBA instead of the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward is said by some to be a potential NBA first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mitch Kupchak, Laker assistant general manager: "We've watched him for 
several years now. He has NBA ability. We scout him, and so do other teams. It 
would not surprise me if he winds up on an NBA roster next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State basketball Coach Pat Kennedy said: "He's the most Christian kid 
I've ever known. When I first started coaching him, I used earthy language. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day he said to my assistant, Tom Carlson: 'Does Coach have to use those 
words?' Tom told me. I stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many former USC assistant football coaches are now NFL head 
coaches? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost unthinkable: Baseball statisticians miss a major league career record? 
No way, you say? Believe it. It happened last season.  
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Baltimore's Cal Ripken became baseball's all-time leading home 
run-hitting shortstop last season . . . and no one noticed until this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Banks of the Cubs, it has been explained, was credited with 16 of his 
293 shortstop homers when he actually played first base. Ripken hit his 278th 
-- the new record -- last July 15, when the Orioles thought he needed 15 more 
to tie Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole officials made amends this week. Ripken was given a bat autographed by 
Banks, and the club said the spot where the July 15 homer landed would be 
marked by an orange seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, who started his career at third base, has hit 297 homers, 289 as a 
shortstop. Banks hit 277 of his 512 homers at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Banks: "I'm not going to hit him on the knee for breaking my record. . . 
. I'm just so happy he broke the record because it gave me a chance to come and 
be remembered, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splendid Splinter: Joe DiMaggio, 79, was called upon to speak recently at 
the dedication of the Ted Williams Retrospective Museum and Library in Florida. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There were great hitters that I did not see," DiMaggio told more than 3,000 
relatives, friends and admirers of Williams, 75. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fellows like Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, George Sisler . . . all were 
great hitters. But from 1936 to the present day, I can truthfully say I've 
never seen a better hitter than Ted Williams." 
</P>

Wannstedt (Chicago).

USC BLOWS FINAL CHANCES, LOSES AGAIN; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FOUR CLOSE-RANGE 
SHOTS MISSED IN FINAL SECONDS OF 50-49 LOSS TO WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four relatively easy chances for victory turned into four missed shots and 
another loss for USC Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the Trojans will remember their 50-49 Pacific 10 Conference defeat 
to Washington before 2,813 after blowing an eight-point lead in the final nine 
minutes, watching the four close-range misses in the last seven seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington led by a point with 22.8 seconds left when the Trojans ran the 
clock down for an isolation play for Brandon Martin, who was double-teamed and 
passed inside to a cutting Stais Boseman with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
 After penetrating, Boseman missed a four-foot bank shot that was rebounded by 
Mark Boyd, who missed two consecutive tips before Tremayne Anchrum attempted a 
desperation rebound volley at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had the tip, but it just floated in the air and then I got 
another tip and it just went long," said Boyd, who had 13 points and nine 
rebounds. "I had almost good position on the play, but I was trying to tip on 
an angle. I tried, but I just couldn't get it to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough defeat for USC, 11-9 overall and 4-7 in Pac-10 play, after 
ending a six-game losing streak Thursday with a victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 One big problem was that Lorenzo Orr, the Trojans' leading rebounder and 
scorer, did not score or grab a rebound in 13 minutes because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing only 11 minutes in the first half because of three fouls, Orr 
was called for his fourth 34 seconds into the second half. Orr returned with 
7:41 remaining and fouled out 74 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be fortunate it came down to a shot at the end (since we were) 
without Orr," USC Coach George Raveling said. "He never got into offensive 
rhythm. A lot of that was because of foul trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who defeated Washington last month at Seattle, struggled but 
controlled most of the game, thanks largely to Martin, who finished with a 
team-high 18 points, and the defense of Boseman, who had five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (4-16, 2-9) gave USC problems with its deliberate halfcourt offense 
in taking a 27-26 halftime lead, but the Trojans appeared to get their offense 
going early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind seven consecutive points by Martin, USC took a 43-35 lead with 9:06 
left. But after that, the Trojans made only two field goals as the Huskies 
slowly crept back before taking a 50-47 lead at the 2:17 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought their tempo was a big factor in that they held the ball until 
there's only 12 or 11 second left on the shot clock," said Anchrum. "Then 
because you want to hurry the game up so bad that you go down and take a bad 
quick shot and then they get the rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's main man was center Maurice Woods, who took advantage of the 
Trojans' interior defense by scoring 14 of his 16 points in the second half 
despite having four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 After two free throws by Anchrum cut the Huskies' lead to 50-49 with 2:02 
left, USC's defense came up with two big stops that led to the dramatic finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't ask for a better shot than Boseman's," said Raveling, whose 
Trojans suffered only their sixth loss at the Sports Arena since March 1990. 
"And we had a couple of quality tips. But Lady Luck didn't look kindly at us." 
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen Avondre Jones and Claude Green did not play because they were 
suspended for violating a team rule Friday. . . . The Trojans' shooting woes 
continued as they made only 32.8% of their shots from the field and 46.2% of 
their free-throw attempts.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL PAC-10 ROUNDUP; BEAVERS WIN IN 2 OVERTIMES 
</P>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshman center Jerohn Brown scored eight of his 20 points in the second 
overtime, leading Oregon State to a 101-91 victory over Oregon on Saturday at 
Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, 6-13 overall and 2-8 in the Pacific 10, forced the first 
overtime when freshman guard Jelani Boline sank a three-pointer with 0.4 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks (6-13, 2-8) had rallied from a 15-point second-half deficit, but 
they squandered chances to win, both in regulation and the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shot that Jelani hit was the one where you're going down for the fourth 
time and it pulls you out of the water," Oregon State Coach Jim Anderson said. 
"That certainly was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 In regulation, Oregon led, 73-71, but Kenya Wilkins hit only one of two free 
throws with 5.4 seconds left. Boline then dribbled the length of the floor and 
made his three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first overtime, Oregon's Orlando Williams, who had a game-high 30 
points, traveled at the free-throw line with 4.5 seconds left and the score 
tied, 80-80. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Oregon's 27th consecutive road loss in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State 71, Stanford 69 -- Mario Bennett scored 22 points and had 11 
rebounds for the Sun Devils, who rallied from a 19-point deficit at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (13-7, 6-5) tied the score, 69-69, with 22 seconds remaining on a 
free throw by Andy Poppink. But Ron Riley, fouled by David Harbour, hit two 
free throws with 17 seconds to play to put Arizona State back on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Brevin Knight was fouled with two seconds left and missed both free throws as 
Arizona State (12-8, 7-4) hung on to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder was ejected with two technical fouls with 
1:09 left in the first half for berating the officials.

ANTEATERS ROUT NEVADA TO END LOSING STREAK 
</P>

 Things UC Irvine fans thought they might never see: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Center DeForrest Boyer passing up a fast-break layup to throw a pass out to 
Chris Brown for a three-point swish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spot-and-shoot bomber Brown driving to the basket and dishing off to LaDay 
Smith for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dan Augulis, Khari Johnson and Shauhin Talesh in a game with almost four 
minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Anteaters win again. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,213 who made it to the Bren Center Saturday night witnessed them all as 
Irvine routed Nevada, 99-70, to end a seven-game Big West losing streak. The 
Anteaters (6-14 and 3-9 in conference) jumped to a 17-2 lead and rolled to the 
victory, leading in every statistical category and a few that don't show up in 
the box score, such as good decision-making and good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had 23 more rebounds than Nevada (9-12, 5-8) and shot 52% from the 
floor. Guard Lloyd Mumford, who was benched during the crucial moments of 
Thursday's overtime loss to Utah State, scored only seven points, but he had 
four steals, 10 assists and only four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who set a school record with 10 three-pointers against Pacific, made 
seven of his first nine three-point attempts and finished with 24 points. Boyer 
made all seven of his field-goal attempts and scored 15. And forwards Jermaine 
Avie and Khalid Channell combined to make 11 of 17 shots and get 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine also got more than its share of loose balls and favorable bounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker held a protracted team meeting -- he did all the talking -- 
after Friday's practice. He said, "You make your own breaks," and waved off all 
analysis of how the Anteaters awoke from a slumber during which they had lost 
10 of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the victory to "we just played hard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 "We did some soul-searching and all decided it was really important that we do 
it tonight," he said. "Everybody needed to make some changes. We took some long 
hard looks at everything and everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford set the tone by flying up, over and into the middle of the team's 
pregame huddle, but the Anteaters have been known to play a great game before 
the opening tip and then fall on their faces. They engaged in a pregame shoving 
match with San Jose State and lost, 72-62. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the bench and just watching and we were a different team tonight," 
Mumford said. "I think we just wanted this one more. We played harder than they 
did and we found out that when you play this hard, good things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who have made a habit of going scoreless for extended periods, 
steadily added to their early lead and had a 21-point advantage at halftime. 
Nevada pulled to within 19 early in the second half, but the Wolf Pack was down 
and out (76-44) with 13 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out hard, we kept our focus and we finally got a 'W' behind it," 
Brown said. "But we could have been up by 30 with a minute to play and we still 
would have been playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker felt a little more secure than Brown, however, and sent in the reserves 
with 3:36 to play and the Anteaters "clinging" to an 89-63 lead. Augulis, who 
hadn't seen action since Dec. 29, got two rebounds. Johnson, who hadn't been in 
a game since Dec. 2, scored on an acrobatic reverse lay-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, a good time was had by all in blue and gold. But, if all it takes 
is a team meeting, a little self-analysis and lot of effort, why haven't the 
Anteaters stumbled on this formula before? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that we haven't been putting out," Boyer said, "but the results 
were different tonight. You just get tired of losing."

HANNIBAL BACK DOING JOB FOR 49ERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Hannibal spent the first month of the Big West Conference season in the 
dog house, but since he regained his starting job six games ago, the senior 
forward has been a key for Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 He made a key three-point basket with less than 90 seconds remaining Saturday 
night as the 49ers defeated San Jose State, 73-66, before 1,593 in the campus 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State (12-9, 8-5), which suffered only its second loss in its last 
nine games, led, 33-24, near the end of the first half and by six points at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hannibal, who was benched in early January for academic violations, scored 
five points as Long Beach (12-7, 6-5) took a 44-42 lead. The score remained 
close the rest of the way; the lead changed hands or the score was tied another 
12 times. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnaround jumper by Terrance O'Kelley with 3:18 to go gave Long Beach the 
lead for good, 63-62. Then Hannibal, who scored 17 points, launched the 
three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the back-breaker," San Jose State Coach Stan Morrison said of 
Hannibal's three-pointer. PAUL McLEOD

CS FULLERTON LOSES TO UTAH STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps spoiled by his team's success Thursday night, Cal State Fullerton 
basketball Coach Brad Holland expected more than he got from the Titans 
Saturday night against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a 62-point second half in a 97-72 victory over Nevada on Thursday 
night, the Titans went flat in a 59-52 loss in a Big West Conference game at 
Titan gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just proved how inconsistent we are," Holland said. "We play well one 
game, then two days later we come out without collective spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew which key I could turn to get some of that inspiration, I would get 
them made and hand them out to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Vernon scored 16 points to lead Fullerton (5-16, 2-11 in conference 
play), but three other Titan starters -- center David Frigout and forwards 
Darren Little and Winston Peterson -- combined for only six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Roddie Anderson scored 14 points for Utah State (10-11, 7-6), which beat 
Fullerton for only the third time in 14 games at Titan Gym. MIKE REILLEY

<P>
 The Matadors (5-16) led, 39-31, at halftime and were within 62-60 late in the

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP; GEORGIA TECH HAS NORTH CAROLINA'S NUMBER . 
. . AGAIN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the sixth consecutive week, the nation's top-ranked team was beaten when 
North Carolina blew a 15-point lead and lost to Georgia Tech, 96-89, Saturday 
at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous five weeks, Duke, UCLA, Kansas, North Carolina and Arkansas 
had lost as the top-ranked team. And, for the fourth consecutive time, Georgia 
Tech won when playing a No. 1 team -- three times against North Carolina, and 
once against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's just the Carolina on our chest or the No. 1 label," North 
Carolina's Derrick Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Vinson scored a season-high 26 points, including an Atlantic Coast 
Conference season-best eight three-point baskets, for Georgia Tech, 13-9, 4-7 
in the ACC. The Yellow Jackets made a team-record 15 of 29 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told each other we didn't have anything to lose," said James Forrest, who 
had 25 points and 17 rebounds for Georgia Tech. "We are trying to get a bid for 
the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech, winning for only the fourth time in 12 games, ended North 
Carolina's 25-game winning streak at the Smith Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy right now, but of course, we're far from the NCAA tournament," 
Coach Bobby Cremins said. "We've got a lot more games to go. I'm just proud 
we've still in the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third time in a row that North Carolina (20-4, 8-3) was beaten by 
Georgia Tech when it was ranked No. 1. The Tar Heels lost to the Yellow Jackets 
by 20 points a month ago in Atlanta and also in the ACC tournament title game 
last March. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Arkansas 99, No. 20 Florida 87 -- Corey Beck made five free throws and 
Corliss Williamson two in the final 95 seconds at Fayetteville, Ark., to help 
the Razorbacks in a matchup of the Southeastern Conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tied six times during the first half, but Florida (19-4, 9-2) 
never got even in the final 31 minutes. The Razorbacks (18-2, 8-2) were ahead 
by 13 with 5:47 to play before Dan Cross made a jump shot and a three-point 
basket to make it 90-84 with 1:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Syracuse 93, No. 4 Kentucky 85 -- Adrian Autry's three-point play with 
one minute left propelled the Orangemen at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5 Autry used his size advantage against the Wildcats' smaller 
guards to finish with 30 points, one shy of his career best. With the score 
tied at 83-83, he beat Kentucky's press for a layup, was fouled and made the 
free throw to give Syracuse (16-4) the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive loss for Kentucky (18-5), which was beaten at 
home by Arkansas, 90-82, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Kansas 65, Kansas State 56 -- The Wildcats took a 41-40 lead on Belvis 
Noland's basket with about 13 minutes left in the Big Eight game at Manhattan, 
Kan., but Steve Woodberry's three-point shot a moment later keyed a 16-2 run by 
the Jayhawks (21-3, 7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kansas' 22nd victory in the last 28 meetings with Kansas State, which 
beat the Jayhawks, 68-64, in Lawrence last month. Kansas State (14-7, 3-8) has 
lost to its archrival at home every year since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Connecticut 80, Seton Hall 68 -- The Huskies, trailing by seven points 
at halftime, outscored the Pirates, 51-30, during the final 20 minutes of the 
Big East game at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Donyell Marshall made two three-point plays early in the second half as the 
Big East-leading Huskies (21-2, 11-1) won their second in a row this season 
over the Pirates (11-10, 4-9), who have lost six of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Louisville 77, Tulane 73 -- The Cardinals, who escaped a late rally to 
beat the Green Wave on Jan. 20 in New Orleans, did it again at Louisville to 
clinch a tie for the Metro Conference regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dwayne Morton made two free throws with 1:32 to go to give Louisville 
(20-2, 9-1) a 75-67 lead, Tulane's LeVeldro Simmons drove inside for a layup. 
Two consecutive Louisville turnovers resulted in Carlin Hartman's layup and a 
tip-in that pulled Tulane (12-9, 3-5) to within 75-73 with 22.3 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Purdue 74, Michigan State 70 -- The Spartans led by 15 points late in 
the first half but couldn't hold off the Boilermakers in the second half of the 
Big Ten game at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuonzo Martin led Purdue (20-3, 8-3) into a 54-54 tie with 12:01 to play. 
Three minutes later, it was tied at 57-57. That's when Glenn Robinson went on a 
7-2 run to put the Boilermakers ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and Shawn Respert, the Big Ten's leading scorers, matched each other 
down the stretch, but Respert twisted his ankle on a layup that pulled the 
Spartans (14-10, 5-7) to within 72-70 with 49 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored 11 of his 23 points in the final 9:10. Respert scored 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Indiana 93, Iowa 91 -- Todd Lindeman's basket and a free throw by 
Sherron Wilkerson in the closing seconds gave the Hoosiers the Big Ten victory 
at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (15-5, 8-3) trailed, 91-90, with two minutes to play. Lindeman gave 
the Hoosiers the lead with 33 seconds left. The Hawkeyes (9-10, 3-7) missed two 
shots, then, with seven seconds left, Wilkerson made one of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Missouri 72, Oklahoma State 70 -- Freshman Kelly Thames picked up a 
loose ball and scored over 7-foot Bryant Reeves with 2.1 seconds to go as the 
Tigers avoided a second-half collapse at Columbia, Mo., and remained unbeaten 
in the Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri is 18-2 overall and has a 9-0 conference record for the first time 
since 1922, when it was a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. The Tigers 
extended their home winning streak to 17 over the Cowboys (16-7, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State 58, No. 19 Alabama Birmingham 53 -- David Vaughn made two free 
throws with 12 seconds left to help the Tigers win the Great Midwest Conference 
game at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State (9-11, 4-6) led, 56-53, with 16 seconds left when Vaughn 
rebounded a missed free throw by Corey Jackson of Alabama Birmingham (18-4, 
6-3) and was fouled as he threw the outlet pass. Vaughn made both free throws 
to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Minnesota 109, No. 21 Wisconsin 78 -- The Golden Gophers handed the 
Badgers their first loss in 13 games this season at Madison, and in so doing, 
completed a sweep of the season series against their Big Ten rival by a total 
of 68 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (17-7, 7-4) dealt the Badgers their worst loss in the 94-year 
history of the rivalry with a 90-53 victory at Minneapolis on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin (15-5, 6-5) played without star freshman center Rashard Griffith, 
who had back spasms in practice Friday. The Badgers were led by Michael Finley, 
who scored 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 79, No. 24 Illinois 68 -- Coach Ricky Byrdsong wasn't there, but 
the Wildcats didn't seem to miss him. Kevin Rankin and Patrick Baldwin each 
scored 21 points at Evanston, Ill., to help snap a nine-game losing streak.  
</P>
<P>
 Byrdsong took a leave of absence on Monday, two days after his bizarre 
behavior during a game at Minnesota when he wandered into the stands slapping 
hands with fans and the Gopher mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (10-9), with assistant Paul Swanson coaching, took a 12-point 
halftime lead and then withstood a second-half surge to break the Big Ten 
losing streak that had followed a 9-0 nonconference start. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois (13-6, 6-4) was led by Deon Thomas with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington 93, No. 25 Xavier 92 -- Vaughn Jones drove the length of the 
court and scored on a layup with 0.8 seconds left in the second overtime at 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier (16-4) took a 92-91 lead on Jeff Massey's four-point play with seven 
seconds left. Afraid to foul, the Musketeers then let Jones bring the ball 
upcourt and drive to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonials (11-9) blew a 14-point lead in regulation and a four-point lead 
in the second overtime before coming back to end Xavier's 23-game home-court 
winning streak. OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn broke a 10-game Southeastern Conference losing streak with a 111-83 
victory over Louisiana State at Auburn. Aaron Swinson scored 30 points to lead 
the Tigers. . . . Jeff Webster scored 41 points and Calvin Curry had 31, 
helping Oklahoma beat Colorado, 98-85, in a Big Eight game at Norman, Okla. It 
was Colorado's 21st consecutive regular-season road loss. . . . Exree Hipp made 
two free throws with five seconds left as Maryland held off Florida State, 
69-66, in an ACC game at Tallahassee, Fla. Charlie Ward's desperation 
three-point shot at the buzzer rimmed out.

HERE'S ONE WAY TO MAKE UP GROUND; L.A. OPEN: JACOBSEN JUMPS SEVERAL PLACES ON 
LEADER BOARD WITH HOLE IN ONE ON 180-YARD 14TH HOLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Jacobsen started quickly Saturday at Riviera Country Club, then stalled, 
looking like a golfer who was about to let the top of the leader board run away 
and hide. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Jacobsen pulled out his ace in the hole at No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen's tee shot, a five-iron into the wind from 180 yards, started right, 
moved left, skidded onto the green slightly right of the pin and about 12 yards 
short, rolled directly to the pin and rattled the hole before falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole in one. 
</P>
<P>
 In one swing, Jacobsen gained several strokes, jumped several places on the 
L.A. Open leader board -- moving from a tie for sixth to third -- and won a new 
red Nissan 300 ZX convertible situated directly behind the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ace, Jacobsen immediately jumped into the car and pretended to drive 
off. Then he leaped out, got the hugs, and motored up the fairway to the green 
gripping his hands on an imaginary steering wheel until he drove himself up to 
the cup to remove his ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the funny kind of magical moments in golf," Jacobsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen said the tee shots by Fuzzy Zoeller and Nolan Henke gave him the 
confidence to go at the pin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got up on the tee and Nolan Henke hit a real good shot in there," said 
Jacobsen, whose third-round 68 put him at 208, six shots behind leader Fred 
Couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fuzzy hit a great-looking shot, ball went right by the hole and he said, 
'Man, I just went from the driver's seat to the trunk of that car.' Which I 
thought was funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the first two guys hit a good shot, you almost feel like OK, it's right 
there for me. So I hit the shot, and the minute I hit it, I went, 'Oooooh, that 
looks awfully good.' It was right at it, felt very, very solid off the blade. 
It landed and boom, went in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Zoeller: "We all hit five-irons back there, and I actually hit a very 
nice-looking shot that hit just about pin high about a foot left of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he hit his, and heck, it rolled right in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Jacobsen, who is sponsored by Toyota -- not Nissan -- started 
the day two-under for the tournament, then birdied Nos. 1, 5, 7 and 8 before 
bogeying Nos. 9 and 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The ace temporarily lifted Jacobsen to six under for the tournament. But, at 
15, Jacobsen hooked a four-iron that bounced off a hill beside the green and 
about 30 yards left. 
</P>
<P>
 He had to punch uphill through two trees to get on the green and two-putted 
for a bogey. He parred in from there, finishing five under overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen disagreed with the thought that he bogeyed because of the emotion of 
the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," Jacobsen said. "Something like that is so fun and it's so out of the 
ordinary. I've made about 12 holes in one. But you never expect to make them. 
It's just gravy. I've never won a car before." 
</P>
<P>
 With Couples and Corey Pavin so far ahead, Jacobsen said he didn't know if it 
was realistic to try to catch them today. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said if it can be done on any course, it can be done on Riviera, where 
he finished third at the 1983 PGA Championship and tied for sixth in the L.A. 
Open last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can gain shots in a hurry -- I made five straight threes on the front 
side," Jacobsen said. "And you can lose strokes in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for Fred and Corey is they've got to be careful they don't play match 
play against each other. Because they can go back and forth and stay at nine or 
10 (under) and someone at five or someone even at four could rush, make five or 
six birdies, the next thing they know they're tied on the 14th hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Where unpredictable things happen.

OFF-ROAD RACING; JOHNSON WINS SECOND STRAIGHT TRUCK TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rick Johnson found the best way to stay out of traffic in the Grand National 
Sport Truck class of the Mickey Thompson Off-Road racing series Saturday at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, starting on the outside of the first row, got ahead of Roger Mears 
Jr. early in the first lap and pulled away to easily win the 12-lap main event 
before a sellout crowd of 47,833. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone got hung up behind Roger and it gave me some room," Johnson 
said. "I had to just focus in and run my race." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year that Johnson, who drives a Chevrolet, has won the 
event. He beat Ivan Stewart off the last turn a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth series victory for Johnson of Encinitas. The victory eased 
the frustration he had in an earlier heat race. Johnson's truck broke down in 
the first lap and he sat in it and watched as the other drivers went by for 10 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Thompson worked his way into second on the second lap and stayed there 
until he was passed by Ford teammate Rob MacChachren off the final jump. 
</P>
<P>
 In the divisions: 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Whelchel of Mission Viejo, who has won the Super 1600 class the last two 
years, led from wire-to-wire in the 12-lap main event. It was his 17th victory 
in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brooks of El Cajon, the defending series champion, won the 10-lap 
Ultracross race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Croft of San Diego won the eight-lap sport utility final. Joe Byrd of 
Union City, Tenn. took first in the four-wheel ATV eight-lap final. Rennie 
Awana of Cerritos took advantage of a last-lap crash to win the superlight 
eight-lap race.

HILL FINDS OLD TOUCH ON NEW COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Past champion Mike Hill was disappointed when the Suncoast Classic moved from 
the site of his first Senior PGA Tour victory, but he might feel a bit 
differently after Saturday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill shot a second-round 64 for a two-day nine-under-par 133 at the Tournament 
Players Club of Tampa Bay.That gave him a two-stroke lead over Orville Moody, 
who shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think one round of shooting 64 will make you fall in love with a golf 
course or a place," Hill said. "I have a lot of fond memories from Tampa Palms. 
. . . And while I've never done very well here, who knows? My whole outlook 
might change." 
</P>
<P>
 George Archer and Raymond Floyd are three strokes behind, Lee Trevino and 
Simon Hobday four back. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-under-par front nine, Hill sailed through the back with four 
birdies and an eagle. He sank an 18-foot birdie putt on No. 10, 12-footers for 
birdies on Nos. 12 and 13, chipped in from 20 feet for eagle on 14 and dropped 
a 12-foot putt on 16.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; TOP-SEEDED RUSSIANS STORM PAST NORWAY; 
HOCKEY: DESPITE DMITRIEV'S DISCLAIMERS, THE 5-1 VICTORY OVER THE 11TH-SEEDED 
HOSTS IS IMPRESSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Igor Dmitriev's mood was as dark as his sober wool suit, his face fixed in a 
frown that transcended the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky," the assistant coach of Russia's Olympic hockey team said 
through an interpreter after a 5-1 victory over Norway here Saturday. "It was 
obvious with our defense, because they were not ready for such sharp and speedy 
moves of the forwards of the Norwegian team." 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitriev's poor-mouthing didn't go over well with Norwegian Coach Bengt 
Ohlson, who was sitting a few feet away. "This Russian team is very strong," 
Ohlson said. "Even if they say something else, they know it's strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not as dominant as the Soviet and Unified teams that won seven of the 
last eight Olympic gold medals, the top-seeded Russian team was more than 
capable of manhandling the willing but overmatched Norwegians. The 11th-seeded 
host team, backed by a crowd of 5,200, kept the score close through two periods 
but was thrashed in the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A short-handed goal by wing Valeri Karpov, the Mighty Ducks' 56th pick in last 
June's draft, deflated the Norwegian players with 7:24 to play and gave Russia 
a 4-1 lead. Sergei Sorokin's wrist shot, set up on a drop pass by Ravil 
Gusmanov, sent the fans streaming to the exits with 5:21 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't seem to be as sharp as I've seen them play before," Norwegian 
goaltender Robert Schistad said. "They're certainly not the machine they were 
in the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Schistad is a native of Wingham, Canada, northwest of Toronto. He moved to 
Norway seven years ago and was eligible for the Olympic team because his father 
was born in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy playing against the Russians," Schistad added. "It's a 
challenge, and I usually play much better against them than against other 
teams, so today is a bit of a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Schistad was in goal for Norway's surprising 2-2 tie with Russia at the 
Izvestia tournament last December in Moscow and for a 5-2 victory in the 
Telehockey tournament in Norway in November. The Russian team has changed 
significantly since then, however, blending players from the Russian teams that 
finished 1-2 in the Izvestia competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The first period provided Norway reason for optimism, even though the Russians 
took a 2-0 lead before the game was four minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on a defensive breakdown, Gusmanov came around from behind the 
net and was unchecked, allowing him to flick a shot inside the right post 23 
seconds into the game. Sergei Berezine scored at 3:27 on a short-handed 
breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegians made the score 2-1 at 18:19, when Marius Rath took a cross-ice 
pass from Espen Knutsen and got behind defenseman Oleg Chargorodski for an 
unchallenged shot at Andrei Zuev. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys never gave up," said Ohlson, a Swede. "But then they scored the 
fourth goal, and it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia will play seventh-seeded Finland, which scored a 3-1 upset of the 
third-seeded Czech Republic, on Monday. This Russian team doesn't appear to be 
in danger of disgracing its great Olympic hockey tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must be frank," Dmitriev said, smiling for the first time. "There is no 
team here with the idea that it is here to lose. Every team will be 
disappointed if they are losing." 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's other game, Germany beat Austria, 4-3.

NORTHRIDGE HANGS ON AGAIN, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Coach Bill Kernen sees it, Cal State Northridge won by a foot on 
Saturday. Unfortunately, this means his baseball team is about a mile shy of 
being a respectable NCAA Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most boring game I've ever been a part of in my life," Kernen said. "We 
didn't show up to play. We didn't win, we just happened to score more runs than 
they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go if we're going to beat anybody this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Cal State San Bernardino counts as an anybody or a nobody is Kernen's 
call, but the Matadors held on to win, 5-4, in a nonconference game at Pierce 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Northridge (2-3) made it interesting in the ninth. Starting 
pitcher John Najar, who cruised into the inning with a 5-2 lead, inexplicably 
couldn't find the strike zone. In his last start, Najar gave up the winning run 
in the final inning and a repeat performance looked like a distinct 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad luck played a part in the rally by the Coyotes, a Division II team. After 
a leadoff single, Levi Funderburk sent a potential double-play grounder to 
Northridge shortstop Chad Thornhill. Trouble was, the ball took a wicked hop 
past the shortstop's head and into center field. Adrian Sanchez followed with a 
single to load the bases, and San Bernardino (2-4) was very much in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar (1-1) walked two consecutive batters and the lead was cut to 5-4, and 
when Gary Frank worked the count to 3 and 2, Najar professed he was more than a 
little worried that his workday might be extended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think about was extra innings," said Najar, who struck out nine 
and allowed 11 hits. "I knew I wouldn't be (taken out). It was my game all the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Najar fired a full-count fastball that Frank -- who was two for four as he 
stepped in -- fouled to the screen. With the runners again moving, Frank topped 
a Najar fastball down the line that first baseman Brian Vasey fielded. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey beat Frank to the bag by a foot or so -- the only difference in the 
game, Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you," Najar said. "I think (Frank) swung at a ball. It was 
up in the zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors zoned out after a fast start, but that isn't exactly unusual. 
Northridge followed its usual pattern: Score early, slip into a lethargic state 
offensively, then hold on for dear life.  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday marked the Matadors' second consecutive victory . . . and the third 
time in as many games that the opposition has mounted a world-class rally in 
its final at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as the ever-succinct Kernen put it: "We did our usual gag job in the 
ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 If it wasn't for Najar and outfielder Joey Arnold, Northridge might have lost 
for the fourth time to a Division II team. After going 0 for 11 in a three-game 
series sweep last weekend by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Arnold has sparked the 
offense this week from his leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show the coach, my teammates and myself that I can be one of the 
guys (to carry the team)," said Arnold, who had three of Northridge's eight 
hits to raise his average to .263. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, who played two seasons at Pierce, also drove in three runs. He had two 
hits against UCLA on Friday. Kernen says the difference was a foot? For Arnold, 
it might have been a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel comfortable in this yard," said Arnold, a senior from Reseda High. 
"Maybe that had something to do with it, maybe it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first, in which he gave up two runs on four hits, Najar settled into 
a groove. From the second through eighth innings he allowed four hits, and only 
two San Bernardino baserunners reached third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a 3-2 lead in the second when Arnold singled home Tyler Nelson 
and Josh Smaler. Northridge added two runs in the fourth -- Arnold contributed 
a single -- to take a 5-2 lead that held up into the ninth. Brian Vasey and 
Thornhill started the rally with consecutive bunts down the third-base line. 
</P>
<P>
 Thereafter, Northridge managed all of three hits.

NORTHRIDGE ISN'T HALF BAD, ISN'T HALF GOOD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MATADORS GO 
COLD AFTER INTERMISSION, FALL TO SOUTHERN UTAH IN A BARRAGE OF FREE THROWS, 
81-71.

 Cal State Northridge used a swarming defensive front to grab an eight-point 
halftime lead Saturday night, but couldn't prevent Southern Utah from putting 
together its best free-throw shooting performance of the season over the final 
five minutes and dropped an 81-71 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, Southern Utah's fifth in a row, lifted the Thunderbirds to 13-9 
while CSUN fell to 5-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our defense was very effective tonight, but at the same time you 
have to say that Southern Utah's offense was very effective too," Northridge 
Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as good as we've played Southern Utah here since we've been playing 
them -- this was better than a 10-point game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors played early like they had no intention losing this one, jumping 
to a 39-31 intermission lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Utah held a 26-24 advantage midway through the half on Donnie 
McDade's three-pointer, the T-Birds' sixth of the 20-minute period. But they 
managed only two more baskets before the break. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Matadors took advantage of 11 Southern Utah turnovers to 
launch a 15-5 run, capped by Brooklyn McLinn's fast-break layup with two 
seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead reached the double-digit mark just seconds into the second half when 
guard Andre Chevalier connected on a long three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Matadors, the 42-point CSUN scoreboard mark wouldn't 
change again for four minutes, leaving the door open for the T-Birds to score 
nine consecutive points -- including three baskets in a row on offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Utah took its first lead of the second half two minutes later on 
Keith Berard's jump shot, then pushed the advantage to four on Andy Ward's free 
throw at the 11:13 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors responded with a seven-point run of their own, capped by Peter 
Micelli's drive and free throw, to reclaim the lead, 57-54, but lapsed into 
another dry spell, this one lasting three minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Three inside baskets, two coming after steals, returned a three-point lead to 
Southern Utah. The T-Birds managed only two more shots from the field through 
the final five minutes, but a 17-for-18 performance at the free-throw line 
proved more than enough to give Southern Utah the victory.  
</P>
<P>
 CSUN did pull to within two with 4:03 remaining on Chevalier's layup and free 
throw, and McLinn's three-pointer with 38 seconds to go left Southern Utah 
ahead just 73-70. 
</P>
<P>
 But four more T-Bird chances at the line and a fast-break dunk by Sean Allen 
kept the Matadors from coming any closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we were a little careless on defense with the reaching fouls down 
the stretch," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got lazy. We wanted to steal the ball instead of playing straight-up 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Lofton scored a career-high 19 points to lead the CSUN offensive attack. 
Micelli added 15 points and Chevalier had 11 as the Matadors shot 46.9% from 
the field to an even 50% for the T-Birds. McLinn and Tom Samson each had four 
rebounds as SUU took a considerable 36-24 advantage under the boards.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE: SOCCER TEAM AT CHATSWORTH FINDS NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From chaos has come order for the Chatsworth High boys' soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Paul Safavian, a first-year walk-on coach, angered and mystified 
many players and parents by cutting from the team most of the school's top 
players for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 After parents complained to the school administration, Safavian was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 John McLean, a teacher and track coach at the high school, took over the 
Chancellors in October. Desmond Willows, a player for the Simi Valley-based 
L.A. Siege semipro team, soon joined the team as a co-coach and the two have 
transformed a program in disarray into a unified, playoff-bound squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Desmond and Coach McLean came, they've given us better spirit," 
midfielder Mike Preis said. "The team has really changed from the beginning of 
the year, both in playing better and in attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 There was nowhere to go but up. Preis, who has eight goals and 15 assists, was 
one of seven current starters who was cut by Safavian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really ridiculous," Preis said. "I was even thinking of transferring 
schools. (Safavian) just didn't like us, I guess. It seemed to me that he 
didn't like the players who knew what they were doing. He didn't know much 
about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Also cut by Safavian were midfielder Trevor Schmidt (the team's leading scorer 
with 11 goals) and Jorge Burey, whom McLean said is talented enough to earn 
All-City honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when the stink hit the fan," McLean said. "It just didn't wash with 
anyone, the parents or the athletic department." 
</P>
<P>
 Preis' father, Barry, was one of several parents who complained to Chatsworth 
administrators. Soon Safavian was gone and McLean was hired, taking over a team 
that was dispirited and out of shape, and had won only two matches the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in absolute chaos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean started from scratch, holding another open tryout and welcoming back 
those talented players onto his roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the kids (Safavian) had playing as first string, I had to either cut 
or kept as substitutes," McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is the arrival of Willows. McLean's expertise is in track, 
not soccer, and he needed help. Through a player on the team whose father owned 
the Siege, McLean was put in touch with Willows. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of days later he was on my doorstep," McLean said. "He was 
God-sent." 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding process had begun. McLean was an expert in conditioning the 
players. Willows added his knowledge of the technical aspects of the sport, and 
the mix proved fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean and Willows have guided the Chancellors to a 9-4-1 record, a 
second-place finish in the strong West Valley League and a playoff berth. Their 
3-0 victory Wednesday at Granada Hills -- tied for first place in the league at 
the time -- was a measure of how far Chatsworth has come in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a pleasure," McLean said. "Everybody's had fun and worked hard. 
Desmond has brought in a high, high caliber of technical skill, and made what 
would have been a so-so team into a team that on any given day can be 
unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Willows: "I'm not getting much money whatsoever, but it's good to do this 
for the team." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Quake Damage: McLean, who lost his home in the earthquake, also lost four 
players because of the shake. 
</P>
<P>
 Burey's family home was destroyed and he has moved back to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other players -- Eli Chavarria, Leonardo Sanchez and Jorge Hernandez -- 
were bused to Chatsworth from South Central Los Angeles. Because of the quake, 
McLean said the players' parents no longer want them attending school in the 
Valley. 
</P>

 A little salt for that whistle?: At the end of overtime in Friday's North 
Hollywood-Grant basketball game, Lancer forward Don Patterson attempted a short 
jump shot that would have tied the score at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot was blocked by North Hollywood's Damon Ollie, but the Huskies thought 
Patterson was fouled on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers at the game heard one of the referees blow his whistle to signal a 
foul, but the buzzer sounded at the same moment, North Hollywood players began 
celebrating their 65-63 victory and the official simply walked off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we were robbed," Patterson said. "It was pretty obvious (that it 
was a foul) and the refs knew it, too. I guess the refs were tired and they 
were ready to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Said North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller: "It was a clean block. I think 
they're stretching it a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let the games begin: The Village Christian girls' basketball team went 8-0 in 
Alpha League play for the second consecutive season, but Coach John Domke was 
not breaking out the champagne and party hats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our league is just really bad," he said. "The closest anyone came to us, I 
think, was 30 points." 
</P>
<P>
 This was no surprise to Domke, in his fifth year as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I purposely beefed up our preseason schedule because I knew the league was 
going to be real soft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His players, however, are anything but soft. Led by starters Lindy James, 
Trisha Palmquist, Jeanne Beauchamp and Christy Ludwig, the Crusaders defeated 
several quality opponents -- including Crescenta Valley, Burroughs and Quartz 
Hill -- in nonleague play in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Domke said the Crusaders (22-1) will likely enter the Division IV-A playoffs 
as the second-seeded team. Last season, the Crusaders advanced to the 
semifinals before losing to Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to get to the finals," he said. 
</P>

 Pass the Advil: The coaches and players at Oxnard and Chaminade must feel like 
they were run over. Their girls' basketball teams had a long night Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena 98, Oxnard 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany 80, Chaminade 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they can take solace in Alemany being ranked fifth in the state and 
Buena 10th. Probably they just took some aspirin. 
</P>

<P>
 His left foot: Trenton Cross, Reseda's leading scorer at 18.5 points per game, 
severely sprained his left foot in the first quarter of Friday night's victory 
over San Fernando and could miss the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross' absence would damage the City Section 3-A title hopes of the Regents 
(16-1), ranked fifth in the area by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told Cross that he will be unable to play for at least a week and 
perhaps as long as a month, but Cross has some hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night I couldn't even walk on it, but it feels a lot better than it did 
last night," he said Saturday. "I think it will only take a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern can only hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big blow to us," Halpern said. "Our goal is to get to the Sports 
Arena (site of the championship). If Cross is out, it would mean we'd have an 
All-City point guard unable to play."

CANYONS STOPS LEVIER THE 2ND TIME AROUND; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COUGARS HOLD 
BAKERSFIELD'S TOP SCORER TO 10 POINTS AND REVERSE AN EARLIER LOSS, 68-63. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody can say that the College of the Canyons men's basketball team doesn't 
learn from its setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous Western State Conference game against Bakersfield this 
season, the Cougars lost by one point because they couldn't contain guard Tim 
Levier, who scored 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night at Canyons, they did a number on Levier and beat 
Bakersfield, 68-63, to remain in first place in the South Division. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh consecutive victory for Canyons (13-15, 7-1 in conference 
play). 
</P>
<P>
 By winning, the Cougars opened a 1 1/2-game lead over Bakersfield (12-17, 5-2) 
in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons has two games remaining and the Renegades have three, one of them a 
makeup game with Santa Monica on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Levier) got six threes the first time around against us," Canyons Coach 
Lee Smelser said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were really going to pay attention to him tonight and we weren't going to 
let him beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 With sophomore guard Alric Gillett shadowing Levier, the Cougars kept 
Bakersfield's top scorer to 10 points and only two three-point baskets. Levier 
went into the game with a 19.2-point average in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gillett gives us quickness and he sets a lot of the pace for us with his 
defense," Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also can shoot a little. 
</P>
<P>
 He tied teammate Kwesi' Fulton with a game-high 15 points, including 12 in the 
first half. He scored eight of the first 10 Cougar points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who lost to Bakersfield, 69-68, on Jan. 26, trailed, 29-19, with 
7 minutes 8 seconds remaining in the first half before going on a 15-0 run to 
take a 34-29 advantage with 2:07 left before the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons exploited 11 turnovers by Bakersfield in the half, including several 
on offensive fouls, to rally for the lead. Bakersfield finished with 20 
turnovers, nine of them steals by the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of mental errors and that killed us tonight," Bakersfield Coach 
Marc Arce said. "We played well until we got in foul trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The Renegades were called for 21 fouls and Canyons capitalized on many of 
them, cashing in 17 of 22 (77.3%) free-throw attempts. Bakersfield made 11 of 
13 (84.6%) from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons continued to take advantage of Bakersfield's foul trouble and shaky 
defensive effort in the second half, building a 65-52 lead with 3:16 left 
before the Renegades answered with a spurt of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we could do some things out of our sets offensively," Smelser said. 
"We screened very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton, a 6-foot-5 freshman forward, came alive in the second half with 10 of 
his points. He also had a game-high 11 rebounds. Forward Randy Eason scored 14 
points and forward Jagos Medenica had 13 for Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that if we ran our offense, eventually we could break them down," 
Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield got 14 points each from center Anthony Jones and forward Ty 
Gaines, and forward Paul Charles scored 12 before fouling out early in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars shot 46.2% (24 of 52) from the field and Bakersfield shot 48.1% 
(25 of 52).

 After pulling out of a meet two weeks ago in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 
earthquake, the Cal State Northridge men's and women's track teams opened the 
indoor season Saturday with a solid showing in the Wolf Pack Invitational at 
the Reno Livestock and Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador athletes posted victories in three events and placed among the top six 
in several others in the non-scoring meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Miller won the women's mile and Tannel House took the long jump. The 
Matador men placed first in the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a sophomore, timed 5 minutes 9.32 seconds in the mile and House, a 
junior, spanned 19 feet 3 1/4 inches in the long jump. House also finished 
third in the triple jump at 37-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Akiem Brown, Troy Collins, Chris Brown (no relation to Akiem) and Jason Stein 
teamed for a time of 3:14.89 in the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, a junior from Oak Park High, finished third in the 400 meters with a 
school indoor record of 48.81 and Evans placed third in the 200 in 22.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Gayles set a Northridge record of 60- 1/2 to finish sixth in the 
35-pound weight throw.

FREEWAY LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; LA HABRA GETS WAKE-UP CALL, BEATS FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Habra shook off the early-morning cobwebs and the effects of a close loss 
to Sonora only 13 hours earlier to defeat Fullerton, 55-45, in a Freeway League 
boys' basketball third-place playoff game Saturday at Fullerton High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew if we wanted to keep playing, we'd have to win this one," La Habra 
Coach Frank McCarroll said. "We just put Friday behind us and went out and did 
what we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Cauley had 14 points and five assists to lead the Highlanders (17-10, 6-5 
in league), who automatically qualified for the Southern Section Division 
III-AA playoffs. Fullerton (14-13, 5-6) will apply for an at-large bid, but 
Coach Tony McCabe isn't optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was it," McCabe said. "We just got a little cold." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians made 24% of their field goals in the second half, and shot 32% (16 
of 50) for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Indians took a 21-14 lead one minute into the second quarter when 
Ryan Schatz, who had 13 points, scored on a driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But La Habra came back on the strength of its outside shooting. Two 
three-pointers by reserve guard Justin Marshall and another by reserve Steve 
McAnally, helped pull Fullerton out of its zone as the Highlanders took a 27-26 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been the strength of this team all year," McCarroll said. "I always 
thought we had great depth; we just kept battling." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Young, a 5-foot-7 point guard who had a game-high 16 points, scored the 
first six points of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Fullerton sophomore Sam Mankiewicz added two free throws to give the 
Indians a 34-27 lead with 6 minutes 5 seconds remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra's 6-7 center Andrija Kristich, who played only four-plus minutes in 
the first half because of foul trouble, helped the Highlanders' second-half 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 He had seven points in the fourth quarter, when La Habra outscored Fullerton, 
19-7, and eight second-half rebounds. Kristich finished with 11 points and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's last lead came with 6:52 remaining after Seth LaTour made one of 
two free throws for a 39-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra outscored Fullerton, 9-2, over the next four minutes and Cauley's 
driving three-point play gave the Highlanders a 46-41 lead with 2:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Cauley made a short jumper in the lane off a Kristich assist and another layup 
and three free throws by Kristich pushed the lead to 53-43 with 43 seconds 
remaining, sealing the victory.

PREP ROUNDUP; EDISON EARNS A REST AFTER BEATING OCEAN VIEW, 75-58 
</P>

<P>
 After playing four games in six days, the Edison boys' basketball team finally 
can rest, knowing it has secured a spot in the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers beat Ocean View, 75-58, in the Sunset League fourth-place playoff 
game Saturday, 24 hours after beating Servite in an emotional double-overtime 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to sleep good tonight," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. "Now we 
don't have to worry about a committee deciding whether or not we get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison had to come back from a 17-point deficit with 13 minutes remaining to 
send Friday's game to overtime. But Saturday, the Chargers took an 8-0 lead and 
never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really afraid that we'd be tired emotionally and physically," Hirst 
said. "We tried to substitute some in the first half and give our starters a 
rest, but they did a real good job and responded real well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks put together a 6-0 run to end the first half and closed to 27-25. 
But Edison pulled away midway through the third quarter, taking a 46-39 lead 
into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison then put the game away with a 15-7 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson led Ocean View with a game-high 24 points, Darrell Adams 
finished with 20 points and Jason Sist had 13 for Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 In Olympic League boys' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 66, Brethren Christian 42 -- Matt Herr scored 16 points for 
Calvary Chapel (13-13, 7-5), which earned fourth place and a spot in the IV-A 
playoffs. Third-place Brethren Christian finished the regular season 16-9 and 
8-4.

CAL LUTHERAN LAYS LOW AFTER MONSTROUS SWEEP OF CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ho-hum. Cal Lutheran scores 87 runs in a three-games series and Coach Marty 
Slimak can't remember who played well. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe doesn't want to remember.In deference to Caltech, the victim of Cal 
Lutheran's 32-0, 22-2 onslaught in a doubleheader Saturday, Slimak was 
reluctant to discuss Kingsmen heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I didn't want any of this in the paper," he said, 
adding that his team tried to avoid running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Kingsmen beat Caltech, 33-5, Friday to open the three-game Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference series, Saturday's outcomes were 
a foregone conclusion. Cal Lutheran outhit the Beavers, 73-14, in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Barber pitched a perfect game in the opener and Jason Wilson hit for 
the cycle in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (3-1, 3-0 in SCIAC play) had 55 hits in the doubleheader. Slimak, 
however, could not recall many individual statistics about the games when 
reached at home. He left his scorebook at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Chad Miyata hit a pair of home runs in the first game.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN NEEDED TO BRING 
L.A. RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III, J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III is director of UCLA's Center 
for Afro-American Studies and an associate professor in the university's 
Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was the civil unrest of 1992, confined largely to the working 
poor, minority and immigrant neighborhoods of central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Malibu, Altadena and Laguna Beach fires, with their severe 
impact on predominantly middle- and upper-middle-income white homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 And now we've survived the great Northridge earthquake, which has left a 
number of San Fernando Valley and Westside residents homeless while tangling 
the travel of many commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 City residents, beach dwellers and suburbanites seldom interact -- and they 
rarely agree on what role government should play in redressing contemporary 
urban ills. But now these three segments of our population share the 
realization that without significant government intervention, the road to 
recovery may be blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably quick government action has already put Federal Emergency 
Management Agency checks into the hands of a number of people displaced by the 
earthquake. Crumpled freeways have been cleared. New construction is imminent, 
aided in no small measure by congressional support for $8.6 billion in 
emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, once the freeways have been repaired, housing replaced and 
cracked plaster fixed, old habits are likely to resurface. Metrolink ridership 
will decline. Those who traveled on surface streets through previously 
unfamiliar neighborhoods will return to the anonymity of daily freeway 
commutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally ominous, many individuals who were aided by government assistance once 
again will think unkindly of those who -- though not directly affected by the 
latest disaster -- nevertheless suffer mightily due to insufficient government 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that happens, is there any possibility of creating new coalitions, 
based on the quake-inspired recognition that our shared fates could spur 
problem solving that is both future-oriented and of benefit to us all? 
</P>
<P>
 For example, what if Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- in concert with 
several other mayors in the region -- were to convene a group of business 
owners small and large, representatives from financial and insurance 
institutions and various community-based leaders and challenge them to create a 
regional economic development plan that would have the following objectives: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing the number of jobs in the core area of each of their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing incentives designed to assure that a large percentage of any new 
jobs created would go to city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Engaging in a cooperative marketing strategy designed to enhance the 
competitiveness of the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Why these objectives? 
</P>
<P>
 The need to stimulate the economy through local job growth is obvious, and the 
earthquake has served to underscore the spatial mismatch between suburban 
housing and urban jobs. We either devise ways to reduce this disparity or 
suffer the consequences when the next disaster immobilizes our freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts at job creation must give highest priority to bringing the unemployed 
and underemployed into the work force. This would particularly benefit 
impoverished residents. Obvious side benefits of this strategy include crime 
reduction and fewer families on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperative marketing is needed because the events of the last two years have 
generated tremendous fear among would-be tourists and investors. Couple these 
fears with the persistent sluggishness of our economy, and extraordinary 
measures must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 With its own economic development plan, Los Angeles would be uniquely 
positioned to forge a partnership with the federal government that could tailor 
emerging programs to our region's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "empowerment zones" being created by the Clinton Administration are a good 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 These zones are the federal version of California's 13 enterprise zones. 
Empowerment zones will offer tax benefits to companies that locate within them, 
along with substantial investment of federal resources and enhanced 
coordination among federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal plan does not alleviate problems evident in California's 
enterprise zones. These zones have not stimulated significant job creation. 
Only the zones in Pacoima and San Jose have created more jobs than would have 
been expected otherwise. The Watts zone has shown a net loss in jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary reason for these disappointing results is that the incentives 
offered to employers for locating in such zones are not sufficient, compared to 
the competitive advantages of locations elsewhere. By the same token, many of 
the employers who have located in the zones were unaware of the program and 
never took advantage of the incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the federal program would be even more limited because of its 
narrow scope. Under current plans, Los Angeles will receive only one 
empowerment zone, and it will be limited to a 20-square-mile area with a 
population of no more than 200,000 and a high concentration of poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 How can we fix things? If linkages could be forged between firms beyond the 
zone and employers and residents within it, much more in the way of benefits 
could be produced. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the positive impact would multiply if the incentives were 
extended to companies outside the zone that subcontracted with firms inside it. 
The objective, after all, is to strengthen economic viability within the 
empowerment zone. Consequently, any employer that participates should enjoy the 
benefits of contributing to the objective. That change alone would link the 
relatively small empowerment zone to opportunities in the larger, regional 
economy.

 The key to making this work would be a truly regional economic development 
strategy, one that parallels the Southland's $183-billion investment in rail 
transit, the efforts to restructure the sprawling aerospace industry and the 
campaign to develop an alternative transportation industry in Southern 
California.

CULTURE WATCH; A LOOK BACK AT HOUSE OF FUTURE 
</P>

 Long before ToonTown, there was Disneyland's "House of the Future," which 
showcased modernistic ideas and gizmos. The house, which opened in June, 1957, 
was the brainchild of engineers and architects from Monsanto Chemical Co. and 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, a set of molded plastic modules attached to a central core, 
rested atop a pedestal near the entrance to Tomorrowland. Five main rooms were 
16 by 16 feet laid out on an X-shaped floor plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was plastic, fiberglass, vinyl, nylon, polyethylene or acrylics. 
Nothing would ever rust or need painting. There would be no cracked plaster, no 
leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
 At the touch of a button, the oven and refrigerator disappeared into a wall. 
Microwaves cooked food and ultrasound waves cleaned dirty dishes. Telephones 
possessed nifty features like push-button, preset dialing. Wall- and 
ceiling-mounted transceivers freed users to roam. 
</P>
<P>
 The "climate control center" filtered and cooled or heated the air and could 
also circulate a preferred scent in individual rooms. Foam-backed plastic floor 
coverings kept everyone walking softly. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 million visitors toured the "House of the Future" until it closed 
in September, 1967 -- it was obsolete. STEVE TICE

PARTNERS FOR LIFE; GAYS IN O.C. ARE INCREASINGLY CONFIRMING THEIR UNIONS BEFORE 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS. BUT CLERGY REMAINS SPLIT ON THE CEREMONIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Preparations for the beach wedding had already begun when Kay Wiker and Daniel 
Holmes got the bad news from the County of Orange: Weddings aren't permitted on 
county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiker, 33, had known what elements he wanted at his wedding even before he 
fully realized, at the age of 18, that he is gay. He wanted a ceremony on the 
sand, and under a full moon. His fiance, Holmes, 27, was determined that the 
orchid-covered bamboo wedding arch, illuminated by 100 tiki torches and candles 
held by each of the 150 guests, would be part of the ceremony at Laguna's West 
Street beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a twist that was both sweet and bitter to the participants, the 
county allowed the ceremony to go on as planned. The event, it seems, would be 
just a party in the eyes of county officials, not a wedding, since the state 
doesn't recognize gay unions as legal marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 So on June 4, 1993, Wiker and Holmes, in matching tailed tuxedos, exchanged 
rings while their seven attendants stood by on the sand. Amid live cello and 
flute music, two ministers read prayers and watched as the San Juan Capistrano 
couple recited their vows.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a ceremony that Wiker, aware of the apparent incongruity of the term, 
described as "old-fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was what I've always wanted to do. I wanted to show Daniel how much I'm 
willing to make a commitment to him, and do it in front of our friends," he 
said. "My straight friends are impressed that we did it so openly. But there 
shouldn't be anything unusual in it. When two gay people want to show their 
commitment, they should be able to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbians and gays increasingly are choosing to announce and confirm their 
relationships before friends, families and co-workers. Variously called 
same-sex covenants, relationship rituals or holy unions, the declarations of 
commitment are on the rise nationally, gay rights advocates say.  
</P>
<P>
 The ceremonies, advocates say, reflect the sheer number of flourishing 
same-sex partnerships. They also underscore the burgeoning political presence 
of gays and are fueling litigation efforts to gain state recognition of 
same-sex unions.  
</P>
<P>
 Because gay unions are not recognized as marriages by any state, they lack 
legal protections and privileges automatically granted to heterosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Although gay partners often have lawyers draft contracts and agreements that 
attempt to duplicate these benefits, it's estimated that such agreements can 
address only 60% of what is covered in a heterosexual marriage. For example, 
the agreements cannot guarantee the same protections in areas such as 
child-custody, pension plans, health coverage and Social Security benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 While states do not recognize the unions, some cities have chosen to do so. 
Laguna Beach is one of five in California -- the others being West Hollywood, 
Berkeley, Santa Cruz and San Francisco -- that offer varying degrees of 
recognition of same-sex unions. On a separate front, some private companies are 
choosing to extend spousal benefits to partners of their gay and lesbian 
employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Some gay commitment ceremonies announce the start of a relationship; most 
affirm partnerships that began years or even decades earlier. The ceremonies 
can also be political statements, as when more than 1,000 same-sex couples were 
simultaneously wed during last summer's March on Washington. The majority, 
however, are private parties held in homes, hotels and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 At Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood, Rabbi Denise L. Eger has performed 
hundreds of commitment ceremonies since 1988. She says the rituals, performed 
in the temple, homes or parks, often serve as a welcome vehicle for hesitant 
parents to show their support of their gay children's relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no official records are kept, the national total of gay unions is 
unknown. "We're talking about a community that does its best to remain hidden 
because of fear of losing jobs and getting their children taken away," said one 
gay-rights activist. However, the American Bar Assn.'s Family Law Conference 
has estimated that 10 million children are being raised in 3 million same-sex 
households nationwide. Nearly all states permit adoption for same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of gay unions remains discomforting to many people -- even to some 
who don't consider themselves anti-homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Diocese of the Episcopal Church, probably the most progressive 
mainline Christian denomination, debated at its recent convention whether the 
blessing of same-sex relationships should be sanctioned. After six hours of 
discussion, delegates failed to reach definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of two women or two men marrying is one that I don't see myself 
theologically able to endorse or accommodate," said the Rev. David Anderson of 
St. James' Episcopal Church in Newport Beach, whose delegation opposed the 
same-sex resolution. "The term marriage has referred to unique bond between a 
man and a woman, and the old medieval idea of marriage had to do with the 
production of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal priests who had previously blessed same-sex covenants, such as the 
Rev. George Regas at All Saints in Pasadena, continue to do so, and backers of 
the proposal say they will press the issue at the church's general convention 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Tuttle, pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Anaheim, says he sees 
homosexuality as a sin but dislikes being lumped together with "angry, hateful 
and militant" opponents of gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't condemn gays that way," Tuttle said. "But I wouldn't have the faith 
to (perform) a gay marriage, because I do believe it's not within God's will. 
We see it as a sin, and they don't. We don't condone homosexuality for the same 
reason we don't condone drunkenness, theft or encourage divorce. I don't 
embrace their lifestyle or value system." 
</P>
<P>
 But liberal clerics such as Regas believe gays should have a welcome home in 
the Christian church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The love of God revealed in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures is an 
inclusive love. That's the predominant theme of biblical literature," Regas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Christian commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples are performed by the 
Metropolitan Community Church, founded in 1968 for gays who feel uncomfortable 
in other churches. The church has more than 300 congregations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jane Carl, co-pastor of Ocean of Life MCC in Costa Mesa, has 
performed about 50 same-sex ceremonies. Like heterosexual candidates for 
marriage, gay partners meet at least three times with Carl before the ceremony 
to discuss the emotional, spiritual and legal aspects of their union. Carl 
requires couples to have lived together for at least one year before the 
ceremony, and they must also attend her church at least three times if they 
don't go to church elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want the support of this church, they need to know what it is that's 
supporting them," Carl said. "If it's just God's support they want, they can do 
(the ceremony) under a tree, and God will recognize their vows no matter where 
they do them." 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of AIDS, Carl says, has played a role in encouraging long-term gay 
unions, especially among men. "Gay men are becoming much more monogamous in the 
face of AIDS," she said. "You see a lot of commitment to not fooling around." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the ceremonies Carl has conducted, 70% have been between women. At 
Congregation Kol Ami gay men take vows just as often as lesbians, which is a 
change from the late 1980s, Rabbi Eger said. She attributes the change to a 
renewal of the values of commitment in the gay male community, prompted by the 
AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl estimates that nationally, three of every five gay commitment ceremonies 
are non-religious. "The reason, I think, is that the church has done so much 
damage to gay and lesbian people spiritually that many are totally convinced 
that God will have no part of them. So they say, why do the ceremony in a 
church?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Micki Clark of Orange County are among the lesbian couples who chose 
to include Christian passages in their wedding. The two met through a gay 
dating service last March and held a commitment ceremony just two months later. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It was love at first sight," said Chris, 31, who is a state employee. "We 
believe in God, and I wanted to have my lifelong partner marry me because it's 
more of a commitment, more bonding. It's not only a religious but a social bond 
when you're out there in front of your friends and family." 
</P>
<P>
 The wedding, performed by the Rev. Rosalind Russell of Laguna Beach, was held 
in the recreation room of the Clarks' apartment complex and was followed by a 
party that lasted nearly eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest list -- which grew from 20 to 42 as more friends and co-workers 
began to show interest in attending -- included "gay, straight, old and young," 
said Micki, 27, an administrative assistant for a rehabilitation firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Micki's sister served as bridesmaid, Chris' nephew was the ring-bearer, and 
Chris' former brother-in-law gave away the bride to Chris, who dressed in a tux 
and tails. 
</P>
<P>
 Micki, who legally changed her last name to match Chris', plans to have a baby 
through alternative insemination. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's parents, however, didn't attend the ceremony. Micki's parents, 
she said, "would rather see us married to males, but that's their opinion. Gay 
people have the right to be married too. We're in love." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, who has performed 40 same-sex unions at various venues since 1991, 
offers to intercede and speak to parents who balk at their children's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents often support the couples, but not always," Russell said. "Some 
parents live out of state, so the (children) don't push (for them to come). The 
couples that do have families involved have a much stronger basis for their 
marriage, as with any relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the gay couples who are wed at Kol Ami, about one-fifth have parents who 
boycott the ceremony on principle. Another 25% of the parents, Eger says, are 
hesitant but find that the ceremony is a way to heal their relationship with 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say the parents are not dealing well with their child's sexual orientation," 
Eger says. "Then they get a call from the child announcing the ceremony. The 
parents resist at first but know they have to do the right thing and show up. 
And it has a positive effect. A wedding is a wedding. There's music and loving 
words said." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits challenging states' policies of withholding marriage licenses from 
gays have become a priority among gay-rights lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the policy in California was unsuccessfully challenged by two West 
Hollywood men who sued after the Los Angeles county clerk denied their 
application for a marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hawaii, where the state's constitution specifically addresses the issue of 
discrimination based on sex, a pending suit may fare better, said J Craig Fong 
of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which has brought the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico and New Jersey may also soon be targeted for marriage license suits 
because those states' constitutions and case laws show potential for being 
challenged, Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the courts are deciding whether the definitions of marriage should be 
expanded, some private companies have rewritten their policies to include more 
non-traditional couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Some began by offering health and other benefits to the unmarried partners of 
heterosexual employees and then extended the benefit to the partners of gay and 
lesbian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley initiated a benefits program 
for domestic partners last year, his rationale was as American as apple pie, 
said company spokesman Frank O'Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was concerned that we could have a potential disadvantage recruiting the 
best talent if gay people knew they couldn't get adequate health benefits," 
O'Mahony said. Sculley's competitive pragmatism, the spokesman added, was 
accompanied by a personal belief that denying benefits to committed gay couples 
is simply unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies offering domestic partnership benefits include Levi Strauss, 
Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream and Stanford University. Some film studios and 
recording companies are also reportedly considering the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Such benefits, however, may not be as lucrative as they seem, according to the 
Partners Task Force for Gay and Lesbian Couples, an advocacy group based in 
Seattle. The Internal Revenue Service calculates the dollar value of domestic 
partnership benefits, then adds that on to the working partner's income, 
according to the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights advocates say the very fact that gay unions are not 
state-recognized is proof that the ceremonies are reflections of love rather 
than arrangements of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this in spite of the fact that there's no legal or economic 
benefit," said Eger, who has been wed nine years to her lesbian partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're discriminated against by the state from building stable, 
normative lives, I have people who have been together 18, 20, 24 years. I find 
it ironic that the radical right wants to paint the gay community as 
promiscuous, evil-doing and predatory when the reality is gay and lesbian 
commitment ceremonies are really about celebrating gay and lesbian stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Eger concedes, however, that divorces among gay partners occur nearly as 
frequently as they do in heterosexual marriages. In such cases, she encourages 
her gay couples as well as her straight couples to undergo what she calls "a 
sacred ceremony of dissolutionment." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do create ceremonies of closure and separation," Eger says. "In 
(prenuptial) counseling we talk of what happens when the relationship doesn't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Daniel Holmes, who was wed on the moonlit beach, his relationship 
has become stronger since the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceremony strengthened it. We'd both had previous long-term relationships, 
and in this one, there's not that thought that one of us could walk out the 
door. This is the most settled and loving time I've had in my life."

STORMING THE CITADEL; FOR 151 YEARS, THE STATE COLLEGE HAS BEEN ALL MALE. THAT 
TRADITION MAY FALL IF SHANNON FAULKNER GETS HER WAY. AMONG HER BIG-NAME FOES: 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
</P>

 "The success of Citadel men is no surprise. . .This experience builds 
character and self-confidence, instills integrity and honor. The Citadel refers 
to it as developing the 'Whole Man,' that which you will become if you complete 
the challenge before you . . . a 'Citadel Man.' " -- Lt. Gen. Claudius E. Watts 
III, president, the Citadel, in a message to 1993 freshman * 
</P>
<P>
 The first question Shannon Faulkner usually gets is: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Why in the world would a teen-ager who collects antique teddy bears and 
porcelain masks want to force herself into a place like the Citadel? 
</P>
<P>
 A place where the first thing they do to you is shave your head and make you 
walk in the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would someone who calls herself a Southern belle -- and cringes at the 
label "feminist" -- opt to go up against this 151-year-old institution in a 
legal battle? 
</P>
<P>
 Since suing this military-flavored state college over its males-only 
admissions policy, Faulkner has been rattling off her reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A good education, she told "Good Morning America" and "Today." 
</P>
<P>
 The discipline of military training at a college near her home, she told Time 
and Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary Citadel network could be hers someday, she always concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the not too distant future, maybe during a job interview or at a 
professional conference somewhere, she'd like to flash that coveted Citadel 
ring, with its rifle and saber, and get a flash of recognition in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always asking me if I really think the network is going to work 
for me too," says Faulkner, who wants to be a teacher, not a soldier -- not 
even a soldier/citizen. "If I wear the ring just like they do, I believe so, 
yes, because I made it through the same system they did. I believe they'll 
respect me just as much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Faulkner is not typical of the barrier-breakers America has come to 
know since the 1960s. She is a quiet achiever, not a brick-thrower. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if she is typical of anything, it is of a Citadel cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 She has those "yes ma'am, no ma'am" Southern manners. She was a varsity 
athlete and drum major in the marching band at her high school in Powdersville, 
a small town 200 miles northwest of here, where the politics are conservative 
and the accents lilt. She plays the flute, tuba and xylophone. She has military 
in her family, although no Citadel graduates. Her love for the South is 
all-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in everything that the South used to believe in -- the Old 
South. But I still believe in Southern hospitality, a Southern gentleman and a 
Southern belle," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as Citadel men pride themselves on being gentleman and on enduring 
hardship without whining, Faulkner boasts her skills as a steel magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 In junior high, she dislocated her kneecap and had to have surgery. The 
physical pain was excruciating but she never squawked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A true Southern woman will not cry in public because that is not what she is 
taught," she says. "It's an emotion that you feel only when you're by yourself. 
I know women of my grandmother's generation who will not cry at their husband's 
funeral. They wait until they're all by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet confronting the Citadel the way Faulkner has -- literally challenging its 
manhood -- would test the strength of the toughest Southern granny. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner has been called a lesbian by a perfect stranger; her car was heaped 
with garbage and her parents' home pelted with eggs; she has received piles of 
mostly hate mail from people calling her such names as "sick bitch" and 
"loser." When she answered a question during a class at the Citadel, she was 
hissed. The teacher ignored the disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I came here, I talked to some graduates and they said, 'Well, the 
stuff you've been going through outweighs any of the hell we went through our 
first year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Faulkner may not be in the Corps of Cadets yet -- she can 
attend class but cannot wear the uniform, live in the barracks nor eat in the 
mess hall while a federal court weighs her case -- but she's getting some knob 
(as freshman are called) treatment. Minus the pushups. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, who started taking classes last month, is describing these 
experiences during an interview at the Charleston home of her lawyer, where she 
is living temporarily. She speaks confidently, yet sometimes sounds like a 
self-conscious 19-year-old who despite her best efforts, still cares what other 
people think -- and how she looks. 
</P>
<P>
 When a photographer begins taking her picture, Faulkner, who recently lost 10 
pounds and had a perm, grabs a small pillow on the couch and hugs it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to photographers, but I'm not," she says dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner's first notion to apply to the Citadel came around Christmas, 1992, 
her senior year. A teacher had assigned her class to read a Sports Illustrated 
article that vividly described recent incidents of racism and hazing against 
freshmen at the Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner and her classmates were stunned that this behavior went on -- and at 
taxpayers' expense. Faulkner was even more stunned when the teacher mentioned 
that all but one of the 16 students in the class -- a boy -- could not enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner can't recall exactly why, but she immediately filled out an 
application.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, she asked her guidance counselor to white-out all references to her 
gender on her transcript and send it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, I never thought they would accept me," says Faulkner, 
who had applied to other South Carolina state schools. "I figured somehow they 
would know I was a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner is convinced that the Citadel admissions officials barely looked at 
her transcript. If they had, they would have noticed "Varsity Softball, Six 
Years" written on the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Varsity softball in South Carolina means girls," Faulkner says. "The boys 
here play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not long before the school got wind of Faulkner's ruse and revoked her 
acceptance -- even though she was academically superior to the 1993 freshman 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had a 3.7 grade-point average and a 1,040 total score on her SATs; 
Citadel freshman average a 2.5 grade-point and 967 on their SATs. (The school 
accepts nearly everybody who applies: Of the 1,472 applicants from last year, 
1,236 were accepted, 611 enrolled and 80% were from the South.) 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner filed her lawsuit soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been pushed by outside forces," Faulkner says. "There was just 
something inside of me that wanted to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Citadel cadets, it is a major sticking point that Faulkner's 
application was predicated on a lie. She was violating the honor code 
emblazoned on the front of each of the four barracks: "A cadet does not lie, 
cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Citadel men could get beyond that -- and most can't -- every time 
Shannon Faulkner walks across the parade grounds where cadets have been proudly 
marching every Friday since the Civil War or when she walks on the sidewalk 
instead of in the gutter, she is walking all over their traditions.  
</P>
<P>
 And from the youngest, palest, skinniest cadet to strapping Gen. Watts 
himself, they make it clear: That hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's not enough just to ask why Faulkner wants to go there. Women have 
been storming men's clubs since before the first Citadel cadet lifted a musket. 
</P>
<P>
 A better question is why the Citadel is fighting to defend something that 
seems anathema in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Why 18 years after West Point and Annapolis accepted women and during a time 
when women are Supreme Court justices and astronauts and corporate presidents 
and even top commanders in Charleston's naval stations, does the Citadel still 
not want women in the Corps of Cadets? 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Wetherington, a cherubic- faced son of a service station owner from 
Hilton Head, S.C., says the answers are all over campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just take a look around," he says, guiding a visitor through every building 
and explaining every monument. "It just wouldn't be the same here. Why does 
this place have to become like every place else?" 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop on Wetherington's tour is the Citadel museum, chockablock with 
the intertwined history of the Citadel, the Civil War and the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was founded in 1842 by an act of the South Carolina Legislature to 
keep peace and prevent slave rebellions. Historians credit Citadel cadets with 
firing the shots that started the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus itself looks like a collection of castles in Camelot with 
crenelated turrets. The class buildings and four barracks are laid out in a 
square around a vast but impeccable parade ground. Walking the campus are 
young, clean-shaven men in gray uniforms and shiny shoes. On a rainy day, they 
walk erect to class wearing long gray slickers and brimmed hats. But even on a 
sunny day, they would seem purposeful. You'd never see a cadet sprawled on the 
grass or throwing a Frisbee across the green. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetherington, the senior class president who hopes his 3.0 average and Citadel 
connections will help him get into medical school, says there's no time for 
such frivolity. In fact, the regimentation of student life and intramural 
sports leaves time for little else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have the most brilliant students here," he says. "There's 
so much else going on other than academics." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesdays and Thursdays, there is a 7 a.m. drill; every day there are sweeps 
and muster formations; Saturday morning inspection is 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., and, 
of course, Friday 2:20 to 5 p.m. is parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman year is particularly grueling because the goal -- almost the sport -- 
is to weed out the fainthearted. It is easy to pick out the freshman, turning 
corners at 90-degree angles as they walk the campus. In the snack bar, they're 
the acne-faced boys leaning against the counters and staring blankly at their 
slice of "Itza Pizza." They're not allowed to sit down at the snack bar, but 
many choose to eat there before meals because in the mess hall, they must sit 
at attention throughout the meal and serve upperclassmen water and condiments. 
That doesn't leave much time to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're yelled at whether you do something wrong or right," recalls 
Wetherington of his first year. "But after freshman year, there's relief. And 
by sophomore year, if you shine your shoes and do what you're supposed to do, 
you're a leader and you can guide and direct freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's image has certainly been tarnished by upperclassmen who have 
decided to give as good as they got -- if not worse. Pat Conroy, a 1967 
graduate, wrote an unsentimental novel, "The Lords of Discipline," about a 
group of cadets literally torturing the first black cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have your instances when upperclassmen get a little nuts or 
overzealous," Wetherington says. "But those cases will be taken care of and 99% 
will get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 But every decade or so, the school takes stock of hazing and racism, ordering 
up reports on barracks life after hours and recommending changes. For example, 
Hell Night was recently banned, and in 1992, "Dixie" was finally given up as a 
fight song at football games because it offended black faculty and cadets. 
Defenders insist that an average Saturday night on Fraternity Row across the 
country makes life in the unsupervised barracks seem tame. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark life in those barracks, the regimentation, the man-against-man 
competition, the common showers are all critical to turning boys into Citadel 
men and are examples of a rigorous standard that women would change, cadets 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the pushups. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a semester, every student must run two miles in 15 minutes, 54 seconds; 
do 42 pushups and 52 sit-ups.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having girls here would lower our standards," Wetherington says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deposition in this case, Gen. Watts insisted that women would "take away 
from the wholistic experience. . . .You're going to have equals among unequals. 
You're going to have dual standards." 
</P>
<P>
 So what if women can't do 42 pushups, says Shannon Faulkner's advocates; many 
cadets also cannot. Those who don't pass the twice-semester test are put into a 
remedial group and must take extra physical education. But a cadet who never 
meets the physical standards still can graduate and wear the ring, Wetherington 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Wetherington notes that physical standards are only part of why women 
wouldn't succeed at the Citadel: Women would inhibit discussions, he says, and 
male cadets wouldn't open up emotionally if they were in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 (Wetherington, the chief religious leader among cadets, notes with a smile 
that he is taking several science classes this semester as well as evolution to 
"learn how the other side thinks.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The learning environment is obviously one of a kind," says Wetherington, 
interrupting himself with a grimace. "Well, now it's two of a kind. If you put 
a woman in class, you have to watch everything you say. If you call somebody a 
'girl' you can get a sexual harassment charge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, in the mess hall among 2,000 cadets, several cadets raise the same 
idea: their fear of women squelching camaraderie. There were similar acrimony 
and doomsayers when blacks first enrolled in the mid-1960s. Did that change 
wreck the school? 
</P>
<P>
 Norman P. Doucet Jr., the top cadet this year, is calm and eloquent about the 
life of "Citadel men," and he is one of the few cadets who doesn't use the 
"distraction" defense against women cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put Shannon in this environment, she could march; she could attend 
parade. That's not the point. The point is the majority of students here pay to 
come here. And they're not interested in having women here; let them go to an 
all-female military institution." 
</P>
<P>
 Doucet becomes agitated only when Faulkner is compared to Charles Foster, who 
ended segregation at the school in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ludicrous comparison," he says. "There is a difference between male 
and female. Physiologically and psychologically. With white and black men, 
there is no real difference except the color of their skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight years after Foster desegregated the Citadel, Doucet became the 
first black regimental commander of the Corps of Cadets. It was an appointment 
made by the administration during the same school year that Sports Illustrated 
skewered the Citadel for racism and Shannon Faulkner blasted it for sex 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the publicity frenzy that has followed Faulkner, the administration has 
often asked Doucet to represent the Citadel's view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is choice not discrimination," Doucet says. "Charles Foster was a 
man. A black man. In company units you live, eat and sleep together. There is 
no separatism like at other colleges." 
</P>
<P>
 He can't understand why Faulkner doesn't want to attend a U.S. military 
academy and isn't convinced of her argument that she is committed to South 
Carolina, not to the military, and that as a taxpayer she should have the right 
to attend a school that receives 28% of its funds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says doesn't want to destroy the Citadel. . ." Doucet says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, she does," interrupts Ronald Doyle, the master chief petty officer. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . .But when it's gone, it's gone for ever," continues Doucet, who concluded 
from a visit to a friend at West Point that women had "eroded that system." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing we can do for Shannon," he adds, "is train her to be an 
outstanding young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Wetherington concludes the tour with a similar message to Faulkner: "As you 
can see, the Citadel is unique. We hope Shannon finds someplace else to get 
what she wants. But leave us alone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a wealth of legal issues likely to come out in this battle, which 
resumes Thursday in U.S. District Court in Charleston.  
</P>
<P>
 Is it tolerable for the state to support a school that bans women? Is the 
Citadel so unique? Does the state have a legitimate interest in educating men 
separate from women? Could a separate school be created for women that would be 
equal? 
</P>
<P>
 Already some of these issues have been raised in pleadings before the courts, 
including the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side has an impressive legal team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel has recruited lawyers from firms in Charleston, Washington and 
Atlanta, including former Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell. The state of South Carolina 
is also representing the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her Powdersville lawyer and the U.S. Justice Department, 
Faulkner has attorneys from Charleston, New York and Washington. And she has 
the American Civil Liberties on her side -- which, Faulkner points out, is not 
necessarily a plus in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been well schooled in the ACLU's involvement in desegregation in the 
1960s and understands what their reappearances means in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU really ticks a lot of people off down here," she says. "It's like 
'Here they come again."' 
</P>
<P>
 Many issues in this case have already been played out through a similar case 
made by the Justice Department against the Virginia Military Institute, the 
only other all-male, state-supported military college in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered co-education at VMI 
but offered three alternatives: admit women, go private or create a parallel 
program for women. 
</P>
<P>
 The school chose the third remedy and last week presented to the district 
court a plan to add a military component to Mary Baldwin College, a women's 
school also in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina's legislature has already worked up a report concluding this 
could work for the Citadel, too. 
</P>
<P>
 So just as the state sends its veterinary students to Georgia because there's 
no vet school in South Carolina, it could send Citadel women to Mary Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Dawes Cooke Jr., the Citadel's lawyer, says he'll present witnesses to show 
an educational justification for the state to support single-gender schools 
such as the Citadel, and to provide an explanation for why there is no 
all-female counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we had one," Cooke says. "Winthrop College. . . .But there was no 
interest. It was on the verge of really going out of business back in 1972 when 
it went co-ed." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was more than 20 years ago," counters Valorie Vojdik, Faulkner's New 
York counsel. "Plus, neither Winthrop nor Mary Baldwin are the Citadel. Part of 
what they're arguing is how unique the school is. Well, we don't believe the 
education, the network, the training can be replicated at Mary Baldwin nor 
anywhere else. The only proper remedy to this case is to integrate." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vojdik says she will rebuke any claims that all-male schools serve society 
similarly to all-female schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there's scant evidence that proves the value of single-gender 
education for college men," she says. "They're not the ones falling behind in 
the classroom. And if there's a group that has been privileged, it has been 
white men in South Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at a recent meeting, the school's governing Board of Visitors -- all but 
one white male Citadel graduates -- seemed confident of the direction of the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Watts, whose father and son graduated from the Citadel, told them that he 
was delighted by the $200,000 raised through one mailing to alumni for a legal 
defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unheard of in fund-raising circles," Watts says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school has a much bigger fund-raising challenge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few years, the school must replace the campus's four barracks, 
which are 50 to 70 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 At a price of $50 million and with needs from all funding sources, the general 
can't afford to anger the South Carolina legislators, the alumni nor corporate 
America, which might be reluctant to give money to a school aggressively 
keeping women out. (Although, the all-male tradition clearly didn't stop Ted 
Turner, president of CNN and a graduate of the Citadel -- like his sons Ted 
Jr., Beau and Rhett -- from pledging $25 million last week, the largest 
donation in the school's history.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Citadel is facing a changing mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emphasis is still military, students are decreasingly signing up 
after college. Less than one-third of the students now join the service, and by 
the time Shannon Faulkner's class graduates, less than 20% will seek military 
commissions.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather, most Citadel graduates now head straight for the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is a fervent Citadel loyalist, Stephen Columbia, who attended the 
school in the late '70s, thinks Citadel men might as well learn to work with 
women in college because they'll be working with them once they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just educating officers in the U.S. military anymore; we're 
educating private sector leaders," says Columbia, who lives in Boston and 
recruits for the school all over New England. "This is a remarkable place. We 
have no cheating, no borrowing exams. . . .So to reduce this school and its 
extraordinary opportunity to a last bastion of single-gender education 
diminishes its value." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Columbia repeatedly points out that he in no way represents the 
alumni nor administration's position, perhaps they too have an inkling that the 
future might mean change. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report in the Charleston Post and Courier in October, the Board 
of Visitors approved an architectural design for the first barracks that allow 
for a future with female cadets, says Col. Bob Barton, a Citadel official. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the design, it's easy to convert some areas that are essentially storage 
areas into latrines and showers," he says. "We're not automatically doing it, 
but if the courts order us to admit women, we can make changes at minimal 
costs."

JAPAN SEEKS TO STAVE OFF TRADE CURBS; DIPLOMACY: HOSOKAWA THINKS BREAKDOWN OF 
TALKS WILL NOT LEAD TO IMMEDIATE U.S. SANCTIONS. HE SUGGESTS MEASURES WOULD BE 
ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Saturday sought to stave off 
American retaliation against Japanese products following the breakdown in trade 
talks between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he (President Clinton) will be thinking immediately about 
sanctions," Hosokawa told a news conference here shortly before departing for 
Tokyo. "I don't think the failure of an agreement will lead immediately to 
sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks reflected a last-ditch hope that the Clinton Administration, in 
its unhappiness with Japan's trade policies, will confine itself to rhetoric 
and will not take concrete actions to restrict Japanese exports to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility appears remote. After Clinton and Hosokawa failed to resolve 
their differences at a three-hour meeting at the White House on Friday, a 
senior Administration official told reporters, "The reality is, we'll take some 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Hosokawa suggested that Japan might try to argue that new 
American trade sanctions would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very much hope that the United States will refrain from resorting to 
unilateral actions that would be in contravention" of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, the Japanese prime minister declared. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to international trade laws that prevent one country from 
acting on its own to limit goods from another nation. Under December's GATT 
agreement, a new World Trade Organization will run what Japan hopes will be an 
effective panel for resolving disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the latest round of trade talks broke down, U.S. officials immediately 
began discussing the possible revival of a trade provision known as Super 301, 
which would permit U.S. retaliation against specific industries within a 
country if that nation is found to be violating existing trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 That section of American trade law was particularly disliked by Japan because 
it required an annual review of trade barriers abroad and mandated U.S. 
retaliation if the barriers were not lifted. The law expired in 1990, but 
Clinton could reimpose it on his own with an executive order, or he could 
support legislation proposed by Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) and 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) that would do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The American position is that trade restrictions imposed under Super 301 do 
not violate GATT because they are in retaliation for another country's limits 
on American products overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Clinton Administration argues that it reserved the right to 
impose these trade restrictions in Tokyo last summer when it adopted a broad 
"framework agreement" aimed at reducing the $60-billion-a-year trade imbalance 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between the two major trading partners is over how to reduce 
Japan's trade surplus in four economic sectors -- autos and auto parts, medical 
equipment, telecommunications equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, agreed in Tokyo last July 
that they would establish a framework for setting "objective criteria" by which 
progress in reducing the trade surplus could be measured. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House on Friday, the President and the Japanese prime minister 
told reporters that there needs to be a "cooling-off period" before the two 
countries try again to resolve their deep differences. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Saturday's news conference, Hosokawa, whose public support in Japan has 
been plummeting, suggested he might like to try to negotiate again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he showed no flexibility on what Japanese officials insist is a 
fundamental disagreement between the two governments over how to judge progress 
in redressing the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has pushed for objective standards in judging 
whether Japan's markets are opened or closed. U.S. officials say they want to 
use hard data, like comparing the percentage of sales in Japan that go to 
imports with the comparable percentages in other industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has responded by saying that this approach would amount to "numerical 
targets" and would be "managed trade," in violation of free-market principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton contended Friday that he is not seeking fixed numerical targets and is 
willing to temper the use of percentages by taking into account such factors as 
exchange rates and changes in domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa on Saturday rejected Clinton's explanation. "Some of the objective 
criteria that the U.S. side sought -- they used various words to express them 
-- we feel were the same as numerical targets," he said. "And we feel that this 
runs counter to the deregulation that we, the Hosokawa administration, have 
taken as its basic principles." 
</P>
<P>
 Managed trade, he said, "is something that we must avoid at all costs. That is 
our basic position. Therefore, we will not modify our position." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Hosokawa's actions won wide support. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what," said Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of the Keidanren, the country's 
leading business group, "Japan cannot accept America's effort to bring about 
managed trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Yohei Kono, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats, also lent support to 
the prime minister. "For Hosokawa to reject the American proposal was simply 
common sense," he said today. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Hosokawa also hinted that Japan may not be able to go 
along with proposals for economic sanctions against North Korea if these 
sanctions require Japan to impose strict limits on the money sent home by North 
Koreans living in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials have suggested that cutting off these "remittances" from 
Japan to North Korea could be one of the ways used to pressure Pyongyang to 
give up a nuclear weapons program. North Korea warned Saturday that any 
economic sanctions would amount to a declaration of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa told Clinton that Japan will support sanctions against North Korea 
"to the extent permitted by Japanese law."

COLUMN ONE; A NATION WITH PERIL ON ITS MIND; CRIME HAS BECOME THE TOP CONCERN 
OF MANY PEOPLE. MUCH OF THE ANXIETY IS FUELED BY A PERCEPTION OF VIOLENCE, NOT 
THE STATISTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a long, harrowing season of death, Americans are preoccupied more than 
ever by violent crime, an obsession as old as the highwayman and as newly 
minted as a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Common wisdom holds that the sudden trajectory of anxiety burst, fully formed, 
from last year's rush of high-profile killings -- the Long Island 
commuter-train massacre, mass murders at family restaurants and fatal 
abductions of suburban children. 
</P>
<P>
 But high levels of personal fear -- the quickening panic that leads people to 
bolt doors and glance backward on city streets -- have been inescapable facts 
of life for three decades. That pervasive alarm has been fueled by the 
long-term growth of juvenile violence, the emergence of new offenses such as 
holdups at automated teller machines, and the decade-long spread of drug and 
gang deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed dramatically is the percentage of Americans who now put crime 
issues at the top of the country's most important problems. The upsurge -- from 
21% last June to 43% last month in a new Los Angeles Times Poll -- marks a 
watershed in public concern about crime, said Tom W. Smith, a polling expert 
with the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear flows with its own infernal logic. The upsurge is not driven by a sudden 
rising tide of crime; the rate of violent episodes, although much higher than 
three decades ago, is down slightly from peaks in the 1980s. The difference is 
in the perception of crime's pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans appear threatened by examples of mayhem they read and hear 
about in their own communities, heightening the belief that the world beyond is 
becoming less safe and that crime requires urgent national attention. Sensing 
that these new signals come largely from middle-class America, politicians who 
had for years rarely addressed the horrendous crime levels of poor city 
neighborhoods now feel compelled to offer solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll found that while 41% of those who said they felt safe in their 
neighborhoods cite crime as a most pressing national issue, the percentage 
jumps to 51% among those who said they felt unsafe. The poll, which surveyed 
1,516 respondents across the country from Jan. 15 to Jan. 19, had a margin of 
sampling error of plus or minus 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is what's close to home," said Jerry Westwood, a regional 
parks supervisor who said he hears gunfire almost every night near his home in 
Aurora, Ill., a city of 100,000 people west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are both real and contradictory. Violent crime actually dropped by 
3% nationally in the first six months of 1993, according to the FBI, after 
similar reductions over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence waned slightly in the suburbs, and overall Americans say they don't 
feel any less safe in their homes or neighborhoods than they did in 1981. But 
murder rates ratcheted upward in small towns, medium-sized cities and urban 
centers with populations between 500,000 and 1 million. Homicide records were 
demolished in 22 cities, from Baltimore to Phoenix, Brockton, Mass., to 
Jackson, Miss., even in the two capitals President Clinton calls home: Little 
Rock, Ark., and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 From Trudy Sundberg, who rallied 800 residents of Oak Harbor, Wash., after a 
school fistfight, to the President, who was restrained by aides from rushing to 
a Washington city pool where six children were shot last year, Americans seize 
upon nearby instances as certain evidence that crime threatens to overwhelm us 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of a get-acquainted chat with Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar last 
September, Bob Haisman, the new president of the Illinois Education Assn., 
broke down, weeping, as he recounted the slaying a week earlier of a popular 
athlete in Hinsdale, a Chicago suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one feels safe anymore. Parents are just petrified," Haisman said. "My 
God! What a society!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hinsdale South High School, where Haisman has taught social studies for 25 
years, is a placid campus where 85% of the students go on to college. When 
17-year-old Barrett Modisette was slain, allegedly by another student as he 
walked home from a football game, the school's sense of safety was instantly 
dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Haisman's impassioned, awkward display set the governor to thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have shootings on the South Side of Chicago -- it doesn't get the 
attention," Edgar said later in an interview. "In Hinsdale, they're shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Edgar, a longtime proponent of traditional tough-on-crime 
strategies, endorsed a ban on assault weapons. This was an unexpected tack for 
a Republican leader who has depended on support from the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar's new approach could also be ascribed to more overt political reasons -- 
for one, he is up for reelection this fall -- but the grim stories that he and 
other leaders have heard from citizens in recent months convinced many that a 
defining moment is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of explanations for the public's mood swing: Times Poll 
Director John Brennan and other public-opinion experts see the crime issue 
simply slipping into prominence and into the vacuum left by an improving 
economy; some political leaders say the public's mood shifted as suburban 
America realized city terrors can also afflict them; a few criminologists cite 
"fear fatigue," the refusal to live in fear any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as mid-1991, only a miniscule number of Americans cited crime as a 
major national concern. And though that number rose to 17% by January, 1993, it 
was still eclipsed by the economy and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 When 17 police executives sat down for a two-day crime conference that month, 
they concluded that violence was sweeping their cities and that policy-makers 
had to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 30-page report, issued last April, brimmed with sobering figures: 
Violent crime in the United States increased 371% since 1960, a rate nine times 
faster than the increase in the nation's population. Homicides tripled; rapes 
burgeoned by 500%. 
</P>
<P>
 The document tumbled into a void. The police officials sent a copy to the 
White House, but all they got in reply was a three-sentence acknowledgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't exactly take the nation by storm," said Daniel Rosenblatt, director 
of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, which sponsored the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Clinton had been "champing at the bit to speak" on the subject 
during his campaign against George Bush, pollster and adviser Stanley B. 
Greenberg said aides damped down his fervor, worried that too much crime talk 
might hand a natural advantage to Republicans, who had exploited the 
law-and-order issue since Richard Nixon's victory in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was elected, Clinton often stressed his support for a national police 
corps and the omnibus crime bill. But crime remained a secondary issue, 
submerged by health care reform and the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last June 22, a gunman raked a southeast Washington municipal swimming 
pool with gunfire, wounding six children. The next day, an agitated Clinton 
told his staff he wanted to go to the pool to console the youths' families and 
make a forceful point about the pervasive damage violence does to American 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But a crucial budget vote was scheduled the next week. Staffers "convinced him 
it was more important at the time to keep his focus on the economic package," 
said domestic policy aide Bruce Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's reluctance to speak out forcefully on crime in early 
1993, despite Clinton's own inclinations, shows how cautious many 
opinion-makers were in acknowledging its importance. The crime rate has not 
changed appreciably since then -- despite their newfound eagerness to attend to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ted Gurr, a University of Maryland researcher, Americans' fears 
have been most pronounced after turbulent periods of street crime and urban 
unrest. The 1850s, the 1920s and the 1960s were all decades, Gurr said, when 
the marked rise of real crime and its perception were closely tied. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the public's current obsession is unusual. Although overall 
violent-crime rates rose in the late 1980s, the trends have tailed off during 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the numbers, the general population doesn't appear to be more at 
risk than a few years ago," said Michael R. Rand, an analyst taking part in the 
Justice Department's annual survey of crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest available indicator of random violence, Rand said, is 
stranger-on-stranger violence, which shows little increase from 1992 to 1993 -- 
from 3.4 million reported incidents to 3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even mass murders, one of the most inexplicable of crimes, have occurred at a 
predictable pace in recent years. Northeastern University crime expert James 
Alan Fox, who has researched recorded mass murders back to the mid-1960s, says 
slayings of four or more people in one location are rare, occurring in the 
United States about twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to go on that would make us worry that it's getting worse," 
Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all through the fall, television and print reports linked each new crime 
in the national spotlight with the public's growing preoccupation with 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The week after Colin Ferguson is alleged to have killed six people on a Long 
Island commuter train, Time magazine responded with a cover showing a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic Ruger superimposed over Ferguson's brooding face. 
Beside it was the word "Enough!" 
</P>
<P>
 The impression that Americans were fed up came from "talk over the barbecue," 
said Time Managing Editor James R. Gaines. "It is a gut thing, a sense that, 
though maybe it's from a middle-class commuter's perspective, this craziness 
has even invaded the sacred precinct of a 5:33 p.m. commuter train." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite ample evidence of crime's omnipresence for more than a decade, the 
press has, for the most part, covered crime "schizophrenically" because it is 
entwined with "such a web of class and race," said Jon Katz, media critic for 
Rolling Stone magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The fusing of last year's high-profile killings with the growing legislative 
debate on guns and crime made the overall issue of violence appear as "a sudden 
crisis," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most intense reactions to press coverage of crime comes from small towns 
and suburban Americans. The poll found 72% of small town residents and 69% of 
suburbanites say their feelings about crime are stirred most by what they see, 
hear and read in the media. Overall, 65% cite news coverage as the main 
influence on their attitudes; by contrast, 21% say they are most affected by 
their own and acquaintances' experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also found that 32% of respondents said their fear of crime was 
heightened by specific incidents reported by the press. Of those, 19% cited 
instances that received widespread publicity, among them the kidnaping and 
slaying of 12-year-old Polly Klaas from her Petaluma, Calif., home, the 
shooting spree on the Long Island train and the murders of tourists in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 17%, however, named approximately 150 other crimes that made news in 
their own communities but drew little notice elsewhere. The list is a national 
police blotter: shootings at junior highs in Wyoming and Jefferson City, Mo.; 
carjackings in New Mexico and Colorado; a yogurt shop slaying in Austin, Tex. 
Gunfire, abduction, rape and murders are described in a succession of mundane 
locales, from malls to automated teller machines to a Connecticut police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can identify with these victims," Smith said. "They could have been 
where these victims were." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Sundberg read stories in Seattle newspapers and national magazines 
about brutality in the poorest sectors of America's cities. Abstract concern 
percolated in the back of her mind, she said, but she felt comfortably 
distanced in Oak Harbor, a Navy town of 20,000 people on Whidbey Island, 70 
miles from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 That began changing last year. As a gang subculture emerged among town youths, 
police confiscated two handguns and seven toy guns from juveniles. There had 
been no such incidents in 1992. In November, a brawl at Oak Harbor High School 
left a victim so bloodied that he was airlifted to a Seattle trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, these incidents would be the stuff of anxious gossip for a spell, 
then shrugged off as aberrations. Not now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pick up the paper and you see all the crime, when the first five 
programs on the TV news are crime, that's the background," Sundberg said. "When 
it happens close to home, then you think: 'Oh no. It's beginning.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the high school fight, she met in her dining room with the town's 
police chief and the county sheriff. She wanted to launch a crusade. The 
officials pledged their help. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Harbor's violent crime rate had decreased by 2.4% the previous year, and 
the school incidents had only the faint aroma of urban-style violence. But 
Sundberg struck a nerve. About 800 residents showed up last month for the first 
"Save Our Kids" rally, applauding as a prosecutor, a judge, the high school pep 
band and the honor society pledged to keep Oak Harbor safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, where two carjackings within three days last month left two 
residents dead, the horror seemed fresh -- even though DeKalb County police had 
recorded 119 such incidents, two fatal, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded with their biggest show of force since the notorious serial 
murders of children 13 years ago. Squad cars and helicopters swarmed over the 
southern part of the county until six men were arrested and charged in the two 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the Justice Department says the number of carjackings is not 
rising. The deaths left toughened city people even more jittery. 
</P>
<P>
 In their wake, sales manager Ronald Witherspoon, 42, now makes full use of his 
license to carry a gun. Hurrying through a downtown parking garage, he 
explained his strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give them my car," he said, "but then when they drive away, I'll shoot 
their tires out." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Stevens ticked off the ominous events of the last two years around her 
six-street tract in Florissant, Mo., near the St. Louis airport: A driver 
almost coaxed a little boy into his car. Neighborhood kids blithely showed her 
13-year-old daughter a gun. Two girls in nearby suburbs were abducted and 
killed -- local crimes that stirred national interest in the wake of the Polly 
Klaas case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it constantly," Stevens said. "I keep thinking: 'God, is it 
just me? Or is it the average American family?' " She suspects she knows the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 In this climate, the Times Poll found that 41% of respondents have taken steps 
to protect themselves from crime. For most, their choice has been the same as 
Witherspoon's -- to carry a concealed weapon, whether it be a gun, knife or 
Chemical Mace. One of four Americans now arms himself outside the home, nearly 
double the 13% of a 1981 Times survey. And almost 20% of those who moved last 
year said they did so at least in part to get away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last summer did politicians began picking up these hints of the nation's 
edgy mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign manager, George Gorton, tells of trying 
in vain to herd 20 San Fernando Valley voters in a focus group back to the 
topic at hand: the state budget. But they kept turning the discussion to crime, 
Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though California hasn't shaken its recession, even though the state's 
crime rate is not rising, "the level of intensity, the frequency of questions 
have pretty steadily escalated in the past year," Wilson said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other indicators. Among them: The Chatsworth, Calif., founders of 
Mad About Rising Crime, an activist group, saw a spurt in membership. So did 
both the National Rifle Assn. and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh says he saw a new demographic group, with votes and 
influence, lending voices to the chorus against crime. "For a long time, 
citizens in the inner city have dealt with this problem," he said. "Now 
(concern) is prevalent (throughout) the middle of Middle America." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't really matter why the public was so upset; it was clear the voters 
wanted something done. By the fall of 1993, politicians across the spectrum 
served up all manner of proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six governors spotlighted crime in their January State of the State 
addresses. In California, Minnesota, North Carolina and Oklahoma, governors 
sponsored crime "summits" -- bringing citizens and officials together to 
discuss solutions. New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and North Carolina Gov. James 
B. Hunt Jr. called special legislative sessions to consider anti-crime laws, 
and Wilson called a special crime session running concurrently with the regular 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in 17 states began considering boot camps for nonviolent offenders 
to clear prison space for the most brutal felons. Lawmakers in more than 23 
states are considering gun-control measures. Officials in 16 states are mulling 
"three strikes and you're out" laws that mandate life in prison on a third 
felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas House Speaker Bob Miller stated the obvious theme for the next 
legislative session in a newsletter sent to his colleagues. "It's Crime, 
Stupid," the headline read. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill that sat stalled in Congress for five years passed the Senate 
last November. It is under debate in the House, swollen with amendments that 
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
puts in three categories: helpful, neutral and "just wacky." 
</P>
<P>
 One would federalize every gang crime. "We'd end up adding 6,000 cases to the 
federal docket," Biden said. Another would require the death penalty for 
killing a federal poultry inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 By November, the President was speaking out, hammering at crime and its 
ravages on inner-city families during a speech at a Memphis, Tenn., church. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said he had noticed a change in the public's mood, a linking of 
crime with the disintegration of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is now one of Clinton's three top agenda items for this year, and has 
become the show-stopper of his recent speeches, including the State of the 
Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this -- the flood of federal bills, the posturing, the speeches -- is 
old news to veteran Washington hands like Donald Santarelli, who served in the 
Richard Nixon Administration as head of the Law Enforcement Assistance 
Administration at the height of the "law-and-order" era. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a steam engine," he said. "A head of steam builds up until someone 
opens the valve, then the superheated steam vents out. Any astute pol 
recognizes that." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is what to do with the steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "You reach a critical mass when people say: 'I've had it,"' said Sen. Phil 
Gramm (R-Tex.), a supporter of tough anti-crime measures. "We have an 
opportunity to do something real." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars of the nation's attitudes on crime are skeptical. Much of the work is 
"pure symbolism," said Roger Conner, executive director of the American 
Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a public-interest law firm. 
Politicians, he said, are "responding to their white, middle-class 
constituents" by "providing palliative measures that they hope will defuse 
their anger by election time." 
</P>
<P>
 The new frenzy of anti-crime activity leaves many minority-group leaders, 
particularly African Americans, feeling a mixture of bemused appreciation and 
bitterness. They perceive the quailing of suburbanites, mostly whites, finally 
seizing the nation's attention after city dwellers, mostly blacks, went unheard 
for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 While 64% of white respondents said they still feel safe walking in their own 
communities at night, the Times Poll found that only 36% of blacks and 41% of 
Latinos would say the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gary, Ind., the latest city to earn the despised sobriquet of U.S. "murder 
capital," both coats and guns are checked by a glowering bouncer at the 
roadhouse where George Henley plays tenor sax with his jazz group, the 
Groovepacers. At the Nation of Islam mosque where he prays, four guards stand 
outside where two once sufficed. "Use your head," Henley advises, "and you'll 
be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new surge in concern about crime, urban leaders say, does not reflect 
concern about the George Henleys who confront violence each day. "I don't get 
the sense that there is a great deal of altruism," said Baltimore Mayor Kurt 
Schmoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans, Schmoke said, are "saying they don't want to see this 
spreading beyond the borders of the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Christal Burnett of Hazelwood, Mo., said she does not consider 
herself a racist, when she pictures a criminal "in my mind I think 'young black 
punk.' I hate that that's in my mind because I know there are a lot of bad 
white people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Otis Moss, an influential African American preacher at Cleveland's 
Olivet Baptist Church, said the heightened interest in crime is "30 years 
late." Nevertheless, he is glad that attention is finally being paid. "It can 
no longer be looked upon as 'those people.' It can no longer be placed in the 
'over there' category," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Times Poll, most black Americans share his sentiments. Blacks 
are divided about whether tougher crime laws will increase prejudice, with 43% 
of Times Poll respondents agreeing they would and 44% disputing that 
contention. (Whites reject that idea, 71% to 18%; so do Latinos, 60% to 26%.) 
But even a wide majority of those who say they think that increased bias will 
result are in favor of the three-strikes approach. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the growing focus on punishment, most of the respondents don't see 
it as the only answer. In the poll, support for the Senate version of the crime 
bill drops from 64% to 37% if it drains money from social programs. Support for 
three-strikes laws also drops, from 79% to 58%, if such money is diverted or if 
taxes are increased. And 52% said they still feel that more money should go 
into education and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Such signs of convergence of liberal and conservative, white and black views 
on crime leave Moss "not without hope." 
</P>
<P>
 He compares the atmosphere to that of Montgomery, Ala., in December, 1955, 
when black housekeeper Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a 
white man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the moment," Moss said, "when people's cup of endurance runs over." 
</P>
<P>
 Times librarian Mary Edwards in Los Angeles and researchers Doug Conner in 
Seattle, Lianne Hart in Houston, Ann Rovin in Denver, Tracy Shryer in Chicago, 
Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna Virtue in Miami contributed to this story. 
THE TIMES POLL: As Concern Over Economy Drops, Crime Becomes a Top Issue 
</P>
<P>
 While most poll respondents say they fell safe in their communities, the issue 
of crime has soared as a national concern. Most say what they read in 
publications and view on TV has more influence on their feelings than personal 
experience.

 While violent crime is actually down overall, medium-sized cities and small

WINTER GAMES START WITH NOD TO SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years to the week after the Olympic flame was ignited over Sarajevo, and 
seven days after an attack on a central market there killed 68 people, the 
opening ceremony of the XVII Olympic Winter Games here Saturday was dedicated 
to the citizens of that war-ravaged Bosnian city. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a white peace ribbon on his full-length ski parka, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch of Spain, president of the International Olympic Committee, asked the 
crowd of 40,000 at the Lysgardsbakkene ski jumping arena, as well as a 
worldwide television audience, to stand for a moment of silence in memory of 
the victims on both sides of the strife in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please stop the fighting, stop the killing," he said in an impassioned plea. 
"Drop your guns, please." 
</P>
<P>
 But apart from that somber interlude, the atmosphere in the outdoor arena was 
festive as organizers in the northernmost city ever to stage the Olympics 
welcomed a record 1,902 athletes from 66 countries with a celebration of 
Norwegian culture and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather cooperated. Out of regard for the organizers' resolve to protect 
the environment, such as the heavy fines they threatened against contractors if 
even one fir tree too many was cut down in the construction of Olympic 
facilities, Samaranch has dubbed these the "Green Games." But the predominant 
color Saturday was white. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow falling throughout the two-hour ceremony added to a near-record amount 
covering the ground. There has been so much snow here this winter that it 
buried the five-foot fences designed to separate spectators from competitors on 
the cross-country skiing and biathlon courses, forcing organizers to hire 
trucks to haul it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the snow is going nowhere because the temperature is too far below 
freezing for it to melt. It was so bitterly cold a couple of weeks ago that 
animal rights activists forced the delay of the transport of 140 reindeer 
trained for the opening ceremony from the northern part of the country to 
Lillehammer because of frigid conditions inside the trailer trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the high Saturday was 14 degrees, it seemed colder because of the 
wind blowing off nearby Lake Mjosa. But the reindeer performed admirably. So 
did the hostess and host, actress Liv Ullmann and explorer Thor Heyerdahl, who 
presided over a program that included acrobats, sky divers, folk fiddlers, 
hundreds of dancing and singing children in traditional Norwegian costumes and, 
of course, mischievous trolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's star, however, was ski jumper Stein Gruben, who sailed off the big 
hill with the official torch in his right hand. Once safe on the ground -- 
which was not a given considering that the original fly-by torchbearer withdrew 
after plowing headfirst into a snowbank in Thursday night's rehearsal and 
suffering a concussion -- Gruben handed off the torch to a partially blind 
cross-country skier, Cathrine Nottingnes, who will compete in the Paralympics 
here next month. 
</P>
<P>
 She, in turn, passed it to the final torchbearer, Norway's Crown Prince 
Haakon, who lit the Olympic flame that will burn for the 16 days of the Games. 
The prince, 20, is a sailor who hopes to become an Olympian, as were his 
father, King Harald, and grandfather, the late King Olav. 
</P>
<P>
 King Harald, who competed in three Summer Olympics in sailing, officially 
opened the second Winter Games to be held in Norway. The first were 110 miles 
south of here, in the capital city of Oslo, in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of 23,000, Lillehammer is the second-smallest city ever to 
serve as host to an Olympics, after the 1932 and '80 winter site of Lake 
Placid, N.Y., and claims to be the world's only city with a skier in its coat 
of arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the "cradle of skiing," Norway is proud of its winter sports 
tradition. It finished at the top of the medal standings in five of the first 
six Winter Olympics, from 1924 through '52, and, although the Norwegians could 
not compete with the state-supported sports systems of the former Soviet Union 
and East Germany, they expect to reclaim their glory over the fortnight, 
perhaps surpassing the nine gold medals they won in the 1992 Winter Games in 
Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the geopolitical turmoil of recent years, 11 former Soviet 
republics and three former Yugoslav republics, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
are competing here independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, South Africa, a pariah in international sports during the decades of 
apartheid, has returned to the Winter Olympics for the first time since 1960. 
Israel is represented for the first time, by a Russian emigre figure skater. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest delegation here belongs to the United States, whose 157 athletes 
also have high hopes. With such proven winners as speedskaters Bonnie Blair and 
Cathy Turner, figure skater Brian Boitano and freestyle skier Donna Weinbrecht 
returning, U.S. Olympic Committee officials are predicting 14 medals, which 
would be the most ever for the United States in the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing long blue down coats and gray cowboy hats, the Americans were led into 
the opening ceremony Saturday by flag bearer Cammy Myler, a luge competitor 
whose brother watched on television from a hospital bed in Lake Placid, where 
he is undergoing cancer treatment.

HARDING TO COMPETE IN OLYMPICS, DROP LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After initially taking a hard line on the question of whether figure skater 
Tonya Harding should compete in the Winter Olympics, the U.S. Olympic Committee 
decided here early this morning to switch rather than fight and allow her to 
skate. 
</P>
<P>
 In an announcement that came shortly after 1 a.m. here, barely 12 hours into 
the XVII Olympic Winter Games, the USOC said that it had reached an agreement 
with Harding's attorneys for her to participate in the competition, which 
begins Feb. 23 in nearby Hamar, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came less than 24 hours after Circuit Judge Patrick D. Gilroy of 
Oregon City, Ore., ordered attorneys representing the two parties to meet over 
the weekend in an effort to settle the $25-million lawsuit filed by Harding to 
block possible USOC action against her. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for being allowed to skate, Harding agreed to release the USOC from 
all legal claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding will skate in the 1994 Olympics," Gilroy said after attorneys 
for the two sides met in his chambers in Portland, Ore., for much of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys released a statement after the settlement was reached. "Tonya 
Harding regrets any inconvenience the Oregon court proceedings have caused to 
the United States Olympic Committee, the International Olympic Committee and 
the other Olympic athletes," it said. "Tonya simply wants to skate in the 
Olympics and be treated fairly. She appreciates the United States Olympic 
Committee working with her to resolve this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was not present at the courthouse as her fate was being decided. As 
she has been throughout much of the ordeal, Harding stayed with Stephanie 
Quintero, a close friend, in Beaverton, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 While her attorneys were meeting with USOC representatives, Harding spent 
about two hours with Portland detectives in Quintero's apartment. Police 
refused to say why they talked to Harding, but their visit was believed to 
involve an incident Friday in which Quintero's husband had an altercation with 
the apartment manager over the number of reporters that had camped out at the 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is under investigation by the FBI, the Multnomah County prosecutor's 
office and the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., but not Portland police. 
</P>
<P>
 As Harding and Quintero tried to drive away from their apartment Saturday 
evening, they were besieged by reporters who have kept a vigil outside the 
complex for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding brushed away questions, but Quintero said "she is very, very happy. 
She is jumping for joy." 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC announcement would seem to close at least one chapter in the saga 
that began on Jan. 6, when Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's rival, was assaulted after 
a practice during the national figure skating championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan was unavailable for comment, but her coach, Evy Scotvold, seemed 
unsettled by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems kind of contradictory when you see the opening ceremonies and all 
they stand for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When associates of Harding were arrested in connection with the attack -- her 
ex-husband later pleaded guilty to his role in the conspiracy -- law 
enforcement authorities in Portland and Detroit focused their investigation on 
whether she was involved. She has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of its own investigation, however, a U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. hearing panel determined that reasonable grounds existed to believe that 
Harding was involved in the plot to injure Kerrigan and the subsequent 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC scheduled a hearing of its Games Administrative Board for Tuesday in 
Oslo and later postponed it until Friday. At the hearing, the board was to 
review those charges and also deliberate on whether Harding's admission that 
she did not immediately report information she learned about the attack to law 
enforcement authorities was a violation of the USOC's code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 In its announcement today, the USOC did not address those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are appalled still by the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, which was not only an 
attack on the athletes but an assault on the basic ideals of the Olympic 
movement and sportsmanship," the USOC's executive director, Harvey Schiller, 
said, reading from a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack was designed to cripple her, alter the competition, and could have 
ended her career. We remain deeply concerned about this incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC decided, however, that prolonging the decision on whether Harding 
should compete while her attorneys fought the process through the courts would 
steal attention from the Winter Olympics and continue to be a distraction for 
the other 156 members of the U.S. team, USOC spokesman Mike Moran said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Judge Gilroy applauded the USOC's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court commends the USOC for their efforts in resolving this dispute and 
for putting their overriding interest in a distraction-free Olympics ahead of 
the legitimate concerns which brought them to this forum." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the media interest in Kerrigan here, she was greeted at the 
front door of the Main Press Center on Saturday afternoon by close to 100 
photographers when she arrived for a news conference, which was attended by at 
least 500 reporters. Moran said it was the largest media gathering ever for a 
USOC news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she knew how she would react if Harding came to the Games, Kerrigan 
said: "Not really. I don't know how I'm going to feel when I see her. I don't 
know what will happen. That is personal and between the two of us, not you 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it seems likely that Kerrigan and Harding will not only live in the same 
dormitory in the athletes' village, although not on the same floor, but also 
practice at the same time in the same rink in Hamar. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials made a request to the International Skating Union that Kerrigan 
and Harding be assigned separate practice times, but it was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. president, Claire Ferguson, said potential 
problems between the two U.S. skaters in practice are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have skaters from countries that are at war who skate at the same 
practice," she said. "I went to the opening ceremonies and looked at the doves 
of peace. We are all part of that."

FBI PROBES TAX-FUNDED CHILD-CARE FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California foundation whose widely acclaimed child-care program has been 
championed by powerful legislative leaders is under federal grand jury 
investigation for possible misuse of more than $1 million in taxpayer funds, 
The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal investigation, spurred by a state auditor's report, is focusing 
on whether top officials of the Foundation Center for Phenomenological Research 
improperly spent money intended for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the FBI investigation say that federal agents are 
examining whether the Sacramento-based foundation's executive director, Marilyn 
K. Prosser, used money from the nonprofit enterprise to purchase property in 
her own name and lease it back to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are trying to determine whether the private foundation, which 
receives most of its funding from public sources, used California money to help 
secure a multimillion-dollar contract in New York City and whether it had 
business relationships with Prosser family members that gave them exorbitant 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 On advice of her attorney, Prosser declined to comment. But other foundation 
officials and advisers deny any wrongdoing, saying that the organization is the 
victim of overzealous investigators who do not understand its intricate 
accounting system. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest publicly funded child-care providers in California, the 
foundation operates 10 programs in private homes in Los Angeles County, where 
it also has three centers, including the David Roberti Child Development Center 
in South-Central, which is named for the state senator and is considered the 
"jewel in the crown" of the group's facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has shocked and saddened the group's supporters and its 
officers, who have received international recognition for a program that serves 
2,300 immigrant and poor children in California from just south of Oregon to 
the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe the Foundation Center has done nothing wrong," said Donne 
Brownsey, a consultant for the foundation and a former top aide to Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys). "I have never seen anything that has led me to believe that 
anything wrong has occurred, anything criminal has occurred. It's just shocking 
to think that people would even make that allegation." 
</P>
<P>
 While federal prosecutors present their case for possible indictment, two 
state agencies -- the Department of Education and Department of Health Services 
-- are examining the foundation's handling of more than $20 million in state 
and federal government contracts over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of financial reviews have spotlighted questions about the 
foundation's practices: 
</P>
<P>
 * The state education department recently notified the foundation that 
preliminary findings contained in a financial report by an outside accountant 
show that $429,243 to $1.1 million may have been misspent in a three-month 
period in 1992. The foundation receives more than $8 million annually in state 
and federal funds for its California programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are stunningly huge amounts of precious child development dollars 
allegedly illegally spent by the foundation," Deputy Schools Supt. Robert W. 
Agee wrote in a letter to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial review, conducted by the Alexandria, Va., firm Cotton & Co., 
identified expenditures that the education department considers questionable -- 
either because they cover old debts or appear to have nothing to do with the 
care of children. Education department officials had turned to Cotton & Co. to 
verify earlier findings by state controller's auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento attorney James M. Mattesich, who is representing the foundation, 
contended that the Virginia firm misunderstood the organization's financial 
records and as a result had reached the wrong conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auditors, including the foundation's accountant during the course of a 
routine audit, raised concerns about high fees paid to family members and 
friends who made short-term loans to the organization. An April, 1993, 
controller's survey said the fees amounted to "exorbitant interest rates." 
Lenders earned a 10% fee even when they got their money back in as little as 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials said in a written response to The Times that the 
short-term loans were needed to tide them over when payments from the state 
were late. They argued that the fees were akin to those paid by private 
companies in similar circumstances. They said Prosser paid the fees out of her 
own pocket, but her auditor noted that the fees were paid by the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Department of Health Services audit released in January demanded that the 
foundation pay back 90% of a $232,000 grant it received to provide no-smoking 
classes to parents and teachers. Health services auditors said there was no 
evidence that the foundation held all the classes its contract required -- 
noting that at one center an employee admitted that attendance sheets had been 
falsified. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattesich said he is confident the foundation will be successful in appealing 
the finding. 
</P>
<P>
 * A report by the foundation's accounting firm disclosed that the 
taxpayer-supported group loaned Prosser $344,063 in the fiscal year ending in 
June, 1991. Foundation officials said in their written response to The Times 
that their accountants mistakenly recorded some transactions as loans, when 
they were not. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's accountant also noted in his audit that as of December, 1993, 
Prosser still held title to a movable classroom the foundation bought from her 
for $260,000 in June, 1992. Foundation board members say that even though the 
title was not transferred, they feel confident of Prosser's word that the 
foundation owns the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime admirers of the foundation say they have not wavered in their 
support, and many share foundation officials' views that their troubles stem 
from personality differences with education department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never ever before or since seen a program equal to those run by the 
Foundation Center," said Sue Toigo, who as one of the founders of the advocacy 
group Children's Lobby used to make the rounds at the Capitol on behalf of the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened its first center in 1980, the foundation has been showered 
with accolades for the quality of its Montessori programs, aimed primarily at 
Spanish-speaking children. 
</P>
<P>
 What caught the eye of experts, state legislators and New York City officials 
who asked the foundation to start programs there is an apparent high rate of 
success at raising the self-esteem and hopes of children living below the 
poverty line. Although measuring the success of preschool programs is 
difficult, teachers at the centers say their pupils often are ready to skip 
grades when they leave the program to enter school. Public school 
administrators often visit the sites to find out what gave them an advantage 
over other children. 
</P>
<P>
 In child development centers decorated with designer touches, needy children 
play with top-shelf educational toys, listen to the music of Beethoven or 
Mozart and eat organic meals by candlelight on china dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beauty really calls to children," said Antonia Lopez, the foundation's 
education director. "If they are given things that are beautiful they learn to 
respect them -- and themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials say in their response to auditors that they manage to 
provide quality care for children at a low cost to the state by keeping their 
administrative expenses down -- largely by relying on Prosser to handle all the 
financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Education department evaluators who visited the centers over the years 
generally were impressed by what they saw, with one praising the foundation in 
a 1991 report for having an "excellent children's program and physical 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the foundation's expenditures for seeming luxuries that first 
raised a red flag for state auditors and eventually led to the federal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Four former employees went to the education department starting in mid-1992 to 
allege that the foundation was using government funds to upgrade property that 
Prosser privately owned and leased back to the foundation, and to purchase 
elaborate furnishings for the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among expensive items purchased, they alleged, were Native American rugs at 
$500 to $2,000 apiece, $15,000 worth of photographic work for a public 
relations package, and cellular telephones and compact disc players for the 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 One former employee said that California funds were used to pay the salaries 
and air fare of nine foundation staff members who traveled to New York in May, 
1992. The purpose of the three-day trip, he said, was to help set up day-care 
programs in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation officials insist that no grant money was used to improve Prosser's 
properties and defended the fine rugs and costly supplies as necessary to 
create an inspiring atmosphere for underprivileged children. They also 
maintained that no California money was used for New York ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the allegations by former employees prompted education department 
officials to request a financial review by the controller's office. On April 7, 
1993, auditor Alan Cates identified as much as $880,000 in questionable 
expenses out of $2.4 million the foundation received in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount, the controller's office said in its report, included some 
expenditures for luxury items and also funds used to pay outstanding debts. In 
addition, it said the foundation "used state funds intended for the child-care 
program for non-program purposes," which he called a "serious violation of 
child-care program regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Cates' findings, the Department of Education threatened to terminate 
the foundation's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ensure continued funding, the foundation turned to legislators 
who have long been supporters of its programs, asking them to intercede on its 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation appealed to state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), a longtime 
admirer of the foundation, who stepped forward to contact state Controller Gray 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 After Davis met with foundation officials at Torres' request, his agency 
agreed to allow the foundation's accountant to present arguments to an auditor 
who had been directed to re-examine the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The second survey lowered the amount that was reported in the first survey to 
$363,000. It also removed a phrase particularly objectionable to the foundation 
that questioned its solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for Davis said it is normal practice for the controller to 
get personally involved in matters that generate telephone calls to his office. 
"The important thing is that we didn't bow to any pressure," said Carol Thorp, 
the controller's special assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The second survey still raised concerns about the foundation's practice of 
paying high fees to employees, relatives and friends who loaned it cash. From 
July to November, 1992, the report noted, the foundation paid nearly $50,000 in 
such loan fees, leading it deeper into financial peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the controller's second survey was released, foundation officials 
discovered they had a more serious problem. Late in the afternoon of April 16, 
1993, a team of FBI agents swept into their 19th-Century Sacramento 
headquarters, disabling computers with wire cutters and confiscating dozens of 
boxes of records and electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman Thomas P. Griffin confirmed that "we have a pending 
investigation and it's before the grand jury" but refused to comment further. 
He did say that no political figures were included as targets of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the investigation have told The Times that one focus of the 
investigation is whether Prosser used government money to buy property she 
leased back to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, some of the foundation's supporters in the Legislature wrote 
letters pressing the education department panel to continue the foundation's 
funding. There is no evidence that legislators were aware of the FBI raid or 
the federal criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most powerful and persistent supporter has been Roberti, who said in a 
letter to Acting Schools Supt. William Dawson the findings of the controller's 
second financial survey "would appear to be in no way sufficient to warrant the 
termination of the . . . contract." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Roberti said his primary reason for intervening was for 
the sake of the children in the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to try not to disrupt the lives of the kids if it can be resolved in 
a less drastic way," he said. "(The controller's report) really struck me as a 
bookkeeping dispute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dario Frommer, a spokesman for Torres, said: "Everyone is so disappointed and 
discouraged with the turn of events. If there's wrongdoing, what can we do? Art 
Torres knew nothing of any wrongdoing. His concern was for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the education department granted the foundation another full year 
contract.INVESTIGATIONS

CLINTON OKS $8.6-BILLION QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-six days after an earthquake cut a swath of devastation through the Los 
Angeles area, President Clinton signed a relief bill into law Saturday that he 
said shows "the generosity of the American people when tragedy strikes," but 
also bars illegal immigrants from receiving some assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8.6 billion in aid -- the most ever appropriated for a single U.S. 
disaster -- will pay for housing assistance and the reconstruction of highways, 
schools and other public facilities, as well as loans to offset damage suffered 
by renters, homeowners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also includes a controversial measure that prohibits illegal 
immigrants from receiving long-term assistance. For the first 90 days, illegal 
immigrants remain eligible for emergency food, medical care and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise formula, however, federal officials are to take "reasonable 
steps" to ensure that anyone applying for assistance of 90 days or more must be 
a legal resident. 
</P>
<P>
 What those "reasonable steps" are remains a matter of legal interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said in 
Universal City on Saturday that authorities would "immediately" begin asking 
applicants for Section 8 disaster housing assistance about their immigration 
status. That program has provided 15,000 low-income quake victims with vouchers 
covering 70% of their rent costs for an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, officials say they have not inquired about the legal status of those 
seeking such rent subsidies and other post-earthquake assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary's comments were the first indication by a high-ranking 
Administration official that government aid screeners would begin asking 
directly about applicants' immigration status. Some immigrant rights advocates 
had suggested that the requirement be enforced on a "don't ask" basis. In that 
scenario, applicants would only be turned away if they volunteered their 
undocumented status or if it otherwise came to officials' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first days of the new approach, Cisneros said in an interview after a 
meeting with more than 1,000 landlords, housing officials will probably rely on 
oral interviews. But Cisneros would not rule out the possibility that aid 
applicants may eventually be obliged to produce some kind of documentation 
verifying that they are in the United States legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Till we have a better procedure, it will be a series of questions that are 
direct questions to the individual and it will be asked of everyone," Cisneros 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid discrimination, Cisneros said, each applicant must be asked about 
legal status. Officials cannot determine eligibility "on the basis of a 
person's skin color or facial attributes or anything else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are refused housing assistance because of their legal status will 
not be turned over to immigration authorities, Cisneros added. "We're providing 
housing and emergency assistance, and (we're) not substitutes for the 
Immigration Service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros, one of the nation's leading Latino politicians, stopped short of 
criticizing the congressional requirement. But he did express regret about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that the circumstances of a disaster would result in making these 
kinds of distinctions about human suffering," the secretary said. "Our job is 
to carry out the laws the way that Congress in its wisdom passes them." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cisneros voiced the belief that few illegal immigrants apply for 
Section 8 housing assistance anyway. The government paperwork requirements 
generally act as a deterrent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say official inquiries about legal status could have a chilling effect 
on all immigrants, even discouraging wary legal residents from soliciting help. 
Talk of such restrictions has already scared many, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates most disaster 
relief, has no immediate plans to revise its procedures, said Phil Cogan, an 
agency spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most FEMA aid is short term, Cisneros noted that one FEMA housing 
assistance program can also be extended up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates denounced the government's action. Among other objections, 
critics note that many families are split, including one or two undocumented 
parents along with several children who are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really just unbelievable," said Carlos Vaquerano, spokesman for the 
Central American Resource Center. "It's not an issue of documented or 
undocumented -- it's an issue of humanity. . . . This policy represents a total 
lack of respect to our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed concern about potential discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they going to ask an upper-middle-class Anglo from Northridge, or a 
person who speaks with an accent and has five children and might look Mexican 
or Iranian?" asked Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some laud the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot continue to provide for all the social requirements of undocumented 
aliens," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), who sponsored the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) called the law a "major turning 
point" in immigration policy, halting a tendency to help the undocumented. 
"This is the first step in evolving back to a more sane economic policy in 
which illegal immigrants do not have the same rights as legal residents," 
Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are already barred from most forms of federal public 
assistance, including welfare, food stamps and unemployment insurance. They are 
generally eligible for federal housing aid, and some medical and nutrition 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, President Clinton called the 
legislation -- approved swiftly by Congress -- "the most comprehensive national 
response ever to a region experiencing a natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the death toll from the Jan. 17 quake (at least 57 died in Los 
Angeles County) and other suffering: nearly 10,000 people were injured and 
there was severe damage to 150 public schools and five hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the assistance package, FEMA, the central coordinating agency -- which 
was about to run out of money this week -- will receive $4.7 billion. This will 
pay for assistance to individuals who suffered in the quake, as well as help to 
rebuild schools, water lines and other public facilities. The agency has 
already received more than 300,000 applications for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the bill is $1.35 billion to pay for rebuilding freeways and bridges 
through the Department of Transportation. Another $1.1 billion will go to the 
Small Business Administration to pay for low-interest loans for homeowners, 
renters and small businesses. The Department of Housing and Urban Development 
will get $200 million more for rent subsidies.

HARDING DROPS LAWSUIT, TO COMPETE IN OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee on Saturday cleared the way for Tonya Harding to 
skate in the Winter Games. In return, Harding's attorneys agreed to drop a 
$25-million lawsuit against the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the opening ceremonies signaled the start of the 17th Winter 
Games, a compromise was reached in the controversy that had threatened to 
overshadow all other Olympic athletes and events. Instead, the stage has been 
set for what may be one of the most dramatic competitions in Olympic history -- 
Harding vs. Nancy Kerrigan in women's figure skating. The competition is Feb. 
23 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution ends the USOC's attempt to hold a Games Administrative Board 
hearing in Oslo to consider Harding's Olympic eligibility. The hearing had been 
scheduled for Tuesday, then pushed back to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's attorneys argued Friday in Clackamas County Circuit Court that the 
board hearing would deny their client due process. After hearing arguments in 
open court and in chambers, Judge Patrick D. Gilroy urged both sides to reach 
an agreement, saying he was "genuinely concerned" with the effect the 
controversy would have on the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 A source involved in Saturday's meetings said that Gilroy put attorneys for 
both sides in different rooms at the Clackamas County Circuit Courthouse for 
nearly eight hours. The source said Gilroy proposed a scenario in which Harding 
would be allowed to skate in return for an agreement to drop the suit. Gilroy 
shuttled between each room, the source said, until an agreement was reached at 
3:30 p.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Olympic Committee is happy with it (the agreement) because they can 
get on with the Games without this sensational mess to worry about," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Harding filed a lawsuit seeking at least $25 million against the 
USOC on Wednesday, saying the planned board meeting in Oslo would deny her due 
process. On Thursday, attorneys filed a motion for a temporary restraining 
order to block the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, who has admitted she knew about the Jan. 6 attack on rival skater 
Nancy Kerrigan well before she reported it to authorities, will likely arrive 
in Norway on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men -- including Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly -- have been 
arrested in the alleged plot to injure Kerrigan. Gillooly has implicated 
Harding in the planning of the attack as well; Harding has denied those 
allegations. She has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC spokesman Mike Moran said that, to his knowledge, Kerrigan had not been 
informed of the decision because of the lateness of the hour in Lillehammer, 
where Kerrigan arrived on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ongoing criminal investigation in Oregon as well as the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. disciplinary review of Tonya Harding and the distraction to our 
athletes and their preparations have helped to make our efforts for a Games 
Administrative Board hearing difficult if not impossible," the USOC said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding regrets any inconvenience the Oregon court proceeding has 
caused to the United States Olympic Committee, the International Olympic 
Committee and the other Olympic athletes," a statement released by Harding and 
her attorneys said. "Tonya simply wants to skate in the Olympics and be treated 
fairly."

A REBEL WITH A CAUSE; TIRED OF BEING 'CONSCIENCE OF THE SENATE,' HAYDEN USES 
GOVERNOR'S RACE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIS LONG-TERM AGENDA FOR REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the days after Democrat Tom Hayden's unexpected jump into the governor's 
race, dozens of requests for radio, TV and newspaper interviews poured into his 
Capitol office and overloaded his campaign answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 To his supporters, the message slips showed that the improbable quest would 
quickly meet one of its goals: grabbing attention for the Santa Monica state 
senator and his reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest gives Hayden, a political activist since the 1960s civil rights 
movement, his latest platform and a high-profile way to spotlight the issues he 
pushed during his hard-fought 1992 state Senate election victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not particularly well-liked by his Senate colleagues, Hayden, 54, has 
earned a degree of respect he never quite seemed to gain in the Assembly, where 
he served for the previous decade. Even members of the Senate's old guard have 
voiced grudging admiration for the way he has challenged Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson's appointees to boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not satisfying enough for the restless Hayden. He seeks a higher 
profile, a statewide stage "to expose special interest influence here" in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the notion of running for governor emerged during a Christmas Day 
drive around Los Angeles in his electric-powered car. Stewing over a state 
Supreme Court decision striking down a campaign reform initiative, he wondered, 
"What's a reformer to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 But he left the question unanswered until deciding at 11 p.m. last Tuesday to 
take "the final option" and plunge into the governor's race. Among those he 
consulted before declaring his candidacy Wednesday were his wife, actress 
Barbara Williams, and former spouse and political benefactor, actress Jane 
Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Fonda, Hayden long has been assailed by conservative politicians 
because of his opposition to the Vietnam War -- a subject that probably will 
resurface during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes he has little chance of winning the race. He entered at the last 
minute and expects to be vastly outspent by better-organized Democratic rivals, 
Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi. He says a poll he commissioned shows he 
starts with support from only 10% of likely Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But among the assets Hayden brings to the long-shot campaign are his 
experience as a political organizer and veteran campaigner, a sharp mind, name 
recognition, a populist appeal and the ability to grab headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 As he returned to the Capitol last week after making his announcement in Los 
Angeles, Hayden, coffee cup in hand, mingled with colleagues who said he would 
shake up the race, chatted with a New York Times reporter and, as he left the 
Senate floor, bumped into Garamendi, who playfully said, "Hello, governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his crowded Capitol office, the graying Hayden tried to sort through 
messages and quickly arrange campaign appearances, including TV news and radio 
talk shows in the San Francisco Bay area. One harried staff member, who noted 
that campaign calls are referred to a hastily rented election office near the 
Capitol, estimated that in the day after Hayden's announcement, the senator 
received at least one media message every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's surprise decision met a decidedly mixed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) immediately revived his complaint that 
Hayden's anti-war activities should disqualify him from any state office 
because of a constitutional provision that bars anyone "who advocates the 
support" of a foreign government engaged in hostilities with the United States. 
Hayden dismisses the complaint, noting that President Clinton recently lifted 
the 19-year trade embargo on Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democratic political consultant branded Hayden's move as "foolish and 
self-centered," adding that Hayden is "a flamethrower and he'll be out there to 
throw those flames and I think it's unfortunate" because it will split the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Democratic senators believe Hayden's surprise move will kindle much 
more interest in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) praised Hayden's intellect, saying "this guy 
always comes up with a deeper dimension" during debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing Hayden's critics, Watson said, "They don't like him because they harken 
back to the '60s when he was a radical, but he makes sense. . . . Whether they 
take him seriously or not they will hear him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Hayden has found a home in the 40-member Senate, one of the 
state's most exclusive political clubs. It's not that the barons who rule the 
upper chamber have embraced his progressive politics or his reformist views. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hayden has taken full advantage of the Senate's unwritten rules of 
etiquette, which give even newcomers wide berth to speak their minds. Hayden 
has spoken out on a wide range of topics, from earthquake safety and automobile 
Smog Checks to bobcat protection and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Hayden has seized on a little-used procedural device to turn 
what is typically a routine review of gubernatorial appointments into a 
spirited dissection of state agencies, from the State Lottery to the University 
of California. Along the way he has challenged Wilson and former Senate 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes them (senators) look at these appointees and not just rubber-stamp 
them," said one Senate staff member who is familiar with Hayden's role as an 
appointment process watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), a charter member of the Senate's old guard 
first elected to the Legislature in 1938, said the freshman's intense scrutiny 
of appointees "keeps us on our toes, particularly on those things that have to 
do with the environment, much to my sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with criticism from Hayden, Wilson last year was forced to withdraw his 
appointment of former Rep. John H. Rousselot to a post on the state Board of 
Prison Terms, and Lottery Commission member Richard A. Cramer abruptly resigned 
rather than face a grilling by Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 Other appointees won approval, but not before Hayden put their credentials 
under his microscope. Even though he failed to block confirmation of Wilson's 
appointment of Daniel Apodaca to the state Lottery Commission, the debate last 
May spotlighted Hayden's ability to use the process to attract attention to his 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Senate debate, Hayden complained that the Pasadena accountant 
failed in his watchdog role, especially in supporting a $400-million lottery 
contract for G-Tech Corp., without competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusually sharp rebuke of a colleague, Roberti sneered: "The Rules 
Committee isn't just blithely passing these things out. We're trying to protect 
our constitutional right and at the same time . . . not slash and cut people 
down who are decent." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden shot back: "I think Sen. Roberti doth protest too much. The record is 
clear. If the Rules Committee had investigated this matter more thoroughly . . 
. I wouldn't have to be on this floor, having to speak out against Sen. Roberti 
and feel very alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked last year if he relishes the niche he carved out for himself, Hayden 
would only say: "I do tend to sound like fingernails on the blackboard for some 
of these traditionalists." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said his poll showed there was widespread support for his 
anti-Establishment critique of state government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can get my message across, I'll be a competitive factor in the race," 
says Hayden, who plans to eschew traditional, 30-second commercials, but does 
not rule out buying TV time, especially on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is not Hayden's first bid for statewide office. In 1976, Hayden 
lost a bid for the U.S. Senate. Six years later he captured an Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a newcomer, Hayden sought to work within the system. But even as he climbed 
the seniority ladder to become chairman of the Labor Committee and later the 
Higher Education Committee, Hayden was frustrated at his inability to pass 
sweeping legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 With mixed results, he turned his attention to passage of major initiatives 
focused on the environment. He played a key role in the 1986 passage of 
Proposition 65, the anti-toxics initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Never totally fitting into the Assembly, Hayden watched as his colleagues in 
1991 backed a measure to obliterate his Westside Assembly district in the 
decennial redrawing of legislative lines. The experience seemed to liberate 
Hayden, prompting him to assail machine politics and tout his own independence 
from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 With his political future on the line, Hayden ran for the newly created 23rd 
Senate District seat that stretches from the Westside to Woodland Hills in the 
San Fernando Valley. Using part of his wealth from his divorce settlement with 
Fonda, Hayden spent more than $700,000 of his own money to win the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, just 16 months after capturing the Senate seat, he has upset the 
political equation once again. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hayden said he enjoys the Legislature, he is tired of getting pats on 
the back from his colleagues for being "the conscience of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 "It means you'll never get the majority," Hayden said. "And my desire is not 
to be just a prophetic but isolated voice in the Senate . . . but to challenge 
the system until it changes."

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; WANT TO BE MAYOR? BUY YOURSELF A TOWN; CAMPO IS FOR SALE, AND 
FOR $1,750,000, YOU CAN OWN NEARLY ALL OF THIS TOWN 50 MILES EAST OF SAN DIEGO, 
WHERE CRIME AND DRUGS ARE PRACTICALLY NONEXISTENT.

 Now that the California real estate market is thawing out, might you be 
interested in buying a town? 
</P>
<P>
 For a mere $1,750,000 -- barely the cost of the fixer-upper in pricier ZIP 
codes -- a buyer can own nearly all of this tiny mountain community 50 miles 
east of San Diego and just north of the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Betty Heslop -- he's a retired Navy chief, she's a ceramist -- have 
owned Campo for six years and have decided it is time to cash out and go 
fishing permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting rid of everything I own, except my wife," said Bob, 58. "I tried 
to talk her into it but she wouldn't go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty, 53, married to Bob for 35 years, has heard the joke before. She is what 
you call a motivated seller. Still, she wants buyers to know that running a 
town, even one with a colorful and bloody history, is no walk in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work," she said. "You're always on call." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer will get 15 acres of land, a 28-unit apartment building, the 
Heslop's three-bedroom home, five warehouses and assorted buildings that 
accommodate a car repair shop, a coin-operated laundry, a Baptist church, 
hardware store, Betty's ceramics studio, Post 2080 of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, a thrift shop and a Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings are mostly World War II leftovers from Camp Lockett, an Army 
base that was one of the last posts for the all-black cavalry units known as 
the Buffalo Soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army rushed 3,500 men and 5,000 horses 
to Camp Lockett for fear that the Japanese planned to use Mexico to launch 
sabotage raids or a full-scale invasion. When that fear waned, the troops were 
sent to North Africa and the camp was used for several hundred Italian POWs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the war, the Italians were sent home (although pictures of their 
religious artwork are still on display at a local diner), and the Army ditched 
Camp Lockett. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Heslop figures Campo is just about to regain its strategic importance: 
this time economically, not militarily. The North American Free Trade 
Agreement, he reasons, makes Campo an ideal spot for a twin-plant manufacturing 
firm or maybe a truck stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who buys Campo can call himself the mayor or chief of police or 
anything you want," Heslop said. "Where else can you get that kind of deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the Heslops wait for offers, Campo residents ponder the prospect of change 
coming to their hot-in-summer, cold-in-winter hideaway at the southern terminus 
of Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want condos and apartments going up all over the place," said Stella 
Fulks, who tends bar at the VFW hall and is partial to country-Western songs on 
the jukebox. "That's why most of us came to Campo: to escape the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a common sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had the money to buy Campo and keep it like it is, just like 
family," said Jerry Weber, 55, a mountain native and former aerospace 
machinist. "If somebody wrong ends up with it, we could end up with tract 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it up here," said Misty Bennett, 18, making her daily trip to the post 
office "Being away from the flatland keeps me out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that trouble never comes to Campo. The roads and trails 
surrounding it are favorite routes for drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, on those rare occasions when Campo makes the local news, it is 
generally because the Border Patrol outpost in Campo has made a major bust. In 
one recent case agents caught a smuggler with 1,250 pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol station is one of only a handful of things in Campo not 
owned by the Heslops. Ditto the county-run ranch for troubled youths, the 
county fire station and general services yard, the San Diego Railroad Museum, 
and the historic Old Campo Store, which is California Landmark 441. 
</P>
<P>
 A plaque outside the store commemorates the gun battle of Dec. 5, 1875, 
between the Cruz Lopez gang and the Gaskill brothers Lumen and Silas, who 
founded Campo in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a bandit and a French shepherd were mortally wounded in the gunfight. 
Vigilantes that night hanged two bandits while the sheriff was conveniently out 
to dinner. Residents like to brag that the Campo shootout was bigger and 
bloodier than the one at the O.K. Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 A re-enactment of the shooting is the highlight of Campo's annual Wild West 
Days celebration attended by several thousand people. The hangings are glossed 
over but the stump of Hangman's Tree is still there, a few yards from the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Such violence is all safely in the past, and despite the occasional drug bust, 
Campo residents cannot remember the last real-life bloodletting, a fact they 
point to as proof of the moral superiority of mountain people over city people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any drive-by shootings," Bennett noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Heslops paid $1.2 million for Campo in 1988 and figure they have invested 
$400,000 in improvements, not counting sweat equity. Nine months ago they 
listed the town at $2.5 million but they dropped the asking price after not 
getting any bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to unload Campo and relocate to their second home near Lake 
Gregory above San Bernardino and maybe take a salmon fishing trip to Alaska 
every so often. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed the process, the Heslops have offered their real estate agent at 
Coldwell Banker a $50,000 bonus, in addition to a 10% commission, if the town 
sells in the next six months. The agent is going to Asia in hopes of finding a 
foreign investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Campo's selling points: California 94 (it runs through Campo), $20,000 a 
month in rental income, a willing work force among the 2,000-plus people who 
live in the surrounding hills, and the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway 
(the line through Campo is defunct but hope for a revival remains). 
</P>
<P>
 The Heslops' sale is not the only change brewing for Campo. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-member Kuneyaay band of Southern Diegueno Indians is suing in federal 
court for permission to use the Campo Indian Reservation for a large-scale 
commercial landfill. The band won a recent round, but the County Board of 
Supervisors will probably appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also word about a Jack in the Box opening up in Boulevard, 12 miles 
from Campo. The company denies it but the rumor persists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to accept the fact that changes are happening and there's not a heck 
of a lot you can do about it," said Ray Reagan, 43, a machinist and Vietnam 
veteran, as he nursed a beer at the VFW bar. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to prove the point, Stella the bartender pushed a button and the place 
was filled with a Hank Williams Jr. song: "A Country Boy Can Survive."

ON CALIFORNIA: TOM DROPS A BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden announced last Wednesday that he wants to run for 
governor, as a "messenger of reform." In a five-page, single-spaced 
announcement, the Chicago Seven alumnus spoke of the "obstinate power and money 
of special interests," of a government "lost in the values of Babylon," and of 
a need for a "new governor with a mandate from a grass-roots movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Now I love it when candidates talk that talk. I'm a sucker for self-proclaimed 
insurgents. Give me candidates with big ears, or 800-numbers, or both -- 
someone on the outside, banging on the door of power, in the name of The 
People. 
</P>
<P>
 This, I know, is a weakness. Blame it on Watergate or too many Frank Capra 
movies or simple naivete. Whatever, I am attuned to the argument that politics 
as usual has created too much government as usual. With others, I keep watch on 
the horizon, waiting for a political Guevara to come along to tear down the old 
order. It's been a long wait, and the guerrillas are impatient. It wasn't Jesse 
or Jerry, and it certainly wasn't Ross. Could it be Tom? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tom Hayden's office is located on the second floor of the Capitol. It is a 
small, handsome lair, with dark wood and deep couches. He led me inside. This 
was Thursday, the day after his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "How goes the revolution?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far," he said with a smile, "so good." 
</P>
<P>
 On his desk sat a glass mug with a few sips of coffee left. Classical music 
played on a cassette recorder. He slumped on the couch with legs kicked out and 
his arms folded behind his head. It was a comfortable scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Right away, there were a few things Hayden wanted to make clear. He wasn't out 
to spoil the prospects of the other Democratic candidates, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. Instead, his hope was 
that "Kathleen" or "John" would adopt his message of reform, at which point he 
could declare victory and withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you really expect Kathleen Brown to give back the five million she's 
already raised?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. But maybe she could say something like, "I am playing the game 
under the rules to win, and when I win I will change the rules." That, he said, 
would be "an honorable stand." 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about Jerry Brown, who was in the news himself, attempting to launch 
a radio show out of Oakland. Brown provided Hayden with both a message and a 
political prototype. Political reform was the issue that brought Brown to 
Sacramento in the first place, 20 years ago. Political reform also was the 
issue that fueled his upstart run at the White House in 1992; a lot of people 
laughed at the 'Beam, but in the end the only ones left standing from a crowded 
Democratic field were him and Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by his fortitude and the response he got," Hayden said of 
Brown. "But I also am cognizant of the fact that, in the castle of incumbents, 
he continues to be a castaway." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused a beat, to let this sink in. You see, Hayden does not intend to 
follow the Jerry Brown path all the way. He has no plans for an 800-number. And 
he certainly has no plans for banishment, post-election, to talk show hell. He 
said he's "comfortable" in his role as state senator, and expressed hope that 
his "colleagues" would respect his efforts to "send a message," adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very interested in remaining a senator. I am not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now when it comes to activism, Tom Hayden has given at the office. His 
reputation as an anti-war protester precedes him wherever he chooses to go, and 
it always will. The Sacramento pols roughed him up good when he landed here, 
and it is understandable that he doesn't want to risk whatever respect he's 
gained since, on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, if he is serious about this kind of candidacy, Hayden probably 
had better forget about his colleagues and "Kathleen" and "John." Jerry Brown 
liked to say he wasn't a "go along and get along" candidate. Hayden might not 
want to go along with the system, but for now he does want to get along with 
its players. Wild-eyed commitment and an elephant skin -- that's what seems to 
work on the insurgency trail. And even then only for a while. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For however noble, however skillful, these candidacies always come up short. 
In the early going, the insurgents thrive in a vacuum of noninterest. Attention 
is not paid until progress is made in the polls. At that point, the power of 
the message becomes clear. At that point, the messenger better duck. Hayden 
said he knows all this. I wonder, and keep watch on the horizon. . . .

SUMMIT AIMS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS; REFORM: SUPPORTERS HOPE THE TWO-DAY 
MEETING OF TOP POLITICAL, EDUCATION AND BUSINESS LEADERS WILL HELP PUSH 
EDUCATION TO THE TOP OF CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. BUT CAN COMPETING 
INTERESTS COME TOGETHER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For two days this week, some of California's best and brightest leaders will 
get a lesson in dropouts, crowded classrooms, campus violence, skimpy budgets, 
low test scores, rising poverty, the complexity of educating youngsters who do 
not speak English and flagging public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this will be new to Lannie Foster. As a longtime teacher at Jordan 
High School in Watts, she has more than a nodding acquaintance with the 
problems besetting many of the state's 7,600 public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Foster is hopeful about the statewide education summit to be held 
in San Francisco on Tuesday and Wednesday. Convened by Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco) and featuring a broad spectrum of political and 
educational views, the summit reflects a growing recognition that Californians 
want better results from their $24-billion-a-year system of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard people talking about what we need for 25 years, but I'm hoping 
that this time we'll get a strategy, a proactive plan for California," said 
Foster, who could not wangle a hard-to-get invitation to the summit. Referring 
to the summit's packed roster of political, business, education and community 
leaders, she added: "This time we'll have the movers and the shakers, and I 
hope they're ready to start moving and shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers hope the summit will help push education to the top of the state's 
legislative agenda, now dominated by crime and the economy. They also want to 
build consensus for overhauling the state's system of public schools, the 
largest in the nation with 5.2 million students. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable television stations statewide will make gavel-to-gavel coverage 
available to 6 million households, and Brown's office has set up a hot line for 
people to call in their comments and suggestions. With almost a week to go 
before the summit, the toll-free hot line, (800) SPEAK 94, had logged more than 
7,200 calls, Brown's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit will explore ambitious topics -- the status of the education system 
and its changing student profile, how school quality affects California's 
economic future, the teaching profession, ways to reorganize and pay for 
schools, and campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the education community will say, 'Gee, yes, we knew all that stuff,' 
but this is a seminar for the public and for the legislators who represent 
them," said Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for child development 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be in the broad context of where we are, where we need to be 
and what it's going to take to get us there -- just defining that will put us 
10 years ahead of where we've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School Boards Assn., sees the 
summit in part as a long overdue opportunity to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of misconceptions about public schools. . . . We should be 
able to get reality out on the table and look at the good, the great, (as well 
as) what's not working," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Education reform faces many obstacles, including deep disagreement over 
exactly what needs to be done and who should be running the reform show. Some 
divisions will be in evidence at the summit, as groups ranging from the 
California Teachers Assn. to the Assn. of Urban School Districts to Children 
Now forward their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Some groups will call for higher spending; others will want to set standards 
for student achievement and hold teachers and principals accountable for the 
results. Others will want changes in the way teachers are trained and 
evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 Making reform work is especially complicated in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the state's largest, where costly efforts to revamp the way schools 
operate must be reconciled with a pledge to end a 10% pay cut imposed on 
teachers. The teachers union is talking strike if salaries are not restored. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also some concern that politics will dominate the summit, given the 
upcoming races for governor and state superintendent of public instruction and 
the expected presence at the summit of all the major candidates. Brown has 
close ties to the politically powerful California Teachers Assn., the biggest 
education lobby in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very important player in this is Willie Brown and his attitude in this," 
said one education leader. Reform is possible, the source said, if Brown "sends 
some key signals at the summit that he is serious about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has said school reform is a top priority and that he would consider any 
proposals. Optimists cite Brown's statewide economic summit of a year ago, 
which is credited with helping break the gridlock in workers' compensation 
reform and clearing the way for economy stimulus legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But others wonder whether anything of substance will result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've become fairly cynical about most politicians and their ability to deal 
with schools," said George Woods, a social studies teacher for 26 years at 
Venice High School in Los Angeles. "I'm sick and tired of some phonies talking 
about how to fix education. The issue is we don't spend enough on public 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders said they will make the case that school reform is a key to 
ensuring a healthy economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much more than a schools issue, this is an economic issue, and it's 
the key to many others -- you can't fix crime until you fix education," said 
Jere Jacobs, a Pacific Telesis executive active with the California Business 
Roundtable's education task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the state's economic problems continue to pose a roadblock to reform and 
widen the rift between those who believe schools should learn to get by on what 
they have and those who say there is not enough money to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Recession-induced budget cuts in Sacramento, which provides most of the money 
for public schools, have forced local districts over the last few years to 
increase class sizes, cut scores of services and let campuses fall into 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Once among the most generous to its schools, California slipped to 42nd among 
the 50 states in the amount it spends per student. At the same time, the 
proportion of needy students and those who do not speak English is growing. In 
the Los Angeles Unified School District, 280,000 students are not proficient at 
speaking English. 
</P>
<P>
 California's nationally heralded reforms of a decade ago, launched with broad 
political and education Establishment support and money to pay for the changes, 
resulted in a stronger curriculum that put the state at the forefront of the 
school improvement drive. Better teacher training, new ways of assessing 
student achievement, fewer dropouts and larger numbers of students taking 
college preparatory courses were some of the payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts still failed to reach large numbers of the most troubled 
students, and did nothing to ease the burden heaped on local districts by a 
seven-volume set of state education regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is a move to free schools and districts from most state requirements 
and allow local educators and parents more power to decide what is best for 
their students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have spent lots of time telling people how they have to operate and 
relatively little time measuring outcomes and deciding what to do when those 
outcomes fall short," said state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), a key 
player in much of the state's education reform legislation for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're beginning to get out of the way and give schools a great deal more 
freedom in managing their educational affairs," said Hart, who spearheaded last 
year's pioneering charter schools law, which allows up to 100 schools to chart 
their own courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the summit's favor is the wide recognition that public sentiment 
for reform is running high. That became clear in last fall's ballot fight over 
a proposal to let parents use tax vouchers for private school tuition, 
presumably from funds set aside for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's voters rejected the measure after the education Establishment 
spent more than $16 million on a campaign that argued that public schools would 
be devastated by the voucher measure. But that did not mean voters were 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Analyses showed that only 1% of the people who voted against the initiative 
did so because they thought the schools were OK," said Guilbert Hentschke, dean 
of the USC School of Education. "This was clearly a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to capitalize on the momentum for change, the governor turned to the 
head of a national education advisory group to attend the summit and serve as 
an "honest broker" in building agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's choice, Frank Newman, president of the Denver-based Education 
Commission of the States, said he has been working with Brown's staff and is 
"enthused" about the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody at this point sees these two (efforts) as going together," 
Newman said. "It's really hard to get thoughtful, coherent, systemic reform, 
and there needs to be a nonpartisan, nonpolitical agent to bring that about." 
The summit could help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "California educators were scared by the voucher initiative, and they have 
begun to realize that if you want more money -- and certainly the schools in 
California are going to need it -- you can't get it unless people believe that 
you are actually moving toward higher performance," Newman said. "You have to 
have a plan, have to be going somewhere."

BUDGET OFFICE IS WARY ABOUT HEALTH 'ALLIANCES'; REFORM: THE CO-OPS AND THE 
SUPERVISORY NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD ARE SEEN AS FACING NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TASKS. 
THE CBO STUDY CAN FIND NO GUARANTEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All but lost in last week's furor over the Congressional Budget Office's 
analysis of President Clinton's health care proposal was the most significant 
and troubling subtext of the study: No one can guarantee that the plan will 
actually work. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would create a variety of entities whose tasks, according to the CBO, 
would verge on the impossible. Chief among them are gigantic regional 
"alliances," responsible for buying health care for most Americans, and a 
National Health Board to supervise the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "New institutions will be required, and new responsibilities will be imposed 
on existing institutions," the CBO report said. "Their abilities to perform 
will be in doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO's assessment is particularly important because of the credibility that 
the office has developed in nearly 20 years of analyzing the costs and benefits 
of government programs. Members of Congress who are looking for reasons to 
oppose Clinton's approach to curbing health care costs and providing insurance 
for all Americans will find plenty of ammunition in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report made headlines for its determination that the Clinton plan is, in 
effect, a governmental takeover of health coverage and that it would cost 
billions of dollars more than the Administration has estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not all the 92-page report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The central thing to know about this report is that it is the absolutely 
best-case scenario for a completely untested enterprise to be tried by people 
who have never gotten anything right," said Lawrence O'Donnell, the Democratic 
chief of staff for the Senate Finance Committee, which has primary jurisdiction 
over the bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 For the system to work, according to the study, the new institutions created 
by Clinton's plan would have to perform better than virtually any other 
public-sector agency ever has -- and right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases in point are the alliances, the cooperative purchasing groups through 
which more than 70% of all Americans would be required to get their health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic idea is that by banding consumers together into large groups, the 
alliances can spread the health risks that have often made it impossible for 
individuals and small businesses to obtain coverage, as well as give them 
greater economic clout in the market for health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in practice, the CBO report said, these alliances would have to combine 
the jobs of purchasing agents, contract negotiators, welfare agencies, 
financial intermediaries and premium collectors. They would have to keep track 
of who is moving in and out of their areas, which plans are signing up the 
sickest people, who is eligible for subsidies and a host of other constantly 
shifting conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, they would also have to figure out how to live within the 
premium caps that would be dictated to them by the proposed National Health 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any one of these functions could be a major undertaking for an existing 
agency with some experience, let alone for a new agency that would have to 
perform them all," the CBO report said. "Some regional alliances might succeed 
very well; others might be overwhelmed by these tasks, especially in their 
early years of operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents of the Clinton plan have seized upon the whole idea of 
alliances as unworkable -- and possibly a greater liability than the plan's 
requirement that all employers provide coverage for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see employer mandates as insurmountable problems. I'm not for them, 
but I don't think they destroy the economy. I think health cooperatives do 
destroy the health care market," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Even Clinton's supporters say they are not wedded to the alliances. "We're 
continuing to evaluate that. I'm not committed to the belief that that's the 
only way to go, or even the best way to go," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health. 
</P>
<P>
 A different set of problems could confront the National Health Board, which 
would be charged with determining how much each alliance could spend on health 
care. To do that, it would need accurate and detailed information on health 
care costs, as well as how they should be adjusted for demographics and other 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO report casts doubt, however, on whether the information that the 
proposed board would need to do its job would even be available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even have the data on the state level, let alone the sub-state 
level," said Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), the ranking Republican on the 
House Ways and Means health subcommittee and a critic of the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, some analysts have said, are the political problems that the board 
would face. What if, for instance, the board decided that people in Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., should be limited to paying no more than $3,000 a year in premiums, while 
those in Boston could spend $6,000? 
</P>
<P>
 If the people in Tuscaloosa and other low-premium areas perceive that their 
health choices are more limited or the quality of their care is lower as a 
result, the pressure to overrule the board might prove irresistible, some 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic goal of the CBO report was to produce a set of reliable numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell's boss, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), has several times 
bluntly expressed doubts about the Administration's economic projections. In a 
nationally televised interview several months ago, he flatly declared them "a 
fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the clear message of the CBO report was that any forecast -- even its own 
-- is highly suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly true when looking far into the future. "Unfortunately, 
the uncertainty surrounding cost estimates increases significantly in the out 
years," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most important, Waxman insisted, is the CBO's assertion that Clinton's 
basic goal of health care coverage for all Americans is achievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't deny the fact that when you deal with significant changes in a major 
part of the economy, there's no absolute certainty," he said. "We do know what 
we're experiencing now with the present health care system, and I can't see 
anybody defending that system."

CONSERVATIVES GATHER, TARGET CLINTON POLICIES FOR COUNTERATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a frustrating year watching President Clinton steal much of the 
rhetorical thunder on the right, conservatives are mapping a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 The blueprint that emerged this weekend from a conference of conservative 
leaders and grass-roots activists is aimed at exploiting what they view as the 
juicy targets offered by Clinton's policies, including tax increases, the 
President's espousal of family values and his response to crises in Bosnia and 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has reinvigorated the right," said David Keene, chairman of the 
American Conservative Union, one of the sponsoring organizations of the 
three-day Conservative Political Action Conference, which ended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy that emerged at the sessions included efforts to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Contrast Clinton's centrist promises with what conference participants say 
is his liberal performance. "He talks about fighting crime, but he cuts the 
budget for the Drug Enforcement Administration," said University of Delaware 
sophomore Thomas Hart, one of the 1,800 people who attended the conference 
forums and caucused in the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton says he only wants to raise taxes on the rich," said Brett Balkcom, a 
Republican precinct chairman in Forestville, Md. "But the people he's taxing 
are the only ones who have the capital to risk to give the rest of us jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 * Spotlight what the participants said are the President's weak points, such 
as foreign policy: "We are on the same downward spiral as we were in the 
(Jimmy) Carter years when the U.S. was feared by none, respected by few and 
ignored by many," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to the conference, Dole chided Clinton for temporizing with 
North Korea while it develops a nuclear arsenal, and with Serbia while it mauls 
Bosnia. Dole urged that the United States ignore the arms embargo against 
Bosnia, unilaterally if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Clinton weakness, conservatives believe, is his push for health care 
reform, which they contend reveals his underlying liberal thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the American people understand what Clinton's plan entails in cost, jobs 
and freedom, it is going to get a reception that is going to make the weather 
outside seem warm and wonderful," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), referring to a 
crippling winter storm in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * Persuade citizens that conservative principles and policies can better meet 
their everyday needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives need to make the case to voters that Clinton and the Democrats 
are "not using government to serve you, they are making government your 
master," said Brett Schundler, who in 1992 became the first modern-day 
Republican mayor of the Democratic stronghold of Jersey City, N.J. "We need to 
give examples that show how government can be used to serve people." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservatives also found a contradiction in Clinton's stress on family 
values. Former education secretary and drug enforcement chief William J. 
Bennett told one conference session that Clinton's talk of traditional values 
is fine, but "the American people want him to govern by them and live by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the 1,800 people attending the meetings set a record for 
the conference, which has been held since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just great to find out there are so many other people who think 
the way I do," said Paula Wilson, a Lynchburg, Va., housewife, who said she was 
drawn to the meeting by her fear of big government. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative direct-mail specialist Richard A. Viguerie said his business is 
soaring. He said that while he has been mailing out 25 million to 30 million 
letters a year on behalf of conservative groups, in 1994 he expects that to 
swell to 75 million letters, the most since Carter was in the White House in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Viguerie said conservatives are missing something now that they had then 
-- a clearly recognizable champion to fill Ronald Reagan's shoes. "We don't 
have a point person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour urged those at the conference not 
to think too far ahead. "I remind you that the first thing we can do to help 
elect a President in 1996 is to focus on the 1994 elections," he said.

MASS. STUDENTS SEE VICTORY IN COST-OF-TUITION BATTLE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students who occupied a University of Massachusetts building declared victory 
Saturday after administrators agreed to join their fight against a predicted 
increase in tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to get the chancellor behind us, and now he is," said David 
Nunez, president of the Student Government Assn.

 Tuition and fees at UMass-Amherst have soared 167% since 1988. State residents 
living on campus pay $9,364 in tuition and fees. Out-of-state students pay 
$15,710. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen students ended their 14-hour occupation of the admissions 
building Saturday when Chancellor David K. Scott agreed to oppose any increase 
in tuition and fees, as long as the state raises the university's budget 
allocation 3% to cover inflation.

WINTER-WEARY EAST STRUGGLES TO DIG OUT; WEATHER: AIRPORTS REOPEN IN NORTHEAST. 
BUT ELSEWHERE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS ARE STILL WITHOUT POWER.

 Exhausted travelers, snowplow drivers and winter-weary residents tried to cope 
Saturday with the worst snowstorm to hit the East in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports reopened as snow was plowed off runways in the Northeast, and utility 
crews spliced ice-damaged power lines in the South. Still, life was far from 
normal after the latest in a numbing succession of storms. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, the Hudson River resembled an ice floe. Plows buried parked 
cars under mountains of snow and people skied in parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities had nowhere left to throw all the snow. "We've got to put it 
somewhere," said Ken MacNeil of the Public Works Department in Weymouth, Mass. 
"God put it here; God's going to take it away somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 12th storm of the season for the Northeast, and many snow-removal 
budgets were depleted. Massachusetts legislators were scheduled this week to 
consider state aid for many communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports in the Northeast resumed service Saturday, but some still had delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston's Logan Airport had two runways operating, but many flights were 
canceled or delayed because aircraft were icebound in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New York metropolitan area, La Guardia and John F. Kennedy airports 
each had one runway open Saturday, while both runways were open at Newark, 
N.J., said Sgt. Stephen Prospero of the Port Authority, which operates the 
airports. Newark got a record 18 inches of snow Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of travelers slept in airport terminals. Some had been trying to 
leave the city since Tuesday when an earlier storm dumped 10 inches on the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore-Washington International Airport had both main runways in use and 
flights were jammed with people whose previous flights had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 An Amtrak train with 135 passengers from Jacksonville, Fla., finally pulled 
into the capital Saturday after being stranded for 11 hours in Virginia because 
of frozen signals and ice-covered trees that fell on the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Island Rail Road, the nation's largest commuter rail system with 
250,000 passengers on an average weekday, was offering only limited service 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as six inches of ice coated parts of Mississippi, and Greenville Mayor 
Frank Self said he barely recognized his own town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look like Bosnia," Self said of his city of 50,000 people. "There are very 
few streets you can go down. Every tree is broken down. It is a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee officials estimated about 417,000 people statewide were still 
without power Saturday. The storm initially knocked out service to close to 
800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200,000 customers were without power Saturday in Mississippi, 
down from 500,000, and 175,000 had no water, said Bo Robinson, public service 
commissioner for the northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250,000 customers were without power in Virginia, utilities reported, 
and National Guard troops were sent to help evacuate residents of blacked-out 
Caroline County. Thousands of other people were still without electricity 
Saturday in West Virginia, South Carolina, Arkansas, Maryland and Delaware.

BOSNIA COMBATANTS STOP SURRENDERING BIG GUNS TO U.N.; BALKANS: EFFECT ON 
SARAJEVO CEASE-FIRE IS UNCLEAR. MEANWHILE, PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA BREAK UP WITH 
NO PROGRESS REPORTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Government and Bosnian Serb fighters who had just begun surrendering their big 
guns to the United Nations stopped Saturday, but whether that was only a hitch 
in the 2-day-old truce or a more dangerous sign remained to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was full of ominous developments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite U.S. and Russian pressure on the warring sides, peace talks in 
Geneva broke up with no progress reported, raising further doubts about the 
viability of the Sarajevo cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. State Department ordered the families of American diplomats and 
government employees to leave Yugoslavia immediately, embassy officials in 
Belgrade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was precipitated by NATO's ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs to withdraw 
their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by midnight Feb. 20 or face air strikes. Many 
in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia support the Bosnian Serbs, and the U.S. government 
apparently is worried about a backlash against Americans if the air strikes are 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bosnian Serb TV showed film Saturday night of camouflage-clad fighters 
aiming shoulder-held ground-to-air missiles at imaginary NATO planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Displays of bluffing and brinkmanship have characterized war and peace in the 
Balkans, and it was unclear whether Saturday's developments meant that the 
latest of numerous cease-fires was in danger of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs, while chafing at the NATO ultimatum, agreed as part of Wednesday's 
cease-fire to pull back their heavy weapons and put them under U.N. 
supervision. The order also applied to Bosnia's Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 After handing over several mortars and other big guns at Sarajevo-area 
barracks Friday, neither side turned in any weapons on Saturday, said Maj. Jose 
Labandeira, a U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian army turned over five guns Friday but decided to keep the rest for 
now, saying the Serbs had 10 times as many but had turned in only 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have many more weapons than we do, so they must hand in many more," said 
Gen. Jovan Divjak, the deputy Bosnian army commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Divjak charged that the Serbs had withdrawn their big guns from the 12-mile 
zone around Sarajevo but were hiding some or taking them to other battle 
fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo was unusually peaceful, although a tank shell that landed near 
downtown Saturday afternoon injured two people. 
</P>
<P>
 French peacekeepers have camped out at six flash points of the Sarajevo 
fighting since Thursday, and Friday night was the quietest in months. 
</P>
<P>
 The French soldiers began working to restore electricity to the city, a repair 
job that will take at least 10 days if peace holds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once all the lights are on, life will be transformed," said Lt. Gen. Michael 
Rose, the new U.N. commander in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Sarajevans who wanted to watch the opening of the Winter 
Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, had to hook up portable TVs to car batteries 
or watch at the few places that had electricity. The 1984 Winter Games were 
held in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible when I remember all the beauty during the Sarajevo Olympic 
Games," said Ismet Kaminlija, an army captain who watched the ceremony from a 
hospital bed, where he was recovering from a machine-gun wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's peacekeepers were thin on the ground -- about 30 at each cease-fire 
line -- but 150 Malaysian reinforcements arrived in Sarajevo, while others set 
up at Bosnian Serb positions in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mt. Trebevic, southeast of the capital, French Lt. Lionel Paillot and his 
infantrymen moved into a burned-out restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Milenko Blagojevic, a Bosnian Serb machine-gunner nearby, said he didn't think 
NATO would bomb his position. If it does, he said, "The people here will kill 
those French with axes and knives." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rose said the U.N. troops were there to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The troops who have been put on the ground between the warring elements will 
not go back," he said. If fired on, "they will fire back. But that won't happen 
because people want peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday marked the one-week anniversary of the mortar shell explosion at 
Markale market that killed 68 people, injured 142 and led NATO to issue its 
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 In northwestern Bosnia, Serbs and Bosnian army troops battled on the Grabez 
plateau near Bihac, according to U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government radio said that Bosnian Serb fighters fired on mosques in 
the towns of Cazin, Bihac and Ostrozac and that a number of civilians were 
killed. The report could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Croats fired 69 shells into the Muslim sector of Mostar, in the south, Friday 
night, Aikman said.

BLAST DESTROYS HAITI FUEL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An explosion destroyed Haiti's center for contraband gasoline and diesel fuel 
Saturday night, gutting a stretch of warehouses, stores, a hotel, and two 
loaded fuel trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blast was unknown.No casualties were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion along the Rue de Cesar in downtown Port-au-Prince could be seen 
throughout the Haitian capital. Tens of thousands of gallons of contraband fuel 
were stored in the warehouses. People on the scene said the two fuel trucks had 
come from the neighboring Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss will intensify the already severe fuel shortage in Haiti, which was 
placed under a U.N. fuel embargo in October to pressure military leaders, who 
overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991, to step 
down.

INKATHA TO BOYCOTT S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party decided Saturday to boycott the 
nation's first all-race election, joining pro-apartheid whites in a move that 
could undermine the watershed vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But political leaders said there still was time to overcome disputes and get 
all groups to participate in the April 26-28 election. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the groups in the opposition Freedom Alliance had registered for the 
election by the midnight Saturday deadline, although President Frederik W. de 
Klerk has said Parliament could extend the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In resolutions passed Saturday, Inkatha's central committee called for 
supporters to boycott the election and to oppose it "in any and every way which 
is permissible by law."

MUSCOVITES WARNED NOT TO GO OUTSIDE AFTER DRINKING; RUSSIA: FREEZING WEATHER 
PROMPTS OFFICIAL INJUNCTION. COLD IS BLAMED FOR 18 DEATHS IN THE CAPITAL IN A 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With deaths mounting from a cold spell extreme even for Moscow, health 
authorities on Saturday issued a Russian version of the injunction not to drink 
and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't drink and go outside," they told Muscovites. 
</P>
<P>
 From Friday morning to Saturday morning, four people froze to death on the 
Russian capital's streets, Moscow's Main Medical Directorate reported. Eighteen 
have died in the cold in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 people needed medical help for frostbite last week, and about half 
of those cases ended in amputation, the directorate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chief, Anatoly Solovyov, sent an urgent appeal to the city's 10 million 
residents: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't abuse alcohol!" Solovyov said through the Interfax news agency. "It's a 
simple truth -- to drink is bad for your health, and in the current weather 
conditions it could end tragically. If you have nonetheless imbibed alcoholic 
beverages, don't leave warm buildings!" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the month, Moscow and much of the European part of 
Russia have been undergoing the same biting weather that has visited the 
Eastern Seaboard of the United States -- but with no letup. Nighttime 
temperatures have hovered near 20 degrees below zero, and daytime highs have 
been about 5 below. Friday night was the winter's coldest so far, hitting 
nearly 40 below. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians consider this ideal weather -- deep frost combined with sunny 
skies that bring out the sparkle in snow. Winter is Russia's signature season, 
time for skiing, skating, strolling in the snow and then warming up with a toss 
of vodka near a huge Russian stove or in a steamy sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current freeze oversteps the bounds of enjoyment, to the point that 
Russian media are already trying to recall the last time it was so cold for so 
long. Many refer to a spell of 40-below temperatures in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal, Solovyov also begged Muscovites to be "merciful" to the 
intoxicated, helping them rather than just passing by. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is this cold, he said, it takes only 20 or 30 minutes for fingers, 
cheeks and ears to freeze. He pointed out that children left outside for long 
periods are especially at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily Segodnya newspaper said that last year, 454 people died of the 
winter cold in Moscow. In parts of northern Russia where fuel is in short 
supply this year, the numbers may be even more frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists predict that the Russian deep freeze will continue through 
Monday before temperatures rise to about zero degrees.

FREAK SNOWSTORM HITS TOKYO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A freak snowstorm brought havoc to the Japanese capital Saturday, causing 
scores of traffic accidents and delaying hundreds of thousands of air and 
railway passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said about 120 people were injured in car and pedestrian accidents 
as a result of the storm, which dropped about 8.3 inches of snow on Tokyo and 
its suburbs, the heaviest snowfall in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No deaths were reported, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 82,000 travelers were stranded at airports in Tokyo and Nagoya in 
central Japan after about 600 domestic flights were canceled, airport officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of incoming international flights were diverted to other airports as 
Tokyo's Narita international airport was temporarily closed. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 passengers were left waiting at stations for delayed local 
commuter trains and long-distance bullet trains, a Japan Railway spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meteorological Agency warned of more heavy snow for Tokyo, saying the 
blizzard was expected to continue into the evening, with total snowfall up to 
12 inches.

CLAN BATTLES DRIVE THOUSANDS FROM SOMALI CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clan battles drove up to 5,000 people out of the southern port of Kismayu, and 
a grenade blast forced aid agencies Saturday to pull all foreign staff out of a 
central Somali town for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles in Kismayu, gateway to the fertile south, were the worst in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officers see the port as a prime flash point for renewed civil war with 
the pullout of U.S. troops and their Western allies from Somalia by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 They said militiamen loyal to Mohamed Siad Hirsi, who goes by the nom de 
guerre Gen. Morgan, drove up to 5,000 Ogadeni sub-clan civilians out of the 
Kismayu area in 90 minutes of battles Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military spokesman said a total of seven people were killed and 42 were 
wounded in fighting between Morgan's forces and supporters of rival warlord 
Omar Jess, who was routed from the town in March last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kismayu was quiet but tense Saturday with civilians and aid workers staying 
indoors. Aid workers who left Saturday said violence was expected to resume 
after forces regrouped. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials believe the Kismayu fighting is a prelude to more clashes as 
clans jockey for position to fill a power vacuum caused by the withdrawal of 
the U.S. and Western units. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said the battles were sparked by an attack Thursday by warlord 
Mohammed Farah Aidid's Somali National Alliance (SNA) militia on a Morgan camp 
in Bulo Xaaji, 50 miles southwest of Kismayu.

NORWAY'S BEST-KNOWN PAINTING STOLEN FROM MUSEUM IN OSLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two thieves Saturday stole Norway's most famous painting, "The Scream," by 
19th-Century artist Edvard Munch, from the National Gallery in central Oslo, 
the gallery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, filmed by video surveillance, climbed into the building using a 
ladder early Saturday.They smashed a window, grabbed the painting and 
disappeared in an operation that took about a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like someone stole the 'Mona Lisa,' " said Oslo University art professor 
Trygve Nergaard. He feared that Munch's painting, on fragile paper, could be 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm was set off at 6:30 a.m. Police arrived within minutes, but by then 
the thieves were gone. They left behind the 10-foot ladder and the wire cutters 
used to cut the wire that attached the painting to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Munch painted "The Scream" in 1893 as part of his "Frieze of Life" series, in 
which sickness, death, anxiety and love are central themes. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, executed in garish colors and sinuous, powerful brush strokes, 
shows a figure on a bridge, screaming for no discernible reason, as two shadowy 
figures stand in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique and the portrayal of personal, nameless horror exerted a strong 
influence on the Expressionists of the early 20th Century. The image is one of 
the art world's most recognizable and has been widely used on T-shirts and joke 
items. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to estimate the value of the painting. But it is Norway's 
most valuable painting, Munch's most renowned and impossible to sell," Berg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Munch's painting "The Vampire" was stolen from the Munch Museum 
in Oslo. It was recovered. by police the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, another Munch painting was stolen from the National Gallery. The 
"Portrait Study" has not been found.

U.S. HAS ALREADY SPENT $900 MILLION IN EARTHQUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before President Clinton's approval of the $8.6-billion earthquake relief 
package, the federal government has spent more than $900 million in emergency 
aid since the Jan. 17 earthquake, much of it to help victims repair homes or 
find new shelter and to reconstruct shattered roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The money has been flowing from just about every federal agency for a wide 
range of other uses as well, from digging out a Ventura County persimmon 
orchard to having experts on hand ready to decipher some unknown disease that 
might break out. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8 quake killed at least 57 people, toppled freeways and damaged or 
destroyed more than 15,500 homes. State officials have estimated the total cost 
of the damage at $13 billion to $20 billion, and warned that the figure could 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 To help with the recovery, Clinton on Saturday approved $8.6 billion in 
earthquake relief -- the largest disaster aid package in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even apart from those funds, emergency money has been streaming into the 
region at a dizzying clip. Paradoxically, the relief effort this time around 
has benefited from the government's involvement in previous Southern California 
disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have a certain familiarity with the state apparatus and with local 
governments so that Los Angeles has an advantage over some other disaster 
sites," said Larry Parks, a spokesman for Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who is 
coordinating federal spending on the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 During this emergency, the big spenders include the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, which has set aside nearly $280 million for quake-related 
housing needs. Much of the money had been in the pipeline for Los Angeles 
before the quake and was expedited. 
</P>
<P>
 But emergency aid is also being provided by such agencies as the Department of 
Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service, which has kicked in $50,000 to repair 
half a mile of fence destroyed on a Ventura County ranch and to unearth several 
acres of persimmons and irrigation lines that were buried under tons of earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health and Human Services is providing $27.5 million to 
cover the costs of such things as outreach to senior citizens who are quake 
victims and damage to National Institutes of Health research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also set aside money to provide expert assistance from the 
Centers for Disease Control to help local health officials identify any 
baffling illness or disease patterns wrought by the quake. Los Angeles 
residents will be glad to learn that the services have not been needed, said 
Tony Itteilag, deputy assistant secretary for health management. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown of federal emergency funding to date includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * FEMA has distributed about $116 million to 37,800 families for temporary 
housing assistance. FEMA has also given the state $200 million to cover costs 
it has spent on earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 * HUD has provided nearly $175 million in community development block grant 
and home funds to the cities of Los Angeles, Glendale, Pasadena, Santa Monica, 
Burbank and Santa Clarita and to Ventura and Los Angeles counties to repair 
housing. The agency also is distributing about $100 million for low-income 
housing subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Agriculture has provided more than $57.4 million in food 
stamps to about 202,000 families. The agency has also provided nearly 3 million 
pounds of food worth $1.8 million to soup kitchens shelters and community 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Small Business Administration has distributed more than $33.6 million in 
low-interest loans to repair homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Transportation has awarded the state $95 million in 
emergency funds to repair and reconstruct highways and road systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Department of Education has sent about $7 million to the Los Angeles 
Unified School District for food, counseling, transportation and to extend 
school hours.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; CSUN BRACES FOR COURSE IN LEARNING AMID THE 
RUBBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The president of Cal State Northridge takes comfort these days from a saying 
she once heard: All a university really needs is a tree, and a professor under 
it to teach the students who gather there. 
</P>
<P>
 And although conditions will not be quite that Spartan for the 24,000 CSUN 
students and faculty members who return to class beginning Monday, they'd 
better expect life on the devastated campus to be hobbled by quake damage for 
months, or perhaps years, to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news, as President Blenda J. Wilson put it: "The buildings that 
existed on the campus are in large measure damaged in a variety of ways." The 
good news: "The people on the campus are not." 
</P>
<P>
 So scratch the library, the labs and the classrooms, most of which have been 
closed by quake damage that has delayed the beginning of the semester by two 
weeks. Most students will be routed to more than 300 modular classrooms 
hurriedly erected throughout the 353-acre campus, or to 25 new off-campus class 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 They may be there a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill for the school's quake damage -- still under review but unofficially 
estimated at $250 million to $350 million -- promises to be the largest ever 
for a natural disaster at a U.S. university, campus officials say. Indeed, it 
may be the largest disaster to an American institution of higher learning from 
any cause since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the damaged facilities -- except for a collapsed $11-million 
parking structure -- appear repairable, school officials say. And if they 
receive disaster aid promised by the state and federal governments, 
administrators said, they can probably put some damaged buildings back into 
service during the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every one of about 60 major buildings on campus has some degree of 
structural damage, the most serious being the Oviatt Library, the east building 
of the Fine Arts complex, and the so-called South Library, which housed the 
university's computers, said Mike Delvin, an engineer working for the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the problems can be solved by patching or replacing damaged walls, he 
said. Among other major buildings, the Sierra complex is closed while workers 
remove a damaged stairwell from Sierra Tower; the engineering building is 
closed for asbestos removal, and the science complex is closed because of fire 
damage and hazardous material contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the quake struck before dawn when the university was between 
semesters, campus buildings were virtually empty, avoiding what could have been 
a large loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is far less a disaster than it might have been," Wilson said. "It's 
impossible to conceptualize what the damage to human life could have been. We 
feel blessed simply that it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two CSUN students -- 21-year-old Manuel Sandoval and 19-year-old roommate 
Jaime Reyes -- died in the Jan. 17 quake when the off-campus Northridge Meadows 
apartment building that they had just moved into collapsed. Officials said the 
only serious injury on campus occurred when a student twisted a knee during one 
of the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the quake, university officials have adopted a motto for their 
planned return: "Not just back . . . better!"  
</P>
<P>
 But after weeks of working from tents that replaced their offices, they were 
hesitant to predict when the university might return to normal. Some said that 
completing all repairs could take two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was clear immediately after the quake that the campus was hard 
hit, the toll of damage grew in the following weeks to far more than had been 
suspected as aftershocks continued and unexpected problems continued to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Thursday, when students began moving back into campus housing, 
officials had to quickly shuffle assignments because several structurally sound 
student dorm buildings were found to have broken water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Early that day, in the wake of two aftershocks that came weeks after the 
original quake, a water cooling unit on the roof of the university's 
structurally damaged administration building also failed, sending water 
flooding through the five-story facility to worsen the prior damage, campus 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the worst blow was to the Delmar T. Oviatt Library, the centerpiece of 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, although the imposing 220,000-square-foot building suffered 
extensive cosmetic damage, university officials said it appeared structurally 
sound. They were planning to try to reopen it by mid-March, about a month after 
the start of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But those hopes -- and the spirits of many on campus -- sank last week when 
engineers said they had discovered serious structural problems in the 
building's east and west wings. The library is closed indefinitely as engineers 
cut into the building to identify the full extent of the structural problems. 
"With every layer, we find something different. It's going to take some time 
just to stabilize it," Delvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 600,000 volumes on its open shelves were toppled by the 
earthquake, officials said, and rain leaked in through the roof a week ago, 
damaging about 15 boxes of rare books and papers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, campus officials have arranged for CSUN students to use 
libraries at UCLA until mid-March and plan to offer daily shuttle service 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some effects of the quake may last longer. Recruiting new administrators and 
faculty members may be more difficult now, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although CSUN's athletic facilities escaped with only minor damage, the 
football program started slowly with only one player signed because recruiting 
visits were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, faculty members and students appeared eager to get the campus 
operating again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing about students who just can't wait to get back. It's been too 
long of a break for them. I know the faculty feel that way," said Faculty 
Senate President Louise Lewis, an art history professor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although many faculty members have been on campus at least briefly since the 
quake to see the damage, the first glimpse may be a shock for many students. 
And students and faculty members will have to grapple with a campus layout that 
has been drastically transformed by the addition of hundreds of modular 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the sprawling campus's grassy areas and its paved parking lots have 
been swallowed up by 10 widely scattered clusters of portable classrooms, 
enough to house about 15,000 people. J. A. Jones Construction Co. of City of 
Commerce, CSUN's chief contractor for the project, had the classrooms towed in 
from as far as Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the scope of the project unprecedented, Jones purchasing manager Dave 
Lagan said they include 333 temporary classrooms housed in 135 trailers holding 
two each, 58 single classroom units and five lecture halls. In addition, there 
will be several dozen restroom and office trailers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the trailer city in time, Gov. Pete Wilson waived highway rules that 
usually would permit the extra-wide portable buildings to be moved only in 
daylight, Lagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials, who launched the plan late last month, expect to spend up to 
$6 million renting the buildings for this semester, hoping they will need far 
fewer by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of parking areas, where modular classrooms will be clustered, and the 
collapse of the 2,500-vehicle parking structure is expected to create a parking 
nightmare around the campus, where most students commute from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the university has sent its neighbors a letter asking for their 
patience. University officials were scrambling to produce additional parking 
areas, and on Saturday said they would have 1,500 spaces graded on the north 
campus area by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 spaces will be available Monday off campus at the site of a 
defunct Handyman's store, just west of the Northridge Fashion Center at Corbin 
Avenue and Plummer Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And for those who can reach the campus, problems will have just begun. 
University officials predict that the first week of classes will be chaotic, in 
large part because the loss of the regular classroom buildings wiped out the 
planned class schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and faculty members were not to learn, until publication of new 
schedules today, when and where their classes will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials also have transferred most of CSUN's lab and other 
specialized classes to 25 off-campus locations as far as UCLA in Westwood and 
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the shuttle to UCLA's libraries, CSUN students mostly will be 
responsible for their own transportation to the remote sites, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first week, people will need a good sense of patience and humor," said 
university Provost Louanne Kennedy, who lost her on-campus apartment to quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the second week, we will have everything worked out."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; REINFORCING FOR THE WORST MAY BE TOO COSTLY 
PREPAREDNESS: STATE SEISMIC PANEL SAYS NEW REGULATIONS SHOULD EMPHASIZE SAVING 
LIVES BUT NOT NECESSARILY AVOIDING INTERRUPTION OF NORMAL WORKDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The head of a state commission charged with strengthening earthquake codes 
said Saturday that it may not prove financially feasible to protect buildings 
fully against the strongest earthquakes that could strike the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilfred Iwan, chairman of the Seismic Safety Commission, said he does not 
believe the commission's mandate from Gov. Pete Wilson is to "prepare the codes 
for the biggest possible earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Iwan, a professor of mechanical engineering at Caltech, suggested that this 
would cost too much. He indicated that the code improvements that the 
commission will recommend by Sept. 1 would have to focus on protecting lives, 
but not necessarily on retaining normal workday functions in buildings struck 
by the most powerful earthquakes possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwan's remarks, near the close of three days of hearings at a Van Nuys hotel 
on the Northridge earthquake, were representative of the moderate tone adopted 
by members of the advisory commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, they appeared to endorse strengthening the codes, but they often 
expressed awareness of costs and political considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd S. Cluff, a Pacific Gas & Electric executive who is one of the 
commission's 15 members, said it was essential that the group complete its 
report by Wilson's Sept. 1 deadline because "this is an election year, and the 
governor may have only a few months to implement our advice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not predicting Wilson's defeat," Cluff quickly added. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwan said partisan politics will not affect the commission's work. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the commission's three members who are elected officials attended the 
half-day session Saturday. Among the missing was Los Angeles City Councilman 
Hal Bernson, who represents part of the San Fernando Valley. Staff members said 
Bernson, who had been present during the first two days of hearings, told them 
he had a schedule conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission members decided unanimously to back legislation offered by 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) to revive a state homeowners insurance 
fund that was repealed last year for fear it would have insufficient resources 
to pay off homeowners' losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias' bill would make the coverage mandatory, which it was not after it was 
adopted in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The legislation calls 
for charging homeowners an annual premium ranging from $25 to $75 a year, 
depending on the seismic risk in their areas. After a $2,000 deductible, the 
fund would pay homeowners up to $13,000 for quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners noted that if the fund had not acquired sufficient 
resources by the time a big earthquake hit, the payout would have been prorated 
according to the money available. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission set two more days of hearings at an as yet undetermined site in 
the Los Angeles area on March 2 and 3, and decided to hire an expert to 
supervise the project of recommending new seismic codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners suggested that their report try to assign responsibility 
for living up to code provisions and quake preparedness rules that exist. They 
expressed unhappiness with some Los Angeles school and hospital administrators 
who during the three-day hearing tried to blame others for preparedness 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge temblor was a vertical thrust earthquake generated by a deeply 
buried and as yet unidentified fault. A commission staff member said this has 
generated concern at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the 
agency charged with tsunami warnings, that if a similar fault slipped in so 
dramatic a fashion in Santa Monica Bay, it could have sent a gigantic wave 
ashore, with deadly consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard McCarthy, senior engineering geologist with the seismic commission, 
disclosed Saturday that NOAA plans to send a team to Southern California to 
assess the potential for such an event. 
</P>
<P>
 Only small tsunamis have struck Los Angeles-area beaches in history, and up 
until now the worst potential for large earthquake-generated waves in the state 
was thought to be along the North Coast in Humboldt and Del Norte counties, 
where an eventual mammoth earthquake is expected out to sea in the Cascadia 
Subduction Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said it is possible that plans for sea-bottom tsunami alert stations 
off Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Northern California could be extended to 
Southern California, although he cautioned that warning stations are not 
enough. He said there must also be substantial education about the danger, and 
development of beach evacuation plans.

BILL BOYARSKY: DON'T BLINK OR WE'LL END UP BUYING A STATION FOR MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know that MCA Inc. runs an earthquake ride in its Universal Studios 
amusement park, but that's no reason to spend federal earthquake relief money 
to build a subway station there. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's true. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Washington 
lobbyist, Arthur Sohikian, admitted the agency has discussed going after $42 
million of our hard-won earthquake aid to help finance a Metro Rail station 
near the politically powerful corporation's CityWalk and the rest of the theme 
park's attractions. It would come from funds in the $8.6-billion relief bill. 
There is $550 million in the bill that can be spent however President Clinton 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA's proposal has nothing to do with repairing earthquake damage. Rather, 
this is just the latest maneuver in an attempt to obtain federal funds for a 
subway stop at an amusement park and movie studio -- a subway to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Metro Rail subway is already being constructed and eventually will run 
through the Cahuenga Pass, connecting the San Fernando Valley to Hollywood and 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the route was first laid out, the subway planners proposed a stop at 
Universal City and the studio. At the time, MCA opposed it. Longtime transit 
board member Nick Patsaouras said that he and then-Mayor Tom Bradley visited 
MCA boss Lew Wasserman in the early '80s and asked him to reconsider. "He said: 
'We don't need a subway here,' " Patsaouras recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So transit planners found a site north of Universal City and began the 
expensive task of buying property and designing a station. 
</P>
<P>
 Then MCA changed its mind. The amusement park was a big success, as was 
CityWalk and a 14-theater multiplex. Cars packed the studio area. MCA asked the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to move the station to Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to understand that when MCA calls on government for help, it isn't 
like the owner of Joe's Market asking his councilman for a loading zone in 
front of the store. MCA and its chief, Wasserman, as generous political 
contributors, have a lot more clout. In fact, Wasserman has been the Democrats' 
premier fund raiser in California for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman's influence and friendships extend beyond the Democratic Party. When 
Ronald Reagan was a young actor, Wasserman was his agent. The friendship 
continued through Reagan's presidency. Then, as now, presidents, senators, 
governors and mayors returned Lew Wasserman's calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the transportation authority staff took on this titan. The staff 
reported that changing plans this late in the game would delay by 21 months the 
opening of the Valley subway leg and add $59 million to the cost.  
</P>
<P>
 MCA began negotiating with transit officials. Both sides agreed the cost 
increase could be cut to $41 million if MCA donated the land for the station, 
and paid for part of the construction. That wasn't good enough for Los Angeles 
City Councilman Nate Holden. "MCA should pay for the station themselves," 
Holden protested when the request came up at an MTA committee meeting Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holden didn't have a chance, as he might have guessed after observing the 
corps of powerful lobbyists MCA had unleashed at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA representative Joe Cerrell, a well-known lobbyist and Democratic political 
manager, circulated around the meeting room, talking to reporters and pols 
while members of his team distributed information sheets to the press. 
Attorneys George Mihlsten and Lucinda Starrett of Latham & Watkins, a major 
lawyer-lobbyist firm, presented the MCA case to the committee. North Hollywood 
residents supporting MCA, organized by company executive Christine Hanson, were 
in the audience. Some of them testified for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision was made at the meeting. But on Jan. 26, the transportation 
authority board voted to tell its Washington lobbyists to work with MCA 
lobbyists to try to find federal funds to pay for the additional costs of 
moving the subway station to Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, by then the earthquake had hit and MCA and transportation 
authority lobbyists were also working on the earthquake relief bill. Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan had asked Wasserman and other L.A. corporate 
chiefs to have their Washington lobbyists help push the earthquake relief bill 
through Congress. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority lobbyists also 
supported the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this frantic lobbying, a source familiar with the events told me, 
someone came up with the idea of tapping a big discretionary fund in the 
$8.6-billion earthquake relief bill. This fund, amounting to $550 million, was 
to be spent at Clinton's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the idea popped up at a meeting of the transit authority's 
Executive Management Committee. Riordan asked Sohikian, the MTA Washington 
lobbyist, "On the President's discretionary money on the emergency funds -- 
I've heard that $42 million has been set aside for the Universal Station. Have 
you heard anything about that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sohikian replied: "At this point, it is still at the discretion of the 
President how he spends that money. . . . But yes, that, that has been 
discussed, Mr. Mayor." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This exchange was reported in Friday's Times by reporter David Willman. At the 
same time, Patsaouras, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 
alternate on the MTA board, told the supervisor what had happened. With the 
embarrassing plan now in the open, Antonovich persuaded board members to call 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't imagine we've heard the last of MCA's subway to the stars. Backed by 
this kind of special interest, pork barrel projects never die. 
</P>
<P>
 They re-emerge over and over, buried in unrelated legislation. We'd better 
keep our eyes open.

OFFICIALS STRUGGLE TO HOUSE QUAKE VICTIMS; AFTERMATH: MANY DISPLACED RESIDENTS 
TURN DOWN TEMPORARY SHELTER BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO STAY IN THEIR BATTERED 
COMMUNITIES.

<P>
 Alfonso Gaitan would rather live in his earthquake-ravaged house in downtown 
Piru than move eight miles up the road to a temporary shelter on the wooded 
banks of a nearby lake. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just one of the hundreds of little realities confronting county 
officials these days as they fit the complexities of federal earthquake 
disaster relief programs with the specifics of Ventura County and its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency put up four trailers 
for quake victims at Lake Piru, about a 15-minute drive from Gaitan's 
dilapidated Main Street home. But there were no immediate takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaitan believes that the reason is simple, although not easily understood by 
federal bureaucrats: He and other Piru residents want to stay in their 
community, and the winding drive to Lake Piru is more inconvenient to local 
residents than outsiders might think. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Piru residents will bide their time in their cracked abodes, Gaitan said, 
until Ventura County sets up mobile homes in a more suitable location downtown 
-- a task local officials now are trying to get under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake battered Piru, Fillmore and Simi Valley, county 
officials have been formulating plans to build alternative housing for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 Ventura County dwellings were deemed unsafe and 900 were 
seriously damaged in the quake, according to building inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But helping residents get settled elsewhere is proving to be a difficult 
process, said Marty Robinson, who is coordinating the county's housing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a challenge to figure out a way to make all of these funding sources fit 
together to meet our needs," Robinson said. "We want to maximize what we can 
get to our residents as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider Robinson's 
recommendation to locate 20 mobile homes -- financed with FEMA money -- on a 
lemon grove in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has already put three trailers on Piru's Main Street for businesses 
that were displaced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize the nature of the community out there," Robinson said. 
"It's not a very wealthy community. People walk a lot in that little town. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everything you do is five miles away and you have no transportation, you 
have a hardship. That's why we are trying to keep things downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Fillmore, 50 mobile homes are expected to be placed near the 
city's central core, and construction is under way on a giant tent that will 
house damaged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials, meanwhile, said they have no plans to install trailers. 
But, they say, that doesn't mean that the temporary homes won't be constructed 
later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Simi Valley is using FEMA funds to help more than 600 mobile-home 
owners repair their damaged structures, said Laura Herron, deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the county, Robinson said officials have been working "around the 
clock" to help meet housing needs, especially for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen-hour days are pretty regular in our efforts to find the holes in the 
system and determine how people are going to fall through them," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to putting up the mobile homes, county officials are pushing 
forward with projects using the following funds: 
</P>
<P>
 * $2.8 million in federal community block grants will be spent to repair homes 
of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The money could also be used to build permanent and temporary housing in the 
Fillmore and Piru areas. About $160,000 will be used to pay for the business 
tent in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 * An undetermined amount of money from the local Area Housing Authority will 
be used to help lower-income quake victims pay their rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, authority officials said they received more than 725 applications 
for assistance. About 75 families in Fillmore, Simi Valley and Piru were 
approved to receive the money. 
</P>
<P>
 * $1 million in state housing grants will be used to assist first-time home 
buyers in Piru. Meanwhile, the federal government is paying for its own 
trailers in such areas as Lake Piru -- where gas, water and sewer hookups are 
readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are sources of money in all different directions," Supervisor Vicky 
Howard said. "We will be examining every source of money we can possibly find." 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for low-income residents warn that the county must be careful 
how it approaches the housing issues. While temporary homes are needed now, the 
county must make sure that enough permanent dwellings are available for 
low-income quake victims, advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must take care of these people with long-term solutions," said Lynn L. 
Jacobs, president of Affordable Communities Inc., which owns the Piru lemon 
grove where the 20 mobile homes will be placed. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable Communities plans to build housing for first-time home buyers and 
low-income apartments on the grove this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will be able to take a big bite out of the need," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard agreed that providing long-term affordable housing must be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps some good will come out of a disaster like this," Howard said. "We 
have had a very small amount of housing for people on lower incomes. We really 
should be working harder on providing those types of housing on a permanent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaitan, who has been out of work for two years, said he hopes to rebuild his 
Main Street home, which he shared with his mother and brother, with low-income 
grants secured by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, he is anxious to move into the county's temporary 
housing with his mother and brother, who are now staying with relatives in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will bring us back together," Gaitan said. "I've lived in Piru all my 
life. My mother has lived here all her life. I don't know any better reason 
than that to want to stay."

THE COLOR OF OJAI; RELATIONS: FEW MINORITIES LIVE IN THE RUSTIC VALLEY. MANY 
RESIDENTS SAY THERE IS NO OVERT RACISM THERE, BUT OTHERS DISAGREE.

 William Taylor remembers visiting the Ojai Valley as a young boy, riding 
horses and hiking the hand-carved trails winding deep into Los Padres National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he told himself as a boy growing up in Oxnard, a small patch of 
ground in the wide open valley would be his. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades later, Taylor had scraped up the down payment for an acre of land in 
the Upper Ojai, a long stretch of grassland between Ojai proper and Santa Paula 
where he planned to make his home. 
</P>
<P>
 But within a few years, Taylor said last week from his home in Texas, racist 
neighbors ran him off with threats of physical harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a dream like that, to own your own home and live in a beautiful 
area, and because of some difference in color you get run out," said Taylor, a 
black man. "I'm 50 years old. I don't need neighbors like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor is one of a relatively small number of blacks and other minorities who 
live or have lived in the Ojai area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ojai Valley -- where more than 22,000 people cluster in the rolling 
hills that make up the communities of Oak View, Mira Monte, Ojai and Meiners 
Oaks -- just 84 blacks have taken up residence, according to the 1990 U.S. 
census. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure represents only 0.3% of the Ojai Valley population, while blacks 
account for 2.2% of Ventura County residents. The percentage of blacks is lower 
only in Fillmore and Santa Paula, which both have almost 60% Latino 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low numbers of minorities who live in and around the Ojai Valley, 
many residents say the numbers alone mean little and that there is no overt 
racism in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where people choose to live is up to them," said Jeff McComas, a white man 
and president of the Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce. "I don't feel that we are 
(prejudiced)." 
</P>
<P>
 But some others describe a life of furtive glances, unwelcome stares or 
blatant threats and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Ojai because I have friends there, but that's the only thing I like 
about it," said Adriane Malone, a former Ojai resident who moved last year. 
"The people in general are sort of hateful." 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans are not the only ones staying out of the Ojai Valley. Other 
minority groups are similarly under-represented in the four communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Latinos account for 26.5% of the county's residents, but just 
12.3% in the Ojai area. Almost 5% of the county is Asian, but that figure drops 
to 1.3% among the four valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the number of Native Americans living in the Ojai area -- 159 people or 
0.7% of the residents -- surpasses the county average of 0.5%. Meanwhile, 
whites make up 65.9% of Ventura County residents, but more than 85% of Ojai 
Valley residents are white. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Moorpark, a city whose population closely mirrors the Ojai 
area, has attracted almost 400 blacks -- 1.4% of its residents. It also reports 
a population that is 22% Latino and more than 6% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, east Ventura County's two largest cities, also 
have attracted four to five times the number of blacks per capita than the Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime Ventura County resident said the Ojai area historically has 
harbored an Old West mentality that tends to exclude nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of people from the Midwest and they bring that type of 
attitude with them," said Al Duff, an Oxnard planning commissioner who is black 
and has lived in the county almost 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the communities up there are very close-knit and you see that 
(racist) type of thing," said Duff, who works as an engineer for Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil industry supervisor Chuck Hawkins of Oak View said people get out of a 
community what they put into it -- regardless of their race. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, they were trying to keep minorities out of Ojai," said 
Hawkins, a black father of three who coaches high school and community soccer 
in Ojai. "But I've been up here since 1985 and I think my kids have had a real 
positive influence on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Hawkins' sons have starred in varsity sports at Nordhoff High School. 
Sixteen-year-old running back Josh Hawkins last semester broke five school 
football records and received top honors from a local service club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to create a positive image as far as being black goes," the senior 
Hawkins said. "We make a point of getting involved in the community, which I 
think helps." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some other blacks living in the Ojai Valley, however, have not been so 
well-received as Hawkins and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a black student at Matilija Junior High School allegedly was 
insulted and threatened by a group of white girls who scrawled epithets across 
her locker and carved a swastika just yards away, Principal James Berube said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berube said the girls were counseled, but that no disciplinary action was 
taken because there was a lack of proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those situations that we had conflicting stories," the principal 
said. "It was difficult for me to substantiate what went on." 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old girl is afraid to return to the campus. She has never gone 
back, choosing instead to enroll in a home-schooling program, said Lonnie 
Stanford, the girl's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the feeling you're not exactly welcome," said Stanford, a retired 
Navy man who only recently moved to the Ojai Valley. "But I don't believe the 
majority of whites in this area feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance last December, police said, a group of white youths 
crashed a party in Ojai, started fights with blacks and threw a beer can 
through a plate-glass window before running off into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child was sleeping in the front room and people were sitting there, but 
thank goodness no one was hurt," said Diane Colby, who hosted the party. "I've 
never been that close to racism in my life, and I was born in South-Central 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, someone returned and slashed the tires on Colby's car. No 
arrests were made in either case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many say blacks and other minorities avoid the Ojai Valley simply because it 
is removed from lively business centers and jobs. But others say there is a 
pattern of exclusion that makes it clear to minorities that they are not 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Adriane Malone, a black woman who moved to Ventura last year, said she was a 
target herself in Ojai while living in a mostly white town. 
</P>
<P>
 While jogging one afternoon she was deliberately run off the road by a group 
of young white men passing in a car, she said. They laughed and flashed a 
swastika at her before driving away, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they only wanted to scare me," Malone said. "They said they belong 
to neo-Nazi (groups). They had guns in their car and a bunch of literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigated. A report was forwarded to the district attorney's office. 
But the case was closed weeks later because it was the driver's word against 
Malone's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect and his passengers explained the veering of the vehicle to be 
accidental," Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald M. Grant wrote on the last page of his 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 A black woman who has lived in the Ojai area for almost two decades said 
racist flyers started appearing in public places shortly after she moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put 'em up all over town," said the woman, a substitute teacher who 
asked not to be named because she fears reprisals. "They were everywhere. The 
Laundromat, the arcade. I thought it was the Ku Klux Klan." 
</P>
<P>
 When a friend of hers was shopping for a house in the valley recently, real 
estate agents eager to sell homes bragged that Ojai-area neighborhoods were 
safe because there were no blacks, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used it as a selling point." 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Ojai Valley Board of Realtors, however, said an agent 
would never make such a comment to a client. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no discrimination," said Virginia Hibberd, a white woman who runs her 
own real estate office. "There's no one in the valley that I know of that 
discriminates against any color whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Mayor Steve Olsen said the low numbers of minority residents contrast 
sharply with the city's permissive reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai is extremely well-represented as far as differing spiritual beliefs," 
the mayor said. "The city has always embraced diversification. But why the race 
numbers don't add up is difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strict limits on development also may have prevented more people -- white, 
black, brown or otherwise -- from moving into Ojai, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't allow new buildings, you're not going to have new people moving 
into the valley," Olsen said. "We've defended our growth-control ordinance so 
we would not have an explosion of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said small pockets of prejudice do exist in the 
Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the number of people of that ilk is no greater than the number of 
blacks," she said. "There are just some people who have very strong feelings 
about people of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say the racism issue is no worse in Ojai than 
anywhere else in Ventura County or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there are going to be individuals who might have that type of 
mentality," said Cmdr. Joe Harwell, who runs the sheriff's substation in Ojai. 
"But I don't get the sense from living and working in the valley that we have a 
KKK mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwell said his deputies have identified a small group of people he considers 
to be active racists. But, the commander added, they are a loose-knit band of 
young white men he considers relatively harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Oak View, we're talking just a handful," Harwell said. "We've seen some 
graffiti which could be construed as being racist, but it's mostly vandalism, 
harassment. I certainly don't think the environment is such that it is keeping 
(minorities) away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Bill Edwards, who oversees a unit that keeps track of gang 
activity in Ventura County, said he has found no evidence of white supremacists 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't doubt there may be those types of people, but we're not tracking any 
organized skinhead gangs," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police may not be tracking racists, but their impact on former Ojai Valley 
resident Karen Parham is undeniable. Parham, a black woman married to a white 
man, said she felt powerless as a minority citizen of the valley -- even as she 
bore almost daily harassment from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are a minority, such as black people are in Ojai, you have no real 
representation," said Parham, who has since moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a group of people used to a particular way of life, and when they 
see us they feel threatened," she said. "They feel like they're losing a grip 
on their control." 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Hatcher III, president of the Ventura County chapter of the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said there is a concerted effort 
to maintain the status quo in the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks that live there are constantly harassed," Hatcher said of the Ojai 
area. "I've had several complaints come out of there, but they're afraid it 
will come back to haunt them, so they live there and don't complain about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Daniels of Orlando, Fla., never complained out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Ojai Valley was more racist than anyplace else he had lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that area, people pretty much feel that blacks are not particularly 
welcome," said Daniels, who recalled that a neighbor told nearby landowners 
that property values soon would slide because he had moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recall an incident at (a market) where they literally ganged up and beat up 
on a young black man who allegedly shoplifted," said Daniels, a corporate 
salesman who lived in the Ojai Valley between 1979 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether he shoplifted or not, the point is they attacked him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels described a climate of suspicion and fear of minorities among whites 
living in the Ojai Valley. Even simple tasks, like shopping or opening a bank 
account, often became awkward situations that pitted himself or his family 
against others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not exactly treated like our neighbors," Daniels remembered. "My 
family was all relieved when we moved." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of living in a mostly white neighborhood is different for 
everyone. The name-calling and racial slurs that routinely greet some residents 
are unheard of by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an advantage because we've lived here for 11 years," said 22-year-old 
Taundra Gross, an Ojai woman whose father is white and mother is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who now works in her father's Ojai medical office, suggested the high 
cost of housing and lack of jobs might contribute to the low numbers of blacks 
living in her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved here in the fourth grade," she said. "I don't remember any stares or 
feeling uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 But El Monte Firefighter Jayd Swendseid, a black man of 22 who also grew up in 
Ojai but now lives elsewhere in Ventura County, said he was verbally assaulted 
just last week on his way home from visiting his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was totally unprovoked," he said of the incident, which he said was only 
the latest in a series of sporadic acts of prejudice he has experienced. "If it 
was something I did, or might have done, then I could understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Swendseid said he thinks most people in the Ojai Valley have lived for so long 
without substantial integration that residents there fear those they do not 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people started seeing more blacks in the city, they'd start getting 
nervous," said Swendseid, a friend and classmate of Gross' as a teen-ager at 
Nordhoff High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of good people in Ojai, but there's a lot of others that have 
the hidden racism you just don't see." Ojai Valley / Racial Breakdown

<P>
 The same year, Vicky Howard spent $104,109 to defeat Simi Valley Councilman 
Bill Davis in one of the costliest races ever for a county supervisor's post. 
Davis doled out $108,153. 
</P>
<P>
 How much a candidate for a countywide race can expect to spend on a campaign 
depends largely on how many people are in the race, whether there's a runoff, 
how long it's been since the last contested election and how aggressive a 
candidate wants to be, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, candidates competing in hotly contested countywide races this 
year are more likely to need upward of $100,000 to mount a serious campaign, 
said Bruce Bradley, the county's chief election official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there are anymore Maria VanderKolks out there," Bradley said. 
"I don't think you can do that for a countywide office anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said candidates should keep in mind that they are also competing for 
campaign funds. He noted that a county supervisor's position is a nonpartisan 
one, which means a candidate cannot depend on his or her political party for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the filing fee to run for a county office is between $600 and $1,200, 
depending on the office. A candidate's ballot statement, which is optional, 
runs about $3,000. And lists of registered and absentee voters can run from 
several hundred dollars to several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest campaign expense is reaching voters through mass mailings as 
well as radio, television and newspaper ads. Bradley said by far the most 
popular and costly way of reaching voters is through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the cost of sending out one campaign mailer in the 2nd 
Supervisorial District, where there are 72,000 registered voters, can be as 
much as $20,000. To reach all 345,000 registered voters in the county would 
cost about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's just postage," Bradley said. "That's not counting printing, signs 
or other advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
 Races expected to be among the more expensive this year are the 2nd and 4th 
districts' supervisorial races and the county auditor-controller's race, which 
has not been contested in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo and taxpayer advocate H. 
Jere Robings have formally declared their candidacy for the 2nd District now 
held by VanderKolk, who will not seek reelection. Her district represents the 
Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, former state Assembly 
candidate Alan Guggenheim, county Corrections Officer David Goodman and Oak 
Park resident Alan H. Knapp have all taken out nomination papers and are 
considering entering the race. Also, two Conejo Valley residents have launched 
a campaign to draft former Ventura County Supervisor Ed Jones as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Should one or two others decide to compete in the June 7 election, it would 
probably force a runoff in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a candidate in the 2nd District, I would be budgeting for two 
races," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings, who recently loaned his campaign $10,000 of his own money, agreed 
that it could get expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will cost about $50,000" to campaign for the June election, 
Robings said, "and probably $100,000 if there is a runoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said it is too early to estimate how much he will need to raise, but 
added that he is confident he could collect $100,000 if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer, who spent $46,463 in 1990 against VanderKolk, declined comment on 
her campaign strategy, except to say "money's important, but it's not 
everything." She said she will probably have a statement in the next week or 
two regarding her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Guggenheim said he expects to spend about $100,000 if he enters the race. The 
Newbury Park resident spent about $120,000, including $40,000 of his own money, 
in his unsuccessful bid for state Assembly in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is expensive these days," he said. "But if you want to get your 
message out and you want people to know who you are and vote intelligently, 
then you have to spend the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guggenheim, an international business consultant, said he would be willing to 
loan money to his own supervisorial campaign but would not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like doing that," he said. "But then people don't like special 
interest groups to contribute to you either. It's a Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
 How costly the race for the 4th District supervisorial post, which covers the 
areas in and around Simi Valley and Moorpark, will also depend on the number of 
candidates and whether there's a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Simi Valley Councilwoman Barbara Williamson has formally 
announced that she will challenge incumbent Vicky Howard. But Moorpark City 
Councilman Scott Montgomery is also considering joining the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said she believes Montgomery will enter the race and has already 
factored his candidacy into her campaign budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've set a ballpark figure of between $80,000 and $100,000 from January to 
November," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the cost of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Williamson said, she has raised more than $7,000, "but money is coming 
in every day." She said she has already spent $780 on signs and plans to 
distribute at least four mailers in Simi Valley and across the district at an 
estimated cost of about $7,000 a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who has $18,000 in her campaign war chest, declined to comment on her 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making any statement on my campaign until the earthquake emergency is 
over," said Howard, who loaned her campaign about $30,000 in personal funds 
during the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor-controller's race is expected to be another expensive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the candidates are appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, Simi 
Valley Mayor Greg Stratton and Ventura accountant Scott Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton has said he is prepared to raise as much as $100,000 to run for the 
office, and Mahon said he will match that if necessary. Weiss has declined to 
comment on how much he would be able to raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides facing a possible runoff, Stratton and Mahon said the reason the 
controller's race could be so costly is that the seat has not been contested 
since 1974. Not to mention, they said, that there are about 345,000 registered 
voters in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't even know what the controller does," said Stratton, who 
had collected $1,600 in contributions as of Dec. 31. He has, however, another 
$2,256 left over from his mayoral campaign that could be used in the 
controller's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon reported $4,000 in contributions by the end of the year. Weiss did not 
file a financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to speculate on how much I can raise," Weiss said. "But my 
campaign and fund-raising efforts will depend largely on individuals and not 
special interest groups." 
</P>
<P>
 A county ordinance drafted by VanderKolk and approved by the Board of 
Supervisors in 1991 will limit the amount of money that candidates for county 
offices can receive from individuals and special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance prohibits candidates from receiving more than $1,000 from an 
individual or business over a four-year election period and $2,400 from a 
political committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The total limit is split between the primary and general elections. Candidates 
can receive up to $750 from individuals and businesses for a primary election 
and $250 for a general election, and up to $1,800 from a committee for a 
primary election and $600 for a general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the five county supervisors, the measure also applies to other 
elected county offices. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she drafted the county law because she believed "special 
interest groups should not heavily influence who is in office." She said she 
wished that the measure could have gone further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think to spend $100,000 on a supervisor's race is ridiculous, but 
unfortunately when you have a lot of candidates in a race and there are a lot 
of brochures going back and forth that's going to happen," VanderKolk said. "I 
would just ask the voters to be aware of what's going on."

NEW METROLINK TRAIN STATION TO OPEN IN CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of wrangling over cost and a last-minute flurry of construction, 
the first Metrolink train station west of the Conejo Grade is scheduled to open 
Monday in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Envisioned as an emergency post-quake measure to help ease congestion on 
commuter-clogged freeways, the station will operate two round-trip trains to 
Los Angeles daily for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said she is optimistic that the 
station will lure commuters off the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry it took an earthquake to make this happen," Craven said. "But I 
think people are really excited about taking the train." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo stop will add 11 miles to the 47-mile Ventura County Line, which 
will go through Moorpark and Simi Valley before heading into Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 County and city officials are expected to mark the opening of the newly 
constructed station with a brief celebration before the first train departs at 
5:44 a.m. The bare-bones station will consist of a 240-space paved parking lot, 
700-foot platform and wheelchair access ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena dropped in at the construction 
site Friday to survey the station and praise local officials for making it 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are all doing a great job," he told officials. "This station is going to 
make it easier for people to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency paid for construction of the $195,000 
station, which was built by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and C. A. 
Rasmussen contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County transit officials have applied for additional FEMA funds to 
cover 75% of the anticipated $1.9-million cost of operating the station for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the application is approved, the state's Office of Emergency Services will 
pick up 18.75% of the cost and the county 6.25%. Government officials have 
assured the county that the funding application is well on its way to being 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo is expected to pay about $10,000 to maintain the station 
during its yearlong emergency operation. The costs for the station were 
determined after two weeks of negotiations between the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission and Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has agreed to pick up the bill for the entire cost of running 
the station if federal and state subsidies fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's funding request to FEMA is part of a larger application being 
submitted by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to pay for emergency 
transit services. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, average daily Metrolink ridership has surged from 
8,100 to 19,000 throughout its four-county region. Ridership on the Ventura 
County Line has jumped from an average of 1,000 to 3,000 passengers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demand, Metrolink has added three emergency stations in the 
Antelope Valley and one at the Sylmar-San Fernando city line, bringing the 
total number of stations to 27. Another station is scheduled to open Monday in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to encourage commuters to continue riding the train, Metrolink is 
accepting February passes through the end of March. Camarillo commuters have 
until Tuesday to buy a February pass, which costs $176. 
</P>
<P>
 To further entice riders, Metrolink Executive Director Richard Stanger said he 
is planning to ask Amtrak to stop at the Camarillo station. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak's San Diegan line, which runs from Santa Barbara to San Diego, stops in 
Ventura, Oxnard, Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an added convenience for everyone," Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak spokesman Bob Kollmar said the national rail line had not received a 
formal request to stop in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are asked to stop in Camarillo, we will consider it seriously," he 
said. "We consider all possible stops seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, County Supervisor John K. Flynn on Friday received preliminary 
approval from federal officials to include Oxnard in the earthquake disaster 
zone, making it eligible for FEMA funding that would allow Metrolink service to 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Running Metrolink to Oxnard may cost less than the Camarillo extension because 
the commuter trains would stop at the existing transit terminal at 200 E. 4th 
St., Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission will hold a meeting this week to 
decide whether to apply for funding for the project, Flynn said. Camarillo

<P>
 Metrolink trains are scheduled to depart from the Camarillo station beginning 
Monday.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Access: Trains are wheelchair accessible. 
</P>

FREE CLINICS INVALUABLE TO NEEDY PATIENTS; HEALTH: FACILITIES IN THOUSAND OAKS 
AND SIMI VALLEY ASSIST THOSE WHO CAN'T GET HELP ELSEWHERE. DOCTORS, NURSES AND 
ATTORNEYS VOLUNTEER TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in the packed waiting room, three pajama-clad children playing at her 
feet, Thousand Oaks resident Donna Luft stared incredulously at the young 
mother cuddling an infant on a nearby chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean it's $5 for an immunization? You pay $5 and you can see a doctor?" 
Luft asked in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tiny Conejo Free Clinic, the answer to both questions is an emphatic 
"of course." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two decades, free clinics in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley have 
provided inexpensive services to residents who fall in an awkward middle ground 
-- not poor enough to qualify for Medi-Cal, not wealthy enough to purchase 
private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer physicians stop by after work to help out single moms suffering from 
burning migraines, unemployed men struggling with depression, red-faced babies 
bawling through infected gums. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer attorneys hold regular bankruptcy and divorce classes to counsel 
residents worried about failing businesses or messy marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 And volunteer nurses offer podiatry care for senior citizens, clipping the 
toenails of those too frail or arthritic to bend down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid $121 for my son to get his shots before school started," said Luft, a 
day-care provider who came to the clinic for a tuberculosis test and was 
astounded to discover the range of services. "I'll never do that again." 
</P>
<P>
 As Luft found out during her tuberculosis test one recent evening, patients 
need not fill out claim forms or present insurance. Instead, they simply pay a 
donation if they can -- $5 per visit at the Conejo Free Clinic in Thousand Oaks 
and $10 at the Free Clinic of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That donation covers everything from checkups to gynecological exams to blood 
tests. Often, the doctors throw in enough free medicine to last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Such service seems almost miraculous to patients like Steve Smith, a 
self-employed Thousand Oaks construction worker raising two children on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit hard by the slumping economy, Smith dropped his own health insurance years 
ago, though he still tries to scrape up enough money to cover his children, at 
a cost of $196 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been to the doctor in 30 years," Smith said as he sat on a plastic 
seat in the Conejo Free Clinic waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But a suspiciously lumpy gland scared him so much that he headed to the free 
clinic for a checkup last week. "This is great when you're down on your luck," 
he said. "I can't imagine what you would do without a place like this. Where 
would you go?" 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the early 1970s, the free clinics in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley 
until recently offered the only low-priced medical care in eastern Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started when there was an economic downturn, a major epidemic of sexually 
transmitted diseases, and many people returning from Vietnam," said Sharron 
Baird, who helped establish the Conejo Free Clinic nearly 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured we would fill a need and that would be it. Well, we're still here 
-- and now look, we're in a recession, we have a health care crisis again," 
Baird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Free clinics in Ventura and Oxnard folded years ago, in part because the 
county began boosting its services to Medi-Cal patients and indigent residents 
on the western side of the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley free clinics continued to thrive, 
drumming up enough volunteers and equipment donations to serve thousands of 
patients a year on annual budgets of less than $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the free clinics are located in two of the county's wealthiest 
communities, they never stand idle. Waiting lists for appointments can be weeks 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our phones are just choked with calls," said Diane Pettifor, a part-time 
receptionist at the Conejo Free Clinic. "The need will always be there because 
the working poor will always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 To help meet some of that need, the county government this month opened a 
public clinic in Simi Valley to serve Medi-Cal patients, and a similar center 
is under construction in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both county facilities will offer more comprehensive services than the free 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Chris Landon, who will direct the county's Thousand Oaks clinic, said he 
aims to provide a "bilingual, bicultural facility" that will supplement the 
Conejo Free Clinic. Because his clinic will focus on Medi-Cal patients, Landon 
said he expects to serve "a different segment of the population." 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the free clinics agreed. Despite the new competition from county 
facilities, they said, the free clinics will always attract patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're as much a mainstream provider as anyone else, and we have our own 
niche," said Fred Bauermeister, director of the Free Clinic of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Recounting the case of one young man who refused to go to the county medical 
center despite severe injuries from a car accident, Bauermeister said many 
patients seem to prefer the atmosphere at free clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very personal, very small, and you're not sitting in some huge waiting 
room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But free clinic care does have drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the physicians rotate through, each volunteering no more than one 
night a month, patients rarely see the same doctor twice. And their 
consultations are usually brief, 15 to 20 minutes, as the physicians try to 
cram up to a dozen patients into a three-hour stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, for example, Dr. Paul Reisser had to diagnose and treat three 
middle-aged men suffering from depression in the space of an hour. "You're 
always in a time crunch," he said. "To attempt to really figure out what's 
wrong and make an intelligent stab at solving the problem while getting people 
in and out quickly is very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic works best, he said, in a trouble-shooting mode. Physicians can 
quickly treat ear infections and provide inexpensive birth-control pills. But 
they cannot spend hours counseling a rape victim or performing extensive tests 
on a newly diagnosed diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The same principles hold true for the legal clinics. Attorneys help solve 
simple landlord-tenant disputes and advise on routine bankruptcy and divorce 
proceedings. But they do not have time to fill out paperwork, and they never 
represent free clinic clients in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the occasional wacky cases that are too off-the-wall to deal 
with -- like the homeless man who wanted an attorney to help him sue the 
government for allegedly bombarding him with radioactive waves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And there are times when wealthy residents come in trying to snag some free 
advice. While the volunteers are instructed never to turn anyone away, they do 
suggest that affluent-looking clients try a private attorney or physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the limitations of free clinic care, the volunteers said they receive 
tremendous satisfaction from helping those who have slipped through the 
government's safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the legal system, if you are a criminal defendant with no money, the court 
will appoint you a lawyer," volunteer David Shain explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it's any kind of a civil problem, there are no resources. And frankly, 
most middle-class people are not in a position to hire an attorney," added 
Shain, who charges $175 an hour at his private law practice in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the unemployed construction worker, knows first-hand the value of free 
clinics. "I'd pay more if I could," he said. "But I just can't."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO WEIGH CURBS ON SPEAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to limit speeches by City Hall gadflies, the Oxnard City Council 
on Tuesday will consider restricting how often residents can address the 
council and what subjects they can discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposed revision of city rules, speakers would be prevented from 
discussing matters that are outside the jurisdiction of the council, 
redevelopment agency or housing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes would also prevent speakers who address the council 
during the afternoon public comment period from speaking during the evening 
period. However, the proposal would increase the time allotted to speakers from 
two minutes to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez criticized the proposed restrictions on Friday, 
saying he will oppose the measure without significant alterations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do anything to limit the public's opportunity for meaningful 
input," he said. "In every council there's always the feeling that people talk 
about things that are not the proper business of the council -- like (the North 
American Free Trade Agreement). But that doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the council tried two years ago to restrict public comment at its 
meetings but backed off because of a tide of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal follows a raucous hearing two weeks ago over the city's attempt 
to consolidate the Police and Fire departments. On Tuesday, Councilman Bedford 
Pinkard criticized Lopez for not exercising more control over the 
sometimes-unruly audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez said it would have been a mistake to try to control that night's 
crowd, which vociferously opposed the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would have been gained to stop the meeting and kick out a half-dozen 
people?" Lopez asked. "What's that going to tell the public? That we don't want 
your participation?" PATRICK McCARTNEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO BE DEEDED LAND 
</P>

 Ventura County's chapter of Habitat for Humanity will build its first home for 
a low-income family on Beall Street in central Thousand Oaks as the City 
Council has agreed to deed a vacant lot to the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite objections from a half-dozen Beall Street residents, the council voted 
to sell the city-owned lot to the Thousand Oaks Redevelopment Agency for about 
$75,000.The Redevelopment Agency, which by law must devote one-fifth of its 
funds to affordable housing, will then turn around and deed the parcel to 
Habitat for Humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other Habitat for Humanity projects nationwide, the Beall Street home 
will be built, in part, by the future owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-income family chosen to move in will be asked to contribute 500 hours 
of "sweat equity" to help construct the home. The family will also make monthly 
payments to Habitat for Humanity to cover the cost of building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the home remains occupied by a low-income family -- with annual 
income of less than $44,000 -- the Redevelopment Agency has set out a strict 
set of conditions. If Habitat for Humanity violates any term of the agreement, 
the nonprofit group will be asked to pay the Redevelopment Agency for the Beall 
Street parcel, according to Olav Hassel, the city's housing services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah cast the only vote against the deal. As chairwoman of the 
housing issues committee, she originally recommended that the council approve 
the arrangement. But she changed her mind after Beall Street residents 
complained that their neighborhood had no room for another house. STEPHANIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK; APPLICANTS SOUGHT FOR CONSERVANCY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark is seeking a resident interested in becoming the city's appointee to 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, who has represented the city on the committee 
since 1990, announced last month that he was stepping down to give another 
council member the chance to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 But no council member agreed to take Montgomery's place, prompting the search 
for public applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he was surprised at the lack of interest among the city's 
elected officials and feared the city would lose clout on the committee by 
sending a member of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will diminish Moorpark's presence," he said. "I'm kind of disappointed 
that one of the other four council members didn't step up to the plate. I've 
been doing it for four years, done a lot of work, attended a lot of meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason said the city should be able to retain a strong voice on 
the advisory group if it finds the right appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, you would think an elected official would have more 
influence," Lawrason said. "I would beg to differ if the right person is 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy is a state agency established to acquire parkland and trails 
for public recreational use and preservation. The advisory committee meets on 
the first and third Mondays of the month at 7:30 p.m. at various locations 
throughout Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for the unpaid position will be accepted through March 8, and the 
City Council is expected to make its appointment by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the city clerk's office at 529-6864. JAMES MAIELLA

READY TO RIDE OUT THE BIG ONE; ONE ARCHITECT SINGS THE PRAISES OF SPRINGS FOR 
QUAKE PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody bounced back from the Northridge earthquake faster than David Ming-Li 
Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's because he has springs under his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen truck-size coils hold up his Westside home. And Lowe credits them 
with cushioning it from the shaking that destroyed some nearby dwellings and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been an 6.8 quake to everyone else, he says. "But it felt like a 5 
in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe, a 61-year-old architect and professor at Los Angeles City College, 
installed the springs when he built his three-level home two years ago. Then he 
settled back and waited to test it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I'm probably one of the few people who was looking forward to an 
earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first true earthquake-resistive house in the United States. It 
floats -- there's no direct contact with its foundation. I'm looking to survive 
an 8.5 earthquake here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe was asleep on the third floor when the Jan. 17 quake hit. He says he felt 
none of the violent shaking that tossed virtually everyone else in Los Angeles 
out of bed. "It was a very gentle rocking. I turned my fluorescent lantern on 
and was outside checking everything when the shaking stopped. Everything worked 
beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe had concocted a do-it-yourself gauge to measure his springs' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He placed rows of different-size decorative glass bricks between the concrete 
foundation and the bottom of the house, figuring he could tell how much the 
structure moved by seeing which bricks got crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattered glass showed that the springs absorbed three-quarters of an inch of 
movement -- mostly along the north side of the steel-framed, $800,000 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 While few of his Purdue Avenue neighbors may have noticed the spring system 
being installed when Lowe constructed his 4,500-square-foot house and a 
companion structure, plenty of other people did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen curious Los Angeles building inspectors trooped through to 
examine the "isolation bases," as Lowe calls them. After the house was 
finished, it became a popular attraction for structural engineers. Eventually, 
the U.S. Geological Survey asked to place quake-monitoring accelerometers in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is base isolators are probably a good idea," said Jim Kaprielian, 
manager of the city's West Los Angeles building and safety office and one of 
those who watched them being bolted in place. "Some day major structures will 
have them as almost a requirement. But most conventional wood-frame buildings 
performed well in this earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Halling, a Caltech graduate student who is a member of the Earthquake 
Engineering Research Institute, agreed. He inspected Lowe's house last week as 
part of the institute's post-earthquake survey of base-isolated structures, 
including the Los Angeles County Fire Command facility on the Eastside and a 
Rockwell Corp. building in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a neat idea. But I think a well-built wood-frame house will 
perform well without them," Halling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if the springs are not properly engineered, they could amplify motions. 
An amateur house-builder could actually cause additional damage with them." 
</P>
<P>
 USGS scientists say Lowe's springs may have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Their accelerometer readings suggest there was more shaking inside Lowe's 
house than outside. Ground movement velocity beneath the house -- measured in 
terms of the force of gravity -- was 0.44g, according to the USGS. But readings 
of 0.5g and 0.63g were recorded on the first and third floors, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds to me like it didn't work," said Ron Porcella, a geophysicist with 
the USGS National Strong Motion Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers with German-based Gerb Vibration Control Systems, Inc., dispute 
that, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their company supplied Lowe with each of the $1,500 springs -- which normally 
are used for industrial projects such as nuclear reactors. They say the coils 
worked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher interior G-force readings were probably caused by the house 
bouncing onto the glass bricks, according to company President Guenter K. 
Hueffmann -- who is coming to Los Angeles on Feb. 27 to inspect the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system obviously did not have enough space to move," Hueffmann said. Even 
so, the springs probably prevented movement from peaking at a destructive 
velocity of more than 1g on the third floor, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe plans to remove the glass bricks before the Big One strikes. In the 
meantime, he said he has devised a way to retrofit older houses with springs 
and shock absorbers that can limit both vertical and horizontal shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody should thump the idea of springs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his house, they produced only good vibrations.

GUIDE TO HELPING STUDENTS AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When classes resume at Cal State Northridge on Monday and with more than 
10,000 of its 23,000 students expected to descend on the quake-damaged campus 
the first day, they may need plenty of help in adjusting to their changed 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Information stations will be set up at 22 entrances to the campus. Each will 
be staffed by two people, who will provide class schedules, maps of the new 
campus configuration and other essential information. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailers -- or modulars as campus officials call them -- have been set up in 
parking lots and other open areas. No classes have been canceled, although some 
have been moved to 25 off-campus sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A new parking lot is being created west of the University Tower Apartments on 
Lassen Street, although it will not be open during the first week of classes. 
Most student services will be available at their usual locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus radio station KCSN-FM (88.5) will broadcast updates at 12:30 p.m. and 
4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, CSUN spokeswoman Kaine Thompson answers some questions to help make the 
first week of classes a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where do I park? 
</P>
<P>
 Not an easy answer. Portions of several parking lots will be used for the 
temporary classrooms, and 2,400 spots were lost when the parking structure 
collapsed. That leaves about 3,000 of the 8,500 spaces that were available 
pre-quake -- although university officials have added 2,000 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty and staff should park in lots B, E, G and J. Students should park in 
lots A, B, O and P. No parking permits will be required for any lots until Feb. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, university officials said Saturday they will have 1,500 spaces 
graded on the north campus area by Monday, with free shuttle service to the 
campus available. Another 500 spaces will be available Monday off campus at the 
site of a defunct handyman's store, just west of the Northridge Fashion Center 
at Corbin Avenue and Plummer Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional parking is being developed, and updates on the parking situation 
will be available daily at any of the 22 information stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What if I did not register by mail? Where do I register? 
</P>
<P>
 Students can still register by phone by calling (800) 200-4340. In person they 
can go to the Student Center for Success on the first floor of the University 
Student Union. The Student Center for Success is serving as a one-stop center 
for many administrative functions. 
</P>
<P>
 *How will I know where my classes are? 
</P>
<P>
 Information will be available at each of the 22 information stations. There 
also will be large signs at every modular cluster, providing directions. No 
classes have been canceled, but some have been moved off campus. Several 
disciplines have added general education classes about natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What about science labs? 
</P>
<P>
 Specialized classes such as those involving science labs, music recital halls 
and engineering equipment have been moved to other campuses, including Pierce 
College, Valley College, Mission College, Glendale College, Cal Lutheran and 
UCLA. Classes will also be held at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, as well as 
several public schools. Check the schedule of classes for the location. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do I do if I want to drop or add a class? 
</P>
<P>
 Classes can be added or dropped during the first two weeks of the semester at 
the Student Center for Success on the first floor of the University Student 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What if I have a question about my financial aid? 
</P>
<P>
 Students receiving financial aid should have been notified by mail where they 
can pick up their checks. Students who have not received a notice or who have 
other questions should go to the Student Center for Success. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is the bookstore open? 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador Bookstore is open and should have all books needed for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the library closed, where can I go to study? 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN is trying to get library privileges at several nearby colleges for its 
students. UCLA has extended library privileges to CSUN students, and an hourly 
shuttle will be available between CSUN and the UCLA library. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Student Union open? Where can I get something to eat? 
</P>
<P>
 The University Student Union will be open, except the theater. All food 
services areas are open, except for The Roof atop Sierra South and Mixed Media, 
in the Fine Arts Building. The Satellite Student Union at the University Park 
Apartments will also be open. The University Student Union will serve as the 
primary information center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the trailers are going to be on some of the fields, what will happen to the 
intramural programs? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the new facilities are expected to affect any of the intramural 
programs, nor any of the intercollegiate practices or games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be a Daily Sundial newspaper? 
</P>
<P>
 The Sundial has set up temporary quarters on campus and will be published 
under its normal schedule. A 32-page special edition was mailed to students and 
staff the second week of February. The first issue of the spring semester will 
be available Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will the student health center be open? 
</P>
<P>
 The student health center will be open and fully operational. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My dorm room was in one of the structures that has been closed. What do I do? 
</P>
<P>
 Every student who signed a contract for housing will be accommodated. Some 
students began moving into their dorms Thursday, and the last of the dorms is 
expected to be ready by this Thursday.

CITIZENS PATROL HELPS CATCH SUSPECTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a citizens patrol group in Oxnard, two robbery suspects were 
arrested on suspicion of taking a man's wallet at knifepoint, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northridge man was sitting in his car behind a bookstore on east Vineyard 
Avenue when two men accosted him about 11 p.m. Friday, Oxnard police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men put a razor blade-type knife to the man's throat, while the 
other grabbed him by the head and demanded his money, police said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the victim gave up his wallet, the two men pulled him out of the car 
and one of them struck the Northridge man twice in the face before they fled, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When members of the Sierra Linda Neighborhood Watch saw the suspects speed 
away, they called the Oxnard Police Department with a description of the 
suspects and the vehicle's license plate number, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer George Tamayo spotted the vehicle at C street and Gonzales Road and 
arrested Rene Paul Francisco, 23, and Jose Alberto Moreno, 18, both of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police praised the local Neighborhood Watch group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them, we wouldn't have been able to do it," Cmdr. Joe Munoz said. "I 
think it's a fine example of citizens helping police, being the eyes and ears 
of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 James Witcher, chairman of the Sierra Linda Neighborhood Council, said he was 
pleased that the watch group, which was formed in June, helped the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel very good to know we were involved in apprehending a 
criminal," Witcher said. "We don't want them here." TRACY WILSON

<P>
 A possible leak in a 150-gallon chlorine tank at a water department pumping 
station led to the evacuation of four homes in Camarillo late Saturday 
afternoon, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department sent a hazardous material team to the site at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was directed around the pumping house at Los Posas Road and Ponderosa 
Drive until about 7 p.m., when the hazardous materials team was able to shut 
off the valve, a Ventura County Sheriff's Department spokesman said.

2 AREA MUSICAL GROUPS DRAW TOP ENDOWMENT AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony Orchestra and Oakleaf Music Festival emerged as this 
year's big winners in Thousand Oaks' annual distribution of endowment funding 
for community events. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest from the endowment, plus a small city contribution, generated $50,000 
this year to fund special events.The City Council voted to divide most of the 
cash among 11 groups and set aside $14,000 for emergencies later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both musical groups received large sums with the understanding that their 
annual appropriations will dwindle over the next three years as the Civic Arts 
Plaza takes over much of the city's cultural programming, Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming year, however, the symphony received $18,000 to stage a 
concert featuring violinist Sidney Weiss, concertmaster of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Orchestra and his wife, pianist Jeanne Weiss. That concert was 
scheduled to take place Saturday night in the Cal Lutheran University gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted," said Everett Ascher of the Conejo Symphony. Noting that the 
award covers the cost of one concert, Ascher added: "There's no way you can be 
cost-efficient by playing Beethoven twice as fast with half as many musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakleaf Festival received $12,000 this year. Other awards include $1,000 
each for the Thousand Oaks Hockey Club, which is sponsoring a cultural exchange 
program with Canada; the Westlake High School Songleaders, for participation in 
a national dance team championship, and the Conejo Recreation and Park 
District, for a Memorial Day open-air concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups receiving $500 each were: the Los Robles Master Chorale, the Thousand 
Oaks High School Boys Volleyball Booster Club, the Newbury Park Bobby Sox, the 
Boy Scouts of America's Ventura County Council, the Conejo Valley Historical 
Society and the Conejo Valley Botanic Garden. STEPHANIE SIMON

 After refinancing their Maywood home and taking the money that Hector Gonzalez 
received from a company buyout, the family independently produced Lava and the 
Hot Rocks' first commercial album last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Their gamble may have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with being denied by several record labels, Hector, 40, his wife, 
Miroslava (Lava), 38, and their son, Alex, 18, changed the band's eclectic 
style to alternative adult contemporary. And with their first, 
soon-to-be-released album, "You Damn Mexicans Are Too Loud," the band has found 
its niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard to get into the Mexican market because they don't consider us 
Latin. Even being of Mexican American heritage, we weren't recognized because 
we aren't immigrants," Hector Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band began its tumultuous journey through the Los Angeles music scene 13 
years ago after Hector Gonzalez's barber introduced him to an attorney who 
recommended their demo album to former concert promoter Jerry Rissmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musically they knocked me out," said Rissmiller, who agreed to become their 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said their blend of Latin elements and big-band sound leads to a bluesy 
jazz beat that is commercial and unique in a world where it is "very difficult 
to get airplay on any radio station, regardless of ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hector on bass, Alex on drums and Lava on vocals, the group also features 
Mel Steinberg, 44, on saxophone, Alfred Ortiz, 23, on percussion and Karl 
Carrasco, 41, on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The family writes songs by improvisation. Hector Gonzalez said he comes up 
with a rhythm and runs it by his son, who adds his ideas. Then they tape the 
piece and give it to Lava Gonzalez to write the melody and the lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzales describes themes for the band's songs as "home-grown." Lava 
Gonzalez said the bluesy songs she sings offer a unique way to discuss life: 
tales of love, war, pain and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of their songs are inspired by her heritage -- she was born in Chinipas, 
Mexico, and moved to the United States when she was 1 -- and by the family's 
attempts to make it to the big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzalez, who won an Emmy Award as a sound engineer for his work on the 
1984 Olympic Games coverage, said his connections at ABC and CBS allowed the 
band to make money while it looked for its niche. Those contacts and some 
late-night club gigs gave the band exposure during an Academy Award wrap party 
and other industry get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 Networking also provided the Gonzalezes with an invitation to be the house 
band for the new PBS show "Somos Latinos," which will be produced by Robert 
Andrade and Associates and may begin taping as early as May. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade, who produces and directs KCET-TV Channel 28's "Life and Times," said 
Lava and the Hot Rocks has much to offer the music industry because of the 
"broad spectrum of their musical abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a busy summer schedule, starting in June with the Troubadours of 
Folk festival at UCLA. As part of the festival, the band will travel with 35 
other acts to Scandinavia and the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 And in August, Lava and the Hot Rocks will join five other groups on a 
three-month, 30-city tour.

 A man wearing a white hard hat robbed the Bank of America on the 2600 block of 
Main Street on Saturday morning, a Ventura Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man gave a note to the teller that read "100 bills," the spokesman 
said.After being handed the money, the suspect ran out through a back door and 
down an alley, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a small explosive charge filled with red dye in the packet of money 
that the teller handed the robber. When the suspect was about 100 feet from the 
bank, the charge exploded, coating him with a red dye that cannot be washed 
off, the spokesman said.  
</P>

 Police said the man was last seen getting into a small blue pickup truck. The 
robbery is under investigation. SCOTT HADLY

ASBESTOS CONTAMINATION ADDS TO RISKS AND COSTS OF CLEANUP; DAMAGE: BUSINESS IS 
BOOMING FOR REMOVAL FIRMS. SOME HOMEOWNERS DO IT THEMSELVES OR IGNORE PROBLEM.

 As president of an environmental testing firm, Michael Uziel usually deals 
with the toxic worries of others. But he's had serious ones of his own since 
last month's earthquake battered his Northridge home -- cracking the 
cottage-cheese-like ceiling and scattering asbestos dust over furnishings and 
carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's devastating. . . . I have to throw (away) almost all my belongings," 
said Uziel, 50, who evacuated his house and may not have enough insurance to 
cover both the structural repairs and asbestos cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolted by an asbestos aftershock, hundreds of building owners and occupants 
are scrambling to deal with the risk of contamination from asbestos, a leading 
environmental cause of lung cancer, along with extra cleanup costs and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its widespread use in building materials, asbestos "is always an 
issue of concern whenever there's an event that damages structures," said 
Kathleen Shimman, regional director of the office of health and emergency 
planning for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When earthquakes or 
hurricanes knock buildings around, asbestos "can be shredded and broken and . . 
. the fibers of asbestos can be inhaled." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one form or another, asbestos is present in more than half of all buildings 
that are at least 15 years old, authorities say. Although many uses of asbestos 
have been banned, some continued into the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials and asbestos consultants have been flooded with calls from 
those who are concerned about the problem. But officials said many building 
owners and occupants probably are unaware of quake-related damage to asbestos 
materials.  
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners who are unwilling or unable to hire licensed asbestos 
contractors are cleaning up asbestos debris themselves -- with or without 
proper equipment and dust prevention methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, business is booming for the asbestos abatement industry in the wake 
of the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in this industry -- consultant and contractor included -- have been 
taxed and maximized to the extent of capacity and beyond to cover all . . . 
work that's going on," said Thomas A. Jordan, vice president of Gale/Jordan 
Associates, an environmental consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In a number of large office buildings in the quake area, asbestos fireproofing 
on steel beams dropped through dislodged ceiling tiles to settle on floors and 
desks, Jordan said. In several offices where his firm ran air tests, he said, 
the spills temporarily created significant airborne levels of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake and its aftershocks also triggered asbestos spills at about 100 
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Richard F. Henry, the 
district's asbestos technical supervisor, said that in preparing the schools 
for the return of students and staff, cleanup crews had to remove fallen 
asbestos soundproofing and pipe wrap and broken asbestos floor tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, the problem has defied a quick fix. In the theater area at El 
Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, asbestos debris from broken 
acoustical material is so extensive that the area has been temporarily sealed, 
Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, pulverized asbestos littered so much of the 
engineering building that officials were forced to order a massive cleanup 
before they could get in to assess quake damage, said Bill Chatham, CSUN 
associate vice president for facilities and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with the cleanup nearly complete after 10 days of wiping and vacuuming, 
a big aftershock Jan. 29, created a second asbestos blizzard.  
</P>
<P>
 Many problems in homes and apartments have involved "cottage-cheese" or 
"popcorn" ceilings -- some of which contain at least a small percentage of 
asbestos, experts said. In some cases, the earthquake cracked or shattered 
these ceilings, dusting carpets and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos is safe when intact. But when asbestos materials are pulverized or 
broken, they can release microscopic fibers that float like water vapor and are 
dangerous to inhale. 
</P>
<P>
 Long considered a leading environmental cause of lung cancer, asbestos also 
has been linked to mesothelioma, a rare and nearly always fatal cancer that may 
appear up to 40 years after initial exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Low levels of asbestos are always present in the air, due to construction and 
demolition work and erosion from automobile brake linings and clutches. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast bulk of asbestos disease has afflicted heavily exposed workers who 
labored for years in dusty conditions with minimal protection. But asbestos 
illness occasionally is reported in people thought to have been minimally 
exposed, prompting many experts to say no level is safe to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulations designed to prevent creation of asbestos dust have also fallen 
victim to the need to clear quake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 In normal times, the federal Clean Air Act and South Coast Air Quality 
Management District rules require precautions to keep asbestos from becoming 
airborne during building repairs or demolition -- including removal and 
disposal of asbestos before building work occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But many quake-damaged buildings are too unstable for asbestos crews to enter 
-- and thus are being cleared with the minimal safeguard of keeping the rubble 
wet to reduce dust. This also means that rubble containing at least small 
amounts of asbestos is going to area landfills normally not allowed to accept 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Air district spokesman Bill Kelly said: "You have to make a trade-off between 
the problem of asbestos and the imminent public safety concern from these 
unstable structures. . . . So we're looking at providing these minimum 
standards for health protection of wetting and wrapping and then landfilling 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike commercial and apartment building owners, homeowners even in normal 
times are exempt from requirements that asbestos removal be done only by 
licensed abatement contractors. Some owners of quake-damaged homes are doing 
asbestos cleanup and removal themselves -- although most experts caution 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials are responding to questions from 
homeowners on simple asbestos cleanups. "Usually people lack the funds to (hire 
a contractor) so we would tell them how to get literature to properly clean up 
asbestos," said Don Thompson, an industrial hygienist with the county's 
health/hazardous materials control program. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing simple about the work required at Uziel's Northridge home. 
Lab tests not only confirmed the presence of asbestos in the ceilings of the 
house, built in 1977, but in plaster from cracked walls. Uziel, who has two 
children, moved out, and alerted neighbors with similar homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of the neighbors also moved out, but some "just shrugged it off," 
Uziel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew my responsibility to other people," he said. "Sometimes you happen to 
know things that the average man doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 What Uziel does not know, however, is how he will take care of structural 
repair and cleanup costs well in excess of his $100,000 earthquake insurance 
policy.

FIRES SCORCH HOME AND SCHOOL AND KNOCK OUT POWER IN VENTURA AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Three separate fires on Saturday scorched a Camarillo school and a Thousand 
Oaks home and caused a power outage in Ventura after a lightning arrester on a 
utility pole exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 High winds and low humidity made Saturday ripe for dangerous blazes, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters said Ventura reported the lowest humidity in Southern 
California on Saturday, a mere 8% at one point. Conditions should improve 
today, with gentler winds and higher humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the fires occurred shortly after 1 p.m. at a home in the 800 
block of Camino la Maida in Thousand Oaks, where a bedroom and hallway were 
badly burned. Firefighters arrived on scene moments after the blaze started and 
put it out in 15 minutes, said a spokeswoman from the Ventura County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Investigator Peter Cronk said the family was fortunate the wind 
did not cause the home's wood-shingled roof to catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the wind blowing as it was, it was a concern this fire would spread very 
fast," Cronk said. He said the fire began after a cigarette fell into a pile of 
stacked clothes and smoldered for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was discovered by the 2-year-old son of the residents, said a 
relative who did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters estimated the blaze caused $15,000 in damage to the structure and 
$10,000 to the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire at Los Altos Intermediate School in Camarillo also occurred shortly 
after 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The small blaze originated in a pile of clothing in the corner of a room that 
was being used as a storage area, Cronk said. It was put out before the flames 
could spread to adjoining classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronk said the blaze probably was begun by someone throwing a burning object 
though the open window above the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials estimated $3,000 in damage, mostly from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Cavaliere, principal of Los Altos Intermediate School, said he expects 
insurance to cover the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The third fire occurred shortly after 2 p.m. when sparks from a utility pole 
started a small brush fire on Foothill Road west of Victoria Avenue, a Ventura 
Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze began after a lightning arrestor on the pole exploded, a Southern 
California Edison spokesman said. The small explosion left about 2,300 homes 
north of Telegraph Road and east of Dos Caminos Avenue without power for about 
20 minutes, the spokesman said. No other damage was reported.

CITY WEIGHS FUNDS FOR 2 ROAD PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city leaders Monday are expected to approve spending more than 
$250,000 on two road projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending an expenditure of $35,284 to pay a consultant who 
is drafting a report on plans to improve the Ventura Freeway between Vineyard 
Avenue in Oxnard and Johnson Drive in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The $44-million project, to be funded by the cities of Oxnard and Ventura and 
the California Department of Transportation, includes widening the Santa Clara 
River bridge to eight lanes and reconfiguring the Oxnard Boulevard and Johnson 
Drive interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant on the project is requesting $78,000 more than the original 
contract of $583,102 because more time was spent on design alternatives than 
originally anticipated, city officials said. Ventura's share would come to 
$35,284. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the freeway project is not scheduled to begin until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $219,645 is being proposed for placing 1.8 miles of asphalt 
rubber on Kimball Road from Telephone Road to Thille Street and on Telephone 
from Kimball to Placid Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest bid came from Oxnard-based Southern Pacific Milling Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the project is expected to begin in a few months. PEGGY Y. LEE

COLLEGE TRUSTEES UNVEIL LIST OF DISTRICT GOALS; EDUCATION: STREAMLINING 
REGISTRATION AND HOLDING LINE ON FEES ARE AMONG 23 PROPOSALS PRESENTED AT 
SPECIAL SESSION. STUDYING EMPLOYEE MORALE IS ALSO DISCUSSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District -- after months of 
fielding student and faculty complaints that the board is unresponsive to 
campus needs -- on Saturday proposed a list of districtwide goals ranging from 
creating more parking space at the colleges to helping students graduate 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in a special Saturday session, the trustees also discussed studying 
employee morale and the state-mandated "shared-governance" process in which 
college staff members are supposed to participate in the management of district 
affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Since early last fall, when their contract talks with the district stalled, 
college instructors have spoken of plummeting morale and a feeling that 
district administrators and trustees do not consult them in key matters 
affecting the district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one trustee, Pete Tafoya, said his outlook on the district's 
future has been affected by teachers' protests and student input. 
</P>
<P>
 "You become a lot more sensitive when you have picketing on the site," Tafoya 
said, referring to protests instructors have staged at Moorpark, Oxnard and 
Ventura Colleges, as well as on the steps of the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 The five trustees proposed 23 different goals, a condensed version of which 
will be reviewed by the board at a later session. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the list were proposals that the district: 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamline the registration process, called "cumbersome" by the trustees, 
either through more sophisticated computerization or other means. 
</P>
<P>
 * Work at the state level to resist increases in student fees, which have 
risen from $6 per unit in the fall of 1992 to $13 per unit since the fall of 
1993. Fees for students with bachelors' degrees are $50 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a district-level office that could provide trustees and district 
staff with trend and statistical information about district students and 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop a plan for upgrading and maintaining campus buildings, laboratories 
and other facilities, some of which are in great need of refurbishing, college 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Invite local legislators onto the district's three campuses more frequently, 
to show them around and explain what the district is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the trustees agreed they should be less inhibited about 
spending money on travel, both for themselves and for district faculty and 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since former district Trustee James T. (Tom) Ely was convicted three years ago 
of misusing travel and other district funds, trustees said they have held back 
from proposing community college-related travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's appropriate education," said Trustee Gregory P. Cole, but he predicted 
that the teachers union "will say that the board spent $5,000 per year on 
travel that should be going to the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he said, "it's important to having a viable board of trustees." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have criticized district expenditures on items they consider extras. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have asked the district for a 3% raise and a cost-of-living increase 
as part of their contract negotiations, but district officials say the district 
is in such tough financial straits that it cannot increase their salaries and 
in fact would like faculty to contribute to the cost of their health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the trustees, after an occasionally acrimonious debate, voted 
Saturday to maintain the current, non-resident student tuition rate of $110 per 
unit. As he has in the past, Tafoya lobbied to lower the rate to $108 per unit, 
the district's estimated cost for educating a student. But Cole, as he has in 
the past, pushed to raise the rate even higher, to $113 per unit, in order to 
generate more district revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic has become an issue at the district because foreign students -- who 
also must pay a $7 per unit surcharge on top of the regular fees -- have 
complained that the cost is prohibitive.

POLITICAL SALVOS INTENSIFY IN DRIVE TO RECALL ROBERTI; CAMPAIGN: SENATOR'S FOES 
SAY THEY'RE GRASS-ROOTS GOVERNMENT REFORMERS. HE CALLS THAT LABEL A COVER FOR 
VINDICTIVE GUN FANATICS.

 Depending on who's talking, the leaders of the effort to recall State Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) are an eclectic coalition of madder-than-hell 
good-government proponents or a secretive bunch of vindictive gun nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall advocates claim to be grass-roots reformers who see Roberti, who was 
the powerful state Senate president pro tempore for 13 years, as epitomizing a 
political system gone haywire with soft-on-crime liberalism, corruption, 
arrogance and deal-making. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti, who recently became the first state lawmaker in 80 years to be 
forced into a recall election, has rejected attempts to characterize his foes 
as anything other than vengeful -- and potentially dangerous -- gun fanatics 
angry with him for his bill that led to a 1989 assault-weapon ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this is all about," Roberti said at a news conference last month 
as he held up an outlawed Uzi assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said recall leader Bill Dominguez, who accuses Roberti of demonizing 
his foes to avoid dealing with their charges that he is a carpetbagger who 
tolerated the political corruption that has scandalized the Legislature in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dominguez also has acknowledged that the recall leadership has had a 
political marriage of convenience with gun activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we called them (gun activists) for financial help, it was almost a 
situation of them being ready to mortgage their houses," Dominguez said. "But 
call up someone and ask them to contribute to a movement to stop corruption in 
government, and they'd say, 'That's nice -- we'll get back to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But while Dominguez, 43, a systems analyst with Transamerica Insurance Group 
and candidate in the recall election, denies that gun issues are the driving 
force behind his own political activism, he nevertheless shares with 2nd 
Amendment enthusiasts the belief that gun control is liberalism's failed 
substitute for getting tough on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've been hanging around these 2nd Amendment people too long," 
Dominguez said recently, joking about their influence. Dominguez, whose father 
was a political refugee from Castro's Cuba, also ran against Roberti in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall movement has paid a price for its alliance with the 
anti-gun-control forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ties have handed Roberti valuable ammunition in his bid to paint his foes 
as single-issue activists. Handgun Control Inc., sponsor of the federal Brady 
bill, has jumped to Roberti's defense. Roberti aides have said they hope to 
turn the recall, scheduled for April 12, into a national referendum on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recall movement cannot be easily dismissed as merely a puppet of 
the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, among the five official proponents of the recall are Glenn 
Bailey, 38, an Encino educator and longtime environmental activist; Hans 
Rusche, 63, an engineering company executive and local leader in Ross Perot's 
United We Stand movement, and Dolores White, 59, a real estate broker and 
veteran activist in county and state Republican party circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusche said recently: "This gun thing has been played up too much by Roberti 
and the media. There's no question these people are involved. But the NRA 
(National Rifle Assn.) hasn't supported us with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Rusche said, he applauds Roberti's assault-weapon ban. "Such 
high-tech weapons belong on the battlefield, not on our streets," he said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bailey and White ran against Roberti in 1992. White and seven others, 
including Dominguez and a Canoga Park gun dealer, filed last week as candidates 
to replace Roberti if the recall succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, last Monday, state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who has represented the 
Westside for two decades in Sacramento, announced that he will run in the 
regular election this spring for the Senate seat now held by Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's current term expires in December, and due to term limits he is 
ineligible to run for reelection. In effect, if he is recalled, Roberti's 
successor in the April 12 election would serve only until December. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal faced a difficult reelection campaign because the 1990 
reapportionment radically changed his constituency. His surprise decision to 
run for the 20th District seat held by Roberti was quickly endorsed by the key 
leadership of the political organization run by U.S. Reps. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 But critics swiftly likened the Rosenthal decision to Roberti's own 
controversial move to the San Fernando Valley -- from Hollywood -- in 1992 and 
predicted that it would help the recall movement by fueling the community's 
anger against over-the-hill politicians trying to set up shop in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Roberti revisited," White complained. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent weeks, the recall has captured the support of a number of 
taxpayer, victims' rights and government watchdog advocates. They include Ted 
Costa, president of People's Advocate, a group founded by the late tax fighter 
Paul Gann; Ralph Morrell, a state capital gadfly, and Kevin Washburn, a leader 
in the "three strikes and you're out" anti-crime initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Roberti camp claims such views and diversity are the exception and not 
the rule in a movement spawned by the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti thesis got a major boost when the media obtained a lengthy 
confidential memo, laden with sinister, threatening rhetoric, written to the 
NRA by recall advocate Russ Howard, a South Bay resident. In the memo, Roberti 
is graphically described as the target of the anti-gun control movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beast is wounded," the memo says in one section, a reference to Roberti's 
costly 1992 struggle to win election to the Valley-based seat of former state 
Sen. Alan Robbins. "It's time to go in for the kill before he can run for 
something like attorney general."

$30-MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE GOES TO JURY; COURTS: TESTIMONY CONCLUDES 
AGAINST MORRIS D. ENGLISH, CHARGED WITH SWINDLING 1,500 PEOPLE THROUGH 
NOW-DEFUNCT WELLINGTON GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than two months of testimony, a federal court jury will decide 
whether the leader of a now-defunct South Bay investment firm swindled 1,500 
investors out of more than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Final arguments concluded last week in U. S. District Court in the fraud and 
money-laundering trial of Morris D. English Jr., 46, former head of the 
Wellington Group investment company. 
</P>
<P>
 While about a dozen glaring investors looked on, Assistant U. S. Atty. Jeffrey 
Isaacs told the jury that investors in English's company "entrusted a good 
portion of their life savings to the defendant, and he stole it." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs said English used some of the money to "live a lifestyle his victims 
could only dream about," including expensive homes for himself and family 
members, private airplanes and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Callahan argued that, although English made mistakes 
in running his company, he never tried to swindle anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes were made here," Callahan told the jurors. "(English) is the first 
to admit it." But, he added, "were his actions criminal? Not on your life -- 
and, more importantly, not on his life." 
</P>
<P>
 English could be sentenced to 450 years in prison if convicted on all 51 
counts in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, some of the investors who lost money, many of them retirees, 
spoke bitterly of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ruined our lives, our children's inheritance," said Eleanor Sturman of 
Burbank, who said she lost $194,000. "He took away everything a lot of these 
people had. We've got old people who are eating dog food because of him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, the case began in 1984 when English purchased a 
dormant Manhattan Beach company called Wellington Escrow Corp. for $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 English later changed the name to The Wellington Group, moved to Rolling Hills 
Estates and began making short-term, interest-only loans to borrowers who 
secured the loans with real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund the loans, prosecutors said, English solicited money from investors, 
promising them a 15% to 16% return on their investment. English advertised on 
radio, and investors from across the country invested millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the company eventually evolved into a classic "Ponzi scheme," 
with new investors' money being used to pay off old investors. Meanwhile, 
prosecutors allege, English diverted investors' funds for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the California Department of Corporations obtained a preliminary 
injunction to prevent Wellington from selling unqualified securities. The 
company later filed for bankruptcy and, according to prosecutors, illegally 
omitted investors' names from the list of creditors so the investors wouldn't 
find out about it. 
</P>
<P>
 English also concealed or destroyed numerous records concerning the company, 
prosecutors charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors say they didn't know anything was wrong until the interest 
payments on their investments abruptly stopped. By then, it was too late to get 
their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's collapse sparked civil lawsuits involving hundreds of investors. 
The company has been placed in the hands of a court-appointed trustee, who has 
been selling its remaining assets to pay off investors. Some investors say they 
may get back 10 or 15 cents on the dollar -- if that. 
</P>
<P>
 English's criminal court troubles began in 1991 when he was charged in 
Torrance with eight counts of grand theft and writing bad checks to investors. 
In a plea bargain, he agreed to make good on the checks, but was later arrested 
for failing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal agents were investigating his business affairs. English was 
arrested in May on the federal charges and has been held in federal custody 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in his own defense, English denied that he ever tried to mislead 
investors. At times combative, he blamed many of his company's troubles on 
overzealous regulators, once referring to a Department of Corporations official 
as a "DOC Nazi."

FATHER-SON TEAM SHOWS SOME HEART; TRANSPORTATION: THE PAIR HELPS MAKE THE DAILY 
COMMUTE MORE BEARABLE BY ERECTING COLORFUL LIGHTED SCULPTURES NEAR A FREEWAY 
ARTERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From dusk to dawn, the 24-foot glowing red heart pierced by an enormous white 
arrow looms above the Harbor and Redondo freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Etched against the night sky, the sculpture -- illuminated by nearly 300 
lights -- is a Valentine's Day greeting from Jesse and Bud Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest in a series of seasonal sculptures erected to amuse the 
thousands of motorists driving past the interchange every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The art is the work of Jesse Gardner, 44, president of California Fence & 
Supply Co., and his father, Bud, 67, a retired furniture manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started when dad and I created a 20-foot Christmas tree out of bent 
square tubing and covered it with 350 Christmas lights and hoisted it onto the 
roof of our building next to the freeway in December, 1992," Jesse Gardner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Gardners and 14 employees of the fence company have displayed 
giant metal sculptures on the roof saluting special days or seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculptures are visible during the day, but after dark, in the brilliant 
glow of lights, the figures attract the greatest attention. 
</P>
<P>
 First a mammoth shamrock commemorated St. Patrick's Day, then a bunny and 
basket of eggs for Easter and later a 20-foot sombrero for Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mother's Day, it was a huge floral arrangement, gigantic lilies for 
Memorial Day, a 23-foot necktie for Father's Day, an enormous birthday cake 
topped with five candles shaped like firecrackers for the 4th of July. 
</P>
<P>
 For Labor Day, there was a 21-foot beach umbrella shading a pot-bellied man in 
a hammock, a ship for Columbus Day, a giant pumpkin with a Betty Boop face for 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 A cross-eyed, bow-legged turkey was there for Thanksgiving. That was followed 
by another Christmas tree and an anchor saluting the about-to-be-closed Long 
Beach Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
 All the works are supported by nearly invisible stainless steel guy wires. The 
sculptures are set up several days before a holiday and remain in place several 
days after. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving the freeways isn't much fun. This is our way to add a smile or two to 
the daily commute," Jesse Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although motorists are not aware who erects the art, the fence company has 
received phone calls and letters of appreciation for the fanciful sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from Gardena signed by Linda Marie Alvarez and Gabriel Torres 
expressed these sentiments: 
</P>
<P>
 "In this day and age when graffiti seems to be the most popular form of 
expression, your choice of lighting up each season is greatly appreciated."

MALIBU'S MANTRA: SANDBAG, SANDBAG, SANDBAG; ENVIRONMENT: BELEAGUERED RESIDENTS 
SCRAMBLE TO SHORE UP HOMES AGAINST POSSIBLE SUNDAY STORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Malibu residents dug out of mud-filled homes, forecasts for a weekend storm 
sent residents beleaguered by last week's cascade scrambling to shore up homes 
against more mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandbag, sandbag, sandbag -- it's been the city's mantra since the November 
wildfires stripped vegetation from hillsides, leaving property vulnerable to 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking to people who are frantic about the Sunday storm," said Sarah 
Maurice, spokeswoman for the city of Malibu. "They are saying, 'Can't you stop 
it -- the storm and the mudflows?' It's gonna happen. We've been telling them 
to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice, who was nicknamed "bag lady" for her work directing sandbagging, said 
free sandbags from the city's supply of 15,000 are available at Malibu fire 
stations. Engineers from the Los Angeles County Flood Control District are 
being sent to instruct residents on proper placement. 
</P>
<P>
 The sandbags, however, are not foolproof. Soggy barriers at numerous houses 
along Pacific Coast Highway were overwhelmed by the mudflows. 
</P>
<P>
 With volunteers tapped out from the fires and the Jan. 17 earthquake, Malibu's 
Community Disaster Recovery and Preparedness Center was operating with a dearth 
of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in part, prompted the city to dispatch temporary laborers to residences 
for help digging out. By Wednesday most of the houses along Pacific Coast 
Highway that had been socked in by mud were cleaned up and fortified with 
sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Malibu residents heeded the city's words to the wise. 
</P>
<P>
 The house of Stella Bacich, a 20-year oceanfront resident, looked 
conspicuously unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What stops (the mud)?" asked Bacich, who views sandbags as a kind of false 
hope. "It's all Mother Nature. You can't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director John Clement said city employees and others are working 
around the clock to clear huge accumulations of sediment, rocks and dead 
vegetation from the system of storm drains, culverts, dams and racks erected to 
catch debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The system stopped much of the debris but was overwhelmed by the enormity of 
the flow, which pummeled at least 24 houses on Pacific Coast Highway and 
severely damaged one home in lower Las Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how much more mud could come down again," said Clement. "You 
still look up in the hillsides at Tuna Canyon and Big Rock and there is a lot 
of black soil. So it is hard to determine how much more hydrophobic soil is 
still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrophobic soil is a non-porous layer two to six inches below the surface 
that is produced from gases and oils of burned chaparral. When it rains, water 
runs off the surface instead of being absorbed, creating mudslides and debris 
flows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little more than an inch of rain (Monday), so if it comes down like 
it did, then we are going to have mudslides again," Clement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired but unbowed, city officials say they are ready. City Manager David 
Carmany said long-term plans for stopping the slides and preventing fires are 
being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 A study on fire-ravaged Las Flores Canyon is under way, along with an attempt 
to get funding to safeguard fire- and flood-prone areas through special 
disaster recovery legislation that Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) 
plans to sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu is also studying geographically similar communities for answers to 
problems with its storm drains and water system, which failed during the 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think we can do something to preempt (mudslides)," Carmany said. 
"We don't know what kind of long-term solutions are out there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 If the mudslides continue on a grand scale, Carmany said the city would ask 
for assistance from the Navy's 91st U.S. Construction Battalion, known as 
Seabees. The Seabees, akin to the Army Corps of Engineers, in just two days 
rebuilt a burned bridge over Las Flores Creek after the fires, Carmany said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life in Malibu took on some signs of normalcy Wednesday. 
Spandex-clad women jogged past mud-splattered residents still cleaning up. 
Cosentino's Nursery, fully recovered from the mud that filled it at the bottom 
of Las Flores Canyon on Pacific Coast Highway, was open and getting ready for 
its biggest day of the year: Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 And gingerly stepping through muck and scattered tree branches along Las 
Flores Canyon Road, a woman out for her morning constitutional looked up at a 
passerby and said with a smile: "Home, sweet home."

BUSINESSES CASH IN ON TRADITION

 For Chinese New Year, N.B.C. Seafood Restaurant in Monterey Park serves dinner 
combinations with names like "good business," "good fortune" and "money come 
in."  
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong Supermarket stocks up on oranges, whose name in Mandarin sounds like 
the word for wealth, and dumplings, whose boatlike shape resembles Chinese gold 
bullion. 
</P>
<P>
 These items -- meant to attract prosperity in the coming year -- have more 
than symbolic significance for the establishments that sell them. The New 
Year's celebration is a windfall for Chinese businesses much as Christmas is to 
department stores and malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate holiday feasts boost sales for markets and restaurants. Phone lines 
are jammed and flights to Asia booked as celebrants reunite with family and 
friends. And Asian bankers profit from increased transactions, as people 
withdraw money to meet expenses, settle old debts or embark on new investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangling brilliantly near the entrance of the Hong Kong Supermarket are red 
scrolls and firecrackers, a paper dragon and gold-colored coin banks. Displays 
of holiday nuts and mushrooms are heaped in front of the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 "On that traditional New Year's eve dinner, you have to prepare a lot of 
food," store manager Philip Pan said. "More than enough for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales pick up rapidly in the weeks before the holiday, he said, and more than 
double on New Year's eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrations are often held at restaurants. N.B.C. Seafood manager William Lee 
said business picks up by about 50% in the two weeks before New Year's when 
companies hold banquets, and in the weeks afterward, when families gather for 
feasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A red Buddhist shrine with offerings of oranges and incense to the gods of 
property and business marks the entrance of Chinese American Live Poultry in 
Rosemead. Here, customers choose from a variety of fowl -- pheasants, squab, 
ducks, geese and, most importantly, chicken. The back room is stacked to the 
ceiling with cages of birds that are butchered fresh and sold with the heads 
and feet still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales leap to three times the normal rate in the days around the holiday, and 
customers sometimes wait more than an hour in lines that stretch down the 
block, owner Quan Phu said. And while fresh chicken is an important New Year's 
dish for any Chinese family, it's especially crucial to Buddhists, who 
sacrifice it to their ancestors on that day, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want chicken without wings or head or feet," he explained. "They 
want a whole chicken, a perfect one." 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is an opportunity for celebrants to visit with family and friends 
they may not have seen all year, and many take that opportunity to travel home 
to Asia. Helen Koo, owner of America Asia Travel Center in Monterey Park, said 
flights to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China increase about 45% or more over 
the holidays. Sales have jumped from 600 in December to 1,000 this month, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers from the opposite direction boost local real estate firms, said 
James Chou, vice president of George Realty Group in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Taiwan, China, everybody has a vacation, so a lot of people plan to 
travel, maybe a month, looking for some property," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight years that George Realty has operated, Chou said, the company has 
seen sales increase 15% to 30% in the weeks around New Year's, as Asian 
investors seek business deals and recent immigrants purchase homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who can't make it across the Pacific can always phone home. Sprint 
spokeswoman Juanada Teas said calls to Asia increase 20% to 30% over normal 
levels during the period from New Year's Day through the following weekend. AT 
& T has no similar statistics available, spokeswoman Lorraine Wong said, but 
the company's Chinese-speaking operators are working six-day weeks to meet the 
increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 New Year's customs can be a mixed blessing for business, said John Hou, 
president of the Asian Pacific Bancorp. and member of the Monterey Park 
planning commission. Because arguments are forbidden during the 15-day holiday, 
he explained, bankers and other businessmen scramble to collect outstanding 
debts before New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, bankers come out ahead, though, said Philip Ma, manager of Cathay 
Bank's main branch in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of transactions going on because people see it as a time of 
prosperity, to celebrate what you've accomplished in the past year," he said. 
"You see more activity among people who like to invest." 
</P>
<P>
 This year -- the year of the dog -- bodes well for business, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog's nature is very loyal," he said. "So it should be a conservative, 
growing year, (although) I wouldn't expect a big jump."

PICTURES LOOK BEYOND STEREOTYPES OF LIFE IN THE PROJECTS; WATTS: A DUTCH 
PHOTOGRAPHER'S MONTHLONG SOJOURN PRODUCES IMAGES THAT TRANSCEND FACELESS 
CLICHES.

 Life in the apartments, gang circles and cliques of Imperial Courts is one of 
hopelessness, poverty and nihilism to outsiders, and to some who live in the 
project. But there is more to this picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the cliched images of gun-toting gangsters, unwed teen-age mothers and 
high school dropouts are the faces of people trying to get by. Some aspire to 
move beyond the run-down facades and grassless front yards. Others find 
themselves drawn there to visit family members or to hang out in a community 
where, despite problems, everyone knows everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, they are all individuals whose lives transcend the faceless 
stereotypes of life in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 For one month in 1993, Dana Lixenberg, a 29-year-old Dutch photographer, 
visited Imperial Courts. She hung out with the OGs -- original gangsters -- and 
young gang members, the mothers, sons and daughters, listened to residents' 
stories and captured portraits of a different side of Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show something that I didn't think was seen before. Through doing 
it, I just took what was given to me," Lixenberg said. 
</P>

 "Coming to Imperial Courts, at first it looks like life isn't really moving 
much, but underneath that, there's a lot of pain and a lot of passion, too," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg's initial plan was to photograph gang members in the area, but she 
decided to focus on residents in the low-rise housing project after meeting 
Tyrone Thomas -- known in the neighborhood as Tony Bogard -- of Hands Across 
Watts, a nonprofit organization formed to encourage the 1992 gang truce. Thomas 
was killed in a shootout last month in Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was real skeptical about me photographing people. I don't think he 
wanted them to be exploited," Lixenberg recalled. "He really grilled me and 
asked me what good it would do for them and his people. I couldn't say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But each day I took another picture of another person, I learned something 
different."

 When he closes his eyes sometimes, Andre Fountain can picture himself riding 
the horses in the 131st Street stables, as he did when he was a child. From age 
4 he was jostled atop the horses, his father hollering instructions on how to 
hang on. At 12, he was breaking them in and would go home to 117th Street, just 
blocks away from the projects, covered in dust.  
</P>
<P>
 "They started calling me Dusty after that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The riding ended in 1983 when Fountain, then 16, was shot in the back after an 
argument and left paralyzed from the waist down. Gangrene required doctors to 
amputate his legs in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty isn't too fond of the projects, although he occasionally comes up from 
Downey, where he lives with his sister, to visit family and hang out. "You 
don't have no yard and can't have no pets" in Imperial Courts, he said. "And I 
don't trust everybody over there."  
</P>
<P>
 He was a member of the Seven Boy Crips when he was young. Being part of a gang 
was part of the life. But that life is over now, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to tell these young brothers to go to school and get an education, and 
they say: 'You didn't go to school.' But I say: 'Don't you want to be better?' 
" 
</P>

<P>
 Lixenberg spent entire days with residents, rarely prying into their lives, 
taking what they said at face value and observing the rest, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys, they spent a lot of time changing clothes and dressing up 
and just sitting around," she remembered. "They acted like nothing bothered 
them, but it always seemed like they cared but couldn't let it show."

 "If I ever come up in life, I'll move my kids out for their safety, but I'd 
(come) back because this is all I know," said Grady Earl (One Love) Gordon, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an OG from over here. I have to stay here for my homeboys," he explains. 
"This is my family here. One for one and one for all. But my kids, they don't 
need to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon wants his children -- James, 12, and Deanna, 5 -- to be protected from 
the sorts of tragedies that have surrounded him. The worst was the death of his 
mother in 1989, shot in the head by a bullet that Gordon fired at his 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 When he mentions his mother's death, Gordon's head hangs low with guilt. He 
loved his mother dearly, he said. He was trying to protect her from a man who 
Gordon said repeatedly beat her. But she jumped in front of the man just as 
Gordon fired at him. He is on parole for the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life here ain't different, it's just harder," said Gordon, who moved to 
Imperial Courts with his family when he was 5. "We're all just trying to 
survive."

 "The media (were) like intruders," said Lixenberg, who watched a stream of 
reporters flow into the projects to get reactions from residents last April as 
Los Angeles awaited the verdicts after the second Rodney G. King beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the media spent time there," she said. "They would interview people 
for two minutes, but only show little bits and pieces. No more than that." 
</P>

 Velma Hill recalls the Imperial Courts of the 1970s with fondness. There were 
playgrounds, teen dances, roller-skating parties and neighbors concerned about 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice. People cared about people," said Hill, 31, known as Coco in the 
community. "Now, they just care about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 There should be more activities for people, better playgrounds for the 
children and a curfew to keep people from being idle on the streets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never the place you live at that's the problem. It's the people," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill admits that her views are somewhat old-fashioned. It comes from her 
upbringing. One of 14 children, Hill grew up with her siblings and both parents 
in two apartments in Imperial Courts, connected by a door that was cut out to 
join them. The girls slept on one side, the boys on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill realizes that her family was an anomaly. Not for its size, but because 
both of her parents were there.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky. Some people weren't blessed with a mama and daddy; we were," she 
said. "Even though we didn't have the best house, I had Christmas every year, 
Easter and Bible study with my mama and daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't nothing my dad wouldn't give us. And there wasn't nothing he 
wouldn't do for any other kid in these projects," she said of her father, who 
died in November. "Mr. Hill was always doing something for somebody."

 Edward Vander is better known as Peanut in the neighborhood around East 114th 
Street. His freckled face stands out when he passes through the neighborhood. 
But he doesn't come by too often now that he lives in Long Beach. Peanut, 19, 
doesn't like the projects, said his grandmother, Cora Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all these gangs, things were just getting too dangerous," Webb said. "He 
wanted to get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the tattoo that says PJW Crip on his right forearm is a constant 
reminder of his old stomping ground.

 "When I first walked in there, I think I represented something negative to 
them," Lixenberg said of residents' initial impressions of her.  
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg grew up in Amsterdam and has lived and worked in New York City since 
1989. She came to Los Angeles in 1993 to photograph Watts with a grant from the 
government of Holland. Even with its problems, Amsterdam has nothing comparable 
to people's experiences in Watts, Lixenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a very different culture and country, and my life is so 
different. For them, I'm someone from a really faraway place," Lixenberg said. 
"But it was important for them not to label me, just as I didn't want to label 
them."

 Inside the Korean-owned market he will manage when it opens on 114th Street 
across from Imperial Courts, Uzzi leans back on the laminated counter after a 
day of installing shelves and building walls and muses about life in "the 
Courts." 
</P>
<P>
 He's hopped around among cities in Los Angeles County -- Pomona, Gardena, 
Altadena -- but he has always come back to the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back because it's Watts, this is where I'm from," he said, as if the 
reason was obvious. "I have my friends, my family. I can't never forget where 
I'm from." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, Uzzi pulls down his sawdust-covered T-shirt to reveal a 
fading tattoo, but an indelible reminder of his roots: Mr. Uzzi/PJW. 
</P>
<P>
 Uzzi, 31, whose real name is Herbert Taylor, got his street name because he 
could throw a lightning punch that could end any fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Uzzi pointed out, however, that he first got the name Uzziah from a cellmate 
in jail who saw him repeatedly reading the second book of Kings in the Old 
Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few material things that Uzzi holds dear, he said. One, especially, 
is his discharge card from a three-year parole -- six days after his birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Best present I ever got," he said. "Ain't no way I'm going back."

 Jessica Patterson grew up in Imperial Courts, but there was no love lost when 
she left in September to live with her aunt on Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 She had no support system when she lived there, and after her mother died in 
December, 1992, she didn't see much point in staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed when my mom died, there was no one living for me, so I had to 
live for myself," said Jessica, 16. "I had to move on to try and make my way." 
</P>
<P>
 She drops by Imperial Courts a couple of times a week to visit her aunt and 
some of her 15 siblings who live there. But the visits are short. A couple of 
hours is too long sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it there very much," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her feelings are not unusual. For many who leave the projects, there is no 
turning back. 
</P>
<P>
 What Jessica wants is an education and a chance to be a model or a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get it there," she said. "I hope I can get it now." 
</P>

 The last series of pictures Lixenberg took were of Tony Bogard. Bogard was 
skeptical until the end and was the hardest person to photograph, Lixenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I photographed him at his house (on 64th Street) and he stood really still, 
like a sculpture. I don't know if he was shy or not. But it was some of the 
best photos I got." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard, a gangbanger-turned-peacemaker, was considered a leader to many in 
Imperial Courts, where he grew up. But not everyone agreed with his approach to 
ending the killings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard realized the danger in what he did -- he carried a gun and wore a 
bulletproof vest. But he wasn't wearing the vest when he was killed in a 
shootout, allegedly by two members of his own gang -- the PJ Watts Crips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't nobody take Tony's place walking through these projects and trying to 
keep the peace," said Cheryl Wilborne, a resident of Imperial Courts who knew 
Bogard since he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't perfect, but he was a role model for some people here," she said. 
"That was all we had. But one of his own had to take that away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg admits that a month was not enough time to come close to 
understanding Imperial Courts or any community. She is not sure how long it 
would take. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now is when I hear of South-Central or L.A., for the first 
time I can say I was allowed to see a part of people's lives."

TRAVELING TOY BEAR HELPS OPEN UP WORLD; EDUCATION: SCOOTER'S JOURNEY TO SEVEN 
STATES AND EUROPE HELPS GIVE GEOGRAPHY LESSONS TO STUDENTS AT ST. ANTHONY 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He stands only 2 feet tall, weighs no more than 5 pounds and is stuffed with 
cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scooter the Bear has been quite the world traveler since September, 
canvassing the globe as an ambassador, sightseer and co-geography teacher to 
the eighth-grade class at St. Anthony Elementary School in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Chad Laines decided to enliven his geography lessons by sending the 
bear on an experimental journey in September. The students armed Scooter with a 
note explaining the project, a set of stamped, pre-addressed postcards, a 
backpack and travel journal. Scooter's traveling companions were asked to send 
the postcards, deposit souvenirs in the backpack, and record their experiences 
in the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Scooter returned to class last month, the cards and journal 
revealed he had traversed at least seven states and eight European countries. 
The light-gray bear had accumulated a wealth of treasures in his backpack, 
including currency from Poland, a beer mug from Sweden (allegedly grabbed after 
a night of heavy partying with some female companions in Stockholm) and a shirt 
from Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Laines came up with the idea for the project with his wife, Annie, who works 
as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 So on Sept. 24, Scooter, well, scooted off from Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Laines gave the bear to a young girl on her way from Los Angeles to 
Portland. After that, Scooter was on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The postcards allowed students to trace Scooter's progress on a map, while 
they studied the geographic, historic and cultural differences of the places he 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
 But the journal revealed a more complete picture of his travels: 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, my family and I are going to Orlando (Florida) to spend five days at 
Disney World and to see other things," one girl wrote. "My little brother has 
cancer and the Make-A-Wish Foundation granted him his wish to see Mickey Mouse. 
It's great to have you flying with us." 
</P>
<P>
 In another entry, dated Oct. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am flying home from Russia where I was born one month ago. I have been 
adopted by an American family from New York City. . . . My name is Vanessa and 
I was born in L'Vov, Ukraine, where my birth mother had no money to support me. 
I know I will have a happy life in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Other entries were unsigned and written as if in Scooter's voice: 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am in glorious ancient Rome. . . . most impressive are the ancient 
Roman ruins of the Forum, the Colosseum, the Pantheon and the Baths of 
Caracalla," reads one entry. In another, from Greece, ". . . On Thursday we 
went to Hydra where we went on a tour of the island on a donkey." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Scooter's companions gave detailed descriptions of geography, 
population, natural resources and other facts about the countries they saw. One 
entry written on a flight to Moscow outlines the relationship of the former 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the volatile political situation in the former Soviet Union, this gave 
me an opportunity to teach about that and put it in some perspective," Laines 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laines, 29, said he was pleased that the experiment worked. The bear's return 
helped restore some of his "faith in human nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the suspense," 13-year-old Manuel Chavez said. "We were always 
thinking (Scooter) wasn't going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Laines' students are eager to send the bear on his way again, possibly through 
Asia or South America. But their teacher is not sure he wants to press his 
luck, especially after Scooter disappeared for two months during his maiden 
voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 The class had stopped receiving postcards in October, and Scooter was not 
heard from until Jan. 6, when Laines received a call from the LAX baggage 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Scooter was sitting in a cardboard box, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The students breathed a collective sigh of relief upon Scooter's return, but 
Laines said he is still baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to know what happened during that time (before January)," Laines 
said. Since Scooter's tag requested he be returned to Los Angeles by Jan. 1, 
Laines said he figures someone probably returned the bear early, and it sat in 
an airport room. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely theory, Laines said, is that the bear just became too heavy to 
carry after being packed with mugs and other trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 Scooter hasn't said a word.

PRENATAL CARE PROGRAM IS TRUE LABOR OF LOVE FOR FORMER NURSE; HEALTH: ZOLA 
JONES HAS RETIRED, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S SLOWED DOWN. SHE'S STILL 
FOCUSING HER ENERGIES ON THE GREAT BEGINNINGS FOR BLACK BABIES PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Everything, it seems, is a family affair to Zola Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, families have been her career. A public health nurse 
since 1961, Jones retired last fall as family planning specialist for Los 
Angeles County's Department of Public Health. But that doesn't mean she has 
stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement means she can spend more time on Great Beginnings for Black Babies, 
which she co-founded in 1990. The volunteer-run prenatal care campaign is 
designed to stop the spiraling infant mortality rate among African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones volunteers most of her time to making Great Beginnings bigger, more 
financially secure and accessible to more women. The program recently opened a 
branch in the Hawthorne Mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get up at 4:30 a.m. to be at work by 6 a.m. and go for 12 or 14 
hours because I was also trying to get Great Beginnings started," she said. 
"Now I get up a little bit later." 
</P>
<P>
 The 56-year-old woman with a passion for family has never been married and has 
no children. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a favorite aunt, the one who sneaked you extra cookies when mom wasn't 
looking. Her brown eyes magnified by owl-rimmed glasses, Jones rarely speaks 
first and always says "we did" rather than "I did." She smiles widely and often 
and laughs generously, her shoulders shaking as if she's been seized by a 
sneeze.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always looked to Zola as the impeccable warrior," Caswell A. Evans Jr. 
of the county Department of Health Services, said in a speech at an 
appreciation dinner recently to honor Jones' decades of work in public health. 
"She is a person with a fire in the belly and a vision in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her retirement, that vision is sharply focused on one thing: "If 
everything could be right in the world," Jones said, "everybody would have 
prenatal care. There would be no barriers for women to get help, and every baby 
would have the chance to be born healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many children don't have that chance. California's infant mortality rate 
hovers at nearly 7%, Department of Health statistics show, but the rate for 
black babies is more than 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings, offered in collaboration with Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood, gives pregnant women the information they need to keep 
themselves and their babies healthy. They are taught not to drink, smoke or 
take drugs when pregnant and are given information on nutrition, exercise and 
basic anatomy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to see Great Beginnings connected with all the major hospitals," 
Jones said from her bare-walled office at the Hawthorne clinic that still has 
chalky dust and the smell of new carpet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 County and state health care experts say Great Beginnings has made a 
difference in public awareness. They point to Jones' subtle way of connecting 
the right people as a cornerstone of the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows . . . all those things one needs to get a major task done," said 
Great Beginnings co-founder Dr. Virginia Hunt. "She doesn't quit until it is 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
 "Zola has always been at the forefront in maintaining quality care in family 
planning," said Geri Nibbs, a nurse consultant for the state Department of 
Health Services who has known Jones for 15 years. "She has a way of pulling 
people behind her." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of eight children whose mother died when she was 12, Jones was 
raised by her father, who worked in a sawmill near Marion, Ala.  
</P>
<P>
 Life wasn't easy for this quiet girl who liked to read. But buoyed by love and 
faith and money from brothers and sisters, extended family, friends, neighbors 
and church, Jones received a nursing diploma from Grady Memorial Hospital 
School of Nursing in Atlanta. Later, she earned bachelor's and master's degrees 
in nursing and public administration from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She started nursing in a newborn nursery in a Cleveland hospital because she 
loved the tiny patients. They were cute and they didn't complain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one bitter winter, Jones followed friends west to warmer climes. She 
made her home first in Long Beach and then Hawthorne, devoting her off-duty 
energies to the nursing sorority Chi Eta Phi, the Council of Black Nurses and 
the Nurses Guild at Messiah Baptist Church in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give something back," she said. "I have always just thought I 
wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently she has. At her appreciation dinner at the Hilton, Jones received 
certificates of commendation from the public health services, the Assembly and 
state Senate, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the Inglewood City 
Council and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where I'm going to put these," Jones confided afterward with a 
laugh, pleased and a little embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she takes much time to worry about wall space. One problem eclipses 
all others. "Infant mortality is a major problem throughout the nation," Jones 
said, "but like Martin Luther King said, 'We shall overcome.' "

VENTURA ENROLLMENT MAY SWELL BY 200 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring enrollment at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge could rise by 
as many as 200 as students displaced from the earthquake-damaged classrooms at 
the college's main campus drive north for instruction, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes are scheduled to begin Monday at the tiny Ventura satellite campus, 
but students can register for Ventura courses until March 4.Administrators 
expect an influx of 100 to 200 new students in addition to the approximately 
1,300 full- and part-time students the campus normally enrolls, said Joyce 
Kennedy, director of the Ventura site. 
</P>
<P>
 Several classes still have openings, and two additional business courses have 
been added to the schedule, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although classroom space and parking at the building on Allesandro Drive have 
always been tight, the campus will be able to handle more students because the 
added classes will be taught during the day. Most Ventura campus classes are 
given at night, geared toward working adults pursuing upper-level classes to 
complete a degree.

FRAUD COMPLAINTS ON THE RISE, REPORTS D.A.; ENFORCEMENT: NEARLY 1,200 LETTERS 
POURED INTO THE CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT IN SANTA ANA LAST YEAR. PROSECUTORS 
SAY THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF SCAMS HAVE INCREASED AS THE RECESSION CONTINUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Last year, nearly 1,200 letters poured into the Orange County district 
attorney's office's Consumer Protection Unit. People complained about dishonest 
mechanics, unlicensed doctors, phony sale prices advertised by department 
stores and even a Huntington Beach taco stand that was accused of skimping on 
the beef in its "macho" burrito. 
</P>
<P>
 And prosecutors say the number of complaints has increased as Southern 
California's recession persists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like when the economy is slow, people are reaching a little harder 
for money," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane L. Shade. "You tend to see more 
scams." 
</P>
<P>
 Shade is one of two prosecutors assigned to the consumer protection unit, 
which files about 50 cases a year, cracking down on businesses big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, prosecutors collected a $310,000 settlement from Montgomery Ward, 
which was accused of falsely advertising that home furnishings were "on sale" 
when in fact the items were regularly sold at the "sale" price. Without 
admitting any wrongdoing, Montgomery Ward agreed to alter its practices and pay 
the civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit also prosecuted Thanh Son Tofu, a one-room, Garden Grove food company 
accused of selling tofu and other soy bean products manufactured under filthy 
conditions. Company officials have declined to comment about the lawsuit, which 
was filed in December. The case was later settled when the owners agreed to 
make improvements in their operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the companies targeted varies, but prosecutors say there is a 
common thread in the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the potential for harming a significant number of people in the 
community," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Gannon, who heads the consumer 
protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for instance, the consumer unit filed a lawsuit against a small, 
independently-owned gas station in Anaheim that was accused of rigging its 
pumps so that customers paid for a full gallon, but received less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been just one station, but since it had a high volume of 
distribution, the potential for shortchanging the public was very significant 
if left unchecked," Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, D&H Service Center, reached a settlement with the district 
attorney's office, and as part of the deal, they agreed to regular testing of 
its pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cases are potentially more dangerous. Prosecutors filed a lawsuit in 
March against an Anaheim X-ray center, alleging that employees performed 
mammography exams without properly certified equipment and that the center 
presented a potential health risk for hundreds of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Professional Imaging Medical Group has denied any wrongdoing, and the 
case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors Gannon and Shade, who work in the 8-year-old consumer unit, say 
they keep an eye out for a variety of abuses, including unfair or illegal 
business practices, false advertising and public health and safety dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer protection unit receives tips of business wrongdoing from 
government agencies as well as from citizens who feel they have been cheated. 
Because of the volume of complaints, the unit requires written statements sent 
to the Santa Ana office. Phone-in complaints are discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kaeni said she is glad she sent her complaint in October. Kaeni, a 
property manager for Pinnacle Holdings, a Newport Beach real estate company, 
said she placed a classified ad in a local newspaper about job openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after, Kaeni said, she received what looked like a bill from a company 
called Employment Classifieds, asking for several hundred dollars. Assuming it 
was the newspaper's invoice, Kaeni said she was prepared to pay it until a 
secretary read the fine print.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not a bill, but was a solicitation from another company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really aggravated and indignant to see the length someone went to to 
make it look like a bill," Kaeni said. "They even used the exact words from my 
add on their invoice. I'm glad the DA is going after these people. It's wrong 
what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Shade said she received nearly a dozen other complaints about the 
Santa Ana-based company, Employment Classified, USA. Shade said she filed a 
lawsuit against the company and that the case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's owner, Erica Kortje, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, consumer fraud complaints also are increasing, according to Senior 
Assistant Atty. Gen Herschel Elkins, who heads the state's consumer laws 
section in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are definitely going up. We now have consumer fraud units in more 
than half the state's 50 counties, including small ones like El Dorado and 
Contra Costa," Elkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to county budget cutbacks around the state, Elkins said, many consumer 
units have shrunk, while others, such as the one run by the Los Angeles County 
district attorney, have expanded because prosecutors have been able to juggle 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon, who has been head of Orange County's unit for nearly two years, said 
he hopes to add two or three more prosecutors to his office to meet the high 
volume of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from settlements collected from businesses is used to pay for 
investigations, to reimburse consumers who were ripped off and to contribute to 
Orange County's general fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year-veteran of the district attorney's office with stints in the 
homicide and sexual assault divisions, Gannon said said he enjoys the diversity 
of issues in the consumer unit compared to homicide, where "you always know the 
main witness will not be testifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Shade has worked for the district attorney's office for eight years, including 
handling juvenile and sexual assault cases. Shade said she receives "personal 
satisfaction" when working on cases that deal with health issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Shade settled the suit involving the Garden Grove tofu store, 
where employees allegedly sold tofu and soybean products that she said "may 
have become contaminated with filth." Shade said insects and rodents had been 
seen scurrying across the company's floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a victim of a crime in a traditional sense, at least you know 
you've been victimized because you might be injured or your car might be 
missing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But others violations are more subtle. People may never be aware that the 
food they eat or the vitamin they swallow is unhealthy." Where to Turn

practices, send a written complaint to:

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIND UNEARTHS FURIOUS DEBATE; ARTIFACTS: HANDLING OF BONES AT DIG 
ENTWINES SITE'S DEVELOPER, NATIVE AMERICANS, POLITICIANS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND 
ARCHEOLOGISTS. NOW DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS ASKED TO INVESTIGATE. 
</P>

<P>
 The place looks like little more than an abandoned work site now. 
</P>
<P>
 On a windy winter day, the heavy smell of damp earth rises from the ground. 
And amid an array of metal storage trailers, the landscape is dotted with piles 
of loosened dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always that way. Once, archeologists believe, this 7.4-acre site 
near the Bolsa Chica wetlands was a large village teeming with the life and 
culture of an ancient civilization. There, men and women, they say, spent 
significant portions of their lives doing the things that people have always 
done to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, in fact, the site has become what many describe as one of the 
richest archeological digs in the state, yielding an abundance of important 
Native American artifacts. Among them are hundreds of "cog stones" -- gear-like 
objects, the purpose of which remains a mystery. And two years ago, scientists 
unearthed several human-bone fragments purported to be about 8,000 years old, 
including a portion of a skull bearing a human-bored hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important site," said Patricia Martz, a professor of anthropology 
at Cal State Los Angeles, and chairwoman of the state Historical Resources 
Commission. "It's one of the very few we have from that time period." 
</P>
<P>
 The rub is that the place is smack in the middle of a controversial proposal 
for a multimillion-dollar development that would put 4,286 new homes near the 
wetlands. Thus the recent discovery, while delighting archeologists, has put 
the project at the center of a furious debate that has some City Council 
members calling for a grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue: Did the Koll Real Estate Group, which owns the property, properly 
handle and report the discovery of the bones, or did it try to cover up the 
find to safeguard building plans? The argument has drawn environmentalists and 
politicians already opposed to the project, archeologists with academic 
interests, state bureaucrats with laws to uphold and various factions of Native 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, about 60 angry Native Americans staged a protest on the 
steps of Huntington Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be manipulated and intimidated," said Jim Velasques, chief of the 
coastal Gabrieleno Shoshone tribe and one of the protest's organizers. "No more 
secrecy in a closed room; we want to know what's going on out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials say that the controversy is unlikely to derail the project 
entirely, it already has resulted in calls within the Huntington Beach City 
Council for a court injunction against the developer as well as the grand jury 
investigation. A recent hearing on the proposed development drew 600 residents. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Group, said, "We've abided by the 
law and followed all procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began last month when opponents of the project leaked to the 
press an internal memo written by a forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange 
County coroner's office to examine the bones found at the site in 1992. In the 
memo, Judy Myers Suchey, a faculty member at Cal State Fullerton, described the 
bones as "very old, approximately 8,000 years," and therefore of serious 
interest to archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn acknowledged Saturday that a number of other bones were found earlier at 
the site, but said she couldn't comment on their scientific importance. 
</P>
<P>
 What angered project opponents was that no mention of the 1992 find had been 
made in the county's draft environmental impact report on the project released 
late last year. "It's a significant omission," said Flossie Horgan, president 
of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which opposes the development on environmental 
grounds. "Our major concern is credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 According to those involved in the process, the omission resulted primarily 
from bureaucratic delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll company officials say that they reported the existence of the bones to 
the coroner's office -- as required by law -- in June, 1992, shortly after 
determining that the remains were human. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coroner's office could not confirm that date, but said 
that he was unaware of any attempt by the company to skirt the law. "They have 
cooperated fully," Jim Beisner, chief deputy coroner, said of the Koll 
company's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tom Mathews, director of planning for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency which oversaw preparation of the environmental impact report, 
said the latest archeological finds at Bolsa Chica were not mentioned in the 
document because studies to determine their scientific significance had not yet 
been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to put a letter from Judy Suchey to the coroner" in the 
environmental impact report, Mathews said. "That's not a report; it's her 
opinion, and I want to see how this information is interpreted by the 
scientific community." 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the bones being prepared by Nancy Whitney-Desautels, a 
state-certified archeologist hired by the Koll company, is expected to be 
released well in advance of the county Board of Supervisors' vote on the 
environmental impact report next fall, Mathews said. If she concludes that the 
Bolsa Chica bones are scientifically significant, Mathews said, that 
information will be included in the final impact report to be used as a basis 
for future decisions on issuing construction permits.  
</P>
<P>
 "It could significantly modify the project," Mathews said, adding that the 
developers conceivably could be forced to build around the archeological site, 
which constitutes only a small portion of the proposed 400-acre construction 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Such assurances, however, did little to mollify critics, some of whom have 
said they believe that the Koll company may have engaged in a cover-up. At a 
recent city hearing attended by 600 residents, in fact, those suspicions found 
voice in a motion by City Councilman Ralph Bauer, who requested a temporary 
restraining order against further disturbance of the site and calling for a 
grand jury investigation into the company's handling of the archeological 
finds. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me this is really significant," said Councilman David Sullivan, who 
seconded the motion. "Is the Koll company following the law? How much did they 
know about the significance of this site when they just went on doing their 
excavations?" 
</P>
<P>
 The motion was eventually tabled while the city's staff prepares a report on 
its legal ramifications. The matter is expected to be decided in about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, a new group of protesters has entered the fray: Native 
Americans who say they have been kept in the dark regarding the discovery and 
disposition of the bones of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has employed several Native American monitors since the project's 
beginnings. Recommended by various archeologists involved in the project, the 
three monitors, each representing a specific tribal group, have been on hand 
during all of the excavations at the site and subsequent discussions regarding 
the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, another group -- identified by the state's Native American 
Heritage Commission as the most likely descendants of the individuals whose 
remains were discovered at Bolsa Chica -- have challenged the right of the 
Koll-employed monitors to act on their behalf. "They don't speak for us," 
Velasques said. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of accepting a recent invitation by the Koll company to meet for a 
discussion on the disposition of their ancestors' remains, the group staged a 
protest Saturday morning. The protesters -- a few bearing signs such as "No 
Development; Respect Native Americans" -- listened to speeches denouncing the 
proposed project before watching a lively dance put on by a troupe of Aztecs 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greed has got to stop," said Cindi Alvitre, a Gabrieleno and director of 
a Native American maritime cultural society in Long Beach. "Who gave them the 
right to rape my ancestors? We are demanding an investigation of the crimes 
imposed on my people by the Koll company. Leave the land alone!" 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists, meanwhile, say they are eager to begin learning the lessons 
that the land may have to teach.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those lessons: What did these early Californians eat, what was their 
stature, how long did they live, what sort of medical problems did they have 
and were they rich or poor? 
</P>
<P>
 "This could fill a gap in our knowledge," said Constance Cameron, curator of 
the Museum of Anthropology at Cal State Fullerton. "When you haven't had the 
remains to study, you don't know much." 
</P>
<P>
 With development inching closer, however, the time may be short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once this site is gone," she said, "it's gone. It's a non-renewable 
resource."

COYOTE POPULACE PUTS PET OWNERS ON THE DEFENSIVE; WILDLIFE: RESIDENTS OF ORANGE 
HILLS FEEL UNDER SIEGE. COUNTY AND STATE OFFICIALS SAY IT'S A PROBLEM WITH 
HUMANS, WHO MUST LEARN TO COEXIST WITH THE WILY CREATURES.

<P>
 Humorist Mark Twain once referred to them as "the most friendless of God's 
creatures." 
</P>
<P>
 But as far as Lori Klunder and her neighbors in the hills of east Orange are 
concerned, the predators which have devoured scores of household pets over the 
last six months have friends in very high places. 
</P>
<P>
 When Klunder recently asked for help in ridding her neighborhood of coyotes, 
county animal control officials sent a pamphlet instead, telling her how to 
co-exist with the beast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a coyote problem," said Marie Hulett-Curtner, a public education 
officer with Orange County Animal Control. "It's a lack-of-human-awareness 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Klunder got virtually the same response from the state Department of Fish and 
Game, which refuses to trap the animals, which kill about a dozen pets every 
night in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost a cat to an automobile once," said Bob Schlichting, a Fish and Game 
spokesman. "But I don't think there should be a ban on automobiles."  
</P>
<P>
 Though wildlife officials don't know exactly how many coyotes live here, they 
say there is a "substantial" population that has adapted well to the urban 
environment. Their numbers have become increasingly visible lately, animal 
control officers say, because last year's fires cleared thousands of acres of 
underbrush, forcing the animals to seek new hunting grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The coyote, a relative of the fox and wolf, is the size of a medium-sized 
shepherd dog and weighs about 25 pounds. Largely nocturnal, it rarely hunts in 
groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes have long preyed upon pets in Orange County, though they seem 
especially active near foothills and adjacent to open spaces, wildlife experts 
say. In the past two years, Tustin, Villa Park and San Clemente have all been 
hot spots for coyote problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Klunder's community is now the latest victim. In the past four months, coyotes 
killed two of her cats, Bugsy and Bianca, and the telephone poles around the 
neighborhood are cluttered with signs from people desperately seeking 
information about their missing pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so heartbroken," Klunder said. "I don't want someone else to go through 
what I went through. And the problem is, it's getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 After Bugsy and Bianca were killed, neighbor Denise Harrison stopped letting 
D.D., her shaggy little Maltese, run around her fenced back yard. Harrison said 
she would feel safer if county animal control would "remove the coyotes to a 
place where they could live like they are supposed to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, whose townhouse complex abuts the foothills, said, "I've been 
hearing more and more coyotes lately. It's really terrifying and it's so 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 The best government agencies can offer, however, is simple and direct advice 
-- keep your pets indoors at all times. Other measures such as capture and 
relocation are usually prohibited by state law to protect the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials say cats are especially vulnerable to coyotes because 
cats often regard the predator as a dog and try to repel the attack by merely 
swatting the coyote across the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a cat tries that with a coyote," said Hulett-Curtner, "the coyote doesn't 
care and in the next instance it has the cat by the neck and that's the end of 
the story." 
</P>
<P>
 As coyotes become bolder about intruding into neighborhoods and back yards, 
Klunder fears a coyote might harm a human, particularly a small child playing 
alone outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials warn parents not to leave children unattended in areas where 
coyotes have been spotted, less than a handful of people are injured every year 
by coyote attacks. Dogs are considered a much greater threat to people. 
</P>
<P>
 To get rid of coyotes, their food supply must be cut off. Officials say that 
pets should be kept and fed indoors. Trash cans must be securely locked so 
coyotes cannot get into them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coyotes will leave an area if there is no food," said Hulett-Curtner. "It's 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 While Klunder and her neighbors say they will follow all the precautions, 
Klunder wants her her community to hire a professional trapper. But wildlife 
officials advise against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes are very difficult to catch, and those that are trapped are usually 
old, young or stupid, leaving behind the strongest and craftiest animals. Said 
Hulett-Curtner: "You actually alter the gene pool to help create a 
super-coyote."

ESCAPING ILLITERACY; EDUCATION: VOLUNTEERS TEACH COUNTY JAIL INMATES TO READ, 
OFTEN INSTILLING A DESIRE TO CONTINUE LESSONS AFTER RELEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They came after a long day at their regular jobs, ready for more work. Their 
tools this weeknight varied from People magazine to Reader's Digest to a 
literacy assessment test. 
</P>
<P>
 The three volunteers were from READ/Orange County, a literacy program of the 
Orange County Public Library. Their clients are inmates at the James A. Musick 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutors and students are part of a 2-month-old pilot project aimed at 
teaching inmates how to read. The program, Working for Inmate Literacy Now, was 
created soon after a 1993 study found that 82% of county prisoners are 
functionally illiterate in English, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the constant turnover in the jail population, we know it's hard to 
get them to be completely literate before their release," said Carol Ball, a 
49-year-old resident of Costa Mesa who is a field services coordinator for 
READ. "Our goal is not to teach them to read and write, but to teach them that 
they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers tested 990 inmates at all five county jails, about 20% of the 
average daily population, said Mercedez Julian, education supervisor of the 
correctional programs unit for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who spoke English, about 53% could not understand what they read, she 
said. Another 16% did not speak or read English as a first language and 13% 
could not read in any language. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night at Musick, volunteer Susan Landis, a 25-year-old office manager 
from Newport Beach, said she chose the People magazine to help her student, 
19-year-old Angel, because "it keeps his attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel said he has learned more from his eight weekly sessions with Landis than 
from 12 years in school. The inmates' last names were not revealed to protect 
their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-to-one deal, so I'm focused on what I have to do," Angel said. "In 
a classroom, there are so many distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous sessions, Landis and Angel have used other magazines and 
even horoscopes as learning tools, Landis said. All tutors are encouraged to 
personalize the sessions to make the students feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of adults learn differently," noted Ball, who said she is dyslexic and 
did not learn how to read until she was 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the average stay of an county jail inmate is 58 days, some students 
who have had only a few reading sessions before leaving jail have asked for 
READ contacts in the outside world, said READ literacy coordinator Scott 
Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success is that they're here and want to learn," Cheney said. "And it's 
great when they want to continue the lessons after being released." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program will run for four more months at Musick and the Theo Lacy 
Branch Jail in Orange. After that, it will be offered in the system's three 
other jails, Julian said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials decided to research literacy in their jail 
system after discovering that many inmates could not read well enough to take 
educational and vocational classes they were already offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The study included written exams and some simple oral tests, such as giving 
prisoners a label from a medicine bottle and asking them how they would 
administer a dose of medication to a child. Few could accomplish the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the pilot program began in January, officials conducted one-on-one 
interviews at the two jails. Theo Lacy has about 900 inmates and Musick has 
nearly 1,000, Julian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a prisoner decided to register for the pilot project, a volunteer from 
READ was matched to meet the inmate for two hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because space is limited to trailers at the jails, five students at Musick and 
four at Lacy are currently enrolled in the program, Cheney said. Each jail has 
two more inmates on waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to have too many people on waiting lists because we don't know 
when we'd have spaces open," he said. "We didn't want anyone to be waiting and 
then they'd get released before getting a tutor." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney said the program could offer more instruction if daytime tutors were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, a 20-year-old inmate working with Scott Dolan of Newport Beach, said he 
had been in special education classes all his life and did not learn anything

DANA PARSONS: PERFECT CLARIFICATION: 'I AM NOT A CROOK -- I WAS A VICTIM'

 Poor Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 How different modern American history would have been if old RMN had just been 
a little more savvy about human behavior, especially his own. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had, there would be no footnote beside his name as the only President 
ever to resign his office. No lingering stain from his role in covering up the 
Watergate break-in in 1972. No need to spend so much time rehabilitating his 
reputation over the final years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, imagine a Nixon who the public accepted, felt sorry for and, most 
important, understood.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Nixon's misfortune, however, to come along before the Menendez 
brothers, Lorena Bobbitt and Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Richard Nixon had known himself well enough to stand on the White 
House steps and, as the U.S. Supreme Court and the House Judiciary Committee 
closed in on him, yell out: "I'm a victim, dammit!" 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, that wasn't Mr. Nixon's style. His inner child was a 40-year-old guy 
with wingtips and a dark suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he had known that his place in history depended on it, maybe he would 
have probed his psyche and better understood the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Drat that Gerald Ford. If he hadn't pardoned Nixon, there would have been a 
trial. And who knows. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney: Mr. Nixon, your taped conversations suggest that you tried 
to hinder the investigation of the burglary at Democratic Party headquarters 
and that you were willing to pay hush money to the burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (dressed in Dockers, baggy sweater and tasseled loafers): May I share 
something with you? 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Surely. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: I've never shared this before, but I had a difficult childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: In what way, Richard? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: From the time I was in fourth grade, I was different than the other boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: How so? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: For one thing, I was shaving. Everybody made fun of me, especially for 
the way I dressed. I liked to wear white shirts and ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: I see nothing wrong with wearing a shirt and tie, Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: To a football game? 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: What else? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: May I have a tissue, please? This is not easy for me. 
</P>
<P>
 (Attorney hands him a box of Puffs.) 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: My father . . . was distant. We never talked that much. That must have 
done something to me, don't you think? (He begins to sniffle.) My mother was 
overly attentive and made me play the piano, so all the other guys called me a 
sissy. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Go ahead, Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (beginning to dab at eyes): One time in high school some of the guys 
invited me to go along on a kegger. I had never drunk beer except for that one 
time when they made me chug a whole bottle during lunch break. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Tell us what happened then, Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (sobbing): I came back and threw up in biology. Some of it got on the 
teacher, and he swatted me with a ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: How did that make you feel, Richard? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (nearly inaudibly): Like I was nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: And is that why, after you became President, you made a secret 
promise to get back at everyone who had ever done you wrong and to destroy the 
career of everyone you were jealous of? 
</P>
<P>
 (He nods, but is too distraught to speak.) 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Is that why you did all those unconstitutional and illegal things, 
Richard? Were you trying to tell people that you weren't a sissy anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (defiantly): Yes! I wanted people to know I had guts. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney (very softly): What happened at the Watergate, Richard? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (wailing): I knew everything! It was my idea! I wanted to go along on the 
burglary but everybody knew I was all thumbs so they wouldn't let me. But they 
let me drive the getaway car. (One final giant bellow.) I drove off when the 
others got caught! Oh God, I'm so ashamed! 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: You were there the night of the break-in, Richard? Is that what 
you're telling us? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN: I showed 'em. I showed 'em I had guts! 
</P>
<P>
 He breaks down on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Is there anything else you'd like to tell the American public, 
Richard? 
</P>
<P>
 RMN (composing himself and staring into the camera): Yes. I hope you can 
forgive me. I tried to be strong, but I couldn't take it anymore -- the names, 
the jokes, the cartoons showing me with the big nose and the jowls. I knew it 
was wrong to spy and eavesdrop and double-cross and burglarize and sabotage, 
but I just couldn't help it. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney: Thank you, Richard. You can step down now. I know this has been 
tough for you. 
</P>
<P>
 RMN steps down from the stand and looks out into a courtroom full of 
spectators, all softly crying. Spontaneously and in unison, they begin 
applauding.

SANTA ANA IS A BATTLEFIELD IN BILLBOARD WARS; ADVERTISING: WHAT CITY CALLS 
EYESORES THEIR OWNERS CALL FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. BUT THE COURTS WILL HAVE THE 
LAST WORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Wheeler shakes his head as he looks at the photograph in his hands. 
It's a glossy shot of the Bank of America billboard that sits 35 feet above the 
1100 block of South Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mega-beast," says Wheeler, a Santa Ana assistant city attorney. 
"It's taller than the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials, who want to boost their city's image, call such 
billboards eyesores. But the companies that put them up say the billboards are 
"unique forums for protected self-expression," and maintain the city is trying 
to run them out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has landed both sides in court, where outdoor advertising 
businesses have sued the city to keep their billboards standing. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are three billboards that were put up in the early and mid-1980. The 
city permits for each has expired and city officials have refused to renew 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 "Things are impossible in Santa Ana," said attorney Ronald Berg, who 
represents Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising, one of the three companies that 
have sued the city in Orange County Superior Court. "They have made one of 
their agenda items, in an informal manner, the removal of billboards." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard companies are fighting to keep the signs up -- or to make the 
city pay for taking them down. They want the city to pay them not just for the 
physical cost of signs, but for what the signs represent in advertising 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Santa Ana case, for example, one billboard expert enlisted by an 
advertising company estimated the value of a board at more than $1 million, 
Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials and attorneys say they don't have to reimburse companies to 
take down signs that are up illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they contend that the signs make the city look bad and can 
distract drivers on freeways. In past years, residents have passed out 
petitions to keep large billboards out of some parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call them 'outdoor advertising displays' . . . but they're big, ugly 
billboards," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Robert L. Richardson said the Bank of America billboard, one 
of the three in dispute, "adds nothing to the appearance of Harbor Boulevard."  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s and 1970s, many cities across the country pushed to remove 
billboards, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past 15 years, cities have had a hard time getting rid of 
billboards without compensating companies for them, although sign companies 
have been less successful in setting up new billboards, said Ronald Beals, a 
vice president and legal counsel at Gannett Outdoor Co. of California, an 
outdoor advertising firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County cities such as Westminster and Orange have passed 
ordinances to limit new billboards. The city of Orange is still embroiled in a 
federal lawsuit dating back to 1985 centering on its billboard policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana has not prohibited billboards, but has put restrictions on their 
size and location, city Planning Commissioner Glenn Mondo said. 
</P>
<P>
 'Whenever we have an opportunity, through rehabilitation, we try to get those 
things taken down as part of the package of improving the image of the city," 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no new billboards in the last three-plus years. They don't 
even apply" for permits for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has won one of the three pending billboard cases, but the 
ruling has been appealed. It is scheduled before the state 4th District Court 
of Appeal in Santa Ana on Feb. 22. Attorneys say the court's decision may set a 
precedent that determines whether a city must reimburse billboard companies for 
their lost signs, even if the signs were up illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 That case involves a Metropolitan Outdoor billboard that stands in the 200 
block of South Grand Avenue, with a permit that expired in 1989. When 
Metropolitan sued Santa Ana in June, 1992, to keep that board up, a Superior 
Court judge ruled in the city's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Billboard giant Patrick Media Group also has sued Santa Ana, asking that the 
city reimburse the company for the cost of the board on South Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising filed the third lawsuit. After Regency pulled its 
billboard off its support post in the 2000 block of South Ritchey Street, city 
officials said a new permit was needed to rebuild the structure more than a 
year later.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're very litigious," Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said about 
billboard companies. "I've got four or five boxes full of papers (from the 
Regency case alone). It's incredible."

HEADLANDS RESORT PLANS TO COME BEFORE COUNCIL; DEVELOPMENT: SINCE 1974, THE 
DEBATE OVER THE PROPOSAL HAS ESCALATED. DANA POINT WILL FINALLY HEAR THE PITCH; 
OPPONENTS PREPARE FOR A SHOWDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Be There," urge the bumper stickers popping up on local street signs in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The handwritten stickers announce that it is time for a showdown at City Hall 
on perhaps the most controversial development in the history of Dana Point, 
perhaps all of South County. 
</P>
<P>
 After countless hearings and public workshops on possible development 
proposals dating back to 1974, a plan for a $500-million luxury resort on the 
Headlands above Dana Point Harbor will come before the City Council on Tuesday 
night for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 A 400-room hotel, two commercial centers and 394 homes are being proposed for 
the 120-acre site, considered by developers one of the most desirable 
undeveloped coastal properties left in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the recent emergency listing of a peculiar Headlands fauna 
-- the Pacific pocket mouse -- as an endangered species is not expected to 
change the hearing process. The mice -- 39 hamster-like members of a rare 
species once thought to be extinct -- were discovered during an environmental 
survey for the proposed Headlands resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before that Feb. 1 listing, battle lines over the development project 
had been drawn between its proponents, who believe it will be an important 
source of long-term city revenue, and an array of environmentalists, who insist 
the land should remain in its pristine state. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists such as Gary Wright, a 32-year-old Dana Point surf shop 
owner, grew up enjoying the open land on the bluff-tops and the waves at its 
shores. He and others, including the South Coast Audubon Society and a local 
Sierra Club group, claim nothing less than a way of life is at stake in the 
development of the Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more of a vista on those bluffs than anywhere in the county, other 
than the Saddleback Mountains," Wright said. "There's a sense of adventure in 
that land, where you feel like you can get away from it all. I don't want to 
lose that." 
</P>
<P>
 Project backers, such as City Councilman Mike Eggers, say the city needs the 
project to pay for its future. The 5-year-old city of Dana Point relies on 
hotel taxes to make up about one-third of its $11-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 When the project is completed, Eggers said, "we are looking at about $2.5 
million annually in city revenues. That puts a lot of cops on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the Newport 
Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis Securities. Sherman, an early Los 
Angeles County developer known for Sherman Oaks, was also the founder of 
Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it was back in the 1920s that a resort was first planned for the site, 
which offers a 180-degree view of the coastline, said Edward M. Knight, Dana 
Point's director of community development. Since that time, the resort has 
undergone several evolutions, all under county or California Coastal Commission 
direction, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone one way and another way and this way and that, from a land-use 
standpoint," Knight said. "Now it's up to the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Eggers, who has not been shy about proclaiming his support for the 
project, council members have reserved their comments for the public hearings. 
The only hints on how the council might feel came in a public workshop last 
May, when individual members indicated they wanted more natural parks, more 
open space and no gated communities in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels of Laguna Beach, president of M.H. Sherman Co., said the 
project has been scaled down over the years after "unprecedented community 
input." Before Dana Point incorporated as a city, the Coastal Commission had 
approved a Headlands project with two hotels, where now there is one, 804 homes 
versus today's 394, as well as time-share condominiums and commercial sites, 
Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the latest proposal, the property will also be crisscrossed by public 
trails, have several lookout points and more than 34 acres of park land, 
Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, rallying around a "Save the Headlands" cry, are certain to 
lobby for more, however. Ken Fortune, 42, a director of the South Coast Audubon 
Society, said the financial arguments for development are weak, and as much of 
the land should be saved as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the wisdom of cashing in a natural resource on some vague promise 
of an economic reward," said Fortune, a San Clemente plumbing contractor. "It's 
a one-way deal. Once you trash it, you can't go back."

THREE INJURED AS TILES TOPPLE AT HOME DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three family members, including a 6-year-old boy, were taken to area hospitals 
Saturday after they were injured by boxed ceiling tiles that tipped over at a 
home improvement warehouse, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident took place about 4:30 p.m. at Home Depot at 601 Placentia Ave., 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman believed to be in her 60s was taken to the UCI Medical Center in 
Orange for her injuries, while a 6-year-old boy believed to be her grandson was 
taken to St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton for minor injuries. A man 
believed to be related to the other victims also was taken to St. Jude for 
treatment for minor injuries, firefighters said. Home Depot officials declined 
to comment about the accident.

CSUN'S LOSS TOPS COLLEGE DISASTERS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the long roll of disasters to American universities, last month's 
earthquake damage to Cal State Northridge appears to lead the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Although, if there were any Civil War era cadets of the Virginia Military 
Institute still around, they might debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many college catastrophes. Floods in 1904 put Michigan State 
University in East Lansing under water. Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., 
was damaged by a tornado in 1966, and Gulf Park College for Girls in southern 
Mississippi was inundated by Hurricane Camille in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 A 7.7 temblor rocked the Charleston, S.C., area in 1886. Buildings collapsed 
throughout the area, but The Citadel military college was virtually unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent runner-up to CSUN's quake damage is the Coral Gables campus of 
the University of Miami, where in 1992 Hurricane Andrew caused $12.5 million in 
destruction. But repairs at CSUN are expected to total 20 times as much, or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 If man-made disasters were included, however, VMI may have suffered the most. 
In June, 1864, the institute's 270 cadets played a key role in the Confederate 
victory at the battle of nearby New Market, plugging a hole in the southern 
line and mounting a charge that routed the Yankees. A few weeks later, with the 
South reeling toward defeat, a regrouped Union army targeted VMI, where dorms, 
classrooms and the library were all located in one huge, four-story building. 
The building was burned to the ground. It took the school a year to reopen.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; EMERGENCY TEAM MEMBERS WERE QUAKE HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dark hours following the area's most destructive earthquake, a 
little-known network of highly trained workers sprang into action to rescue 
people trapped inside their homes, perform first aid and generally lead and 
comfort anxious neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not firefighters or police officers -- they were ordinary citizens 
who are members of the Los Angeles Fire Department's Community Emergency 
Response Team program. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports indicate the teams performed very well in the crisis, but Fire 
Department officials say they want to get a full assessment of how the teams 
worked and learn how they can work better in the future. To this end, fire 
officials will be holding a debriefing and critique session for team members 
today, at 1 p.m. in the San Fernando High School gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first really big test of our system," said Assistant Chief Frank 
Borden. "We'll be looking for their experience to see if we can make the course 
more attuned to the realism of an event like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the program's budget was cut in half nearly three years ago, down 
from two eight-person training units to just one for the entire city. Borden, 
the head of the department's training and disaster preparedness division, said 
he hoped information gathered from the hearing would bolster the department's 
efforts to get the program fully funded. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of the disaster teams in some ways mirrored those of Neighborhood 
Watch groups, which lacked disaster preparedness training but nonetheless 
helped organize neighbors after the quake. The performance of the Neighborhood 
Watch groups, which are organized by the Los Angeles Police Department, 
surprised and delighted public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick introduced a motion Tuesday calling on the fire and 
police departments to create a new citizens emergency response program that 
combines the infrastructure of Neighborhood Watch and the expertise of 
Emergency Response. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that the emergency response teams are kind of dispersed 
throughout the different communities but are not connected as part of a 
community team," said Karen Constine, Chick's chief of staff. "What is taking 
place now is that the ERTs are being integrated into Neighborhood Watch so that 
the community can be self-sufficient in a time of disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the emergency program are trained in teams of 50, and 
generally come from the same geographic area. In the event of a disaster, team 
members are supposed to work as a coordinated group if they happen to be 
together, said Capt. Ron Jackson, who heads the Community Emergency Response 
Team unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants said they felt isolated from their fellow team members, so 
they acted alone or led untrained volunteers to respond to various problems 
that cropped up. Jackson said his program stresses independent action because 
often in a disaster, communication networks are scrambled anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some team members said their emergency training allowed them -- and 
their neighbors -- to be self-sufficient in the hours and even days after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 a.m. on the morning of Jan. 17, team member Paula Elefante called a 
neighborhood meeting on her front lawn. Like an Army commander reviewing a 
battle plan, the Reseda resident spread a tract map of the neighborhood on a 
card table and located pools from which water could be taken and used to flush 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few days, Elefante conducted seminars on water purification, 
arranged for barbecue grills to be used on a communal basis on various nearby 
streets, and provided emotional support to her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so grateful that I had the training, that I was able to share 
information and answer questions," said Elefante, 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge resident Cheryal Caron bandaged a deep gash on a neighbor's arm, 
and made her a makeshift sling from torn sheets. Earlier, the 36-year-old 
secretary helped rescue two disabled people from their homes. Caron and a 
neighbor pulled a fallen dresser and television set off a man who was hooked to 
an oxygen tank, and navigated a dark house littered with obstacles to reach an 
elderly woman who uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion (the training) probably saved my life," said Caron, who was 
pinned between her bedroom wall and a mattress upended by the quake. "If I 
didn't know anything, my instinct would have been to panic. I probably would 
have brought on a stroke or a heart attack. . . . Now that I have the training 
and I understand and know what to do, (earthquakes) don't scare me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Lang Springer knocked on every door on the third and fourth floors of 
his Woodland Hills apartment building, in some cases heaving stuck doors open 
to free the inhabitants inside. He helped many elderly people down the stairs 
and out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 When one aged woman complained of shortness of breath and chest pains, the 
29-year-old employee of a health maintenance organization recognized the 
symptoms of a heart attack. While another person called 911, Springer placed 
her on a couch, elevated her feet, covered her with a blanket and, before going 
to help others, directed some bystanders to stay with her and keep her calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that kind of situation, people tend to be real happy if anybody shows any 
kind of leadership," Springer said. "I was very directive in what I was saying 
-- that's what they tell you to do. You don't ask. You say, 'You need to do 
this.' 'Take this person down and do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Bob and Caryn Friedenthal of Beverly Glen got their children safely out 
of their wrecked house, they went from door to door to make sure their 
neighbors were OK. In some cases, they kicked in doors to allow people out, and 
shut off the leaking gas valves at almost every house on the street, Bob 
Friedenthal said. The owner of a computer supply company is a member of a 
community ham radio network, which he used to inform the Fire Department about 
gas leaks that they could not curtail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emergency Response Team program was started in 1988 by Councilman Hal 
Bernson, then-Mayor Tom Bradley and Fire Chief Donald O. Manning, and was 
inspired by a citizens disaster preparedness program that Bernson had 
encountered on a visit to Japan. During the past six years, fire officials 
estimate they have trained more than 10,000 people, about half of whom live in 
the Valley. Borden said he believed at least 1,000 to 3,000 of those trained 
actually used the skills they learned during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes run for seven weeks, 2 1/2 hours per week, and cover topics including 
earthquake preparedness, fire suppression, first aid, light search-and-rescue, 
disaster psychology, team organization and utility control. Many Neighborhood 
Watch participants have already taken the ERT course. The program has also 
trained significant numbers of business groups and government employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Elefante, the Reseda homeowner, who happens also to be a Neighborhood Watch 
block captain, thinks integrating the two programs is an idea whose time has 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a more effective way to get disaster preparedness to the community," 
she said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; PROJECT HOUSES VICTIMS WHO 'FELL THROUGH THE 
CRACKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Before the Northridge earthquake, Elizabeth Kasper lived modestly in a 
22-year-old mobile home in Newhall with her husband, Jeff, and their two 
daughters, Joy and Grace. 
</P>
<P>
 After the temblor knocked their trailer from its foundation, the Kaspers not 
only found themselves without a home -- they discovered they were ineligible 
for government housing assistance because their yearly household income, 
$29,500, was too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell through the cracks," said Elizabeth Kasper, 32. "We were not 
low-income enough, but we had no place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a new Salvation Army program, the Kaspers are now living better 
than ever -- in a two-bedroom condo in Sylmar with a vaulted ceiling, pool, 
Jacuzzi, and a private parking garage -- all for $86 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Project EARTH (Earthquake Aid for Relocation and Transitional Housing), 
the Salvation Army is helping to fill a void by leasing condominiums -- most of 
them in the San Fernando Valley -- and offering them for low rents to people 
made homeless by the quake. To qualify, the participants must earn between 50% 
and 80% of the median household income for Los Angeles -- too much money to 
receive government assistance, but too little to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, $43,000 is the median income for a family of four in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Any family displaced by the quake with a household income of less than half of 
the local median is eligible for housing subsidies through HUD's Section 8 
program. But Project EARTH coordinator Jerry Hill said thousands of displaced 
families in the Valley do not qualify for Section 8, yet also are too 
financially stretched to take out a government loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Project EARTH is meant as transitional housing, and anyone who stays in the 
condos longer than three months will pay a considerably higher rent. For a 
two-bedroom condo, for instance, the rent would jump from $86.40 to $518 for 
each of the following three months. The deadline for moving out completely is 
Dec. 31, Hill said.

<P>
 The program was created one week after the earthquake, but it took a while to 
get under way because the Salvation Army had to find apartments to lease. About 
100 people have applied to the program as of Thursday, and 18 have been 
accepted, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Salvation Army has leased 45 condos, all owned by HUD, in Pacoima, 
Arleta, Sylmar, Panorama City, Mission Hills, Canoga Park, Valencia and Van 
Nuys. They intend to lease 100 in all, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who call inquiring about Project Earth have usually been referred by 
HUD, the Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency, or other agencies 
unable to help them, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The application process involves filling out a one-page form listing the 
applicant's former address and landlord, their current job, their income and 
some form of identification. If they pass a brief review, they are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people are accepted into the project, Salvation Army workers try to place 
them at the apartment closest to their former home. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent-controlled Sherman Oaks apartment where Gloria Wilson, and her 
mother, Trudie, had lived for the past 17 years was condemned after the quake. 
They moved into a friend's home for two weeks, uncertain of what to do, until 
they learned about EARTH from a FEMA worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gone to FEMA, went through the whole rigamarole," said Gloria Wilson, 
24, a CSUN graduate student who works to help her mother pay the rent. "We were 
basically shoved around, sent from place to place, and we were finally told 
that we made too much money to be eligible for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating. You have no home, and the people who are supposed to 
help you say they can't. There are low-income people, and people who can start 
out again, but most people are like me. We're standard middle-class people. We 
work for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 At $31,000, the Wilsons' household income was far too high to qualify for 
government assistance, but still put them within EARTH's boundaries because 
they are supporting Earl Wilson, Gloria Wilson's retired father who also lives 
with them. The three Wilsons are now living in a two-story, two-bedroom condo 
in North Hills, and plan to stay there until they have enough money for rent 
and a security deposit somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris and Danielle Beck, who were married only three months ago, had only 
acquired a few joint possessions when the quake destroyed their Saugus 
apartment. Now they are living in a one-bedroom EARTH apartment in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a chance to save a little money, and replace some of the things 
we lost," said Chris Beck, 21, a student at Master's College in Santa Clarita. 
"She went out and bought a set of dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck and his wife both live on her $24,000 secretary's salary, which put them 
over the Section 8 housing level.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; FOR MANY, QUAKE HAS RATTLED CONFIDENCE IN 
PARKING GARAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the list of things shifted and set awry by seismic forces, add this: 
parking behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Back before the Northridge quake, folks would sell their children for that 
convenient covered space -- preferably next to the elevator entrance -- where 
the elements would not dull the resale value of their Lexus. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there's often a mini-rush for the top deck and other open-air spaces, 
out from under any floor that could collapse in the next quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently fueled by the repeated appearance of news photos and TV coverage of 
pancaked parking decks squashing parked cars to the thickness of a wallet, 
motorists appear to be crowding onto the previously undesirable top floor, or 
skipping garages entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, thousands of people haven't given parking much more than a second 
thought. But a random survey found plenty who do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirkka Manning wheeled her Pathfinder into a rooftop space at Media City 
Center in Burbank recently and all but bolted for the staircase down to the 
Ikea home furnishings store. 
</P>
<P>
 Could she be rattled by tremors? 
</P>
<P>
 "You got that right," she said. "That's why I'm off this thing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Once on solid ground, the Van Nuys resident tried to put her anxiety in 
perspective. "This is the first time on the top," she said. "Usually, I park 
underneath. When you see the parking structures that came down, it makes you 
wonder. I'd rather be on top than the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Stanton, an accountant leaving a meeting in Sherman Oaks, said cracked 
concrete and valet parking attendants in hard hats hardly inspired confidence 
in the McNeill Plaza garage, where drivers were not allowed to enter the 
parking structure themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, we had five people at our meeting this morning and three of them 
wouldn't park in here," even with the valets running the risk, Stanton said. 
"They parked on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Many top-deckers may be operating from fear alone, but they get some expert 
support. Helmut Krawinkler, a Stanford civil engineering professor and 
specialist in earthquake engineering, reluctantly acknowledged that he too 
might opt for a rooftop or open parking spot if he were in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if it's a blind shot, I would prefer to be on top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's good enough for Krawinkler, it's good enough for visitors to Universal 
Studios. Visitors there keep asking for parking spots out in the open, two 
parking attendants said. "We fill the open lots, but then there's no choice," 
said one, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Randel Urbauer tried hard to blame his wife for his choice of rooftop parking 
at Media City Center recently. "She brought up whether it was built on-site or 
precast," he said, displaying his newfound knowledge of garage construction 
techniques, and their seismic safety effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Urbauer eventually confessed that this parking anxiety was community 
property: "It's probably the first time we thought about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Shuken has no choice where she parks -- but wishes she did. She 
wheeled her Lexus LS 400 into a ground-floor garage on Ventura Boulevard in 
Sherman Oaks on Thursday morning, then walked out briskly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started working here yesterday and that's where I have to park," a shaken 
Shuken said. "I'm not happy about it. . . . If I didn't have to park in a 
parking structure, I wouldn't. My daughter works in the (Sherman Oaks) 
Galleria. I was such a wreck. I begged her not to park under there, and she 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound fear of the lower decks doesn't sit well with designers at The 
SyArt Co., which builds parking structures the way seismic-safety experts say 
is best -- using concrete that is poured in place, not precast. More than 40 of 
the firm's quake-zone structures held, and only two had any damage -- at 
Sherman Oaks Fashion Square and Northridge Hospital Medical Center -- said 
Karen Rappaport, a company spokeswoman. Both are standing, and none of the 
damage is critical, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 10 years, I've designed 43 (parking structures), all concrete, 
all of them standing up, all of them in service," said Moises Witemberg, 
president of Witemberg & Associates structural engineers, which designed many 
of the SyArt structures. "People should be afraid of being in residences." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still those who scoff at doom, such as John Elejalde, a New York 
City transplant who calmly left his Honda in a ground-level garage on Ventura 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't let the paranoia get to me," he said. "It's like a lot of 
paranoias, including drive-by shootings or carjackings. . . . L. A. has all 
kinds of paranoias."

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SURVIVOR OF APARTMENT COLLAPSE LEAVES 
HOSPITAL, REVISITS DISASTER SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A man who survived the collapse of the Northridge Meadows Apartments during 
the Jan. 17 earthquake drove by the complex, where 16 of his neighbors died, 
immediately after his release from a Burbank hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that I made it out of there alive," said Alan Hemsath, who was 
trapped for nearly seven hours in the rubble of his first-floor apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's literally on the ground," he added, after briefly surveying the 
apartment he once called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemsath, 37, a general contractor, had been in St. Joseph Medical Center since 
the earthquake, when the three-story building collapsed around him, pinning him 
to the kitchen floor. At the hospital, he underwent surgery to save his arms 
and legs, which were pinned down so tightly by debris that the blood flow was 
cut off for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Jan. 17, Hemsath said he was trying to get out of his 
apartment when the upper floors came crashing down around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My left arm was pinned by an electrical panel. It didn't crush a bone, but it 
flattened my arm like a pancake," Hemsath said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has regained use of his legs and although he said it's painful, Hemsath can 
walk with the help of a cane. However, he has almost no use of his left arm and 
said that he has no idea if he will recover completely.  
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a week, a month, or never," he said the doctors told him. 
</P>
<P>
 He will continue with physical therapy while staying at his parents' home in 
Northridge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemsath said he was awakened at 4:31 a.m. on the morning of the earthquake by 
the noise of falling objects and the apartment complex crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bam! I woke up and my bed galloped like a horse and I was thrown out of bed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemsath, who was alone, opened the bedroom door and ran until he tripped and 
fell on his stomach with his nose pushed against a door. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head hit the door and I felt like I was going unconscious," he said. "I 
said a prayer and realized that I was conscious. Then I decided that I was just 
going to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he heard a man's voice he did not recognize, crying out "Help! 
Help." Then suddenly, he said, there was total silence. He heard nothing other 
than traffic on the street outside until his alarm went off at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was comforting because I knew what time it was and I knew the world, it's 
going to be up and about," Hemsath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited and waited. Thinking about seeing my family again was what kept me 
going. It's not the way I wanted to leave. It seems like an unfair way to die, 
no warning, no time to make preparations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks were creepy, he said. "The creaky noise, the debris falling 
down -- that was weird. I couldn't move so I shook with the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours into his ordeal, he heard a firefighter's voice and called out to 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely relieved. I knew I was going to make it," Hemsath said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took awhile for his rescuers to locate him. Meanwhile, he said he sang 
the alphabet to direct them. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of sawing and cutting through concrete and wood, a rescue team 
freed Hemsath. 
</P>
<P>
 A native Californian, Hemsath said he doesn't plan to move out of the area 
anytime soon, but said he won't live in a three-story apartment again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not beaten yet. I showed them this time," he said. "I am not one to 
run."

TEEN PLAYING WITH GUN FATALLY SHOT HIMSELF, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Santa Ana youth who ignored a friend's warning about playing 
with a loaded weapon died Saturday after accidentally shooting himself in the 
head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's name was not released because the victim's relatives had not 
yet been notified, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. John Follo. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place about 5:45 p.m. at the teen-ager's home in the 700 
block of West Bishop Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Follo said the teen-ager was showing off a new gun to a friend, Javier Paramo, 
20, of Santa Ana, and jokingly pointing the weapon at his own head when Paramo 
told him not to play with the weapon. Moments after Paramo left the room, he 
heard a gunshot and returned to find his friend with a fatal gunshot wound to 
the head, Follo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real tragic situation," Follo said, adding that authorities are 
investigating the shooting to find out where the youth obtained the weapon. 
Follo said Paromo's version of the shooting was confirmed by other witnesses.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; 4 MILES OF SIMI FREEWAY WILL REOPEN MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four miles of the Simi Valley Freeway closed by last month's Northridge 
earthquake will reopen in time for the Monday morning commute, Caltrans 
officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway will reopen between the San Diego and Foothill freeways, along 
with most of the connectors linking the Simi Valley with the Foothill, Golden 
State and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 However, ramps connecting the southbound Golden State to the eastbound Simi 
Valley, and linking the northbound and southbound San Diego to the westbound 
Simi Valley freeway will continue to be closed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans on Saturday also announced that the Golden State Freeway between 
Lyons Avenue and Roxford Street, both northbound and southbound, will be closed 
for quake-related bridge repairs periodically during the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
 From 11:30 p.m. Monday until 5 a.m. Tuesday, and again from 11:30 p.m. Tuesday 
until 5 a.m. Wednesday, southbound auto traffic will have to exit at Lyons and 
detour along San Fernando Road to the Antelope Valley Freeway before rejoining 
the Golden State at Roxford. Depending on progress of the work, the same 
closure may be in effect from late Wednesday night to early Thursday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hours of the closure, southbound truck traffic will have to exit at 
California 138 and detour to the Antelope Valley Freeway before rejoining the 
Golden State at Roxford. Trucks traveling south from Bakersfield may be better 
off taking California 58 to the Antelope Valley Freeway and take the Golden 
State Freeway at Roxford, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound closure will affect the same stretch of the Golden State during 
the same hours, but is scheduled to begin Wednesday night. Northbound autos 
will join the Antelope Valley Freeway at Roxford and take San Fernando Road 
back to the Golden State at Lyons. At Roxford, northbound trucks will take the 
Antelope Valley Freeway to California 138 or 58.

POLICE SEEK ATTACKERS WHO SHOT 2 IN A CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police here are searching for several people who shot into a crowd outside a 
dance party late Friday night, injuring two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Santa Ana man and a 17-year-old Anaheim youth received gunshot 
wounds to the upper body and were taken to a local hospital, said Newport Beach 
Police Sgt. Andy Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said the pair's wounds are not life-threatening, but both youths will 
probably remain in the hospital for a couple of days. Police did not release 
the victims' names or the name of the hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 An altercation took place about 11:30 p.m. at the Plaza de Cafes, a food court 
at 4881 Birch St. near John Wayne Airport that occasionally opens as an 
after-hours music hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said the fight broke out inside the auditorium-size building as several 
hundred Orange County teen-agers and young adults were dancing. The fight, 
involving several dozen people, then moved outside, where multiple shots from a 
handgun and a shotgun were fired, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably had multiple suspects firing randomly at a crowd of people 
without provocation, and that is pretty consistent with gang-related shootings 
that have happened elsewhere in the county," Gonis said. "That is our suspicion 
at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for a Latino man, approximately 18 years old, with a 
mustache, and a black sedan, possibly a Ford Thunderbird, that may have been 
involved. Descriptions of the others were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Newport Beach 
Police Department at (800) 550-NBPD.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; ANXIETY LINGERS FOR VICTIMS OF RUPTURED 
PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the Northridge quake, Rachel Hayes has tried to convince her 
3-year-old daughter Rosanna that it is safe to leave her aunt's house in Lake 
Elsinore and return to her home on Wolfskill Street in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subject only brings back terrifying memories for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "She still cries on the phone when we talk to her," Hayes said. "She says 
'Mommy, clean up the house, but move it away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like many residents on this quiet street, Rosanna's quake anxieties were 
aggravated by memories of the nightmarish explosions and fires caused by a 
quake-ruptured oil pipeline under Wolfskill Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Now added to that anxiety are the less emotional concerns of some about the 
headaches of reaching damage settlements with the pipeline owners. 
</P>
<P>
 After igniting, the crude oil fueled two massive walls of flame that raced 
down the street and put some in mind of an earthly hell. The blaze injured one 
man, destroyed a house, damaged three other homes and burned 17 vehicles and 
dozens of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake, that's no problem," said Hayes, a discount store employee. 
"But that and the street being on fire. . . it was too much." 
</P>
<P>
 For several of Hayes' neighbors, the fears will persist as long as the 
1920-era pipeline owned by the Atlantic Richfield Co. continues to operate 
beneath Wolfskill Street and near adjacent O'Melveny Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are scared that another quake is going to come along and burn the house," 
said Luz Becerra, who watched a car catch fire and explode in front of her home 
on the corner of Wolfskill Street and Rincon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hope of preventing future disasters, officials from Los Angeles and the 
neighboring city of San Fernando are trying to get the pipeline moved out of 
the neighborhood and away from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who witnessed the fire that I witnessed a half hour after the quake 
would (question) why we have pipelines in residential areas," said Los Angeles 
City Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the Wolfskill Street 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the rupture, Alarcon on Friday called for a moratorium on new city 
agreements to operate such underground pipelines in the city until an 
investigation into the Wolfskill Street rupture is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, life on the street is slowly returning to normal. The ruptured 
pipeline was patched up, the scarred street has been partially paved over and 
the city has rebuilt the charred and oil-stained gutters and sidewalks. Arco 
officials said they plan to reopen the line by late March. 
</P>
<P>
 While many residents have settled their damage claims with Arco, others 
criticize the petroleum firm for trying to rush them into accepting an offer 
that they say may not adequately cover their damages. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the roof of the single-story, stucco home that Alejandro Castillo 
and his family share on the corner of Wolfskill Street and Amboy Avenue was 
charred in the fire and is now covered with a plastic sheet to keep out the 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo said contractors have estimated the damage at about $60,000, but he 
said Arco has only offered $13,000. Furthermore, he said his family has been 
asked to sign a waiver, freeing Arco of responsibility for future health 
problems caused by the rupture. He said he is reticent to do so because he and 
his six family members have suffered headaches in the week after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they were going to compensate everyone for their damages," he said. 
"But the catch is you have to sign a release." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Duran, who lives a few doors away from Castillo, said she has not yet 
settled with Arco either -- for the smoke damage and oil stains in her house -- 
because she did not want to waive her rights to claim future health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her family, including her 74-year-old mother, suffered rashes 
and coughs in the week after the rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just wanted us to sign off right there," Duran said in an exasperated 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spokesman Scott Loll denies that his firm has asked residents to give up 
their rights, saying the residents who settle property damages do not 
necessarily waive the right to file future health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked our adjusters to work with the people in the community," he said. 
"It's our intention to look at each claim individually." 
</P>
<P>
 Arco does have deadlines for offering the settlements, he said, but is willing 
to work with people who need more time to settle the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Loll said Arco is willing to consider moving the pipeline, if city officials 
help the company acquire new rights-of-way. But Alarcon said he is reluctant to 
simply move the line to another residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The break was one of eight ruptures on a 35-mile span of the pipeline, which 
carries crude oil from Kern County oil fields to Los Angeles refineries. 
Another rupture killed hundreds of fish and other wildlife in the Santa Clara 
River in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local fire investigators attribute the breaks to the pipe's age -- 
it was installed in 1925 -- and to the use of welds made with acetylene 
torches, which are not as strong as modern arc welds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the crude oil in the line was not being pumped through the pipeline 
at the time of the quake, witnesses say it only took a few minutes for oil to 
fill the gutters on two sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators remain unsure how the oil became ignited, but some 
neighbors say the fire started with a spark or backfire from the exhaust pipe 
of a car seen speeding through the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out on the street and we saw the oil come down the street," said 
Sylvia Esperanza, Becerra's sister. "Then we saw the car go by and the fire 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene that ensued was described by witnesses as resembling a vision of 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames that reached as high as the telephone wires raced down the street for 
three blocks. Cars and trucks parked along the street "popped like popcorn," 
said one resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious injuries were to Arturo Rodriguez, 21, who was burned over 
25% of his body after he tried to ride his motorcycle through the oil. He was 
released Friday from Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really ugly," said Anastasio Gallegos, a retired carpenter who fought 
the flames with a garden hose from the roof of his house. "I thought it was the 
end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat from the blaze was so intense that it singed trees and plants in 
Gallegos' garden and melted the bumpers and brake lights on two of his cars 
parked in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 While his damage was relatively minor, Gallegos said he is worried about 
whether the pipeline that runs a few feet in front of his house can fuel a new 
disaster in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is not with the earthquakes; it's down here," he said, pointing 
toward Wolfskill Street.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; BUSY SHERMAN OAKS STREET SILENCED BY QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharon Cooper would give her eyeteeth just to hear the music again -- those 
same loud rock 'n' roll songs that blared from the apartment complex next door, 
driving her and her tenants so crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 But what years of arguing among apartment managers could not resolve, the 
Northridge quake took care of in a day when it wreaked havoc on the neighboring 
building, triggering its tenants to flee and take their tunes with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an eerie feeling when there is no noise," said Cooper, who manages the 
Villa Bonita Apartments on Willis Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now abandoned buildings like the one next to Cooper's place dominate Willis 
and authorities estimate that 80% of the street's more than 500 apartment units 
and condominiums will have to be rebuilt at a cost of at least $24.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scenario is being played out on countless streets throughout Sherman 
Oaks, where building inspectors have red-tagged 3,000 apartments and condos and 
where damage has caused postal officials to stop delivery to more than 11% of 
the community's 29,000 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and other residents who survived last month's disaster and chose to 
stay on Willis described their avenue before the quake as a bustling community 
with car-packed curbs and sidewalks that led the street's condo and apartment 
owners to nearby Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most desirable streets in Sherman Oaks," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a minute on Jan. 17, the neighborhood's appeal all but vanished 
for hundreds of Willis residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Boards, fences and red tape now decorate apartment facades on Willis which, 
before the quake, attracted residents with its appealing location -- near major 
freeways, movie studios and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner, some of the same businesses where Willis residents used to 
run their errands and grab a bite to eat remain boarded-up and closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the quake, residents jammed the street with moving vans as they 
prepared to flee their homes with the National Guard standing by to prevent 
looting. Recalling the chaos, Willis dwellers spoke of elderly neighbors, whose 
homes survived the quake, watching the mass evacuation from their lawn chairs 
and looking on as fights broke out over parking spaces for moving vans. Some 
said they saw couples cry as they packed their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Rothhammer, who moved out of his red-tagged condo to a nearby rental 
unit the second day after the quake, said the atmosphere on Willis that morning 
scared him as much as the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been nuclear war," Rothhammer said. "Tempers were running very 
high and the sense of desperation was running even higher." 
</P>
<P>
 An eerie silence has replaced the sounds of life that had echoed up and down 
the street just a week before. Willis has become so desolate that it is "rare 
to see a man out walking his dog," one resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the migration, Cooper is baffled as to why so few of her neighbors 
who fled their homes chose to move into the dozen empty units in her building, 
which was among those found to be safe. She joins other apartment managers 
throughout Sherman Oaks whose buildings were able to withstand Mother Nature's 
wrath, but who must now search for tenants to fill units vacated by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea where the people went," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Andy Dorfman, say enough is enough. Dorfman says he's had it and 
does not plan to return to Willis. Dorfman, who lived in a third-floor 
apartment in the 4600 block of Willis, said he spent the first week after the 
quake in a hotel before deciding to move into a duplex in the Burbank 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a really bad feeling from what happened there," Dorfman said. After 
the quake, Willis was "not a pleasant place to be and now it strikes me as a 
desolate place to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents say they want to return regardless of Willis's abandoned state 
and the potential of another earthquake because the street remains home to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the owner of my condo that, if the building can be fixed, I will go 
back," Milton Silver said. "When you're almost 76 years old, it doesn't really 
matter that much more" where you live, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Silver has rented a guest home four blocks away from the 
condominium he had rented on Willis for a little more than a year. With only 
about half the space his condo had, Silver said his new place leaves him 
yearning for the old residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for everybody involved, including myself," Silver said. "That 
apartment was my security blanket." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some residents, like Rothhammer -- who owned a condo in the same 
building where Silver rented -- face no choice but to stay and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 With no earthquake insurance, Rothhammer said he and his neighbors plan to 
apply for a $1.5-million, low-interest federal loan that will cost each owner 
of the 33-unit building roughly $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothhammer was married in December and was on the verge of purchasing a new 
home and starting a family when the quake hit, forcing him to put his life's 
plan on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a disaster has struck and I'm in the middle of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Willis, Steve Sturman reflected on the effect of the quake on his home 
and community. He shares Rothhammmer's sense of defeat, but says he too will 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sturman's condo was one of the few buildings to receive a green tag from 
building inspectors. Yet the inside of his once-showcase home has been in ruins 
since the quake shook his 750-book collection to the floor along with the 50 
paintings of his art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates 90% of his possessions were destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like my life started on Jan. 17, because I now have nothing that 
validates my past," Sturman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escaping his home provides little solace for Sturman, who describes his 
neighborhood to friends and family as "Sarajevo, Calif., without the gunfire 
and the deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only was my home destroyed but my neighborhood was, too," Sturman said. 
"I'm just waiting for a plague of locusts to land next." 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs from Sturman, Hannah Glickman wears her optimism with the same ease 
that Sturman wears his devastation. She remains confident that life will return 
to her beloved neighborhood, which she predicts "will be better than before" 
once the buildings are refurbished and filled with tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll feel as good as a new hairdo," she quips.

3 MEN HELD AFTER DRUG LAB FOUND IN ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three San Fernando Valley men were arrested Saturday on suspicion of 
manufacturing methamphetamine in a makeshift lab in the Antelope Valley, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A property owner on a routine tour of his land discovered a new shed and what 
looked like a group of men cooking chemicals, said Lt. Ron Shreves of the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived, the men were gone, but remnants of a narcotics lab 
remained inside the shed, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, two of them brothers, were later arrested on the Golden State 
Freeway near Roxford Street in Sylmar and were held in lieu of $500,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Luis H. Rios, 34, of Lake View Terrace; Miguel H. Rios, 32, of 
San Fernando, and Gustavo Becerra, 48, of Van Nuys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies seized an undisclosed amount of what appeared to be 
narcotics in the lab and in the suspects' vehicle, Shreves said.

$15 MILLION URGED FOR SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental coalition led by The Wilderness Society Saturday called on 
Congress to provide $88 million to acquire park and wilderness areas in 
California during the next fiscal year, including $15 million for the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by 38 conservation groups said the wildfires that roared through 
the Santa Monicas last fall may increase opportunities "to purchase undeveloped 
portions of canyons, key wildlife corridors and trailways," in the recreation 
area, which extends from Griffith Park in Los Angeles to Point Mugu State Park 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends federal purchases next year in 35 areas in California -- 
including Big Sur, Lake Tahoe and Cleveland National Forest -- but calls for 
more money for the Santa Monicas park than for any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Bray, information officer for the recreation area, said a $15-million 
appropriation would help with critical acquisitions, including at Paramount 
Ranch in Agoura and along the Backbone Trail -- a path along the spine of the 
mountains that Bray said will be "nationally significant once it's completed." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which seeks funding for hundreds of conservation projects 
nationwide, is a yearly rejoinder to the more modest requests contained in the 
President's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $1.52-trillion budget plan for fiscal 1995 he unveiled last week, 
President Clinton called for using $254 million for conservation projects from 
the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, a pool of money derived mainly 
from oil and gas royalties from offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilderness Society and its allies, including the National Audubon Society 
and Friends of the Earth, called for tapping $800 million next year from the 
fund, which typically amasses about $900 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 G. John Roush, president of The Wilderness Society, called the Clinton 
proposal inadequate, warning that "time is running out for America's last 
undeveloped lands. Every year there are more people, more development schemes, 
more dollars chasing these special places."  
</P>
<P>
 "If we put off these purchases," Roush said, "we're going to lose a lot of 
these areas. Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between the conservationists' wish list and the Clinton budget is not 
so great as it was last year, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, this time Clinton proposed $5 million for the Santa Monicas park, 
but sought no funding for it last year, when the conservation groups 
recommended $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress eventually approved $4 million for the mountain park for the fiscal 
year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by Congress in 1978, the national recreation area is actually a mosaic 
of public parks, preserves and beaches, interspersed with private holdings. The 
National Park Service, which administers the area, to date has acquired 20,493 
acres of the 35,000 acres it eventually hopes to own. The California Department 
of Parks and Recreation and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy also have 
significant holdings in the area.

O.C.'S BERGESON HAS PROVED A CAPITOL ASSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She has become, by way of 16 years of dogged effort and persistent success, an 
Orange County institution in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's moving a balky bill or bringing home the bacon, state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) has long been counted as Orange County's most 
effective lawmaker at representing the region's interests in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the longtime legislator is expected to vacate her Senate seat and move 
back to Orange County -- if she can capture a job this year on the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the lobbyists and locals who consistently count on Bergeson for help in 
the Legislature, that's bad news. They face the grim prospect of life without 
Marian, and many suggest the county's clout in the Capitol will be badly 
eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other legislators have certainly helped over the years, but not 
to the extent Marian has," said Christie McDaniel, chief of staff for Orange 
County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. "There is a concern about who will step 
forward and take her place." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members, city officials, university leaders, transportation 
experts and others around Orange County express similar worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a big loss," said John F. Dean, Orange County superintendent of 
schools. "We would miss her voice in Sacramento. For education, there's nobody 
on the scene who can be nearly as strong, and we need that desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bergeson's Democratic opponents in the Capitol suggest that her 
anticipated departure will hurt the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Bergeson is as responsible a legislator as we have in our state," said 
state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), longtime Senate Democratic leader 
before he stepped down last month. "Orange County's gain of a supervisor will 
be Orange County's loss in the Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Bergeson doesn't see a possible departure in dire terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone is indispensable," she said. "But whatever happens with 
me, I do think it's important in Orange County to make a conscious effort to 
recruit people for the Legislature who have public service as their bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Bergeson would prove to be a double whammy for Orange County. 
While her departure remains contingent on her winning the supervisor's seat 
being vacated by the retiring Riley, Orange County is certain to lose 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg, a Garden Grove Democrat who is making a run for state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Bergeson has one opponent in the 5th District race, Laguna Hills 
businesswoman Madalene Arakelian, who has pledged to raise at least $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a relative newcomer in Sacramento, Umberg has enjoyed strong 
legislative support in the Democrat-controlled Assembly from peers eager to 
ensure his success -- and keep a toehold in the Republican bastion of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the Angst over the looming legislative void, some see hope. They suggest 
that Bergeson the county supervisor would act as a bridge between Orange County 
and the state Capitol, making regular phone calls and forays to Sacramento to 
push local interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The positive things she has going for her aren't going to be entirely lost up 
here," said Dennis Carpenter, a powerful Sacramento lobbyist whose clients 
include the County of Orange and the Orange County Transportation Authority. 
"As a member of the board, she'll be able to use all the relationships she's 
developed when she comes back to plead the county's case." 
</P>
<P>
 But such influence can only go so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're no longer a voting member in the Legislature, you lose some 
ability to be a player at the statewide level," said Christopher Kahn, 
Bergeson's chief of staff. "If she is elected as a supervisor, it would be 
difficult for her to have as major an influence on the legislative and budget 
process as she has enjoyed in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Some remain optimistic that Orange County's other state lawmakers -- an 
ideologically conservative bunch who can be more adept at blocking legislation 
championed by the Democratic majority than shepherding laws of their own -- 
will step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't view this as a huge loss for the region," said Larry Thomas, 
spokesman for the Irvine Co., the giant Orange County property development 
firm. "Marian will remain very well connected in Sacramento, and I think the 
power will eventually move over to those still in the delegation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists and state lawmakers note that Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) 
has been able to use his cachet as a former Assembly Republican leader to push 
through some important bills. Since moving over from the Assembly three years 
ago, Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has more aggressively championed new laws. 
Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), an avuncular sort popular among members 
of both parties, has also proven effective at moving bills. 
</P>
<P>
 New state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) has quickly moved into a position of 
GOP leadership. Though he seems more focused on politics than policy, Hurtt 
gets credit from county officials for helping open a special Orange County 
office to speed the issuance of state regulatory permits for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) has assumed the No. 2 
spot in the Assembly Republican hierarchy, and is becoming an increasingly 
savvy Capitol player. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for someone who can compete in the same league as Marian in 
terms of effectiveness, it's Curt Pringle," said Kevin Sloat, Gov. Pete 
Wilson's deputy chief of staff and a former top aide for Bergeson. "As Curt 
moves up in the leadership, it will only help." 
</P>
<P>
 But some are not so generous with their praise of delegation members other 
than Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Bergeson gone, I'd say Orange County will be in pretty desperate shape 
in Sacramento -- basically absolutely devastated," said one longtime lobbyist 
who asked not to be named. "Ross Johnson and Gil Ferguson and those types are 
strong leaders in their segment of the Republican Party, but they have a hard 
time transferring it to effective legislative production, and they're not much 
interested in it. Their job is to stop things from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to show its plight to the Orange County delegation, the Board of 
Supervisors held a pair of informal "round tables" with state lawmakers last 
year. The sessions "opened eyes" on the plethora of issues affecting county 
government, McDaniel said. "We're hoping those meetings will help us segue into 
this new era for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some say Bergeson will be impossible to replace -- in no small part 
because of the state's new term-limit law. Under that rule, Assembly members 
can serve three two-year terms, and state senators are restricted to two 
four-year terms. With the clock ticking, lawmakers now lack the longevity to 
develop the close working relationships that Bergeson was able to cultivate 
with her peers during 16 years in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anyone stepping in and accomplishing the things Marian has," 
Pringle said. "Much of it is simply due to who she is. But also with term 
limits, we just won't see people develop power like Marian has." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the years have seen Bergeson earn a solid measure of respect 
throughout the corridors of the Capitol. The woman dubbed "Marian the 
Librarian" when she first arrived in Sacramento was named in a 1992 Capitol 
Journal survey as the second most effective Republican in the Senate, right 
behind GOP leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), and fourth overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, the county's lobbyist who served as a state senator from Orange 
County for nearly a decade, said the loss of Bergeson would hurt the county in 
two areas where help is needed most -- transportation and local government 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop somebody else in the delegation who is interested in those 
things," Carpenter said. "They're not terribly sexy, but they're important to 
the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson and Umberg are the only Orange County representatives with spots on 
the Legislature's transportation committees. As Orange County continues its 
most ambitious freeway building effort in 30 years, the departure of Bergeson 
would leave the county without a voice inside the Capitol on transportation for 
the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having Marian up there would be an extraordinary loss for us," said Stan 
Oftelie, Orange County Transportation Authority chief executive. "It's in the 
day-to-day work of government that she does such wonderful stuff for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of the Senate Local Government Committee, Bergeson is in a 
unique position to attend to bills that have the interests of Orange County and 
its cities at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Often those efforts are the legislative equivalent of slogging through the 
trenches -- sweating the details on funding formulas for special districts, 
poring over records on financing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it takes two or three years to accomplish a goal," noted Bergeson. 
"And generally those tough types of issues usually aren't the headline 
grabbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson has shown an aptitude for taking on fights that seem like losers from 
the beginning, and then somehow scoring a victory. After Newport Beach was sued 
by a swimmer who broke his neck by diving into a sandbar, Bergeson fought an 
uphill battle for a law limiting government liability in beach accidents. In 
the end, she won. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told in the beginning that we'd never get it," she recalls. "But it 
was never a question of compromise. You've got to be willing to know enough 
about an issue to influence others." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson also has proven to be a tiger in fighting for the county's share of 
the legislative pork barrel. She was instrumental in getting money for the 
$5-million restoration and dredging of the ecologically sensitive Upper Newport 
Bay wetlands, as well as $1.5 million in state funds to rebuild the 
storm-battered Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator, whose term expires in 1996, often elbows in as a referee during 
intergovernmental disputes. In a recent example, Bergeson pressured the 
California Coastal Commission to sit down with Orange County cities to resolve 
a tussle over beach curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been extremely successful at mediating those kinds of fights," said 
Kenneth J. Emanuels, a Sacramento lobbyist who represents the cities of Santa 
Ana, Irvine, Laguna Beach and Tustin. "That just isn't a role any of the other 
Orange County legislators have developed." 
</P>
<P>
 On some fronts, however, there are signs of the torch being passed. For the 
past four years, Bergeson has tried to push through a bill that would allow 
Orange County to save money by contracting out services such as janitorial work 
and tree trimming. Although she was rebuffed by lawmakers sympathetic to 
organized labor, the fight will continue. Pringle is taking over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But many officials lament that such efforts will be the exception rather than 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be harder to accomplish our objectives in Sacramento without Marian 
there," said Ernie Schneider, county chief administrative officer. "We'll just 
have to work harder. That's what it boils down to." Marian Bergeson's Legacy 
</P>
<P>
 If elected to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson would leave behind a 16-year legacy in Sacramento as one of the 
county's more successful state lawmakers. She has earned high marks and pushed 
through several key bills during her tenure. Bergeson's biggest failures have 
been getting rebuffed twice in attempts for statewide office.

OFFICIALS WARNED YEARS AGO OF 757 TURBULENCE DANGER 
</P>

<P>
 As he prepared for final approach into Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the pilot 
nudged the throttle into idle, set the flaps at 15 degrees and engaged the 
landing gear. He had gone through this drill countless times before, but this 
landing would soon be anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, the jet pitched violently to the right. As the pilot and 
co-pilot scrambled to gain control, the jet banked 75 degrees -- 2 1/2 times 
the standard turning angle -- both steering wheels shimmied and an alarm 
wailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just moments from impact, the flight crew advanced the throttle to the fire 
wall, hurtling the plane toward earth. After a few tense seconds, the crew 
managed to level the plane's wings, pull up the nose and eventually touched 
down safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later would they learn what had happened: They had flown into wake 
turbulence caused by a Boeing 757 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of dozens of similar close calls -- from Los Angeles to London -- are 
documented in previously unpublished records on 757 wake turbulence kept by the 
national Aviation Safety Reporting System and the United Kingdom's Civil 
Aviation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 On at least 46 occasions dating back to 1983, flight crews in the United 
States and the United Kingdom have filed written reports about close encounters 
with the unusually powerful turbulence caused by 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 In often dramatic fashion, the flight crews' accounts underscore the potential 
danger of 757 wake turbulence, which is suspected in two fatal air crashes in 
the past 14 months, including one in Santa Ana Dec. 15 that claimed five lives. 
They also indicate that pilots recognized the force of 757 wake turbulence more 
than a decade ago and attempted to draw attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight crews routinely reported that 757 turbulence caused violent, 
"uncommanded" rolls of their aircraft, triggering "stall warning lights," 
"stick shakes," "dives" and rough landings that resulted in "tire bursts" and 
"tail strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have called for the 757 to be reclassified as a heavy (aircraft) for a 
number of years now," a change that would require planes landing or taking off 
behind that type of jet to stay farther away, said David Mallino, president of 
the Air Line Pilots Assn. "This is something that has been a concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has said that without further study, there is no need to increase 
separation between 757s and trailing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with no new information other than the occurrence of the crash of a 
corporate jet in Santa Ana two months ago, FAA Administrator David Hinson 
issued a directive Dec. 22 requiring air traffic controllers nationwide to warn 
pilots of the turbulence caused by 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that that is sufficient," said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell in Long 
Beach. "Follow the established procedures for wake turbulence avoidance and you 
will stay out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board convenes Tuesday in Washington to 
address the 757 issue. While the NTSB is not a regulatory agency and does not 
have rule-making authority, the safety board routinely issues recommendations 
to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence occurs when a jet travels through the air, leaving an 
invisible, but potentially lethal pair of horizontal tornadoes emanating from 
its wingtips. The hurricane-force winds of these mini-cyclones can cause even 
mid-sized passenger jets to tilt violently, but they can treat smaller aircraft 
as if they were made of balsa wood. The turbulence is most dangerous during 
landing and takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers suspect the 757's sleek wing design is the culprit in the 
turbulence phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent accident believed to have been linked to 757 wake turbulence 
claimed the lives of two executives of the In-N-Out burger chain, when a 
twin-engine corporate jet landing about two miles behind a 757 at John Wayne 
Airport went out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 That accident came almost a year after a similar accident in which eight 
people were killed in Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen of the 46 incident reports obtained by The Times through public 
information requests for the years 1983 to 1993 were filed as part of the 
federal Aviation Safety Reporting System, a 17-year-old program run by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was created to red-flag potential aviation safety hazards. Because 
the information is collected confidentially -- to encourage reporting -- and 
without reference to aircraft type, there is no way to guarantee the culprit 
aircraft in every incident was a 757. 
</P>
<P>
 However, based on descriptions and technical clues in the reports, ASRS 
researchers suspect that 13 reports involved 757s. Copies of the same 13 
incident reports were distributed to the FAA, NTSB, Air Line Pilots Assn., NASA 
headquarters and the Berlin Technical University in Germany -- all of which are 
looking into the 757 wake turbulence phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 33 British reports, the 757 was clearly identified as the source of the 
turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few cases, there were injuries to passengers and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, the planes sent out of control by 757 wake turbulence were 
MD-80s and Boeing 737s, which can weigh 100,000 pounds and more. 
</P>
<P>
 * In December, 1988, a jet taking off from Dallas-Forth Worth International 
Airport encountered turbulence from a 757 that had taken off moments before. 
"It took almost full aileron . . . to keep from rolling past 45 degrees," a 
member of the flight crew wrote. "The wake I encountered was considerably more 
than normal." 
</P>
<P>
 * In August, 1990, a jet taking off from Los Angeles struck 757 turbulence 
when it was just 100 feet off the ground -- a particularly precarious 
situation, pilots say, because there is so little room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encountered the wake vortices . . . and we were in them until about 2,000 
feet," the crew reported. "During that time, we experienced very rapid roll 
rates . . . and full aileron was often required to keep the aircraft right side 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This pilot) strongly suggests the FAA consider treating the (757) as a heavy 
for separation requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 * Flying at 3,500 feet on final approach to the Atlanta airport in August, 
1992, a jet encountered two blasts of 757 turbulence. The first caused the 
plane to roll 45 degrees to the right; the second pitched the plane into a 
"90-degree bank to the right," shoved its nose down 10 to 12 degrees and nearly 
stopped the plane in its tracks, slowing its air speed "to zero in less than 
five seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA considers a bank of 60 degrees to be acrobatic flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took between 130 to 140% torque to recover and start flying again," the 
flight crew reported. 
</P>
<P>
 * A jet landing at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in April, 1993, rolled right 
nearly 100 degrees when it ran into wake turbulence. The crew applied full 
throttle to escape, but then hit more turbulence, which knocked the plane back 
the other way no more than 60 degrees. The crew pulled up and landed 
uneventfully the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the incident report, this happened despite the pilot's 
deliberately flying above the normal landing path in an effort to avoid the 
"nasty" turbulence that flight crews know is caused by 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the (757) should be classified as a heavy jet and increased spacing 
should be used," the author of the report, a member of the flight crew, wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * In November, 1993, moments after departure from the Minneapolis airport, an 
MD-80 rolled 25 degrees left, then jerked back the other way 25 degrees. The 
flight crew wrote of the wake turbulence problem: "Let's not use crisis 
management on this issue. We have a problem. Let's fix it before people are 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 * The flight crew of a 737 on approach to London's Heathrow Airport reported 
this mishap five days before the fatal Santa Ana crash: "Aircraft rolled 
through 40 degrees. Turbulence initially light, then severe. Autopilot 
disconnected, full aileron plus rudder used to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say it is unclear whether the NTSB will make any 
recommendations after Tuesday's hearing. Like many of the pilots who have 
experienced wake turbulence, the Virginia-based Air Line Pilots Assn., and 
others in the aviation safety field say the medium-sized 757 should be 
reclassified as a heavy jet because it appears to be capable of producing wake 
turbulence more powerful than that caused by aircraft four times its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclassification of 757s would probably stir controversy because of its 
potential economic impact. It would require that pilots of smaller planes be 
given "heavy turbulence warnings" and that smaller planes be required to stay 
two miles farther behind 757s than the three miles of separation they now 
adhere to on final approach. 
</P>
<P>
 At busy airports, that could effectively push back all incoming planes, 
meaning potentially fewer flights and fewer paying passengers during optimal 
flying times. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also unclear how the FAA would respond to any NTSB recommendations on the 
757, although historically, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said, the FAA has 
adopted 80% of NTSB's safety advisories, changing flying rules to correct 
potential safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last year the NTSB urged mass inspections of all planes equipped with a 
propeller it thought defective. The FAA took no action, and, a few months 
later, the propeller was blamed in a crash that killed South Dakota Gov. George 
Mickelson. The FAA subsequently ordered the replacement of propellers on all 
planes like the one that killed the governor and seven others. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake 
turbulence problem to the agency's attention in 1991, said the NTSB should 
recommend that the 757 be reclassified as a heavy jet at least until further 
flight testing is done. That would increase the separation distance for most 
corporate and commercial jets from three miles to five. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should make sure the increased separation distance remains in effect 
until we get a better handle on the 757 wake turbulence problem," said Garodz, 
an FAA specialist in wake turbulence for 20 years. "What's causing this? Is it 
the super-smooth wing? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something going on back there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Canadian aviation officials have already reclassified the 757 
as a "heavy" plane and are requiring increased separation distances -- five 
miles or six, depending on size -- for planes landing and taking off behind 
757s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United Kingdom, Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Jonathan Nickolson 
said officials at Heathrow Airport have taken a similar step on a six-month 
trial basis. There, planes that used to be kept three miles behind 757s are 
being kept four miles behind; aircraft that once were held four miles at bay 
are now held back six miles.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; EMERGENCY SYSTEMS KICKED IN ON CUE, AVERTING 
CHAOS; PREPAREDNESS: COSTLY PRECAUTIONS PREVENT LOSS OF WATER, RELEASE OF 
SEWAGE AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS.

<P>
 Toxic gas billows from dozens of plants and factories. Sewage spews into the 
streets and floods the ocean by the millions of gallons. And flames roar out of 
control, as fire hoses and hydrants run out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dark scenes might have descended on Los Angeles in last month's 
earthquake were it not for years of planning, scores of technological advances 
and several billion dollars in public works improvements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dozens of deaths and devastating property damage understandably have 
received the most attention since the quake, many government officials, 
business people and others said residents should take some comfort in the 
calamities that were averted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' power, water, sewage and toxic control systems functioned almost 
flawlessly after the quake, and based on that experience, many officials are 
cautiously optimistic those key services will survive the much-anticipated Big 
One as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Southern California was throttled at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, power was lost 
throughout the city. That could have been disastrous for a city sewer system 
that carries nearly half a billion gallons of waste every day. But the system 
shifted almost seamlessly into emergency mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup generators have been installed at most of the 54 pumping stations along 
6,500 miles of sewer lines to keep waste flowing even during power outages. And 
an internal power station was built at the Hyperion Treatment Plant, the 
oceanside facility in Playa del Rey that processes three-quarters of the 435 
million gallons of sewage created in the city each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was part of court-ordered improvements to reduce the pollutants 
dumped into Santa Monica Bay -- a $3.5-billion reconstruction job that is 60% 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the emergency response was the Hyperion plant, which switched to 
the internal power system fueled by methane gas and dried sewage sludge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't miss a beat," said Sam Furuta, assistant director of the city's 
Bureau of Sanitation. "The internal power system came on and kept powering us 
throughout the incident." 
</P>
<P>
 With the plant still on-line, it was able to serve its intended purpose as the 
backstop for two other sewage plants that do not have emergency generators. 
More than 37 million gallons of effluent was diverted from the Donald C. 
Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Basin and the Los 
Angeles-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant near Griffith Park. Those facilities 
had to shunt waste to Hyperion for half a day until they regained power. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hyperion had lost all power, the outcome would have been much worse. The 
plant would have been down for at least an hour and 45 minutes, long enough 
that it would have been forced to dump about 25 million gallons of sewage into 
Santa Monica Bay with only minimal treatment, public works engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city system lost just 300 gallons, from a single sewer main that 
was crushed in southwest Los Angeles. The new backup generators, installed at 
pumping plants around the city, helped avert much larger spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "That prevented sewage from literally flowing in the streets," said Mark Gold, 
staff scientist for the environmental group Heal the Bay and a frequent critic 
of the sewer system. "That would have created a much greater risk of some sort 
of public health outbreak." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's major water supplier, the Metropolitan Water District, 
also relied on new technology and innovation to weather the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD officials feared that in a major catastrophe they would have to wait in 
line with other customers to order new pipe to replace damaged lines. They also 
worried that the makers of giant main lines were so distant that they could not 
deliver to Southern California promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after the 1971 Sylmar quake, the giant agency created its own pipe-making 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 With its own facility and metal supplies in La Verne when the quake hit, the 
MWD was able to fabricate and replace in just a day, two critical, 
seven-foot-diameter sections of pipe that had been damaged at the MWD's Jensen 
Pumping plant in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Without that pipeline, much of the Valley would have been without water within 
about 72 hours, when reservoirs' supplies would have run low. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major supplier, the city's Department of Water and Power, suffered 
breaks in its two aqueducts that feed the Valley. With the MWD back in service 
so quickly, water was routed to all customers except those who suffered local 
damage to mains running under city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the potential for this problem in 1971," said Richard Balcerzak, 
assistant general manager. "This is a cheap solution, and one that really paid 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Another innovation may have prevented even further damage at the Jensen 
facility in Granada Hills -- a critical transmission point for water in the 
California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 It had sustained major damage in the Sylmar quake, in part from the phenomenon 
of liquefaction -- when solid ground turns to the consistency of quicksand as 
water tables are suddenly elevated. A flood and certain fatalities were only 
avoided because the plant had not yet gone on-line, MWD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To correct the problem, former MWD Chief Engineer Robert Mohle embraced a 
revolutionary design in which the water district drilled 1,100 holes in the 
ground, two feet in diameter and 60 feet deep. The "Mohle holes," as they were 
quickly dubbed by MWD engineers, absorb water as it rises and limit the effects 
of liquefaction, Balcerzak said. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD engineers believe the holes helped neutralize the shock waves from the 
quake and minimize the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel pretty good about what we did," Balcerzak said. "We fared pretty 
doggone good." 
</P>
<P>
 An untold amount of additional funds have been spent by private industry to 
limit another potential earthquake disaster -- the release of hazardous 
materials. Authorities say that widespread compliance with an 8-year-old state 
law helped limit hazardous releases to a handful of relatively minor incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, about 350 companies have been found to hold enough acutely 
hazardous chemicals to pose a potential public health threat if storage 
containers are damaged. About 200 that store the most dangerous compounds have 
completed the state-mandated risk management prevention programs to improve 
storage and responses to emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of hazardous materials it really went well," said David Zocchetti, 
manager of the hazardous-materials unit for the state Office of Emergency 
Services. "In the last few years in Los Angeles a lot of resources have gone 
into these programs. And it really showed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions were a train derailment in Northridge that dumped two tankers 
of sulfuric acid, the upending of laboratory chemicals at Cal State Northridge 
and a liquid propane leak near the Van Nuys Airport. The only serious injury 
came when a man was burned after a crude oil pipeline ruptured and ignited in 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 But many more businesses reported no serious mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys demonstrated the value 
of preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago the plant alongside the San Diego Freeway revamped an ammonia 
refrigeration system in order to limit any release of ammonia liquid or gas. 
Instead of a continuous loop for cooling beer, the system was divided into 25 
separate compartments, each with automatic shut-off valves. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake hit, one damaged section of the cooling system was immediately 
isolated from the rest. Just 500 pounds of ammonia was released from a system 
that holds about 100,000 pounds, according to initial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been many, many times more," said one Busch official, who asked 
not to be identified. "Someone manually would have shut off the system 
eventually. We would not let it go on. But the system did it automatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Years of planning also enabled the city's electrical system to emerge from the 
disaster virtually unscathed. As the quake rocked thousands of power lines that 
crisscross the city, scores of transformers shorted out, showering the night 
sky with blue and white sparks. That touched off dangerous electrical surges, 
which began backing up through the power grid, threatening to damage critical 
electrical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility immediately went into its "automatic shutdown mode," turning off 
power before it could cause any harm. Given the extraordinary force of the 
temblor, the process continued until the entire city was dark. But the system 
was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, engineers began the process of cranking the system up again. 
Many residents had electricity within 38 minutes. By nightfall, 60% of the city 
had power restored. And within 24 hours, 93% of residents had power. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, restoring power from scratch, a so-called "black start," could have 
taken days. The DWP avoided that in part because it has power-sharing compacts 
with utilities as far away as Oregon and Washington, said Marcie L. Edwards, an 
engineer at the DWP's emergency control center. 
</P>
<P>
 Routing power from these sources around the worst of the quake damage, DWP 
engineers were able to kick-start their own generators. By 8 a.m., the first of 
the DWP's generating facilities was back in operation.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the (electric) business that is almost unheard of," Edwards said. Lots of 
utilities use similar series of sensors and switches, she said, concluding: 
"What's important is that ours worked."

 Tonya and Nancy are teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 1 o'clock Sunday morning here and guess who's coming to Norway? Tonya 
Harding is coming. Nancy Kerrigan is already here and Harding is packing her 
suitcase and Michelle Kwan of Torrance is out. Michelle is 13 and presumably 
will have other chances to skate in the Olympics. But Harding is 23 and, for 
her, it is now or never. Turns out to be now. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 4 o'clock Saturday afternoon in the Pacific Northwest of the United 
States and faxes are flying. Judge Patrick D. Gilroy in the Circuit Court of 
the State of Oregon for the County of Clackamas "is pleased to announce that 
the issues now pending before this court have been resolved. . . . Tonya 
Harding will skate in the 1994 Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding herself sends word that she "regrets any inconvenience" and "simply 
wants to skate in the Olympics and be treated fairly" and sincerely hopes that 
she will "not have to grant interviews, hold press conferences or make 
additional public statements" and would appreciate everyone's cooperation 
because "it's time to put this matter behind all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitry Feld is passing out the faxes. Dmitry is usually a spokesman for U.S. 
luge, not figure skating, but he is here helping out. Dmitry is trapped in a 
facsimile feeding frenzy, outstretched fingers reaching toward him, hungrily. 
Dmitry, a Russian immigrant, dispenses the faxes and says, "Is this like a line 
for bread or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Moran, spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, reads aloud from his own 
USOC prepared statement, stapled to the faxes. It says, in part: "Because of 
the resolution of the court proceedings in Oregon today, Tonya Harding will 
continue to be a member of the Olympic team, and she will compete in the 
ladies' event in figure skating beginning on Feb. 23." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a day before, at high noon, Moran was at the front of the same 
auditorium, riding verbal shotgun for Nancy Kerrigan at her first appearance 
before the multitudinous world media. Now he has been called back to announce 
and explain why a woman being investigated in a violent attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan is on her way to Norway to skate with Kerrigan on behalf of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya and Nancy are teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are appalled still by the attack on Nancy Kerrigan, which was not only an 
attack on the athlete, but an assault on the basic ideals of the Olympic 
movement and sportsmanship," Moran reads from the USOC prepared statement. "The 
attack was designed to cripple her, alter the competition, and could have ended 
her career. We remain deeply concerned about this incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, the U.S. Olympic Committee has attempted to bring this 
matter to a conclusion, and to employ our Constitution and Bylaws and other 
resources to find the truth in these matters and to be undeniably fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the moment, the matter is stilled. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We wish each of them the best of success as they attempt to realize their 
lifelong Olympic Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams, with a capital D. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the end of an imperfect day. From slightly past noon, at which time 
Nancy Kerrigan was saying that how she felt about Tonya Harding was between 
them, to slightly past midnight, at which time Harding was officially on her 
way here to Norway and hoping to deliver in person that "hug" she wanted to 
give Kerrigan, this opening day of the XVII Winter Olympics has been one of 
extraordinary pomp and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this time frame, to quote again from the USOC document, "approximately 
1,900 of the world's finest athletes" -- neither Kerrigan nor Harding among 
them -- "entered the Olympic Stadium in Lillehammer. The men and women of the 
1994 U.S. Olympic team are now part of the Games and the reason why the United 
States delegation, the nation's First Lady (Hillary Rodham Clinton) and 
countless other Americans are here in Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya and Nancy are teammates. Each would appreciate no more questions. Alas, 
there are more questions than answers. Where will they practice? At the same 
place, same session, as is currently stipulated? One international skating 
official said late last week, coldly, if one cannot skate with the other, "then 
don't bring her." 
</P>
<P>
 What about Kerrigan's state of mind? Her coach, Evy Scotvold, said with 
understandable concern, "She can't get any peace." Yet she also looked her 
skater in the eye after practice and said, "Get used to it. None of this is 
going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Kerrigan's physical state? She has lost weight. She skated hard in 
practice to music by Tina Turner and Neil Diamond, took a fall, got up, flexed 
her tender right knee. Saturday, she said she was fine. But she also skipped 
the opening ceremony, reluctant to put much strain on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 What will Harding say to Kerrigan, if anything? How about that hug Tonya said 
she would give Nancy, given the chance? How would Nancy respond to that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bye," Kerrigan said, and skated off. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Harding had been told to hang her skates on an Oregon peg and watch 
the Olympics on TV? One of her lawyers, Dennis Rawlinson, said, "If she's later 
found innocent, we could never make it up to her." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. is sending her. 
</P>
<P>
 What else can it do? 
</P>
<P>
 Norway is welcoming her. 
</P>
<P>
 What else can it do? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mystery, as Kerrigan called it herself. Neither woman has a clue how it 
will turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 A soap opera, others would call it. It has villains and victims and lovers and 
lawyers and sponsors and music. 
</P>
<P>
 In the background is a 13-year-old girl from the fringe of Los Angeles who 
acts more mature than most of the grown-ups. Michelle Kwan has been prepared to 
skate for herself and her country. Now she will stand by and watch, with other 
Americans by the millions. She is the most innocent of bystanders. Bravo, 
Michelle. She will never show any more grace or poise in her career than she is 
showing right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Tonya and Nancy are teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic Dreams still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams. Plural.

JIM MURRAY: L.A. OPEN; OPEN MATCHUP: A PUNCHER AGAINST A CLASSIC BOXER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thing you have to like about Corey Pavin is, he plays the game of golf as 
if he had a plane to catch. As if he were double-parked and left the motor 
running. Guys move slower leaving hotel fires. 
</P>
<P>
 It's refreshing. You know how the rest of the field usually plays. Like guys 
going to the electric chair. A state funeral moves faster. They have the 
expression on their faces of a guy undergoing an appendectomy.  
</P>
<P>
 Pavin always has this little half-grin on his face. He looks as if he likes 
what he's doing. That he's glad there's no heavy lifting or shoveling to do. He 
hits a shot and then goes running after it holding onto his hat like a guy 
chasing a bus. When he sinks a long putt, he doesn't just blow on his 
fingernails and give it a ho-hum stare. He usually jumps straight up in the air 
like a kid who just got a pony for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an attitude calculated to win widespread acceptance. With $50 
million at stake, the PGA Tour is entitled to all the solemnity of a Bank of 
England board meeting. And no one ever laughed there.  
</P>
<P>
 Golfers keep a pretty stiff upper lip, too. The atmosphere is about what it 
was in the trenches before an offensive in World War II -- except nobody ever 
got killed by a four-foot putt. Corey is one of the few on tour who seems to 
keep that in mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Pavin, whose college was UCLA, is the prototypical "gutty little Bruin," a 
term coined by the late great USC track Coach Dean Cromwell to describe his 
undermanned crosstown athletic rivals. Pavin is gutty, little and a Bruin. His 
career is a tribute to determination, persistence, consistency and a total 
undiscourageability. God didn't make him a golfer, he did.  
</P>
<P>
 He is, for instance, 122nd (out of 133) in driving distance on the tour. He 
hears "You're away!" a lot on the fairway. But not very often on the greens. No 
one ever mixed him up with John Daly off the tee. But no one ever has to look 
for his ball, either.  
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pavin's matchup in the Nissan L.A. Open this week is the classic boxer 
vs. puncher. Fred Couples is used to kayoing a golf course. Punching its lights 
out with these incredibly long tee shots. Bringing it to its knees bleeding and 
cut, on the ropes. Pavin has to out-jab it. Keep it off balance, distract it, 
confuse it, dazzle it. Make it fight your fight. Decision it. 
</P>
<P>
 Riviera has lately turned from Hogan's Alley to Couples' Corner. Fred has won 
the L.A. Open twice at Riviera and, after two rounds Friday, seemed in position 
to put it down for the count again. He plays this course the way Tyson played 
Spinks -- with haymakers to the button.  
</P>
<P>
 Riviera is a course that responds best to brute strength. You have to be long, 
straight. A little arrogance couldn't hurt. Corey Pavin has to creep up on it. 
Pick its pockets, so to speak.  
</P>
<P>
 He does this better than anybody, too. He should work Times Square.  
</P>
<P>
 But Corey Pavin was climbing into the ring with Fred Couples at the L.A. Open 
Saturday. Couples' nickname is "Boom Boom," to give you an idea. Corey's would 
be more like "Click!" 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pavin had just shot one of the incandescent rounds of the tournament on 
Friday -- a 64 in the face of ferocious wind conditions that made even a par 
round an achievement.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an axiom of golf that a super round is seldom followed by a duplicate. A 
"zone," an out-of-body state of being in golf, seldom lasts 36 holes.  
</P>
<P>
 If you were betting, you had to make Couples an out price. His opening 67s 
were well within his capabilities. They were like Joe Louis knockouts, highly 
duplicatable. Corey's round looked singular.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Saturday's round started, the course began to take Freddy's best 
punches and come fighting back. He failed for the first time in three days to 
birdie or eagle the first hole. The course was no pushover for the first nine 
holes.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the gutty little Bruin held the course at bay. Par golf moved his 
lead from three strokes to five strokes by the turn as Couples stumbled to two 
bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 On the back nine, though, Couples' heavier punches began to take effect. He 
birdied 10 from point-blank range, he birdied 12 after a mammoth drive, he 
birdied 13, then 16, then 17, a par five he hit green-high in two. If it was a 
real fight, they would have stopped it.  
</P>
<P>
 It got to Corey. He unaccountably bogeyed 14. Then he birdied 15.  
</P>
<P>
 But on 18, he played Pavin golf. By then one shot behind -- he had lost his 
five-shot lead to Couples' relentless back nine -- he had to hit his third shot 
on the par four out of rough you could hide a lion in and he left himself a 
curling 18-foot putt.  
</P>
<P>
 When he made that, he signaled that his cold round was over. It was a Pavin 
par. It set up a shootout for the ages today.  
</P>
<P>
 Pavin golf has been extraordinarily successful. Sunny, speedy golf has paid 
off. He is usually hitting first off the fairway. He was 20 to 30 yards behind 
Couples all day. But hitting first doesn't discourage Corey Pavin. Hardly 
anything does. He scurries after his ball -- and then usually hits it inside 
everybody on the green. If he doesn't, he's still a better putter than any long 
hitter.  
</P>
<P>
 If you needed proof, you had only to check his resume. Corey Pavin is 16th on 
the all-time money list, he has won 10 tournaments in an era when to win a 
dozen makes you a megastar. He is probably that familiar cliche of the first 
tee -- the "best player never to win a major." Tom Kite was the last guy to fit 
that dubious description -- till he won the 1992 U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
 Corey Pavin was the tour's leading money winner in 1991, with $979,430. He was 
fifth the following year.  
</P>
<P>
 He is formidable competition. "We all know he is a tiger," Couples admitted 
after overtaking him on the back nine. "He keeps coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 In horse racing, when a horse gets passed in the backstretch, he is usually 
beat. But golf is not horse racing -- its annals are full of guys who came 
back.  
</P>
<P>
 Couples expects a tough last round. "I enjoy watching Corey play," he 
admitted. "He's such a shotmaker. He fades the ball, he draws the ball, he does 
whatever is necessary. You know he's always in a pleasant frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be a classic windup -- Dempsey vs. Tunney, Ali vs. Foreman. Have 
Fred Couples' power punches taken all the fight out of the course? Or will 
Pavin's infighting and ring generalship bring it to its knees? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, you'll see Corey Pavin scurrying along like a puppy chasing a ball 
today while Fred Couples will try to get Riviera to run up the white flag by 
long range.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, you won't be able to tell by looking at Corey Pavin. 
He always looks as if he just heard he won the lottery.  
</P>
<P>
 His strategy for today's final round? Play fast. Nobody in the history of golf 
ever made $5 million as fast from tee to green. If he loses, he'll be the one 
grinning, "Boy! Freddy played good, didn't he?" as he runs out the door.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; AMID THE ICE AND SNOW, SPIRIT BURNS; 
OPENING: A TIMELESS SIMPLICITY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A SPECIAL WINTER 
FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four hundred twenty-five miles from the Arctic Circle, the XVII Winter 
Olympics began here Saturday with reindeer-drawn sleighs, fiddlers on the hoof 
and fanfare from rams' horns, all on a far-as-the-eye-can-see fleece of snow. 
Let the giant Viking games begin. 
</P>
<P>
 His Majesty King Harald V of Norway, royalty in a parka, made the formal 
announcement, "I hereby declare opened the 17th Olympic Winter Games in 
Lillehammer," after which his 20-year-old son, His Royal Highness Crown Prince 
Haakon, put the torch to the Olympic flame. They are the descendants of King 
Olav V, a competitive skier and Olympic sailor himself before his death in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In these, the winter carnivals that have introduced worldwide audiences to 
athletes as eclectic as Sonja Henie and Tonya Harding, as electric as the 1980 
U.S. hockey team, as glamorous as Alberto Tomba and Prince Albert of Monaco, as 
triumphant as Rosi Mittermaier and Eric Heiden and as eccentric as a bobsled 
crew from Jamaica and a blind-as-a-bat ski jumper who called himself Eddie the 
Eagle, rarely has a setting seemed so natural and traditional as this. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, where by legend two skiers in 1206 carried the original Prince Haakon to 
safety from enemies of the crown, children have been known to ski before they 
can walk. The town of Lillehammer, population 23,000, pictures a skier on its 
coat of arms, something seen in no other city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Although adventurous Norwegians have journeyed by land and by sea -- among 
them the actress Liv Ullmann and the explorer Thor Heyerdahl, who served as 
emcees of Saturday's opening ceremonies -- and have excelled at other games, as 
did the Norway-born football legend Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, this is a 
nation of skiers and skaters, of children whose first sleds mean as much to 
them as one did to the fictional Charles Foster Kane. 
</P>
<P>
 Twanging mouth harps and melodic violins were played by musicians of all ages 
who entered the Lysgardsbakkene ski-jump arena aboard wagon, sled and 
horseback, some on dainty "Dela" horses the size of Shetland ponies, bays with 
white manes and tails, so colorful that they looked like carousels come to 
life. Children garbed in Viking regalia danced around grandfatherly men who 
played willow flutes, ram-horn trumpets and lures, ancient bugles made from 
birch-tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was far less avant-garde than the one staged two years ago in 
Albertville, France, where women crouched inside crystal-like globes and men 
swung from bungee cords or swayed atop 50-foot stilts. For these Winter 
Olympics, the first ones to follow so closely on the heels of another, the 
kickoff pageant featured woodland creatures and characters from fables, with 
few things so modern that they couldn't have been seen in the 1952 opening 
ceremony at Oslo, 110 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 What newness there was Saturday came in an appeal for peace in the former 
Olympic host city of Sarajevo by the president of the International Olympic 
Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, followed by a minute of silence for the 
embattled citizenry there. Parachutists delivered the national flag and skiers 
the flame, one of them an eleventh-hour replacement for a ski jumper originally 
assigned to advance the torch, whose crackup during rehearsal will make him as 
famous here as the opening credits of American TV's "Wide World of Sports" made 
famous another unlucky ski jumper many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the athletes, too, were new, although familiar faces abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mingling with the many experienced Olympians in the parade of nations were 
such newcomers as Michael Shmerkin, a figure skater who is about to become 
Israel's first Winter Olympian, and fellow skater Dino Quattrocecere, who, 
though born in Virginia, will represent South Africa as its first participant 
in these games in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 New flags galore flew before republics from the former Soviet Union, while 
athletes such as Carolina Photiades, a skier from Cyprus, walked alone, flag in 
hand, a one-man Olympic band. 
</P>
<P>
 At times spectators did need a program to tell which nation was which, as when 
several athletes marched into the stadium behind a banner identifying them as 
being from the nation of JOMFRUOYENE. This was, as it turned out, the Norwegian 
version of Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 DEN TSJEKKISKE REPUBLIKK was the Czech half of the former Czechoslovakia, 
TYSKLAND stood for Germany, STORBRITANNIA for Great Britain and, near the 
beginning of the alphabetical parade, strode the mighty team of the AMERIKAS 
FORENTE STATER, 157 cowboy-hatted athletes representing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, for the curious, Canada was CANADA and Mexico was MEXICO. 
</P>
<P>
 The words that rang out in the Norwegian night, however, were these, spoken by 
Liv Ullmann to the thousands in attendance and the millions listening 
worldwide: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tap og vinn med samme sinn," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lose and win with the same attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 It was something to embrace, something for everyone to carry with them or wrap 
around them, for now or for later, while sitting here on top of the world.

FOR VAN EXEL, ROOKIE GAME FUN AFTER ALL; ALL-STAR FESTIVITIES: NOT SCORING 
DOESN'T BOTHER LAKER GUARD. RIDER WINS SLAM-DUNK COMPETITION; PRICE TAKES 
THREE-POINT SHOOTING CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It could have been worse, Nick Van Exel said after missing all eight shot 
attempts. It could have been what he expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the strangest thing happened to the Laker guard Saturday at the 
Target Center in the inaugural rookie all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 He had fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best time of my life," Van Exel said. "I'm not being sarcastic." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that because this is the same Van Exel who said recently he wasn't 
excited about playing because too many people want to have fun at all-star 
games and not enough want to win. 
</P>
<P>
 So he arrived Friday, did some interviews and ran up the room service tab, 
then went scoreless in 20 minutes and had a game-high six assists in a 74-68 
loss. Somewhere in between, he became one of those people who have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway, the other starting guard on Van Exel's team, the 
Sensations, led all scorers with 22 points and was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber of Golden State had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the victorious 
Phenoms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another rookie, Isaiah Rider of the Minnesota Timberwolves, made good on a 
draft-day prediction and won the annual slam-dunk championship in his home 
arena and the $20,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like I did my best dunks, though," he said. "I was kind of 
indecisive. I didn't really get into the really wild, crazy dunks that would 
have made the crowd go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver's Robert Pack, the former USC guard, finished second in his first dunk 
competition on any level, and Shawn Kemp of Seattle was third. Harold Miner of 
Miami, the defending champion, was a late scratch because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price of the Cleveland Cavaliers successfully defended his three-point 
shooting title, easily beating Philadelphia's Dana Barros in the finals for the 
$20,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Price made 20 of 25 shots, including 20 of his first 22, for 24 points in the 
scoring system. That put the pressure on Barros, who won a coin toss but 
elected to go second. Barros then hit 13 from behind the stripe, for 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're out there shooting and get a score of 18 you know you're shooting 
pretty good," Price said. "And if you get 20 you know that you're really 
shooting the ball well. I wanted to go for the record (25 points by Craig 
Hodges in in the final round in 1986) in the final round, but I missed a few 
balls at the end of the last rack. But I knew that I had hit enough shots to 
make it tough for Dana." NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Clippers were one of four teams named to play in a two-day 
exhibition tournament in Mexico City this fall. Houston, San Antonio and 
Seattle will also take part Oct. 28-29. Meanwhile, the Clippers' trip to Japan 
to open the regular season with two games against the Portland should be 
finalized soon. The site is will probably be Tokyo or Yokohama. . . . Danny 
Manning of the Clippers has been elected secretary-treasurer of the National 
Basketball Players Assn. Buck Williams of the Trail Blazers replaced Detroit's 
Isiah Thomas as the union president with negotiations for a new collective 
bargaining agreement set to begin sometime in early March.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; EXPANSION IS NICE, BUT ALL IS NOT SUGAR AND SPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hits just keep happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto and Vancouver are joining the league in 1995. Mexico City is penciled 
in for 2000 (honest). 
</P>
<P>
 Diluting the talent? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, but the Canadians are paying $125 million each, up a mere 385% from the 
$32.5 million for the last expansion class. For $125 million, David Stern would 
put a team in Vladivostok or your back yard, provided you had a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the bright side: There should be someone worse than the Clippers at 
the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to this delightful league where everyone liked everyone 
except Red Auerbach and Darrell Garretson? 
</P>
<P>
 Item: After years of peaceful labor relations, the players are upset at the 
owners' idea of a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 They caught the owners hiding luxury suite money, obliging the owners to 
settle out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 They signed away the licensing money for $500,000 a year and saw the league 
take home $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the players claim they want to scrap the whole deal: the salary cap, the 
draft, the graduated free agency system. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, gulping in anticipation of his first difficult labor negotiation, 
actually asked reporters -- "plead" was the word he used -- not to play up 
rifts between labor and management. This is getting to be standard procedure 
with Stern, a plea to soft-pedal whatever issue is at hand, perhaps dating to 
his difficulty last spring when he tried to interpose himself between Michael 
Jordan and a press corps asking questions about his gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 However softly you say it, the league has its own demands. 
</P>
<P>
 It wants the current salary cap loophole closed. If the players fight them on 
it, the NBA will surely take a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: The NBA keeps suing and losing. 
</P>
<P>
 For a league run by lawyers, these guys are on a cold roll. 
</P>
<P>
 They sued Chicago Bull owner Jerry Reinsdorf to bar him from putting games on 
the WGN superstation. Reinsdorf won and increased his schedule. The NBA sued 
again. The case is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 They sued the Portland Trail Blazers to prevent them from offering Chris 
Dudley that one-year termination clause that effectively blew up the salary 
cap. The NBA lost before an arbitrator, a special master and a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Item: The owners won't do what Stern wants, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf defied him in the TV case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers defied him in the Dudley case. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte's George Shinn blew his wage scale out of the water on a lark, 
signing Larry Johnson, who had three years left on his $20-million contract, to 
an $84-million extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the local beauties, Minnesota Timberwolves owners Marv 
Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, who have been celebrating their All-Star season by 
threatening to move their five-year-old franchise to Nashville or San Diego if 
the city doesn't take over their arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Told a new building was a condition of entry, Harv and Marv built the Target 
Center with their own money but had a little cost overrun -- from $50 million 
to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When their financing collapsed, they got a loan from a Japanese bank that now 
runs the building $7 million in the red annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timberwolves, of course, are still playing to 95% of capacity despite 
stunted growth and remain wildly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of the irony, but it's accurate," Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the team is doing very well. Yes, we're proud to have it here, being 
well-treated. Yes, we really would like to keep it here. But yes, there is a 
terrible economic issue for the ownership that put it here." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't exactly the backdrop Stern wanted for his midwinter night's 
classic, a snowflake logo over the words: "The NBA, See It While It's Here." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern has taken over this case, personally. He told Harv and Marv to stop 
teeing the locals off with threats. He reminded the locals they have already 
lost the North Stars, and the Twins are up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you Minnesotans spell g-h-o-s-t t-o-w-n? 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, he entreated the press to act responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern is doing OK on this front -- the story hasn't yet made "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what happens when you hit the big time. You make money, you lose 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell those Mexico City Caballeros to keep an eye on their contractor and start 
saving up that $500-million franchise fee. ELLIOTT FOR HORRY: THE DEAL FROM 
HELL 
</P>
<P>
 There are trades that hurt both teams but few that messed everyone up like the 
aborted deal of Detroit's Sean Elliott for Houston's Robert Horry and Matt 
Bullard. 
</P>
<P>
 Horry and Bullard, accepting their fall from the league's No. 2 record to No. 
26, reported to Detroit, where they learned that Houston doctors had discovered 
Elliott had a kidney ailment and the Rockets were holding the deal up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket officials wouldn't talk on the record, so, inevitably, people gossiped. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, at home in Tucson, had to call a news conference to dispel rumors 
that he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott's ailment is treatable and curable, but the Rockets were in no mood to 
take a chance. They told the Pistons they'd go ahead if Detroit put up $10 
million and its 1997 No. 1 draft choice, should Elliott go down this season or 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, it should be noted, are known for exacting standards in physical 
examinations. Last season, they nixed a deal for Greg Kite, who returned to 
Orlando and kept playing for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Piston Coach Don Chaney, a former Rocket: "It looks like somebody got 
cold feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Rocket owner, Les Alexander, had a news conference to refute the 
"cheap shots" he said were coming out of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Horry and Bullard reported back to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Horry, asked if he thought he was there to stay, said: "Get back to me on Feb. 
24." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the trading deadline. The Rockets, who started 22-1 and once led San 
Antonio by eight games, are a half-game up at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "When San Antonio passes us," Hakeem Olajuwon said, "maybe that's going to get 
us to play the way we were." 
</P>
<P>
 He said when , not if . FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Shut Up, Grasshopper: New York's Patrick Ewing, upset at Shaquille O'Neal for 
bellowing, "Who's the man?" in a Magic victory over the Knicks at Orlando, 
outscored him, 32-22, in a Knick victory at New York last week. Said Ewing: 
"He's not the man, yet." . . . O'Neal said he had been yelling to teammate 
Donald Royal, not Ewing, but stopped short of an apology. "Patrick knows the 
deal," Shaq said. "If he plays me one-on-one the whole game, we'd see." . . . 
Just saying no: Danny Manning ran out his short list of prospective employers: 
Orlando (thought to be the favorite), Charlotte, Miami, Phoenix, Lakers, 
Boston. The rebuilding Lakers are a longshot, but Manning respects the 
organization and he still loves L.A. "You look at teams like the Lakers, the 
Celtics and you know they're going to do something to get back on top. Because 
that's just the Lakers and that's just the Celtics." 
</P>
<P>
 Men of Teal, where are you? The Charlotte Hornets lost eight games in a row, 
finishing the first half of the season without Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, 
LeRon Ellis, Scott Burrell and Kenny Gattison, all injured, leaving them with 
Mike Gminski and free-agent pickup Marty Conlon at center. Said assistant coach 
(for the moment) Bill Hanzlik: "We never thought we'd see the day when we 
worried about Gminski getting in foul trouble." . . . The Hornets are No. 9 in 
the East, out of the playoffs, at the moment. A ninth-place finish would not 
send them back to the lottery, however. They flopped draft choices with Seattle 
in the trade that sent Kendall Gill to the SuperSonics. . . . Correction: A 
recent item in this column, stating that the Clippers do not have their top 
pick this spring, was wrong. In fact, they do -- and it looks as though it will 
come in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Pfund, on the suggestion that his Lakers lack pride: "It's funny how all 
of a sudden a couple of Pistons who were championship players seem to have lost 
a level of pride. Since Phoenix has lost Kevin Johnson and Charles Barkley, 
their pride seems to have gone down considerably." . . . Utah's Karl Malone, 
upset at being overlooked by fans, wasn't going to the All-Star game until 
Barkley scratched and he was made a starter. The Mailman was also upset at the 
home loss to the Lakers -- "embarrassing" -- and the general state of the Jazz. 
"With what's happening now," he said, "I can see us (playing .500) the rest of 
my career. For nine years, it's like we fooled everybody and we fooled 
ourselves." . . . The Nuggets' Rodney Rogers hit three three-pointers in 8.8 
seconds during a loss to the Jazz. That projects, over 48 minutes, to 2,880 
points. Said Denver's Issel to Rogers: "That's how many I'm expecting you to 
have tomorrow in San Antonio." He missed by 2,880, going 0 for 5 against the 
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Phil Jackson, with the Bulls trailing by two at Phoenix, ran the same 
play on which John Paxson hit a three-pointer to win last season's title. Sun 
Coach Paul Westphal told his team beforehand: "If they get a three, nobody gets 
to come back into the locker room." Johnson grabbed Paxson to keep him out of 
the play, but Steve Kerr wound up shooting a three-pointer, whereupon KJ almost 
beheaded him and got a flagrant foul. "He's not the cleanest player," said 
Kerr, a former Sun teammate. "He's got that face and that reputation as a good 
guy, but he's a dirty player." Said Westphal: "In Kevin's defense, Kerr did not 
get a clean three-pointer." . . . The Indiana Pacers won eight games in a row 
to reach .500 for the first time under Coach Larry Brown. "They're going to be 
good," former Pacer Chuck Person said. "They've got a lot of athletes, guys 
that play hard every night. Their team is 13 strong. They're playing harder 
than all of the Pacer teams I was associated with. They're trying to defend, 
which is the sign of a team that's coming." . . . Jayson Williams, on the rally 
that carried the Nets to 22-24: "I'm seeing Coach (Chuck) Daly smiling. Hell, I 
didn't even know he had teeth."

IT'S NO DREAM: THESE KIDS ARE NBA ALL-STARS; PRO BASKETBALL: WITH RETIREMENTS, 
INJURIES AND AGE, IT'S A CHANGING OF THE GUARD (AND FORWARD AND CENTER). 
</P>

 Where's Larry? 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Magic? 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Mike? 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems strange because I'm still looking for those guys," said Clyde 
Drexler, 31 and by grace of the voters an All-Star once more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so used to seeing them around, you kind of look for them in the hallway 
on your floor. But I haven't seen them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is he likely to. Bird is scouting, Johnson is touring, Jordan is taking 
batting practice. Charles Barkley is promising to retire. The old guard is 
changing so quickly, it will have to charter a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more starters in today's All-Star game from Dream Team II than 
from the original. Chris Mullin, 30 and returning shakily from a long layoff, 
didn't make it. Drexler, a shadow of what he was two years ago, got a courtesy 
appointment from the fans. Isiah Thomas, 32, didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal once more outpolled Patrick Ewing to start at center for the 
East. A year ago, Ewing bristled at the news, but he seems to have learned to 
accept it. This is fortunate, since Patrick, the sphinx, will go off as a 
longshot for the rest of his career against Shaq, star of stage, screen and 
what have you. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning got the spot once reserved for Brad Daugherty before bowing 
out with an injury. Thomas' string of 12 consecutive selections was snapped. In 
place of Mullin is Golden State teammate Latrell Sprewell, 23, a monster talent 
who will be hard to deny. Waiting in the wings are two more super rookies, 
Chris Webber and Anfernee Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a young, good group, a lot of raw talent," said Derrick Coleman, New 
Jersey's $69 Million Won't Get It Man. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to step up and accept the challenge of, quote unquote, taking over 
the league, the next generation or whatever. I think we have a lot of guys with 
a lot of talent that are willing to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, All-Star games lacked sub-plots, but that was before rookies with 
$50-million contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm well aware of one thing," said Karl Malone, 30. "When time comes calling, 
you say to yourself, 'I had a good time while it lasted.' And I'm not one of 
the those guys that look back and say to myself, 'God, why couldn't I have been 
five years later?' I'm happy with the years I came in because the NBA's been 
great to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember when I came out of college, the forward then was Maurice 
Lucas. He was like the guy . Whenever you played him, you sort of said to 
yourself, 'God, that's the older guy. Hopefully, I'm the newer guy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you go out and play someone, they've got a young forward. If I 
have a great game, 'He's supposed to.' But if that young player has a great 
game, 'Changing of the guard. This guy's getting old.' 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that frustrates you as an older player, I realize how good it's 
been for me, and you just hope that we don't spoil it. Meaning that you come in 
this league and prove yourself before you get the big contracts. To me, if 
anything can ruin the NBA, that will, the money part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran can stand only so much. Malone once told a reporter to check out the 
four games in which he and Coleman had gone head to head. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman had missed two with injuries, and totaled 30 points in the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is on Coleman's side, however, and on O'Neal's, Mourning's, et al. 
</P>
<P>
 Weird it may be, when All-Star weekend doesn't have Magic and Bird talking 
trash, or any reports that Jordan played 36 holes of golf before the game, but 
it's happening. Everyone, young and old, will have to deal with it.

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; AFTER A YEAR'S ABSENCE, SELES' SEEDING IS A THORNY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unusual saga of Monica Seles took another curious turn last week when her 
name disappeared from the Women's Tennis Assn. computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 A player must compete in at least three tournaments in a 12-month period to 
maintain a ranking. Seles, who has not played since she was stabbed by a 
spectator last April 30 during a tournament at Hamburg, Germany, has 
participated in only two in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is, when Seles returns, should she be given a special 
dispensation -- namely a high seeding in the first tournament she enters? 
</P>
<P>
 She was ranked No. 1 at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a tough issue," fellow player Mary Joe Fernandez said. "She's going to 
be out of the game for almost a year. It's tough to put her (No.) 1 or 2 
because everybody else has worked very hard and deserves to be where they're 
at. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what they should do. They should give her some sort of 
acknowledgment or seeding, but it's tough to take away that spot from the No. 2 
or 3 player." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject of a special seeding consideration for Seles is on the agenda for 
a meeting of the Women's Tennis Council Feb. 27-28 at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Seles has given no indication as to when she might return to the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the Monica watch like everybody else," said Steve Simon, director of 
marketing for the Evert Cup Feb. 21-27 at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian 
Wells. "We all know that she's going to play at some time this year, and I 
think every tournament is hoping that theirs will be the (first) one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously think that our chances are as good as anybody else's, only 
because she's done well and I think she enjoyed her stay the one year she 
played here and won the tournament (in 1992)." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for International Management Group, which represents Seles, said 
their client, who had hoped to have recovered in time for last month's 
Australian Open, has not made any decisions about her schedule, "but has not 
ruled out any tournaments." 
</P>

 It doesn't rank with the passing of the Helms Bakery, the Herald-Examiner or 
the Pacific Electric red cars, but the Los Angeles Strings are no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strings, who brought three championships to the Forum and whose all-time 
roster includes Jimmy Connors, Chris Evert, Ilie Nastase, Martina Navratilova, 
Bjorn Borg and Billie Jean King, announced this month that they will not be 
part of the 1994 World TeamTennis season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sad only because it's something that I've done for so long," said 
Jeanie Buss, who since 1981 had run the team for her father, owner Jerry Buss. 
"But I don't feel that we didn't make our best effort. We tried so many 
different things -- bringing in Jimmy Connors, bringing in Borg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think where team tennis has been most successful was in the intimate 
stadiums, where the people could be right in on the action, but we just didn't 
have a facility (that would create that type of atmosphere)." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 teams that will compete in the league this summer, only the Phoenix 
Smash, whose home is the 19,100-seat America West Arena, will not play in a 
facility designed for tennis. The Newport Beach Dukes will again play their 
home matches at the John Wayne Tennis Club, which seats about 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Average attendance for 84 World TeamTennis matches last summer was 2,287, with 
the Strings drawing an average of 2,087 for seven home matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some facilities around the league, that would be standing-room only," Buss 
said. "As far as our attendance (is) compared to the rest of the league, we 
weren't bad. But we were one of only two teams playing in a facility like this. 
When you're talking about filling 10% of your capacity, that doesn't sound very 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she inquired about the possibility of renting a smaller facility to 
house the Strings, "but the goal of my department is to bring events to the 
Forum." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the seven dates left open by the Strings' demise would be filled by 
the Los Angeles Blades of Roller Hockey International, who have expanded their 
schedule, and by booking more concerts. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Unlike some of his more celebrated U.S. contemporaries, including Pete 
Sampras, Jim Courier, Michael Chang and Andre Agassi, Todd Martin went to 
college, playing for two seasons at Northwestern while studying linguistics. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had turned pro earlier, Martin said, he probably wouldn't be playing on 
the ATP tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes an awfully special person to be able to deal with the suffering and 
sacrifices you have to make to be on the tour," Martin told the New York Times. 
"One, as an 18-year-old, I wasn't a good enough tennis player. Two, I certainly 
wasn't emotionally prepared to live on my own for 40 weeks out of the year in 
this setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was perfectly comfortable living 40 weeks out of the year on my own at 
college, with hundreds of friends and teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 And now the 6-foot-6 Martin, 23, seems pretty comfortable on the tour, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Magazine named him the most improved male pro of 1993, and last month 
he reached the final of the Australian Open before losing to Sampras. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi's appearance in Helen Hunt's fantasy during a recent episode of 
the NBC sitcom, "Mad About You," lasted only slightly longer than his stay in 
last year's U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The character played by Hunt, Jamie, sat at a bus stop as Agassi, playing 
himself, approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, would you get a token out of my pocket?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hunt, standing up to retrieve it: "Here you go." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," said Agassi, walking out of the picture. 
</P>

 An Emmy nomination awaits. Tennis Notes

 Boris Becker, who returned to the ATP tour this month after taking time out 
for his Dec. 17 wedding and the birth of a son, said last week in Milan, Italy, 
that he will apply for a wild-card entry into the Newsweek Champions Cup Feb. 
28-March 6 at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells, but tournament officials 
have yet to hear from him. . . . Those attending the Newsweek Champions Cup 
will be the first to experience the ATP Tour Fan Fest, kind of a tennis theme 
park where fans can compare their grips to the top players' and time their 
serves. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin has been granted a wild-card entry into the Evert Cup Feb. 21-27 
at Grand Champions. . . . Top-ranked Steffi Graf, who is scheduled to play in 
the Evert Cup for the first time after pulling out at the last minute last year 
because of a pulled stomach muscle, is 60-2 since losing to Arantxa Sanchez 
Vicario in the final of the Citizen Cup at Hamburg, Germany, last May 2 -- the 
tournament in which Monica Seles was stabbed by a deranged fan of Graf's -- and 
has won 10 of the 11 tournaments she has entered, including the French Open, 
Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova, playing her last year of singles, is scheduled to make 
her only Southland appearance in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles Aug. 8-14 at 
Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. She is an eight-time winner of the 
event. . . . A record 69 players earned $100,000 or more on the women's tour 
last year. On the men's tour, 171 earned that much.

 India has yet to name its team for a first-round Davis Cup match against the 
United States March 25-27 on grass at New Delhi. Captain Tom Gullickson's U.S. 
team: Jim Courier and Todd Martin in singles, Patrick McEnroe and Richey 
Reneberg in doubles. . . . Players who use wheelchairs will be paired with 
those who don't in a unique doubles competition March 5-6 at Pierpont Racquet 
Club in Ventura.

 Colin Jackson has videotape of Greg Foster's 60-meter indoor hurdles world 
record, set in Los Angeles in 1987 and disputed by some who believe Foster 
jumped the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Jackson had two false starts before he was timed in 7.35 
seconds, 0.01 faster than Foster's mark, in a British-United States meet at 
Glasgow, Scotland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it was a flyer," said Jackson, a 26-year-old Welshman of Foster's 
record-setting run. "I used to think that the only way I was going to beat it 
was by getting the same sort of start. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson lost his bid for a double by finishing second in the 60-meter sprint 
to world and Olympic 100-meter champion Linford Christie, who won in 6.53 
seconds.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; SOME OF OTHER EVENTS BEAR WATCHING TOO

 Yes, America, there is more to the Winter Olympic figure skating competition 
than Tonya vs. Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief look: MEN 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first time that two Olympic figure skating champions have 
faced one another. The United States' Brian Boitano won in 1988, Ukraine's 
Viktor Petrenko in 1992, and both enjoyed the spoils as professionals before 
the International Skating Union passed a rule enabling them to return to 
serious competition. The other leading contender is Canada's Kurt Browning, a 
four-time world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrenko has emerged as the favorite, considering that neither Boitano nor 
Browning won his national championship this winter. Boitano, unable to fully 
recover from a knee injury, was second to Scott Davis. Browning finished behind 
Elvis Stojko. Elvis does live. PAIRS 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Russian intramural affair. And just like the Bolshoi vs. the Kirov, 
it's Moscow vs. St. Petersburg. The Muscovites, 1988 Olympic champions 
Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, appear to have the edge over Natalia 
Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev, the 1992 gold medalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The reigning world champions, Canadians Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, 
Russians Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, Germans Mandy Wotzel and Ingo 
Steuer and Czechs Radka Kovarikova and Rene Novotny, who train at Lake 
Arrowhead, are medal contenders. So are U.S. champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand 
of Costa Mesa, who could finish anywhere from third to seventh. Fifth place 
would be considered outstanding. DANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after they wowed the figure skating world with "Bolero" in winning 
the gold medal at Sarajevo, Great Britain's great Jayne Torvill and Christopher 
Dean are back. But they had some difficulty in their first major competition 
last month, barely winning the European championship ahead of two Russian 
teams, Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov, and Maia Usova and Alexander Zhulin. 
Expect another close decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The only U.S. team is Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, a married couple 
who will be competing two weeks after her father was stabbed to death by her 
brother. Competing so that they can take their family's mind off the tragedy, 
they would be satisfied with a top-10 finish. RANDY HARVEY

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOW THE HARD PART AWAITS KERRIGAN; FIGURE 
SKATING: SHE HAS A HISTORY OF FAILING IN BIG EVENTS. COMPETITION SHOULD BE WIDE 
OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first time the lords and ladies of international figure skating got a good 
look at Nancy Kerrigan, they were less than impressed. She was in first place 
after the technical program at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Tacoma, Wash., but 
succumbed to the pressure in the freestyle and plopped into fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Like handicappers standing at the rail to check out a young thoroughbred, they 
agreed that she had good form. But she was skittish. Perhaps, they said, 
blinders would help. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Jane Pauley, who probably had never met the skater or seen her 
compete until she interviewed her a few weeks back, told a national television 
audience that she cannot believe anyone could ever have concluded that Kerrigan 
is fragile, it is apparent that NBC's researchers did not do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither have the people who are setting her up as the gold-medal favorite in 
the women's competition that begins on Feb. 23.  
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say she cannot win. But even if she had not been set back by 
the injuries to her right knee in the most overblown attack since Grenada, and 
even if she was not competing against a field that includes world champion 
Oksana Baiul of Ukraine, four-time European champion Surya Bonaly of France and 
two-time world bronze medalist Chen Lu of China -- and, as of Saturday, 
national champion Tonya Harding -- Nancy Kerrigan would still have had to 
overcome her No. 1 nemesis, Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 A welder's daughter from Stoneham, Mass., who graciously accepted many 
responsibilities around the house to help out her legally blind mother, and who 
played hockey with her brothers in her leisure time, Kerrigan, her coaches say, 
was a tough kid outside of a figure skating rink. Inside one, she froze like an 
ice carving. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kerrigan returned home from the Goodwill Games in 1990, coaches Evy and 
Mary Scotvold sent her to a sports psychologist, and if the 
positive-mental-attitude people were thinking of using a poster child, Kerrigan 
was it. She has never skated better, before or since, than she did in 1991. Her 
placement in the national championships was only third, but the competition was 
so daunting that future Olympic gold-medalist Kristi Yamaguchi was the 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991 national championships at Minneapolis, Harding was a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the ice, she revealed that she had married Jeff Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you spell that? a reporter asked, unaware that someday the name would 
be as well known in the United States as Capone, Dillinger and Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "H-A-R-D-I-N-G," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, she revealed an undisputed national champion. Perhaps because of 
her asthma, but more likely because of her inattention to serious training, 
Harding had never been considered more than a diamond in the rough. But, 
arriving in Minneapolis with all her edges polished, she was a glittering 
vision of the female figure skater of the future, one who combined superb 
athleticism with artistry and exuberance to create spontaneous combustion. 
</P>
<P>
 She became only the second woman, the first American, to perform a clean 
triple axel -- the most difficult triple jump because, despite its name, it 
actually demands 3 1/2 revolutions -- then appeared to float above the ice for 
the rest of her four-minute freestyle program, earning raves from the audience 
and the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting transfixed among the crowd that afternoon was 10-year-old Michelle 
Kwan, a talented novice who was not particularly committed to the sport. Until 
she saw Harding. Kwan told her parents that she would work harder so that one 
day she could be among the best. She wanted to be like Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kwan went home to Torrance to fulfill her promise -- only three years 
later, at 13, she finished second to Harding in the national championships in 
Detroit -- Kerrigan, 24, and Harding, 23, have not fulfilled theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, a reserved New Englander, did not enjoy sharing her innermost fears 
with a sports psychologist and quit going after the 1991 competitive season. 
She won the bronze medal in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, 
behind Yamaguchi and Japan's Midori Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Harding, who whines that the snooty figure skating Establishment 
never gives her a break because she is from the wrong side of the tracks in 
Portland, Ore., had third place in the 1992 Olympic trials in Orlando, Fla., 
gift-wrapped for her. Ohioan Lisa Ervin outskated her, but, at only 14, she 
was, in effect, told by the judges to wait her turn. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave Harding a plane ticket to France, but, ignoring advice from her 
coach, she chose not to use it until three days before her competition and 
finished fourth, a testimony to her natural ability considering that she was 
knock-kneed from jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, after Yamaguchi's retirement, Kerrigan and Harding were 
expected to battle for the national title in Phoenix. But Harding was a virtual 
no-show, finishing fourth, and the competition became a coronation for a shaky 
Kerrigan. She did not seem comfortable as America's new ice princess, on or off 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you aware you've been called the Irish Katarina Witt?" a reporter asked, 
figuring it was a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Irish," she huffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's lowest tide was to come. In a performance reminiscent of Tacoma in 
1990, she finished first in the technical program in last year's World 
Championships in Prague, then disintegrated in the freestyle, dropping to 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 As she tearfully waited for her scores, she told the Scotvolds: "I just want 
to die." At a pro-am in the Sports Arena a month later, she fell twice and 
finished second to Caryn Kadavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Ferguson, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., expressed concern 
that Kerrigan might be one of those athletes more comfortable out of the 
spotlight, happier in second or third than first. 
</P>
<P>
 Evy Scotvold fumed, telling Kerrigan that he saw no reason for her to continue 
in her bid to return to the Winter Olympics if she had no more mental resolve 
than she showed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a tactic, but Kerrigan responded positively, resuming 
sessions with a sports psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to Piruetten, an international competition in the Olympic 
Amphitheatre in nearby Hamar, where the Olympic competition will be held, early 
this winter, and won, beating Bonaly and Chen. She went to a pro-am in 
Philadelphia in December and won there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed in Philadelphia that some figure skating experts now considered her 
the Olympic favorite, she said: "I think I'm the favorite, too. I competed 
against all the contenders except Oksana at Piruetten, and I beat them all. I 
feel I'm good enough to win, and I know it." 
</P>
<P>
 She has not competed since then because of circumstances beyond her control, 
and no one can predict how she will hold up physically or emotionally, but it 
could still happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The waifish Baiul, abandoned by her father when she was 2, orphaned by the 
death of her mother at 13, and a world champion at 15, has lost some of her 
following in the last year. She still floats like a butterfly, but her jumps 
are inconsistent. Bonaly has all the tricks, but the judges have never warmed 
to her three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-ice-shavings attack. Chen is mechanical. 
Witt, a two-time gold medalist returning at 28, is figure skating's past. Kwan 
is the future. Harding is the wild card.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; YOUNG U.S. TEAM LOOKING FOR GOLD; HOCKEY: 
THOUGH SEEDED SIXTH, THE AMERICANS ARE CONFIDENT. QUEST BEGINS TODAY AGAINST 
FRANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Its exuberance tempered but not extinguished by six months and 61 games of 
preparation, the U.S. Olympic hockey team begins its gold-medal mission today 
against France. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I've been dreaming about since I was 8 years old," said 
Craig Johnson, the left wing for Todd Marchant and Peter Ferraro on the team's 
top-scoring line. "I think we're really prepared, and we have some real 
confidence going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no U.S. team has won the Olympics in a foreign country -- the 1960 
team won at Squaw Valley, Calif., and the stunning 1980 victory was 
accomplished at Lake Placid, N.Y. -- there is reason for U.S. high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly believe we have a chance for a medal, and I'm not just speaking 
hopefully," said center Peter Ciavaglia, who joined the team 10 days ago after 
playing in the Swedish Elite League. "We're shooting for gold. I can't say that 
if we won a bronze we'd be unhappy, but right now we wouldn't trade a 
guaranteed bronze for the chance we have." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team is seeded sixth in the 12-team field, well above the 10th-seeded 
French team. However, the United States and France played a 4-4 tie on Feb. 5 
in Rouen, France, a game in which the United States squandered a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Too little discipline by the U.S. team, and it will struggle as it did in 
Rouen, where only a late goal by Peter Ferraro averted an embarrassing defeat. 
Too many mistakes by goaltender Mike Dunham, who has stopped 64 of 68 shots in 
his last two games after giving up 35 goals in a five-game stretch, and the 
offense will be under pressure. Too much offensive pressure, and the defense, 
the team's most vulnerable element, will be thrown off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first five minutes of the first game of the entire Olympics, with a young 
team like we have, this one game could be the catalyst to send us toward a 
medal," Ciavaglia said. "People are going to have question marks about us after 
that. We learned we can't lose our patience against teams like Sweden and 
France. If we have to chip it off the boards, dump it in, we will. We've been 
burnt before and gotten frustrated, and we can't let that happen again. We've 
got to keep attacking, but be smart and not force the attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tim Taylor is concerned about his team maintaining its concentration if 
it has a slow start or is victimized by an unfortunate bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players are young," he said. "We can't change that. We can only make them 
play more maturely and with as much poise as possible. Discipline is the area 
we've made the most progress in and it's the area we have the longest to go. 
These kids were all like street fighters when we started. They've got to be 
patient and not take retaliatory penalties, but stand up and support each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of our game plan is to not get frustrated with their defensive 
play. You have to get good goaltending, and you have to be patient defensively. 
It's not a situation where you can count on offense to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor juggled his line combinations through last Wednesday's pre-Olympic 
finale. The offense will be sparked by the Marchant line and the line of late 
arrivals Ciavaglia and Ted Drury (Calgary Flames) flanking center Brian 
Rolston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a point where we feel we have four very solid lines," Taylor said. 
"I think that's our best approach -- four lines with short and hard shifts." 
</P>
<P>
 That and solid goaltending. Dunham, who admitted he had never felt so 
discouraged as he did during his slump, has regained the assurance that 
deserted him in December and January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost some sleep, but right now I'm ready to go," he said. "(Today's game) 
is just another hockey game, and I'm going to have a lot of other big hockey 
games in my career after this. . . . We've played so many games, we know each 
other's ins and outs. There's no question we're ready and we're confident with 
each other."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; PARISIEN'S STORY IS BAD NEWS/BAD NEWS; 
SKIING: SHE HAD A TRAGIC '92, WHEN SHE LOST A MEDAL AND THEN HER BROTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took U.S. skier Julie Parisien 20 years to reach the mountaintop in ski 
racing, but less than one year to lose an Olympic gold medal and her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for life's fairness. So much for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Grief, cloaked in degrees, became Parisien's night stalker. The Olympic loss 
struck first -- what a gnawing pain it seemed then -- on the slopes of Meribel, 
France, at the 1992 Albertville Games. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before, Parisien had crashed into a recreational skier and lost four 
front teeth. A few days later, she cracked her wrist on a slalom gate in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But she charged into Albertville, fought off the pain, flashed her newly 
capped teeth, was fitted for a cast, taped her injured wrist to her ski pole 
and went on her Olympic way, choosing to ignore this run of misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien posted the fastest time after the first run of the Olympic slalom. 
The gold was hers to lose. Between races, she went back to her room, alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so long between runs, that was the hard part," Parisien recalls. "It 
was about 2 1/2 hours. Usually we have about 45 minutes. Looking back, I would 
have stayed and hung out with the rest of the competitors. It wasn't that I 
thought too much, but I think I got a little complacent, a little mellow. It 
was like, 'Cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien wins gold in France. Cool. No, magnificent . 
</P>
<P>
 So how come the second run was slow motion, compared to the first? She knew 
she had blown it mid-run and expected the worst, then looked up at the leader 
board and found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien did not simply squander the gold, she finished fourth -- the ultimate 
Olympic indignity -- losing the bronze by five-hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Could there be anything worse? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Dec. 17, while Parisien was away at a World Cup race in Canada, older 
brother Jean-Paul, her mentor, was killed when his car was run off the road by 
a driver only miles from the family home in Auburn, Maine. J.P., a student at 
the University of Colorado, was returning home for the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hit-and-run, but they found the guy 15 minutes later," Parisien 
says, recounting the story. "There was black ice around this corner, and J.P. 
was going about 40, under the speed limit, and this guy pulled out to pass him. 
He was a disabled driver as well, he was driving with hand controls. (He was 
also) a habitual drunk. He rear-ended J.P. and he spun around and hit a tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those relatives who seek justice to ensure closure on tragedy, Parisien 
did not involve herself with the post-crash particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's life is ruined already," she says. "He's a paraplegic, he's a drunk 
and now he's killed someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the emotional weight of the last two years, it comes as no great 
surprise that Parisien -- the world's top-ranked slalom skier a year ago -- is 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 These were to have been the Olympic Games of redemption, a chance to right the 
wrong of '92. Patience is not one of Parisien's virtues, so it had to be fate 
that she would have to wait only two years before Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Parisien begins the 1994 Olympics battered and bruised emotionally, with 
only a few top-15 finishes to show for her season. She is no longer among the 
top 20 slalom skiers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? In the weeks after J.P.'s death, Parisien had jumped right 
back onto her skis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to get back," she says. "I couldn't mope. You grieve, you go 
through this whole terrible process, but it's a process, and you just have to 
keep things as normal as you can. Your mind and your heart are so gone. But you 
go out with your friends, even though it's hard; you go out with people who are 
going to make you feel safe. You put on a good face, you go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother was gone, but Parisien swears he was there in some form, propping 
her up. Three weeks after Christmas, when Parisien slightly twisted her knee, 
J.P. kept pushing her, all the way to the World Championships in Morioka, 
Japan, at which Parisien got a silver medal in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, afterward, she was almost despondent because she hadn't won gold for her 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien continued to feel J.P.'s presence. Together, perhaps, they were 
destined to take the gold in Lillehammer and make some sense of his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere she looked, there was J.P., in some incarnation. Sometimes he took 
the form of her other brother, Rob. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when it was Robby turning into J.P." she says. "He'd say 
something that sounded so much like him. There are mystical feelings. You feel 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Parisien sought a fresh start. She requested that she train 
independently of the team with Rob Clayton, who had coached her on the Alpine B 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team agreed to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Parisien struggled to put the pieces back together, it was arranged for 
former World Cup champion Tamara McKinney to accompany her to Italy in October 
for pre-World Cup training. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of this -- not Clayton, not McKinney -- translated into results, and 
after several mediocre performances early in the season, the Clayton plan was 
scrapped and Parisien returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien's slump continued through Christmas. In fact, she had to rally in 
January with a couple of top-15 performances just to meet the U.S. team's 
Olympic qualifying criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has yet to crack the top 10, Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine 
director, thinks there is time to repair Parisien before the gates open on her 
specialty, the slalom, on Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julie has really struggled at times," Major said last week. "It's been a real 
emotional battle."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; SHE'S A MOGUL MAGNATE; 1992 GOLD MEDALIST 
DONNA WEINBRECHT DOMINATED FREESTYLE SKIING BEFORE KNEE INJURY, AND NOW SHE'S 
BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She was the Michael Jordan of her sport. Donna Weinbrecht dominated freestyle 
moguls skiing almost to the point of tedium. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no reason for her to try breaking new ground in a training run on 
Nov. 17, 1992, at Breckenridge, Colo. Weinbrecht could have bowed out a 
champion, on her terms. You know, go to the Bahamas, lie low for a month, get 
restless, then try out for the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Weinbrecht had considered, at 27, walking away from it all with her 
cache of 25 World Cup victories, three overall titles, one world championship, 
five United States titles and the first sanctioned Olympic gold medal for 
women's moguls, at the 1992 Albertville Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Weinbrecht was sure what she was doing that day at Breckenridge, 
trying something so daffy as a daffy twister , an aerial maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having a hard time mentally, after winning the (Olympic) gold," 
Weinbrecht acknowledges. "When I first started the freestyle thing, I thought I 
would have retired in 1992, and here I was on the slopes again. I was with a 
lack of focus and desire. I knew I wanted to ski, but yet I couldn't rekindle 
those kinds of feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht proceeded with the daffy, but the only thing that twisted was her 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 As her coach, Jeff Good, rushed to her side, Weinbrecht lay in agony on the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept looking up at the sky and saying, 'Oh God! Oh God! Did I blow out my 
knee?' " she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 She blew it out. Anterior cruciate ligament. Three words skiers -- and all 
athletes -- hate to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 They took Weinbrecht to the famed skier's surgeon, Richard Steadman in Vail, 
where it was hoped her knee could be reconstructed well enough for her to climb 
stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 What a way to go out, some said. 
</P>
<P>
 What a reason to come back, Weinbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, oddly, put her at peace. Her soul searching was over. She had 
found her motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the injury gave me a focus to come back," she says now. "It gave me a 
second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht missed the 1992-93 World Cup season. It might have been a lonely 
time for rehabilitation and introspection but for a CBS television crew that 
became an appendage. The TV guys were making an Olympic documentary. The camera 
crew introduced itself to Weinbrecht in the operating room, then announced it 
would be staying for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much tape in the can, Weinbrecht figured she had to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht proved in her season away she was also the champion of rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took the path of most resistance, not least resistance," said Good. "It 
would have been much easier to bail, mentally and physically." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht wouldn't know for sure about the comeback until more than a year 
after her injury, Dec. 11, 1993, as she stood at the start of her first World 
Cup competition at Tignes, France. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Tignes in 1992 that Weinbrecht had claimed the Olympic gold with 
20,000 partisans rooting against her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even relate to it," she recalls of the Olympic crowd. "It was like 
a concert, and you're on stage. It was too hard to fathom that all those people 
were looking at you and screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Tignes was different this time. Weinbrecht's right knee was now encased in a 
high-tech carbon-titanium brace. 
</P>
<P>
 She felt no pain, but the hinges of the brace that brushed against her left 
leg served as a constant reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 She was nervous, but told herself, "Donna, you took this challenge. You didn't 
feel fulfilled and ready to retire yet, so you got to take the ups and downs." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht won the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As in figure skating, freestyle skiing is a judged event, with skiers graded 
on technical and artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Weinbrecht's being the sentimental favorite swayed the judges that day 
in Tignes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinbrecht didn't stop there. Remarkably, she won the first six World Cup 
moguls events and is the prohibitive favorite to successfully defend her 
Olympic gold when moguls competition begins here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Good, a self-described eternal optimist, could not have predicted 
Weinbrecht's return. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is, without question, the most unique individual that's ever been in 
freestyle," Good says. "The thing she does best is compete. I think if you did 
physical testing, probably athletes on other teams, and on our team, are more 
fit than she is. But there is no way of measuring who is competitive on contest 
day. And no one's ever been more consistent than she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Steadman, the surgeon, is as surprised as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good enough for skiing," Steadman said of his repair work. "But to 
come back the next year and be the best in the world?" 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, who is going to stop Weinbrecht. 
</P>
<P>
 Freestyle is the one Olympic skiing discipline the United States has 
dominated. While the rest of the world is catching up, Weinbrecht's toughest 
international threat here figures to be Stine Lise Hattestad, who won the World 
Cup moguls title last season in Weinbrecht's absence. Hattestad, a Norwegian, 
will have the home-slope advantage here. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht also figures to be challenged by teammates Liz McIntyre and Ann 
Battelle. 
</P>
<P>
 But she envisions an even tougher opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself," Weinbrecht says. "Dealing with myself." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Weinbrecht's career more impressive is that she got a relatively 
late start in competitive skiing. She grew up in West Milford, N.J., where she 
began skiing when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Her racing career blossomed in high school, after her father had built a 
second home in Killington, Vt. Weinbrecht initially raced Alpine, but was soon 
drawn to the artistry and freedom that come with moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, she attended art school for a year before moving to 
Killington, where she waited tables at a pizza pub and tried to convince her 
parents that she was training diligently for the U.S. freestyle team. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom said, 'Yeah, right,' " Weinbrecht recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht's rise was swift. She placed 15th at nationals in 1986, fourth in 
1987, was named the World Cup rookie of the year in 1988 and has been virtually 
unstoppable since. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the decision to stagger the Summer and Winter Olympics greatly 
influenced her comeback decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a second chance, and I'm going to seize that chance," she said. "I was 
so affected by '92 and the Olympic spirit. It's definitely colored my life in 
remarkable ways. It's filled every dream I thought of the Olympics being. To 
take part, and be a returning gold medalist, it's very exciting."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DIFFICULTY HELPS THESE LUGERS GAIN 
PERSPECTIVE; PREVIEW: TRAGEDIES HURT, BUT MAKE GAMES EVEN MORE SPECIAL FOR 
CAMMY MYLER AND BETHANY CALCATERRA-MCMAHON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the snow-white sparkle and media avalanche of the Winter Olympics, U.S. 
flag bearer Cammy Myler said, it can be difficult to retain perspective, but 
she and U.S. luge teammate, Bethany Calcaterra-McMahon, have an emotional feel 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luge has always been the most important thing in my life, that and school, 
but it's really just a sport," Myler said, weighing it against her brother 
Tim's fight with colon cancer in an Albany, N.Y., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra-McMahon, in a harrowing accident during a December World Cup race 
in Winterberg, Germany, crashed into German coach Sepp Lenz as he swept snow 
from the track, severing his right leg below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra-McMahon had been cleared to slide, but the partially deaf Lenz, in 
the middle of one of the fastest curves on one of the world's fastest tracks, 
did not hear the announcement or the sound of the approaching sled. 
</P>
<P>
 On her back on the sled, Calcaterra-McMahon said she caught sight of Lenz in 
the distance but could only shudder, hoping he would be able to scramble from 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing the German coach standing there and thinking, 'There is 
nothing I can do,' " she said. "I was going 75 m.p.h. There's no time to 
adjust, no time to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could do was think, 'My God, I'm going to hit him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra-McMahon, 19 and in her first year of senior luge competition, 
remained on her sled despite the impact, slowing to about 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept hoping that maybe I had hit the broom or that his jacket had fallen on 
the track as he got off, but then I saw that I had blood all over me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was traumatic, of course, but the remarkable thing was that he was more 
concerned with how I was than with his leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reattach it failed, but Lenz has been fitted with a prosthesis and 
is here, coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him the other day and he assured me again it was strictly an accident," 
Calcaterra-McMahon said. "The fact that he's up and doing fine makes it easier 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates were very supportive, and I think it helped that I didn't have 
much time to think about it. I had to get back on the sled the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 In completion of the suspended race, an Olympic qualifier for U.S. sledders, 
Calcaterra-McMahon finished fifth, her best World Cup performance of a rookie 
season in which she was 12th overall, clearly demonstrating the toughness and 
focus that also have marked Myler's 10-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time Olympian at 25 and a senior geography and pre-medical major at 
Dartmouth, Myler had right-shoulder surgery to correct a series of off-track 
dislocations after finishing fifth in the 1992 Olympics, then dislocated her 
left shoulder lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never know when it's going to be out of place, but I'm as ready as I can 
be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invariably, things happen in life. You just have to deal with them. I'm 
trying to do that with Tim. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him. He got me 
started." 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old former sledder who narrowly missed making the 1980 Olympic team, 
Tim Myler has also encouraged his sister to retain her focus during his 
illness, as has a supportive Duncan Kennedy, whose mother, Betsy, recovering 
from October surgery for breast cancer, is in Norway to watch her son compete 
in the men's singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom is doing fine now, but I think I have a feel for what Cammy is going 
through," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myler acknowledged that but would not discuss her brother's status. He had 
surgery on Christmas Eve and has been hospitalized for six weeks. Myler said 
her parents are remaining in Albany through the Olympics. The emotional pull, 
she said, made her selection to carry the flag in the opening ceremony even 
more special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm representing the U.S. team, my sport and, in many ways, my 
family," she said. "I know how much it's going to mean to them under the 
circumstances because I know how much it means to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to Tim every other day and he always tells me about the pretty nurses 
on his floor and asks me to get a win for him," Myler said. 
</P>
<P>
 She got one in Altenberg, Germany, in the final World Cup race of the recent 
season, tying for fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has never won an Olympic medal in luge. Tim Myler's sister 
is hopeful but understands that all that glitters is not gold.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK; DOWNHILL SKIER MOE CAUTIOUS 
DESPITE CONFIDENT FINAL RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unwilling to repeat Bill Johnson's "called shot" in 1984, American skier Tommy 
Moe would not predict victory in today's Olympic downhill at Kvitfjell. 
</P>
<P>
 But after finishing fourth in Saturday's final training run, Moe is perhaps 
more confident than at any point in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it dialed in today," he said after his run. "I still think I can go 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Because many racers hold back in training, not wanting to tip their hands, 
practice runs are not normally a reliable indicator of who might win. 
</P>
<P>
 But fourth is always better than 40th. And there was no sand-bagging by Moe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me good vibes," he said. "I'm skiing real well right now. I wanted 
to treat this as a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the downhill at the 1984 Sarajevo Games, Johnson told reporters that 
everyone else would be skiing for second. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's confidence was always loud, whereas Moe's is quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be looking to say I'm going to win the race," he said. 
"There are 10 guys within 10 seconds (of his time)." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so sure of himself is AJ Kitt, Moe's teammate, who finished 26th in his 
training run, then skied away, refusing to talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Rasmussen continued his steady work, finishing 14th Saturday, only two 
places below Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, one of the race favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Pietro Vitalini was fastest in the final training run with a time of 
1:45.86, 0.12 seconds ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ski racers have trained most of the week under overcast skies, producing a 
backdrop known as "flat light." They don't like the condition because the 
haziness and lack of shadows make it difficult to read the contours of the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Kitt offered a comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like driving 60 m.p.h. in fog with your high beams on -- you slow down," 
he said. "We get the same feeling, but we don't slow down. It's like skiing 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, however, the sun made its first appearance of the week. If it shines 
on race day, it could drastically change conditions and racer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather remains cold, hovering around zero, generally making for a slower 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the weather being that cold, you've got to have fast skis," Moe said. "I 
think I've got them." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 The snow storm that paralyzed much of the East Coast of the United States the 
last two days resulted in additional Olympics coverage for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Georgetown-Providence college basketball game the network had planned 
to telecast Saturday was postponed because the Hoyas were unable to fly out of 
Washington, CBS substituted two hours of the Olympics. 
</P>

 CBS had live coverage of portions of the Norway-Russia and Austria-Germany

 Ending what had become a minor drama, U.S. Coach Tim Taylor designated Mike 
Dunham to start in goal today against France. Taylor also indicated Dunham will 
start Tuesday's game against Slovakia and Garth Snow will face Canada on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham was projected to be the team's top goaltender since training camp began 
last August, but his struggles in December and January, coupled with Snow's 
strong play, had jeopardized his starting job. Dunham, a 1990 fourth-round 
draft pick by the New Jersey Devils, was 22-9-2 in pre-Olympic play with a 3.78 
goals-against average and an .873 save percentage. Snow, who was 3-2 in five 
games with the Quebec Nordiques this season, was 13-5-3 in pre-Olympic play 
with a 3.22 GAA and .884 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor informed the players of his choice late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate because we have two strong goaltenders who are capable of 
playing at this level," Taylor said. "It wasn't an easy decision to make, but 
Mike has a bit more international experience than Garth. That doesn't mean 
Garth won't have an opportunity to play. I anticipate giving both goaltenders a 
chance to play here." 
</P>

<P>
 Six players on the French hockey team have ties to the Canadian province of 
Quebec -- five more than the number of Quebecers on the Canadian squad. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded French team, which faces the United States today, has several 
Quebec natives and several others who played junior hockey there. Defenseman 
Steven Woodburn was born in Montreal and played in Shawinigan, Verdun and 
Laval. Defenseman Serge Poudrier and forward Benoit Laporte were both born in 
the Quebec town of Trois Rivieres. Right wing Arnaud Briand played for St. Jean 
of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and was chosen 240th by Edmonton in 
the 1983 NHL draft and right wing Franck Pajonkowski played junior hockey in 
Shawinigan and Chicoutimi.  
</P>
<P>
 Center Pierrick Maia has ties to both Quebec and the United States, having 
played for Bowling Green and for Victoriaville, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian team has only one Quebec native, forward Jean Yves Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden has long produced world-class hockey players, and so has Finland. 
They're seeded second and seventh, respectively, in the Olympic tournament. But 
Norway, the host country, has never contributed many players to the NHL and is 
seeded 11th here. 
</P>
<P>
 That lowly status could change soon, George Kingston said. He coached the 
Norwegian national team from 1989-91, having been recruited to help Norway 
create facilities and plans to stage these Games. Kingston, who went on to 
coach the San Jose Sharks in their expansion season, is now director of 
operations for Hockey Canada, the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norway has improved over the past few years, no question about it," he said. 
"They're improving because they're gaining experience playing against solid, 
A-pool (top-notch) nations. The only way you can improve is through playing 
against the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Robert Schistad, who grew up in Canada and moved to Norway seven 
years ago, is optimistic the Olympics will help hockey in his adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds are good, but they're not crazy like the fans back home," he said. 
"In a few places here, hockey is big, but it hasn't developed that kind of 
support everywhere. It's going to take a while because we don't have that many 
rinks. But we're definitely improving and I hope it keeps going that way."

 Defending Olympic champion George Hackl of Germany drew the No. 1 starting 
assignment for today's first of two heats in men's luge.

 Wendel Suckow and Duncan Kennedy of the United States will start 10th and 
12th, respectively, with the top tier of 12 reversing order for the second 
heat.The final two heats will be held Monday.

NORTHRIDGE OPENS TIGHTLY BONDED; CAMARADERIE DEVELOPED AFTER EARTHQUAKE COULD 
BENEFIT SOFTBALL TEAM IN TITLE QUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Togetherness. Coaches teach it and clergy preach it, but perhaps only a 
natural disaster can make it absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Cal State Northridge softball team has been 
as together as is humanly possible. In fact, for about a week, a majority of 
Matador players lived under a single cracked ceiling -- in the Reseda home of 
senior center fielder Jen Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposed to go to Big Bear for our bonding thing," said Fleming, 
whose family was host to almost two dozen Northridge athletes. "Instead, the 
earthquake was our bonding." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to the mountains surely would have been more fun, but probably far 
less effective. The Matadors, an already confident group, say they have found a 
source of additional strength by becoming more of a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of teams out there, but how many have gone through what 
we've been through?" said senior right fielder Terri Pearson. "There is a 
difference knowing I can count on my teammates not only in a softball 
situation, but also if I need a place to live or if I need food or if I'm 
scared and need somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team pulled together so much during the earthquake. You've never seen so 
much generosity." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is likely to need the added boost because obstacles still abound. 
The Matadors, 48-9-1 last season, are at less than tip-top form as they open 
today with a doubleheader at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake drove many Northridge players from their homes and forced the 
team to lag far behind its training schedule. Several players have sore backs 
and arms, kinks that are normally worked out by now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors not only are behind in practice time but also in practice space. 
Portable trailers that have been moved on campus as makeshift classrooms have 
been placed over a practice field adjacent to the softball diamond and batting 
cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming expects the environment to actually add -- someday -- to Northridge's 
home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are going to come in and see all this mess and they're going to be all 
shook up," she said. "Once we get used to it, we'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the conditions are yet another inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which was ranked second in the nation much of last season, should 
have its best-ever team. The Matadors are rated between third and sixth in 
preseason polls and have six regulars, plus their entire pitching staff, 
returning. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Calcante and Scia Maumausolo, the school's first Division I softball 
All-Americans, should provide plenty of offense. Calcante, a senior outfielder, 
is the school's home run leader with 25 in her career. She is coming off a 
season in which she batted .343 with 12 homers and 51 runs batted in. 
Maumausolo batted .307 with seven homers and 28 RBIs as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming, the Matadors' leadoff hitter, batted .294 with 20 RBIs and scored 27 
runs. Tamara Ivie, another senior, batted .288, slugged nine home runs and led 
the Matadors with a .393 on-base percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's pitching staff has a pair of top right-handers, Kathy Blake and 
Amy Windmiller, in addition to a solid ace in the hole, Jennifer Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 A trio of pitchers, and three different looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who was 22-3, keeps the ball down and away. Windmiller, who struck out 
an average of one batter per inning while posting a 19-6 record, throws a nasty 
rise pitch. Richardson, who won her only seven decisions, keeps batters 
guessing with off-speed pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a great spot," said Coach Gary Torgeson, who plans to use Richardson 
more often to keep Blake and Windmiller fresh. "I have three pitchers I have a 
lot of confidence in." 
</P>
<P>
 The only changes on defense are at catcher and second base. Maumausolo, the 
designated hitter last season, takes over at catcher. Ivie, a first-team 
All-Western Athletic Conference selection at first base, moves over to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Hunt, a transfer from Cal State Fullerton, is the first baseman, and her 
understudy, Kelli Koens, will serve as designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie is a step slower than her predecessor, Denise Swank, but she is smart and 
played well at second for a top amateur team last summer. She also has 
approached the switch with a positive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to win with me at second base, fine," Ivie said. "I don't care 
where I play as long as we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Maumausolo is not a fast runner, but she has a strong arm, deceptively quick 
hands and is an intimidating presence behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, who has hurt Northridge in the past with extra-base hits, provides 
additional batting pop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have even more power than we did last year," said Torgeson, whose club hit 
an NCAA-record 40 home runs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to their positions are shortstop Vicky Rios, third baseman Shannon 
Jones, left fielder Calcante, center fielder Fleming and Pearson, the right 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is good enough to win a national championship," Torgeson said. 
"They're confident enough, they're experienced enough. We have the pitching and 
we have the hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had all of the above last season too, but lost two of three games 
in the World Series. In the elimination game, Northridge was no-hit by UCLA 
All-American Lisa Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped hitting at a bad time," Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the upcoming season, Northridge has a WAC championship to defend on its 
way to what the Matadors hope will be a second chance for a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson genuinely seems more concerned about reaching the playoffs than he is 
about how his team will perform should it get there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors play their first 19 games away from their home diamond -- 10 
against highly regarded teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're behind, but if any team is capable of pulling through all this, it's 
this team," Torgeson said. "They know they're good and they have a good healthy 
outlook on what they can do. They're cocky. Nothing bothers them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, nothing compares to what they already have been through. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Pearson put it, "Let's put it in perspective: If we can survive an 
earthquake, regroup, and put our lives back together like we have, we can win a 
national championship."

DIGEST: BERNARDI LEAVES BURROUGHS FOR ASSISTANT POST AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Bernardi, who turned around Burroughs High's football fortunes as a 
first-year coach in 1993, resigned Friday and accepted a job as an assistant to 
Coach Terry Donahue at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, who came to Burroughs last season after 12 years as an assistant at 
Arizona and UCLA under Larry Smith, led the Indians to 5-6 record and exceeded 
expectations by taking an inexperienced team to the Southern Section playoffs. 
Burroughs had finished 0-10 the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi's decision did not surprise Burbank Unified School District trustee 
Bob Dunivant, Burroughs' former football coach of more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the way he ran practices and handled himself on the sidelines -- he's an 
excellent coach and he got everything out of the kids," Dunivant said. "I'm 
sorry to see him go. We would like to have had him stay a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi's departure means Burbank district officials will have to find two 
football coaches in short order. Expected this week is the naming of a new 
coach at Burbank High. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Paul, the Moorpark High backup quarterback last year, will remain at 
Moorpark next season because the Southern Section ruled he would have been 
ineligible had he transferred to Thousand Oaks, said his father, George Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 The Section made its ruling because George Paul made contact with Thousand 
Oaks assistant Bob Shoup to discuss the potential transfer, a violation of 
California Interscholastic Federation rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," George Paul said. "He will stay at Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is keeping Paul, a sophomore, Moorpark Coach Rob Dearborn was 
hardly overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the kid is not happy at Moorpark, he should have the right to go where he 
pleases," he said. "The shame is this coach got in the way and ruined this 
kid's chances to go somewhere where he would have been happy."

MIKE PENNER: JORDAN'S NOT DOING ANY HARM TRYING OUT FOR WHITE SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . . Michael Jordan: So what's the fuss? 
World's greatest basketball player, producer of three NBA titles for Jerry 
Reinsdorf's Chicago Bulls, wants his own private baseball fantasy camp and 
Reinsdorf, who also owns the White Sox, is in a position to help. And he who 
helps Jordan helps himself, since a happy Michael Jordan might someday deem 
Reinsdorf's Bulls worthy of a comeback. It's called protecting your investment. 
Meanwhile, the rest of Major League Baseball needs to lighten up. What's the 
worst thing that can happen by giving Jordan a spring training tryout? He 
embarrasses himself against live pitching, is dispatched to minor league camp 
and we can all go back to watching wind sprints and bunt drills. Aren't you the 
least bit curious? Those people who would deny Jordan his turn in the batter's 
box ought to go work for the NFL, where novelty and fun are discouraged at 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 John Orton: He couldn't hit major league pitching, either, yet the Angels 
invited him to training camp six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers: His take on the Jordan tryout is that "when you're in a two-team 
baseball situation like Chicago is, when you've got the Cubs and the White Sox, 
it's a good way to capture the press for eight weeks." Exactly. Nothing wrong 
with that. It beats writing and talking about the baseball owners' Blockheaded 
Decision of the Week. Jordan breaks the monotony and if a media circus is the 
result, Rodgers suspects White Sox Manager Gene Lamont can live with it. 
"Sometimes, it can help you," Rodgers says, "by diverting attention and 
pressure away from the young players. . . . I'm sure Bo Jackson will receive 
90% of the press at our camp. That's not why we got him, but the unusual always 
attracts attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's owners: Now, they want to hire a commissioner who cannot enact 
change in postseason play, expansion, realignment, interleague play, the sale 
of teams, the relocation of teams, revenue sharing, broadcast rights or act in 
the best interests of the game. In other words, they want a commissioner who 
can't commission. Collectively, you'd find a clearer-thinking group of humans 
inside the jurors box at the Menendez trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Olson: He opted for a one-year contract with Atlanta instead of a 
multiyear deal with the Angels, but then the Braves were offering something the 
Angels couldn't: a World Series share. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dopson: So who picks up the slack for Joe Magrane, whose left arm won't 
be doing much except endorsing large paychecks in the weeks ahead? Rodgers 
calls Dopson, who was 7-11 with Boston last season, "very similar to a Magrane 
as far as the way he throws, a seven-inning-type pitcher at best. I had him at 
Montreal and he has a good hard sinker, and he'll challenge anybody with it. 
He'll come right at you and you can't keep the ball off the ground." Sounds 
promising, yes? "But we also know that we've got to keep somebody ready in the 
bullpen," Rodgers adds, "because John can lose everything in four pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Hillegas: Another recent Angel signee, but don't expect him in Rodgers' 
starting rotation any time soon. Rodgers' ringing endorsement: "He's an arm. 
What can I say? He's been around, he's 30 years old and whatever he is, he's 
still got a quality arm. Maybe some day, he'll wake up and win, I don't know. 
So far, everybody's been reluctant to count him out because he's still got a 
decent arm, and you don't find that many in the big leagues. . . . I'd call him 
a right-handed Tim Fortugno type guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Abbott: Right about now, he'd look particularly good in an Angels uniform. 
Wonder if they could get him for J.T. Snow, Russ Springer and Jerry Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks Talk: On behalf of the sportswriters of Southern California, I 
would like to thank the trash-talking Ducks for their incendiary quotes of the 
past week. I'm a big fan of anything that makes our jobs easier. But when they 
go after Wayne Gretzky, they are aiming at the wrong target. Think about it: 
Gretzky is responsible for the Ducks' very existence. Gretzky proved hockey 
could make it in El Lay and paved the way for expansion in such previously 
unimaginable outposts as San Jose and Anaheim. He also reportedly recommended 
Tony Tavares to Michael Eisner as a good man to run his hockey team. When the 
Ducks snipe at Gretzky, they bite the hand that created them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A $12-million power play:" The sole difference between the Kings and the 
Ducks, according to Duck right wing Todd Ewen. For curiosity's sake, we totaled 
up the salaries for the power-play unit that produced the Ducks' second goal 
Friday night -- Bob Corkum, Garry Valk, Peter Douris, Sean Hill and Don 
McSween. A $1.28-million power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick Harris: The Rams' new offensive coordinator was in training all last 
season as the team's running backs coach. Handoff to Jerome Bettis. Pitchout to 
Jerome Bettis. What else is there to know? 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox: He is loyal to his assistant coaches -- to a fault, some might 
say. To make room for his old staff from Seattle, Knox cleared out 11 Ram 
assistants in early 1992. Eight of them made the playoffs with their new teams 
in 1993 -- Jeff Fisher (49ers), John Teerlinck (Vikings), Ronnie Jones 
(Oilers), Tom Bettis (Oilers), Hudson Houck (Cowboys), Gil Haskell (Packers), 
Nolan Cromwell (Packers), and Jimmy Raye (Chiefs). 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Zampese: The one Ram assistant Knox retained in 1992 -- and now he's 
headed to Dallas and, presumably, a Super Bowl or three. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman: Now that the lawsuit has been decided and the former Cal State 
Fullerton volleyball coach is $1.3 million richer, what's next for the 
estranged parties? Here's an accord I'm sure both sides can live with: Huffman 
donates $1 million to the school, the school holds a press conference to 
announce the christening of "Jim Huffman Stadium." Everybody's happy. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks Tickets for Guns: A noble proposition, but let's not stop there. Let's 
remove another menace from our streets -- and the aisles of Anaheim Arena. 
Ducks Tickets for Duck Calls. Turn them in today.

TURNING THE TABLES; TRIBE'S CASINO SUCCESS UPSETS RURAL AREA'S POWER STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a drive north along rural Route 2, amid the postcard-pretty woodlands of 
southeastern Connecticut, the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino appears out 
of nowhere, a baroque palace in teal and white that dominates the countryside 
from a lordly hilltop perch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unlikely establishment in more ways than one: an immense, Las 
Vegas-style casino and hotel plunked down amid quaint New England villages and 
centuries-old dairy farms. It is owned by a tiny, long-forgotten tribe of 
Native Americans -- and poised to become a major destination resort. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Mashantucket Pequot, the casino represents a historic turning of the 
tables, a restoration of the dominant economic position they enjoyed before 
being all but exterminated more than 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the tribe's partners -- including Burbank-based Iwerks Entertainment, 
which recently opened the first of its high-tech "Cinetropolis" entertainment 
centers at the complex -- it is a chance to test the latest concepts in family 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the non-Native American locals, who until a few years ago had never 
given the Pequot a second thought, the casino is a strange and troubling 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a source of jobs -- and many are grateful for that -- but some wonder 
whether casino gambling is the solution for the area's economy. Many have 
joined a vociferous campaign to block a proposed expansion of the Pequot 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominally, the controversy is about taxes, zoning and obscure Interior 
Department regulations. The real issue, though, is far more profound: Just 
whose land is this anyway, and who has the right to make decisions about 
development? 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more developable land," said John Holder, a tribe member who oversees 
construction at Foxwoods. "People (who oppose expansion) say: 'This farm has 
been in our family for 300 years.' Yeah, ever since you took it away from the 
Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Mashantucket Pequot and the three towns abutting the reservation agree 
on one thing, it is that the turnabout has happened incredibly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been just two years since the tribe, having successfully fought a 
decade-long legal battle, replaced its modest bingo parlor with a full-blown 
casino. And it has been barely a year since the Pequot installed their first 
slot machines, following a hugely controversial deal with the state of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Foxwoods is now the largest casino in the nation outside Las Vegas. And 
with revenue estimated at $600 million to $700 million a year, no immediate 
competition and relatively low costs, it may be the most profitable. It has 
become a model for would-be Native American casino operators across the nation 
-- and an example of the conflicts such operations can bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite subzero temperatures one recent weekend, the complex was mobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two huge gambling halls, young couples and retirees alike jostled for 
space at craps tables and roulette wheels, where on this weekend evening the 
minimum wager was $25, considerably higher than in most Las Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Families promenaded along the indoor shopping strip, where the stores -- all 
owned and run by the tribe -- are trimmed with Victorian facades. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the complex's broad foyers, a glass sculpture of a Native American 
fires "rain arrows" into the sky. Faux-Indian motifs, as well as genuine Native 
American sculpture, dominate the decor in a low-key imitation of Vegas kitsch. 
The stereotypes -- cocktail waitresses with feathers in their hair -- do not 
bother Holder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all a fantasy anyway," he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Down at the Cinetropolis -- a cluster of attractions including a film 
simulation ride, a 360-degree movie and a giant screen theater -- some of the 
non-gamblers who came to Foxwoods "just to see what it's all about" seemed 
happy with what they found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd definitely come back," said Jeff and Marilyn Goldwasser, a 
thirty-something couple from Trumbull, Conn. "This is family entertainment," 
Jeff added. "You can come here and do the games, have dinner, go dancing -- 
lots of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 As evening closed in, the Cinetropolis' 360-degree theater metamorphosed into 
a discotheque, serving a young crowd that included many casino employees. By 
summer there will be other attractions, including a virtual-reality ride that 
puts patrons at the controls of a simulated submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are not so hot on high-tech, Foxwoods also has begun hosting 
big-time live entertainment. Frank Sinatra played a weeklong engagement in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, Foxwoods has become the hot spot in this corner of the 
Northeast. Most of the customers come not from New York or Boston -- though 
each is just two to three hours away -- but from Connecticut and Rhode Island 
and nearby parts of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 And almost all of them -- up to 25,000 a day -- come by car, screaming along 
once-quiet country roads. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the first complaint of residents in Ledyard, North Stonington and 
Preston, all venerable but tiny communities with only a handful of stores, a 
few churches and acre upon acre of rocky farms and rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic, though, is only a small piece of the evolving relationship between 
the tribe and the towns. It's a relationship that for much of the past year has 
been centered on the tribe's effort to annex additional land to its 1,230-acre 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pequot, with just 305 members, already own the land in question -- one 
247-acre parcel and an additional 1,100 acres of lakes and forests that were 
once a Boy Scout camp. 
</P>
<P>
 With backing from their financial partner -- a Malaysian development company 
called Kien Huat Realty -- and support from the casino management team led by 
veteran Atlantic City gaming attorney G. Michael Brown, they plan to build two 
golf courses, a theme park, tennis courts and a skeet-shooting range, among 
other attractions, as well as some tribal health and safety facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether The Pequot should be allowed to add the land to their 
reservation -- and thus render their development exempt from taxes, zoning 
regulations, health and safety rules and all other local and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, such annexations are permitted as a way to promote the 
welfare of Native Americans. The Pequot say they need the land and have a right 
to annex it. 
</P>
<P>
 The towns, however, say there's only a right to apply for the annexation -- 
and that the application should be denied because the tribe doesn't need 
additional land for economic health and self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Annexation. Not One Acre." is the slogan of community groups that are 
fighting the tribe's plan. While local officials take a more pragmatic view of 
the issue and are inclined to at least consider negotiating -- the Pequot at 
one point offered each town $1 million a year for five years not to oppose 
annexation -- the activists are uncompromising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our town," said Madeline Jeffery, a weaver and former schoolteacher who 
has lived in North Stonington for 23 years. "The boundaries were set in 1717. 
We have a history, we have a heritage. If you want to buy land, fine, but go 
along with our rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffery and other activists succeeded in forcing local referendums on the 
issue, and residents voted overwhelmingly in November to require their town 
governments to oppose annexation. Following the votes, Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt intervened, saying he would name a "facilitator" to promote dialogue 
between the towns and the tribe. The appointment is expected any day. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatting with community activists in community resident Ann Brown's sunny 
sitting room, it's easy to see why many townsfolk are not enthused about an 
expanding resort in their midst. The titmice and cardinals are frolicking 
outside the window, the stone fences and sloping fields of the family dairy lie 
blanketed in snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The citizens of this community are taking the lead," said Brown, who is not 
related to the gaming attorney. "Without our efforts, the federal government 
would already have said 'yes' to annexation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The tribe's use of the land up until now has not been one of conservation or 
preservation, but of high development," Jeffery said. "If they were to annex 
(the former Boy Scout camp), there goes another stunning piece of land." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the annexation debate is multilayered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents seem driven mainly by the principle that the towns should 
retain jurisdiction over the land. Others object to the resort development 
plans -- and presumably will object even if annexation is blocked. Still others 
appear motivated by anger over the very existence of the casino and the sudden 
power of the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Brewster, a young mother from Ledyard who heads one of the activist 
groups, alleges that the Pequot harbor feelings of "vicious hatred and 
vengeance" toward the non-Native American townsfolk. She says her house is 
virtually unmarketable because of uncertainty over the tribe's expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Pequot can be imperious in their dealings. They have not kept 
the towns well informed of their plans. In their satisfaction over achieving 
what they regard as historical justice, they sometimes seem dismissive of the 
townspeople's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the property has to be controlled through the zoning boards, it really 
slows down the development process," said Barbara Hartwell, one of seven 
members of a tribal council that governs all major tribe decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, slowing down development to assure minimal impact on surrounding 
land and residents is the very reason for local zoning rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartwell insists that the tribe always has been open to discussion, saying it 
is the activists who have polarized the debate with their "Not One Acre" 
slogan. "Making that statement means you're not willing to discuss anything," 
she said. "If you make ultimatums, that causes a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in her office at the tribe's new community center -- which features an 
indoor swimming pool and gymnasium, Hartwell added: "Back when there were just 
a few people (living in trailers) up here, no one cared. The towns would not 
provide any services or get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the tribe has become a major contributor to local charities. It also 
plans to use some of its newfound wealth to build a $100-million Native 
American museum and research center, which would be the largest such 
institution in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Pequot have a right to be proud of their achievements. Once an 
economic powerhouse in the region thanks to its control of wampum, the shell 
currency used in the fur trade, the tribe was crippled by wars and smallpox and 
nearly wiped out in a brutal 1637 massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1900s, just a handful of tribe members still lived on a tiny 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribe began its comeback in the 1970s, suing to regain reservation land 
and later establishing a bingo hall. After the courts ruled that the state's 
sanctioning of charity "Las Vegas nights" meant Native Americans could offer 
card games, the casino was opened in February, 1992. Slot machines came the 
following January, after the tribe agreed to pay the state 25% of all slot 
machine revenues or $100 million per year, whichever is more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pequot also note that for all the noise made by a few local residents, 
they have an excellent relationship with the state government and many 
localities a little farther away. (For their part, many in Ledyard, Preston and 
North Stonington say they feel that state officials sold them out with the slot 
machine deal, which yields little for the towns most affected by the casino.) 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the jobs -- right now about 8,050 of them. Many pay poorly, 
with salaries starting at around $6 an hour. But many do not, and the Pequot 
are proud of the fact that all full-time employees get full benefits and free 
meals. Most casino workers interviewed spoke highly of their employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are especially welcome in a region long dependent on a few big defense 
contractors. The Electric Boat Co., a submarine builder in nearby Groton, still 
employs about 13,000 people, but that's down from 22,000 just a few years ago. 
And more cuts are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the casino, we would be in very serious trouble," said Michael Seder, 
chairman of the Ledyard Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In the river town of Norwich, only about 10 miles from the casino, abandoned 
munitions factories and textile mills line the waterfront. The downtown 
shopping district, with its vintage 19th-century brick buildings, is clearly 
struggling. Many here regard the casino as the region's great hope, and the 
tribe even talks of building a monorail that could provide a direct link to 
Norwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast about 15 miles to the south, there is already a healthy 
tourist business centered around the Mystic Seaport and Aquarium. Having a 
casino nearby adds to the region's allure as a tourist destination -- though 
some fear it simply will siphon off visitors who would have spent their money 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many towns in the area -- not to mention depressed cities such as 
Hartford and Bridgeport -- would kill to get a piece of the gambling trade. 
Several other tribes, as well as casino magnates such as Donald Trump and 
Mirage Resorts Chairman Steve Wynn, are heavily engaged in a convoluted battle 
over gaming in the region. It seems almost certain that the Pequot will face 
competition within the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet questions linger about the long-term effects of gambling on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoni Borowski, an immigrant from Poland, has converted a 125-year-old 
factory building in Norwich into a restaurant and bakery. But business has been 
terrible lately, and Borowski says the casino is partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's big traffic, but nobody stops to eat," he said. Even some of his 
regular customers now go gambling instead of going out to eat, he said. Worse, 
Foxwoods has declined to buy any of his fresh-baked products. And with his 
business in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Borowski says he cannot match the health 
benefits and other opportunities that the casino offers employees, making it 
hard for him to keep staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years from now, everything down here will be condemned," he said. "All 
this is good for the big people, but nobody does anything for the little 
people."

JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. BRAINPOWER HELPS FUEL ELECTRIFICATION OF THE FAR EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most significant business stories of the decade is unfolding in the 
massive building of electric power plants in Asia, with U.S. companies, perhaps 
surprisingly, in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 18 countries from China to Indonesia are planning and building power 
plants at a breathtaking pace as they strive to develop modern industrial 
economies. General Electric Co. expects more than 460 billion Watts of power to 
be ordered in Asia over the next 10 years, says Delbert Williamson, head of 
GE's power systems division who is now based in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than 400 generating plants, requiring an investment across Asia of 
roughly $300 billion. The idea dwarfs the outlook for almost any other 
business, and is calling forth vast financial ventures, such as a $2.5-billion 
fund being set up by GE Capital and global financier George Soros. 
</P>
<P>
 China plans to build more than a dozen plants a year, India will add five a 
year, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea will be adding a lot of 
electrical capacity. Even Japan's mature economy will be adding more than 50 
power plants to build a reserve of power the way U.S. utilities do. 
</P>
<P>
 The projections are not pie in the sky. In many countries, construction is 
underway. South Korea, for example, is building two new cities -- Ilsan and 
Puchon -- around Westinghouse power plants that will provide electricity for 
light and heating. 
</P>
<P>
 The needs are immediate. The Philippines has just bought 39 diesel generators 
from Caterpillar Inc., put them on offshore barges and hooked them into the 
national power grid. Diesel generators are higher-cost, interim producers but 
the Philippines needs them to curb brownouts while larger base-load plants are 
built.  
</P>
<P>
 At that, the brownouts attest to rising living standards: They are caused by 
more people using electric rice cookers. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale and bustle of activity are fascinating, but the electrification of 
Asia is more than a "gee whiz" story. It holds business lessons galore and 
poses important questions. 
</P>
<P>
 First, if Asian countries, particularly China, build all those power plants, 
won't the global environment be hurt? Maybe not, thanks to the way plants will 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of China's increased electricity will come from Yankee ingenuity. 
Westinghouse Electric is already at work renovating 150 generators to increase 
their efficiency and output. The result will give China the equivalent of 10 
additional, and cleaner, power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the new plants that are built in China and elsewhere will use 
environment-friendly methods that gasify coal and then burn gas to generate 
electricity -- even though such plants cost millions more to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Why will poor countries, which at their present stage of development care more 
about industry than the environment, pay more for their electric plants? 
Because international lenders will insist on it, says Edward R. Muller, 
president of Mission Energy, a subsidiary of SCE Corp., which builds and 
operates electric plants here and abroad. "Financing on these plants will be on 
10-to-12-year cycles," says Muller. Lenders won't want to get caught with a 
plant that has to be shut down in the future. So they'll withhold financing 
unless environmental standards are met.  
</P>
<P>
 A second question is closer to home: Why are U.S. companies so prevalent in 
the business, particularly in Asia, which was thought to be a Japanese sphere 
of influence? The answer is that global business respects skills more than 
nationality, and U.S. firms benefit from know-how and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian nations are deciding that private power is the way to get more 
electricity. Rather than raise taxes or try to float government bonds to build 
generating plants costing $2.5 billion each, they are turning to private 
contractors to finance, build, own and run electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. companies, with a lot of know-how about setting rates and billing 
customers, are reaping a growth business. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission, Duke Energy and Southern Electric International, along with 
non-utility companies such as Enron Power and Transco Energy, got into the 
business thanks to a 1978 law that encouraged alternative energy producers and 
have years of experience in domestic and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. power-plant suppliers have kept up technologically by pursuing overseas 
markets in recent years, when few plants have been ordered domestically. GE, 
the world leader, and Westinghouse have been adaptive, forming joint ventures 
in China, Japan and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 They prepared for a market that is exuberantly global. Indonesia, for example, 
is about to launch construction of a $2.5-billion power plant, which will be 
owned by Mission Energy, Mitsui of Japan, GE and an Indonesian company. GE will 
supply the turbine generator but other major parts will come from Switzerland's 
Asea Brown Boveri. Financing will come from global capital markets and Fluor 
Daniel or Bechtel will handle engineering and construction because those U.S. 
firms have credibility with global lenders, who want plants built well and on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 For a lesson in world business today, we should note who is buying and what is 
being sold. Poor countries -- Indonesia, China, India, Vietnam -- where 
villages are awakening to the dynamics and clamor of the modern world economy 
are buying, with the aid of global financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 And what the United States and other developed countries have to sell is 
brainpower, whether contained in turbine generators and advanced fuel-burning 
systems or in knowledge of how to construct an electrical grid and use it most 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge, reliability, credibility may not appear on any balance sheet, but 
they are very significant national assets in the race for business in emerging, 
electrifying Asia.

MURDOCH TRIES TO DIG WAY OUT OF ASIA HOLE; STAR TV: THE MEDIA MOGUL'S REMARKS 
RAISED POLITICAL HACKLES IN THE FAR EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rupert Murdoch is learning the politics of global TV the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks after acquiring control of Star TV, the linchpin of his worldwide 
television empire, Murdoch managed to offend some of his most important viewers 
-- Asian political leaders -- when he declared satellite TV to be an 
"unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks, part of a speech made in London and beamed live to a Hong Kong 
breakfast given by Star TV, startled the Chinese in the audience. Shortly 
afterward, the Beijing government passed a law to curb use of satellite dishes 
in China -- a step that could undercut Star TV's viewership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese crackdown was followed by a similar rebuke from Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohammad, who has long been suspicious of the Western media. 
Why, Mahathir wondered, did Murdoch -- known for using his media properties to 
advance his own agenda -- buy control of Star TV "if he is not going to control 
the news that we are going to receive?" 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash prompted Murdoch to make a goodwill trip to Beijing and Kuala 
Lumpur. And it revealed the kinds of obstacles outsiders face as they establish 
themselves in Asia, where many rulers are sensitive to the intrusion of Western 
news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing's clampdown "was a signal to Murdoch that he couldn't go on providing 
(satellite TV) without taking heed," said John Kaye of Survey Research Group in 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in the nearly seven months since Murdoch's News Corp. took over Star 
TV, the new management team at the satellite TV service has managed to offend 
or alienate many members of Asia's power elite. While perhaps not fatal, News 
Corp.'s missteps mean Murdoch will end up having to spend a lot more money -- 
and time -- getting Star TV off the ground than he had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite network -- whose offerings include the BBC World Service TV, MTV 
Asia and Prime Sports -- beams five channels to 53 countries over an area that 
stretches from Indonesia across China, India and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2.5 billion people -- about two-thirds of the world's population -- 
fall under Star TV's satellite shadow. The potential audience is big enough to 
dwarf the viewership of the four American networks combined, but until 
recently, most of those countries had only one or two state-run TV channels, 
and programming was heavily censored. 
</P>
<P>
 Political problems have, for now, forced Murdoch to shift most of his 
attention to Star TV's faster-growing Indian market. The company also is 
rethinking its English-only programming policy, which has drawn tepid response 
from advertisers. And potential allies have emerged instead as competitors in 
the wide-open market. 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite a switch from last summer, when pundits declared Murdoch's 
$525-million purchase of a 63.6% stake in the pan-Asian satellite broadcaster 
had given him the final and most crucial component in his global TV web. 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp. executives deny that Star TV has presented any major surprises. 
They insist that growth rates and operating results are in line with 
expectations and, in some cases, exceed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch's experience is important because he is the forerunner among a cadre 
of satellite broadcasters racing to introduce television to every nook and 
cranny around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Discovery Channel went on the air in Asia, joining other American 
channels such as CNN, ESPN and HBO. Later this year, Ted Turner's TNT and 
Cartoon Network will jointly launch their own pan-Asian satellite channel. 
Disney is considering its own pan-Asian channel. Tele-Communications Inc. and 
Dow Jones & Co. are partners in Asian Business News. And several Asian 
companies are hoping to start "indigenous" satellite channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, Star TV is catching all the flak," said Gary Brown, regional media 
director at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Hong Kong. "It's the first 
time anybody has put up a satellite system to over 50 countries. Whatever the 
outcome, broadcasting in Asia has been changed forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles Star TV faces were underscored by Murdoch's arrival in Hong Kong 
early this month. The globe-trotting media chief, who had lately made his base 
in Los Angeles, has rented a house on The Peak, the tony neighborhood 
overlooking Hong Kong's harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 From there Murdoch, on his private G-4 jet, is embarking on missions to India 
and other countries, meeting with government ministers and potential business 
partners who will play pivotal roles in Star TV's success or failure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the turmoil of recent months, Star TV deserves Murdoch's undivided 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal dispute with Hong Kong's cable TV operator has kept Star TV off what 
is expected to become the world's biggest cable TV system. Star TV also fell 
out with its advertising sales agent for the lucrative Taiwan market. The 
company's staff has been slashed 20%, to 620 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially troublesome is an escalating feud with Viacom over its license 
agreement for MTV Asia. Viacom has been pressing for an equity stake in the 
channel, but Star TV has refused to budge. At the same time, Sony, Time Warner 
and Viacom are negotiating to buy a stake in Hong Kong-based satellite 
broadcaster TVB, the world's biggest producer of Chinese-language programming. 
Star TV could suffer if the media giants' movie studios, Columbia Pictures and 
Warner Bros., funnel their films exclusively to TVB. 
</P>
<P>
 Star TV's hardball tactics could turn out to be a costly mistake when Murdoch 
starts new pay TV channels later this year and needs films for broadcasting. 
Before Murdoch's arrival, executives had hoped to enlist the major Hollywood 
studios in a joint venture for new pan-Asian pay TV channel, but the Murdoch 
management team scotched the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Star TV also has been plagued by management turmoil. It has had five managing 
directors in 2 1/2 years, three of them within the last six months. Gary Davey, 
the latest, is a former executive with Murdoch's BSkyB in London and a protege 
of Sam Chisholm, the salty News Corp. director who oversees satellite TV 
operations. (Chisholm's trademark opening question on meeting new Star TV 
employees: "How much we pay you?") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a spate of bad publicity, Star TV last month released a survey it 
commissioned that showed the satellite service was received in 42 million 
homes, including 30 million in China, 7 million in India and 2.4 million in 
Taiwan -- representing growth of 279% in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, Star TV cannot say how many people who are able to 
receive its signals actually watch any of the five channels. In Taiwan, where 
sophisticated measurement is possible, Star TV says a recent ratings survey 
found it achieved an average 7.8% share of the audience, with its 
Mandarin-dialect Chinese Channel drawing twice as many viewers as the other 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch clearly did not foresee many of Star TV's problems when he bought the 
service. He chased after it in typical Murdoch style, hastily negotiating the 
investment in 48 hours with Richard Li, who ran the service for his magnate 
father, Li Ka-shing. The 28-year-old Li flew to the Mediterranean to meet 
Murdoch, Chisolm and Fox Inc.executive Chase Carey on Murdoch's yacht, The 
Morning Glory, and cut the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't do any due diligence," said Craig Erlicht, a Hong Kong banker and 
former Star TV executive. "Murdoch bought into a cash flow that, to a large 
extent, was disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it could be argued that if anyone can make Star TV succeed it's 
Murdoch, who has a track record, from Fleet Street to Fox, of turning troubled 
businesses into immensely profitable franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two years ago, BSkyB -- Murdoch's satellite TV service in Britain -- was 
losing $15 million a week. After a merger with its chief rival, the company is 
now in the black. And Murdoch started the Fox network in the United States to a 
chorus of naysayers predicting it couldn't be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite persistent reports in the Hong Kong press that Star TV is losing 
between $60 million and $80 million annually, Murdoch recently told The Times 
that the service will lose no more than $20 million in the fiscal year ending 
June 30. Analysts peg its revenues at between $60 million and $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Star TV is "free-to-air" -- meaning the signal is not scrambled and 
anyone with a satellite dish can receive it -- advertising support is crucial 
to Murdoch's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Li Ka-shing, Star TV inaugurated the "foundation advertising program," 
in which 80 advertisers each commited to initial expenditures of $2 million. In 
many cases, Li -- a Hong Kong real estate tycoon -- leveraged his business 
relationships into advertising contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that many of these early advertisers, such as Japan's 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, bought ads only out of loyalty to Li. Many of them 
are not renewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Burnett's Brown estimated that only about 20% of Star TV's advertising 
time is sold. "They are working hard to improve that, but there are few 
marketers that want to say the same things to the vast markets of China and 
India," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obstacles imposed by the Beijing government have forced Murdoch to rethink his 
strategy, as well. The quiet shift entails focusing immediate resources on 
India, which is more open to Western culture and is rapidly commercializing TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Star TV acquired a 49.9% stake in Zee TV, a fast-growing 
Hindi-language satellite TV channel in India. And Star hopes to enter the 
subscription TV business later this year when it launches the first of what are 
expected to be several pay TV channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of prioritizing their markets, India is now No. 1, because of the 
(satellite dish) curb in China," said Steven Li, an analyst with Jardine 
Fleming Securities in Hong Kong. "India is more developed, and the TV market 
more liberalized. China is longer term." 
</P>
<P>
 Although News Corp. executives deny that China has been put on the back 
burner, people close to Star TV say that Murdoch had his sights set on China 
when he first bought into the company. In part, that reflected a strategy 
inherited from Li Ka-shing, whose good relations with the Beijing government 
signaled easy access and robust growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Star TV also is having to move away from its dedication to being an 
English-language programming service aimed at the wealthiest 5% of viewers. 
Instead, the emphasis will be on developing indigenous-language channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson from Star TV is that you can't be all things to all people," said 
Andre Nair, managing director of Ogilvy Media Asia in Hong Kong. "The 
advertising hasn't been there. A marketer in India may not be interested in 
Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beijing is fostering the growth of cable in China, most TV executives 
in the region say the policy owes as much to the government wanting to control 
content as it does to the economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially sensitive is the matter of the BBC World Service news channel 
carried by Star TV, which has broadcast reports embarrassing to the Chinese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 A Li-era contract prohibits Star from dropping the BBC, but Murdoch is trying 
to negotiate a deal that would substitute documentary and educational 
programming for the British news service. Others believe that Murdoch wants to 
supplant the BBC with news programming from BskyB and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 With Star TV's attention shifting to India, however, Murdoch is said to have 
become acutely aware of the need to find politically well-connected partners 
who can ease entry into that market of nearly 900 million people. Possible 
candidates: Bennett Coleman & Co., owner of the prestigious Times of India 
newspaper, and Hindustan Times, the country's second-largest newspaper group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murdoch will face new competition as India loosens media controls. "The 
Bold & the Beautiful" and "Santa Barbara" on Star TV have become cult with 
middle-class Indian women dissatisfied with the state-run TV service. 
</P>
<P>
 But new Indian TV stations are expected to be much more market-driven in their 
programming. And, across Asia, the coming onslaught of popular programming from 
satellite-broadcast competitors has Star TV on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are in a situation of come-from-behind," one former Star TV 
executive said privately. "They blew a tremendous lead." Murdoch's Global 
Television Empire

<P>
 Rupert Murdoch has built Australia-based News Corp. into a globe-spanning 
media web. Television accounts for roughly 15% of News Corp. revenue. Other 
properties include the Fox movie studio, leading British and Australian 
newspapers and the HarperCollins publishing group.

<P>
 If you're a victim of the Northridge earthquake -- and insurance or disaster 
relief didn't cover all your losses -- you may be in line for thousands of 
dollars worth of 1993 tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have un-reimbursed disaster losses, consider filing for a casualty loss 
deduction on your 1993 tax return -- even if the loss occurred in 1994. Federal 
tax laws allow people in designated disaster areas the option of claiming 
casualty losses in the year that they occurred, or in the previous year. The 
idea is to quickly get refunds into the hands of people who need the money. It 
also allows taxpayers to push their deductions into the year in which they'd do 
the most good. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster victims should realize that the tax breaks fall far shy of 
compensating for actual losses. However, they can substantially pare your 
current tax bill or land you a tax refund. Additionally, if your casualty loss 
deductions substantially exceed your taxable income, you may be able to use 
leftover losses on next year's return -- or carry them back to a previous 
year's return to get another refund. 
</P>
<P>
 But casualty loss deductions are complex and frequently trigger tax audits. If 
you claim these losses, pay close attention to details and keep exceptionally 
good records. 
</P>
<P>
 Who qualifies for casualty losses and how do they work? Here are some answers: 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is a casualty loss? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is a loss from a "sudden, unexpected or unusual event," such as a fire, 
flood, mudslide, earthquake, windstorm or theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can I deduct all the losses I suffer in a disaster? 
</P>
<P>
 No. You can only deduct a portion of your un-reimbursed losses. First you must 
subtract insurance and "other" reimbursements -- such as federal disaster 
grants. Then, you only can deduct the un-reimbursed losses that exceed 10% of 
your adjusted gross income, plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, consider Jane, who earns $60,000 annually and suffered $50,000 
in losses from the Midwestern floods. She had no flood insurance, but got 
$10,000 in disaster aid from the federal government. The $10,000 grant reduced 
her actual casualty loss to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 She then subtracts $100 from the $40,000 un-reimbursed loss to get $39,900. 
She multiples her annual income by 10%, to get $6,000 and subtracts that from 
the loss, as well. Her deduction amounts to $33,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if you have two casualty losses in one year? Does each one have to 
meet the "10% plus $100" test? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. The 10% test applies to cumulative casualty losses in any given year. 
The $100 applies to individual losses, says Ken Anderson, partner with the 
accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is everything I lose deductible? Or are there limitations for personal 
items or business property? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Technically, every loss is deductible. But it can be tricky to figure out 
the loss amount. That's because, for tax purposes, your loss amounts to the 
smaller of the decrease in fair market value of the property or the "adjusted 
basis" -- the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, let's say you lost three antique crystal lamps in the Northridge 
earthquake. It would cost $3,000 to replace the lamps, but they were given to 
you by your grandmother, now deceased, who purchased them new for $10 each. If 
Grandma gave you the lamps when she was alive -- rather than bequeathing them 
to you in her will -- your "adjusted cost basis" is just $30. If they were 
willed to you, the cost would be whatever value was assigned to the items in 
probate, which would probably be substantially more. But, in either case, the 
tax cost would be substantially less than the "decrease in fair market value" 
which is usually deemed to be the replacement or repair cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about business property? The computer that I use in my home office was 
completely destroyed. Can I deduct that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, if you still have a taxable cost in the item. But, if you've had the 
computer for a few years and have been filing your returns correctly, you 
probably don't. That's because you're allowed to either depreciate or "expense" 
business equipment on your tax return. If you expensed the item, you would have 
gotten a deduction equal to the computer's value in the year you bought it. 
That leaves you with a zero "cost basis." In other words, no deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What sort of records do I need to keep if I claim a casualty loss? 
</P>
<P>
 You need records that substantiate what you lost, what it cost and how much of 
the loss was reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best documents is your insurance claim, which should be filed 
regardless of whether or not you expect payment from the insurer. The claim 
form usually details all the items that were damaged or destroyed and what they 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're claiming casualty losses for business property, you may also need 
documentation -- such as previous years' tax returns -- to substantiate your 
"cost basis" in the property.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: OLD SLIP MAY ESCAPE IRS SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: My only income is from rentals and investments. In 1986, I opened two 
individual retirement accounts at separate brokerages for a total of $2,000. 
Neither told me that, because my income was passive, I was ineligible for an 
IRA. I didn't find out for several years. Now my tax preparer says I should let 
the matter slide because the Internal Revenue Service won't catch it. Is this 
good advice? Will I get in big trouble when I withdraw the money when I turn 59 
1/2 ? -- J.M . 
</P>
<P>
 A: We'll let you decide what to do. Here are your choices:  
</P>
<P>
 To be absolutely within the strict bounds of the law, you should withdraw the 
funds in those ineligible IRA accounts, pay a 6%-a-year excise tax for excess 
contributions and a 10% penalty for early withdrawal, plus ordinary income 
taxes on the full amount of the withdrawal. Then, carefully clutching the few 
dollars you have left, you can rest assured you have made full amends to the 
government for your $2,000 mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, you could just forget the whole matter and let the funds 
stay where they are. At age 59 1/2, simply withdraw the money and pay the 
appropriate income taxes on the disbursement. After all, you might reason, the 
IRS didn't catch the contribution when it was made eight years ago. Further, 
our experts note that, assuming you have not made additional contributions to 
the accounts in subsequent years, the statute of limitations on the initial 
deposits has elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the IRS say? A spokesman said that officially, the agency can only 
recommend the first choice above. Unofficially and anonymously, he said chances 
are pretty good that the IRS won't come looking for you. Besides, he noted: 
"Let's be reasonable. We're talking peanuts here." 
</P>
<P>
 Where to Write Off Quake Business Loss 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I own a small retail business that suffered considerable, uninsured 
inventory damage during last month's earthquake. May I write off my loss on 
Schedule C of my tax return and thereby reduce my self-employment tax? May 
these losses be carried forward or back to another tax year? -- J.E.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Business inventory casualty losses should be listed on Schedule C. And, 
because self-employment taxes are based on your net business income, those 
losses would affect the amount of self-employment tax you must pay. Excess 
losses may be carried back for up to three years or forward as far ahead as 15 
years. For more information on casualty losses to businesses, see IRS Pub. 536. 
To order it, call (800) 829-3676. This number is staffed from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
in most time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, the Jan. 30 column on the replacement period for casualty losses 
needs amplification. Taxpayers whose principal residences are in a federally 
designated disaster area have up to four years to use insurance settlements to 
replace lost homes. This provision of the 1993 tax law covers only principal 
residences and is retroactive to Sept. 1, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Business owners with real estate casualty losses from a natural disaster or 
another type of involuntary conversion have three years to replace that 
property. The replacement period for all other assets, including a residence 
not in a federal disaster area, is two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock on the various limits begins running on Jan. 1 of the year following 
the tax year in which the involuntary conversion occurred. For taxpayers 
affected by the recent Southern California earthquake, the replacement period 
clock starts ticking on Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring Tax Status on Foreclosed Deed 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We acquired a property at foreclosure last year on which we had held the 
second trust deed. The previous owner had defaulted on our note, and we had 
advanced money on the first trust deed to avoid foreclosure by that lender. 
What is our tax basis in this property? -- I.M.  
</P>
<P>
 A: According to our experts, your basis now is your original tax basis from 
the second trust deed plus any money you spent to bring the note current 
(including back taxes and payments) to avoid foreclosure, plus the balance due 
on the remaining note. The appraised value of the property is irrelevant to 
this calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 'Reverse Mortgages' Are Not for Everyone 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you help me get information about reverse mortgages? We are senior 
citizens who need cash and would like to remain in our home. J.R.S.  
</P>
<P>
 A: An increasing number of older people whose primary asset is appreciated 
real estate are opting for what are called reverse mortgages. Under this 
program, the homeowner borrows against the equity in his house to gain 
additional money for living expenses. Since these programs tend to deplete the 
equity in a home quickly, they are best suited to people who are in their late 
70s or older and have substantial equity. 
</P>
<P>
 You should talk with your accountant, lawyer or other trusted professional 
adviser to determine if this program suits your long-term needs. For more 
information about reverse mortgages in your area, send a postcard asking for 
"Home-Made Money" to the American Assn. of Retired Persons Home Equity 
Information Center, 601 E St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049. Delivery takes six 
to eight weeks. Or telephone the AARP at (800) 424-3410. 
</P>
<P>
 CORRECTION: The phone number for consumer service counselors at the Resolution 
Trust Corp. was misprinted in last week's Money Talk column. The correct number 
is (800) 842-2970, ext. 67470. Counselors at this number are prepared to tell 
you if the RTC holds your mortgage. Be prepared to give the name and address of 
the thrift that originated your note and the loan number.

BACK TO THE BEACHWEAR; CLOTHING: O.C. SURF-WEAR FIRMS ARE POISED TO BENEFIT 
FROM AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the '80s, surf wear practically sold itself to consumers who couldn't get 
enough of the Day-Glo shirts and shorts designed by Southern California 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry wiped out late in the decade, though, as neon colors fell from 
favor on the beach and off. Teens and young adults seeking a new look turned to 
the dark, baggy urban styles inspired by rap and hip-hop groups, adopted by 
skateboarders and broadcast nationwide on MTV. Sun-drenched was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf-wear makers were forced to regroup, and some, including longtime leader 
Ocean Pacific Sunwear Inc. in Tustin, eventually wound up in bankruptcy court. 
National sales of surf apparel and accessories, worth about $1.5 billion 
annually in the late 1980s, sank to $500 million by 1991, industry observers 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beachwear," said Alan G. Millstein, editor of Fashion Network Report in New 
York, "is no longer the fair-haired child of the department store." 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry is positioned this year to catch a ride on an unprecedented 
wave of marketing opportunities. In June, legendary surf filmmaker Bruce Brown 
and New Line Cinema will release "Endless Summer II," a sequel to the 1964 
mother of all surf flicks. There's also talk of a sequel to "Big Wednesday," 
the 1978 surf classic. 
</P>
<P>
 And Disney is considering a movie about the late Dewey Weber, a legendary 
surfer whose remains were scattered on the waves at Redondo Beach in 1992 while 
hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going back and using surfing as vehicle, as a window to a time that 
wasn't so complex," said Weber's ex-wife, Carol. "And in doing that, we found a 
great untapped reservoir of interest. Surfing is something that Hollywood 
thinks is very marketable." 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion industry thinks so, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "America is a sport-driven country, and there's still a romance with this 
sport," said Shaheen Sadeghi, a former executive of surf-wear maker Quiksilver 
in Costa Mesa. "It's got an almost mystical attraction because it's not 
something most of us are exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing will also be getting big play this year on the small screen. Prime 
Ticket plans to televise 11 U.S. surf contests this year, including the U.S. 
Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach in August -- the first world-class surf 
contest on the U.S. mainland in three years. And Coca-Cola has signed a 
multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with the Assn. of Surfing Professionals 
for TV programming to be beamed to viewers in 23 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of surf wear will surely benefit, said Lesa Ukman at IEG Consulting in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like beach volleyball," she said, which was unknown in most of the 
United States until the TV networks started covering it. As its popularity 
soared, so did demand for clothes like those worn by the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on television, Ukman said, "can do great things for lifestyle products." 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the new surf movies should refocus attention on Southern 
California as a playground rather than a recession-torn region pummeled by 
earthquakes, wildfires and floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Los Angeles had the riots and fires, the Southern California fashion 
industry inherited the ashes," editor Millstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the most optimistic beach-wear makers expect the surfer look to be 
the rage again. But the manufacturers' group notes that Americans will buy 
approximately 315,000 surfboards, 162,500 snowboards, 450,000 volleyballs and 
467,500 wet suits this year -- and are expected to spend $405 million on 
clothes to wear while using that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver, which is licensed to produce "Endless Summer II" shirts, hats and 
accessories, is among companies that intend to ride the media wave. Standing to 
benefit are those "with the most credible surf images -- Quik, Rusty, 
Billabong, Stussy -- . . . not the surf wanna-bes," said Robert B. McKnight 
Jr., chairman of the company. "This isn't going to help launch fake labels like 
'Surf Fetish,' 'Maui & Sons' and that kind of crap." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparel makers say what they're looking for now is not a fad like Day-Glo but 
a profitable niche under the broad "beach lifestyle" umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in being a trend or fashion driven," said Mark Price, a 
former Gotcha Sportswear vice president who is now an executive at Tavarua 
Island Surf Co. in Laguna Beach. "We want to serve customers who don't change 
the way they dress." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Tavarua is developing a line of casual clothing, including 
T-shirts, hats and sandals, with "a South Pacific look," Price said. Tavarua -- 
the name of a South Pacific island known for spectacular surfing -- will be 
carried by 70 retailers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Pacific, which led the charge in the Day-Glo '80s, is trying to revive 
its apparel lines. The company last year sold its remaining assets through 
bankruptcy court to a Bay Area investment group that is now producing designs 
that incorporate the well-known OP label. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Bull, a 2-year-old Long Beach company, is focusing on styles like those 
worn decades ago by long-board surfers. Similarly, Hang 10 in San Diego is 
building on its line of "retro" clothing that borrows heavily from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders maintain that surf wear will always play a role in the 
larger fashion scene. "I think the story is that this industry is still alive, 
that after all these years it's still here," said Paul Holmes, a Hang 10 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners express some doubts about whether movies and TV alone can bolster 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "People buy clothing because it's cool . . . (not because) they know anything 
about surfing or care anything about surfing," said Ron Jones, who sells surf 
apparel through B'Jammin', a Winter Park, Colo., specialty store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers, too, question whether the wave of media interest means anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another tide change in surfing's hype," said Shawn Stussy, a surfer 
and creator of the highly successful Stussy Designs in Irvine. " 'Endless 
Summer II' and 'Big Wednesday II' aren't soul movies like the original 'Endless 
Summer.' These are Hollywood epics. They're apples and oranges. " And there's 
no guarantee that they will sell clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the Super Bowl," said Don Meek, a Prime Ticket vice president 
who is also a surfer. "I can deliver to the advertiser the most highly rated 
show in history. But it's up to the industry to put product on the shelf that 
people want to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike major sports, which can drive clothing sales by licensing a popular 
team's logo, surfing hasn't had a single, dominant focus since the demise of 
Day-Glo. And, while the popularity of dark, slouchy street styles is waning, 
surf wear now faces a new challenge: the "Northern Exposure" look, which 
borrows from the outdoorsy, Pacific Northwest styles worn by the cast of the 
award-winning TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New York, Boston and Chicago you see these people dressed up like they're 
going mountain climbing," Millstein said. "But the only hill they'll ever see 
is the one in Central Park where they walk their dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 While male teen-agers may still crave Southern California labels like Mossimo, 
Quiksilver and Rusty, many older men are instead choosing "that outdoor, 
wholesome Eddie Bauer look," said Tom Campion, owner of the Zumiez specialty 
store in Everett, Wash. "And it's definitely something that had its origination 
here in the Northwest, not in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cherbak, a retail expert in the Costa Mesa office of accounting firm 
Deloitte & Touche, acknowledged that "the Timberlands of the world are out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But "I'm a firm believer that the beach lifestyle never goes out of style," he 
said. "Surf has dealt with hip-hop, it's dealing with grunge. The wholesome 
look is just one more look coming through." On Pro Tour, Surf's Up Inland! 
</P>
<P>
 Who says you have to be in Southern California to enjoy the region's 
much-envied lifestyle? 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the world's top professional beach volleyball players 
have been digging, setting and spiking in sand-filled parking lots in inland 
cities from Phoenix to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the world's top surfers are getting ready to move their sport inland, 
too. They'll be riding eight-foot waves generated by wave-making machines at 
water parks in Japan, South Africa and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for an initial round of inland surf contests at Walt Disney 
World in Florida, Palm Springs, Tokyo and Sun City, in the Bophuthatswana 
region of South Africa. The inland tour eventually will be expanded to other 
water parks in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian-based Assn. of Surfing Professionals has identified 38 inland 
"beach venues" where it will stage "rock 'n' roll" surfing events that feature 
live music and light shows along with top surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can erect huge stages for the world's top rock bands," said Bob Pritchard, 
a Santa Monica marketing consultant who is helping to arrange the inland 
events. "With this combination of music, light shows and surfers, we can create 
a combination music-lifestyle event." Surfing U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing industry observers predict that 1994 will see a comeback of the sport 
and a return of surf wear to the retail limelight. Influential events: 
</P>
<P>
 * TV coverage: The Prime Ticket cable network will air 42 hours of surf 
programming to 41 million homes, an increase of 50% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Open and Op Pro: Huntington Beach will be host to back-to-back surfing 
events. The prestigious U.S. Open of Surfing, a sanctioned World Championship 
Tour event considered the largest and most heavily publicized surf event in the 
world, will be held July 26-31, followed by the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing 
Championship Aug. 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Surfing Magazine Turns 30: The magazine, founded in 1964 during the surfing 
boom, will celebrate its 30th anniversary with several collector editions and 
will serve as the official publication for the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Endless Summer II": A sequel to the classic surf film "Endless Summer" is 
scheduled for release in April or May. The director is Bruce Brown, who did the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Surfs? 
</P>
<P>
 Baby boomers who surfed in their teens are returning to the water along with 
their kids. In 1994, the sport's core age group is expected to be 18-23, 
slightly older than in previous years. Most surfers, 90%, are men. 
</P>
<P>
 California Rules 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of America's surfers live in the Golden State: California: 45% 
Hawaii: 20% Florida: 20% Other states: 15% 
</P>
<P>
 Catching a Wave 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Americans who surf at least four times a year is expected to 
increase 10% in 1994. Estimated number of active surfers, in millions: 1992: 
1.1 1993: 1.4 1994*: 1.5

RESTAURANTS ROMANCING THE COUPLES; PROMOTIONS: RECESSION-WEARY O.C. 
ESTABLISHMENTS ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS TO WOO VALENTINE'S DAY PATRONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dohyo, a Japanese-Polynesian restaurant in Anaheim, has made lists of the love 
songs among its karaoke offerings and has posted them on diners' tables. Some 
suggestions for sentimental songsters: "Feelings," "If" and "My Funny 
Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, Le Meridien is hosting three days of Valentine's specials, 
including selections from the musical "Phantom of the Opera." And at L'Opera in 
downtown Long Beach, a violinist and an opera singer will perform tableside on 
the evening of the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Local restaurants are promoting this Valentine's Day like no other in recent 
memory. Sensing a slight improvement in the economy, they are going all out to 
woo diners who gave up the dining-out habit during the recession, said David 
Wilhelm, a consultant and celebrity chef who founded such well-known Orange 
County restaurants as Diva in Costa Mesa and Topaz at the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Court Cafe, inside the Westin South Coast hotel in Costa Mesa, sent out 
2,000 newsletters advertising its Sunday brunch and Valentine's Day dinner, 
said Janne Clare, operations manager. Dinner includes mussel bisque, apple 
pheasant and Champagne sorbet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a competitive business," Clare said. "People look for something 
exciting, a draw that makes a restaurant a special event." 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has hit the restaurant industry hard, especially fine-dining 
establishments. Their annual revenue has grown by 2% or less during the 1990s, 
according to the National Restaurant Assn. in Washington. That compares to 
double-digit annual growth for much of the '80s. This year, the industry's 
sales are expected to increase by 2.6%, the association has projected -- but 
fast-food restaurants will provide nearly two-thirds of that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trading down," said Scott Read, a spokesman for the California 
Restaurant Assn. in Los Angeles. "Upscale places are offering (discounted) 
daily specials, and fast-food restaurants have come out with value menus." 
</P>
<P>
 Wok Spirit, a chain of take-out Chinese restaurants, is capitalizing on that 
trend. Along with its regular inexpensive menu, it is offering a box of 
chocolate-dipped fortune cookies for $4, wrapped in red cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine's Day, however, is one occasion when most restaurants can raise 
their prices and still draw in the customers, especially at establishments 
offering extras like a special menu, music, roses and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants really need to max out on an opportunity like Valentine's Day," 
said Richard Martin, a former restaurant owner and West Coast bureau chief of 
Nation's Restaurant News. "This is a natural marketing opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, conveniently, the holiday falls on a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know you can leverage the publicity over two or three days, you're 
more likely to spend the advertising dollars," chef Wilhelm said.

months' wildfires, earthquake and aftershocks.

 "There's a tremendous amount of interest now in the family," said Steven L. 
Schandler, a professor of psychology at Chapman University in Orange. "You 
realize, when you see material things go, that all you have left is the 
family." And Valentine's Day is, after all, the national occasion to show how 
much you care.

 Lovers and others have been making their dining arrangements far in advance 
this year. The tables have been booked for almost three weeks at Pascal, a 
French restaurant in Newport Beach, owner Pascal Olhats said. He expects two 
seatings of 80 people each for lobster bisque and chateaubriand. 
</P>
<P>
 To reserve a table, diners were required to stop by and pay for the prix fixe 
dinner in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our busiest day, and I can say it's the craziest too," Olhats said. 
"People call all day (on Valentine's Day), and we have to keep saying 'no.' "

<P>
 Still, he conceded, it's nice to be asked.

 Spiga Trattoria in Costa Mesa took reservations for Valentine's Day during a 
charity benefit on Feb. 8. The benefit, for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and 
Young Professionals Against Cancer, included a mock dating game along the lines 
of the TV show "Studs." Table tents and a six-foot red heart detailed the 
upcoming Valentine's Day menu.

<P>
 "People are still willing to spend a buck," said Frank Groff, whose Long Beach 
public relations firm organized the event. "But they want to know what they're 
getting, that it's going to be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Emporio Armani Express has advertised its Valentine's menu in front of the 
restaurant, which is in the South Coast Plaza shopping center. The restaurant 
is serving an assortment of miniature Italian pastries, chocolate creams and 
liqueurs for dessert. 
</P>

 Much like a lover, the restaurant wants to let its diners know that it is not 
taking them for granted, spokeswoman Jane Summer said. "We're in the business 
of catering to people's needs, desires and wants." Dining Probabilities

2 KENNY ROGERS ROASTERS DUE THIS YEAR; FAST FOOD: AS MANY AS 15 OF THE 
FLAME-BROILED CHICKEN OUTLETS ARE PLANNED FOR THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters Corp. says it will open two restaurants in Orange County 
this year and as many as 15 during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters, based in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., features wood-fire 
roasted chicken. It is one of several chains hoping to dominate the 
flame-broiled chicken category, arguably the restaurant industry's 
fastest-growing sector. Other key players include KFC Corp. of Louisville, Ky., 
and fast-growing Boston Chicken, which in January granted Carl Karcher 
Enterprises, Anaheim-based parent company of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain, a 
franchise to open as many as 300 Boston Chicken restaurants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers generally regard flame-broiled chicken as a healthier alternative to 
regular fast food and also perceive the meals as being a good value, restaurant 
industry analysts say. One measure of flame-broiled chicken's appeal is the 
fact that Boston Chicken, based in Naperville, Ill., set a record when its 
initial public stock offering doubled in price in first-day trading in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 Kenny Rogers Roasters planned for Orange County will be owned by a 
Newport Beach franchisee who plans to open restaurants this year in Fountain 
Valley and Santa Ana. Subsequent sites under the Orange County Roasters 
umbrella will be opened in 1995 and later years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters franchisees also plan to open a handful of other 
Southern California locations, including Northridge and Torrance, later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers Roasters was founded by singer Kenny Rogers. The company's 
chairman is former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown Jr., who is also a former owner 
and chief executive of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Kenny Rogers Roasters says it 
hopes to open as many as 1,500 restaurants nationwide, including about 200 in 
California, where it will deal largely through franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kenny Rogers Roasters store already open in Palm Desert is partly owned by 
Carl Karcher Jr., son of Karcher Enterprises founder Carl N. Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises hopes that its Boston Chicken stores, the first of which 
is expected to open later this year in a converted Carl's Jr. store, will 
bolster the company's flagging sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players in the chicken segment of the California fast-food market are 
Irvine-based El Pollo Loco, with 200 restaurants in California, Nevada and 
Texas; and KooKooRoo, a small but rapidly growing Los Angeles-based chain that 
serves skinless flame-broiled chicken.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUSING PROJECT: Approved a resolution to permit building La Villa Mariposa, 
a 115-unit low-income housing project at 345 Columbia Ave. in Westlake. 
Construction, set to begin in two months, is planned to be completed late next 
year. Rents will range from $110 for a single to $485 for a four-bedroom 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * COLISEUM FUNDS: Approved using $10.9 million of the $75 million the city has 
received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for repairs to the 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which sustained an estimated $33 million in 
damage in the Northridge earthquake. Another $40 million from FEMA is expected 
soon, with $6.1 million earmarked for the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 * COLISEUM STUDY: Instructed the city attorney to report on whether the 
Spectacor Management Group was negligent in failing to disclose results of its 
1991 study regarding the potential vulnerability of the Coliseum in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * NOISE CONTROL: Approved a motion to temporarily suspend the city's 
noise-control ordinance within a one-mile radius of the Santa Monica Freeway to 
assist Caltrans in its effort to repair the earthquake-damaged freeway. The 
goal is to finish reconstruction by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 * PREMIERE TOWERS: Approved a $400,000 loan to the owners association of 
Premiere Towers, a 120-unit apartment complex at 621 S. Spring St. The money is 
to be used to provide security and to pay for utilities. The city Community 
Redevelopment Agency took over the building after the partnership that operated 
it went bankrupt, and the CRA now owns 88 of the units. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRAFFIC LIGHT: Approved Councilman Mike Hernandez's motion to proceed with 
the installation of a traffic signal at the intersection of San Fernando Road 
and Edwards Avenue, where a supermarket is under construction. The installation 
cost will be paid by Hughes Market, which plans to open the store in September. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * PARKING METER SLUGS: Approved an ordinance that fines users of 
illegal tokens in public parking meters an amount equal to the cost of 
repairing the meter. Repair costs range from $50 to $300. Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg argued against the original ordinance, which called for mandatory jail 
time not to exceed five days, saying it would exacerbate the problem of 
overcrowded jails. Passed 9-6. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Hernandez, 
Goldberg. Voting no: Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

HIV-POSITIVE WOMEN GET WORKSHOP OF THEIR OWN; PROGRAM FOCUSES ON ASSERTIVENESS, 
CHILD CARE NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 The seminar on how to live with HIV filled Pat Griffin with hope and 
determination, but it left her with one burning question: Where were all the 
women? 
</P>
<P>
 At next weekend's Los Angeles Shanti Foundation seminar at the T.H.E. Clinic 
in the Crenshaw district, things will be different. For the second time in a 
year, Griffin has helped organize a workshop geared toward women who are living 
with the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so much out of it, I started wondering why it couldn't be done for 
women only," Griffin, 41, said of a 1991 Shanti seminar that attracted few 
other women. "They had an hour presentation on women's issues, but that wasn't 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 After the seminar, Griffin approached Barbara Crofford, program manager of the 
nonprofit foundation, and began volunteering. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until October, however, that Griffin's mission was accomplished: The 
foundation sponsored its first weekend seminar for HIV-positive women and their 
care-givers, "Women for Positive Living," at the T.H.E. Clinic, 3860 W. Martin 
Luther King Jr. Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day workshops provide women with more than strategies to maintain good 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "People usually think in terms of medical intervention, but there's a lot 
more," said Crofford, who leads the workshop with Griffin. "This seminar is 
about the mind-body-immunology connection, and for women who may be struggling 
with self-esteem this is particularly important. We try to teach them how to 
have a higher quality of life overall." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 participants will hear discussions on the special needs of women: 
caring for children, practicing safe sex, asserting themselves with doctors and 
health care providers, and addressing gynecological problems. All of these can 
be difficult for women who are accustomed to being care-givers rather than 
care-takers and who often blame themselves for carrying and passing on the 
virus, Crofford said.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important fact participants learn at the seminar, Griffin 
said, is that they are not alone. "We provide a safe place for women to talk to 
other women, probably for the first time," she said. "We try to break the 
isolation, the stereotypes and stigmas attached to HIV and AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for me was being with other women," said Rhonda, a 
Los Angeles resident who participated in the October seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other workshops I went to were mostly attended by men. Here, it's not only 
HIV women attending, but also working as volunteers. People can really deal 
with you because they've walked in the shoes you've walked in. It's more 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of creating a nurturing environment, the foundation offers 
participants free child care, meals and transportation. At the sessions' end, 
women are given flowers, beauty products, candles and other gifts that 
reinforce a feeling of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to be Pollyanna, but neither is HIV a death certificate," 
Crofford said. "Participants can look around and see that there are other women 
like themselves who are happy, satisfied, and saying: 'Yes, I am HIV-positive.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, about one-fourth of the workshop volunteers, including Griffin, are 
HIV-positive. T.H.E. Clinic itself houses the county's largest support program 
for HIV-positive women. Griffin said that women, who constitute the 
fastest-growing group of documented AIDS cases, can't find the workshop soon 
enough, particularly women of color.  
</P>
<P>
 "Black and Latino women make up only 19% of the population, but they're 
accounting for 72% of all female AIDS cases," she said. "Women are too often 
reluctant to do things for themselves. We have to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 295-5671.

with HIV. Page 18 Women and AIDS

IT MAY BE A LOSING SEASON; RECOVERY: THOUSANDS OF JOBS ARE AT STAKE IF THE 
QUAKE-DAMAGED COLISEUM DOESN'T OPEN IN TIME FOR RAIDERS AND TROJANS FOOTBALL. 
RESTAURANTS AND OTHER BUSINESSES THAT COUNT ON FAN PATRONAGE COULD CLOSE. 
</P>

<P>
 If the quake-damaged Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum remains closed during the 
upcoming football season, the economic effects will be devastating for the city 
government and neighborhoods surrounding the historic stadium, economists and 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and the USC Trojans draw hundreds of thousands of fans, many of 
whom are the lifeblood for local businesses that can directly link more than 
half of their annual income to football games. And Coliseum officials say the 
stadium and adjacent Sports Arena are the second-largest employers in 
South-Central, providing about 8,000 full- and part-time jobs, most of them to 
local residents.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city receives about $1 million annually in sales taxes from a 
combined revenue of about $26.3 million in ticket sales, concessions and 
parking fees from USC and Raiders games, according to figures in a state 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Coliseum shuts down, it would just be tragic in a whole variety of 
ways," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to the 70-year-old Coliseum may also force the cancellation of the 
monthlong World Festival, which is expected to draw up to 250,000 people paying 
$6 to $12 each for soccer exhibitions and concerts preceding the World Cup in 
July, a spokesman for the event said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with USC and the museums in Exposition Park, the Coliseum is one of the 
economic anchors in an area struggling to overcome the lingering effects of the 
1992 riots. Its closure would deal a major setback to long-term revitalization 
efforts, say business owners and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have said repairs to the stadium will cost at least $33 
million, about half of which is expected to be covered by federal grants. 
Though the officials are awaiting a structural report expected this week, they 
have said the damage appears so extensive that it might not be repaired in time 
for the football season, which starts in August with preseason games and can 
last until January if the Raiders make the playoffs, as they did this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford another economic blow in this community," said Levi Kingston, 
chief executive officer of the Community Consortium, a coalition of 
neighborhood and business organizations in the Exposition Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of life without football weighed heavily last week on the minds of 
local business operators, who are already suffering from the riots and the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the football season has always carried restaurants around here," 
said Rudy Polin, chief executive officer of Julie's Trojan Barrel, a venerable 
USC football hangout at 3724 S. Figueroa St. 
</P>
<P>
 With its photos and wall paintings of Trojan football greats, Julie's is 
packed with fans before and after the five or six USC home games each year and 
the eight to 10 Raiders home games. Those crowds account for about 40% of the 
restaurant's annual business, Polin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie's has yet to recover from the riots, which scared away its nighttime 
clientele. The loss of the football crowd, Polin said, "would be the nail in 
the coffin" for the tavern.

 Down the block from Julie's, the Margarita Jones restaurant relies on the 
football season for about 60% of its annual business. Before and after Raiders 
games, the Mexican restaurant is packed with fans decked out in silver and 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no football, we will have to close the restaurant," said general 
manager Antonieta Montoya. "It's what we wait for all year -- football." 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from football and other Coliseum events accounted for about $1 million 
last year for the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, formerly the University Hilton, 
which is across the street from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters from visiting college teams often book more than half of the hotel's 
250 rooms for up to five days, said general manager Albert A. Salah. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a tremendous amount of money -- not just for us, but for 
everybody around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the football season, Coliseum spokeswoman Cindy Rubin said, the stadium 
provides many of the sport complex's 8,000 full- and part-time jobs, ranging 
from parking lot attendants and maintenance workers to vendors. That total is 
second only to USC in the number of jobs provided in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the workers are low-income people "who are already living on the 
edge," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, spokeswoman for Local 11 of the Service 
Employees International Union, which represents about 400 Coliseum food service 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum is also the centerpiece of the World Festival, which is scheduled 
to begin in June and culminate with the Word Cup final in Pasadena July 17. The 
event is meant to give Angelenos an affordable taste of international soccer 
through a variety of musical, artistic, sports and culinary events. The 
Coliseum would house the major events such as soccer games and concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Coliseum in disrepair, those activities that would bring in the 
largest crowds are in jeopardy," said Todd Parker of World Cup USA 1994. He 
said festival officials are considering other sites, including the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena and the Los Angeles Convention Center, if the Coliseum is not repaired 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said the World Festival is intended to be accessible to 
families that might not be able to afford tickets to World Cup games, which run 
from $25 to $475 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them would likely patronize affordable food outlets such as McDonald's 
at 2800 S. Figueroa St., which sees its sales rise 5% to 10% on Coliseum event 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we will be affected," said Rahim Aref, director of operations for 
the hamburger franchise. "I hope they fix (the Coliseum) soon."

 COMIC HERO GETS A SUPER RESPONSE23-YEAR-OLD CRENSHAW NATIVE IS NOW 
DISTRIBUTING A SECOND ISSUE ILLUSTRATED BY A NEW PARTNER, HAS A LITERARY AGENT 
AND IS SPEAKING WITH SHOW BUSINESS TYPES ABOUT DEVELOPING HIS COMIC BOOK INTO A 
FILM OR TELEVISION PRODUCTION. "I ALWAYS FIGURED I WOULD KEEP PUSHING, NO 
MATTER WHAT," SAID TOWNSEND, A UCLA GRADUATE WHO SEEMS GENUINELY TAKEN ABACK BY 
THE FLURRY OF ATTENTION. "BUT I NEVER EXPECTED THIS." THE ATTENTION ENABLED 
TOWNSEND TO ENLIST THE HELP OF ANOTHER ARTIST, OTIS PARSONS SCHOOL OF DESIGN 
STUDENT RODNEY CLOUDEN, WHILE HE CONCENTRATED ON DEVELOPING THE STORY LINE. 
"STEVE HAD A GOOD CAUSE WITH THIS COMIC BOOK, PLUS I THOUGHT IT WAS A HOT IDEA 
ARTISTICALLY," SAID CLOUDEN, AN INGLEWOOD RESIDENT. "IT TOOK A LOT OF TIME, BUT 
IT'S BEEN WORTH IT." THE SERIES' MAIN CHARACTER, 19-YEAR-OLD ANTON PETERS, IS 
SOMETHING LIKE TOWNSEND: AN ORDINARY MAN WHO IS INSPIRED TO FIGHT CRIME AFTER 
HIS BROTHER, AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER, IS KILLED IN GANG CROSS-FIRE. AFTER THE 
DEATHS OF TWO FRIENDS IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS, TOWNSEND TOOK UP HIS PEN AND BEGAN 
SHAPING HIS HERO, "THE HOOD." WHILE THE FIRST ISSUE RECOUNTS THE STORY OF HOW 
ANTON DECIDES TO DON A MASK AND BATTLE CRIME BY NIGHT, THE SECOND DELVES MORE 
DEEPLY INTO ANTON PERSONALLY AND SHOWS THE CONTEXT OF HIS LIFE. "HE STARTS TO 
THINK ABOUT HIS GOALS, ABOUT EXACTLY HOW HE'S GOING TO GO ABOUT FIGHTING CRIME 
AND NOT KILLING PEOPLE," TOWNSEND SAID. "I ALSO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT GANG 
MEMBERS, DRUG DEALERS AS REAL PEOPLE, NOT AS CARDBOARD CUTOUTS. IT'S A LOT TO 
INCLUDE IN 24 PAGES, BUT I WANT TO BRING IN AS MUCH REALISM AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT 
MAKING IT PREACHY." WITH 2,000 COPIES OF HIS NEW ISSUE IN HAND, TOWNSEND IS 
PASSING MOST OF THEM ON TO THREE NATIONAL COMIC BOOK DISTRIBUTORS -- DIAMOND, 
CAPITOL CITY AND HERO'S WORLD -- WHILE HE WORKS TO GET THEM IN LOCAL 
BOOKSTORES. THE NEW ISSUE IS PRICED AT $2, AND TOWNSEND EXPECTS TO HAVE A THIRD 
ISSUE OUT BY JUNE. JOHNNY LEVIN, A WILLIAM MORRIS AGENT REPRESENTING TOWNSEND, 
SAID "THE HOOD" IS AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME: "IT REALLY RESONATES WITH A LOT 
OF PEOPLE THESE DAYS. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT STEVE CAN CREATE." 
HOWEVER SUCCESSFUL THE VENTURE BECOMES, TOWNSEND DOESN'T WANT TO CONTINUE "THE 
HOOD" INDEFINITELY. "I DON'T WANT TO DO 300 ISSUES," HE SAID. "I WANT THIS TO 
BE SORT OF A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. PEOPLE CAN LOOK BACK ON THIS ONE DAY AND SAY: 
'WOW, THIS STUFF HAPPENED IN THE '80S AND '90S, BUT THANK GOODNESS IT'S NOT 
HAPPENING ANYMORE." 'ERIN J. AUBRYTOWNSEND, STEPHENSOUTH CENTRAL COMICSCOMIC

 For dancer and choreographer Pat Taylor, the upcoming performances of "Midtown 
Sunset" with jazzman Mark Shelby are a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taylor and her two partners opened the Dance Collective studio on Degnan 
Boulevard a year ago, she had envisioned joining forces with the musical talent 
that regularly jammed at the World Stage, a small but prolific jazz spot across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much artistic ability here, I knew right away I wanted to do 
something," Taylor said. "Now it's come to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of a $5,000 Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibits artists' projects 
grant, Taylor and Shelby, a bass player and leader of the Black/Note Jazz 
Quintet, were able to mount "Midtown Sunset." It is a concert piece based on 
and named for one of artist Romare Bearden's seven collages depicting slices of 
postwar black American life. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor had always been inspired by Bearden's work. "I try to capture the 
feeling of improvisation, the complexity and rhythms, coloring and phrasing of 
his work," Taylor said. "I did a lot of research on Bearden and found out he 
was very much inspired by jazz. Illustrating his work with dance and jazz music 
made sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's six-member troupe, the Jazzantiqua Dance Ensemble, will perform 
"Midtown Sunset" accompanied by a quartet that Shelby formed for the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first large-scale piece I've composed for dancers, and it's been 
a real challenge," said Shelby, 28. "But the whole spirit of the piece, the 
nature of the art, made it easy for me to do. And the fact that Pat and I do 
our work here really makes it part of the community too." 
</P>
<P>
 "Midtown Sunset" performs at 8 p.m. Friday and at 3 p.m. Feb. 20 at the 
Morgan-Wixson Theatre, 2627 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. Tickets are $8 and $10.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: HYDE PARK; CHURCH TAKES PUPILS DISPLACED BY QUAKE 
</P>

<P>
 The row of fluttering blue and yellow balloons tethered to a chain-link fence 
at St. John the Evangelist Church welcomed 190 students last week from 
earthquake-damaged Nativity School, a small South Los Angeles campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the quake happened, the diocese was brainstorming about what they could 
do, and came up with this," said St. John Principal Margaret Welle. "It's real 
lucky we had the space here. We're glad to be able to accommodate them." 
</P>
<P>
 As Catholic school officials pondered what to do with the displaced Nativity 
population, Welle and a local Catholic school administrator suggested using the 
little-used rooms on St. John's campus and in its parish hall basement across 
Victoria Avenue from the church. Though it meant that the school would be 
divided -- kindergarten through fourth grade on one side of the street, fifth 
and sixth on another -- most of the Nativity staff, students and parents 
welcomed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "To find all this room was nothing short of a miracle," said Nativity 
Principal Sister Ann Dermody, surrounded Monday by stacks of cardboard boxes in 
her makeshift office in the basement. "Even though it rained today, it didn't 
hinder us. Nearly everyone is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nativity's three-mile move from Vermont Avenue and 57th Street continued right 
up through Feb. 4, three days before students were scheduled to arrive. 
Classroom essentials, such as desks with books still inside, were moved 
wholesale; computer and library materials, file cabinets and other equipment 
will remain while Nativity's fate is being decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nativity's church was relatively unharmed by the quake, the school 
was hit hard. The main kitchen and several bathrooms are unusable, access to 
rooms was cut off, holes were ripped through walls, ceilings cracked and many 
rooms have been condemned. The school was seismically retrofitted in 1988, 
"probably the only reason it's still standing," Welle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though quickly prepared, the basement quarters at St. John's parish hall have 
the pleasant air of a new apartment, smelling of fresh paint and just-laid 
carpet. The fifth- and sixth-grade students readily adjusted to being seated in 
an open room, remaining studiously quiet as teachers alternated instruction and 
individual activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be in school again, even though we have to work extra hard to 
catch up," said 11-year-old Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being at home three weeks felt like being in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Nativity's students swells the 
kindergarten-through-eighth-grade population at St. John by two-thirds, but the 
schools will operate fairly independently of each other. While bathroom and 
playground facilities are shared on the main campus, the parish hall has its 
own playground and other facilities. Ill-equipped to deal with more students, 
the small cafeteria serves cold lunches to Nativity students. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they said they are pleased with the arrangement, Welle and Dermody said 
they are worried about ongoing student transportation. Most Nativity parents 
don't own cars; few can afford monthly bus passes for their children. Last week 
most students were taxied over to St. John by teachers and parents who 
coordinated pools.  
</P>
<P>
 The principals have been unsuccessful in getting bus services donated by local 
politicians or organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 Dermody and Welle said that Nativity will remain at St. John at least through 
June. And for the time being, many students said they are grateful to be back 
in school, improvised though it may be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got bored at home. I wanted to come back," said 12-year-old Alejandro 
Ramirez. "It feels kind of weird to not really know where anything is, but it's 
OK. My mom thinks it's good that I'm here, though it's kind of far." ERIN J.

 Pregnant teen-agers in at least three local high schools will get a chance to 
learn more about becoming better mothers and delivering healthy babies. 
</P>
<P>
 White Memorial Medical Center has received a $10,000 grant from the March of 
Dimes Campaign for Healthier Babies to send a nurse to the high schools over 
the next year. Nurse Janet Byers began the program at Lincoln and Riley high 
schools Thursday morning and hopes to visit Garfield and Roosevelt high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the first of its kind offered by the medical center, said 
Melanie Thiel, family education coordinator at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens are more at risk during pregnancy because of their age, educational 
level and socioeconomic level," Thiel said. "They are more likely to deliver 
premature and low-birth-weight babies, and they're a greater risk group for 
using drugs, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Byers, a registered nurse who teaches Lamaze and is a consultant for new 
mothers on breast-feeding, will conduct weekly classes at each of the schools. 
Classes will focus on nutrition, fetal growth, the labor and delivery process, 
breast-feeding and baby care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistics have shown that prenatal education helps reduce the chances of 
low-birth-weight and premature babies in any age group," Byers said. "This 
population tends to not seek prenatal care, or they're not plugged into a 
program that's geared toward their age group, so they don't get this 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at White Memorial, 295 girls who were 16 or younger delivered 
babies. In 1992, County-USC Medical Center, which delivers more babies than any 
other hospital in the nation, delivered more than 9,500 babies to girls 17 or 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Thiel gathered statistics from the targeted high schools that showed that in 
1991-92, the most recent school year for which numbers are available, 200 
pregnant teen-agers were at Lincoln High School, 85 were at Garfield and 100 
were at Roosevelt. At Riley High School, which takes pregnant teen-agers from 
three areas of the city, 700 were enrolled that school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to reach at least 200 teens, and possibly 500," Thiel said. "A 
lot of it depends on how soon we can meet with the girls." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the classes at each school, White will offer pregnant 
teen-agers a series of Lamaze classes. The $20 fee will be reimbursed if the 
student attends all classes and buys an infant car seat; if the student does 
not buy a car seat, hospital officials will give her the seat and retain the 
$20 fee.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; AVENIDA CHAVEZ TO GET TREES, MURALS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps and several community organizations are 
planning a yearlong project along Avenida Cesar Chavez to plant trees, paint 
murals and clean up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will begin April 30 when 40 trees are planted between Eastern 
Avenue and Soto Street, moving west as the year progresses, said Arturo 
Rodriguez of the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists also will begin work on seven murals that will be placed on temporary 
panels. They will be exhibited for six months, then removed so new murals can 
take their place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need outreach into the community and we want it to be grass-roots," said 
Eddie Gomez, who is coordinating the mural effort. "This is a call to the 
community for more artists to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez also needs donations of paint, brushes, dropcloths and money for 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exhibit will center around Chavez, who died last April 23. Chavez 
founded the United Farmworkers of America, which worked to improve the 
conditions of migrant farm workers. He was noted for his humble demeanor and 
lifestyle that reflected the poverty of the people whom he represented. 
Rodriguez said the project will focus on Chavez's accomplishments through the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that each tree planting will have a theme so that the children 
learn about him and his life, because some of them think he's the boxer, (Julio 
Cesar Chavez)," Rodriguez said. "We have a group that will do the research on 
the union -- when they got their first contract, when they won their first 
court case -- so we're not only planting trees but educating the children."

<P>
 The Bard is hip at Theater 6470. 
</P>
<P>
 In the company's 40-minute "Riffs of Shakespeare," Petruchio has a difficult 
time taming Kate, who punches him in the stomach and pulls at his ear as he 
pleads with her to marry him. Romeo lurks in the audience and speaks Spanish to 
Juliet when she calls for him. Gangs in "Henry V" drive lowriders and pack 
AK-47s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pretty funny," said William Martinez, 17. "I thought this stuff was 
boring before, but now I'm interested." 
</P>
<P>
 To capture the attention of today's teen-agers, Theater 6470, a 5-year-old 
nonprofit corporation founded on Hollywood's Theatre Row, has turned 
Shakespeare on its ear. This month, the seven-member company began a tour of 25 
junior and senior high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District with 
a performance at Odyssey High School. The tour is funded by a $13,600 grant 
from the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Jill Holden, who founded Theater 6470 with fellow actor John Evans, said the 
parody draws themes from Shakespeare plays and sonnets that are familiar to 
younger audiences: love and passion, hate and war. "Shakespeare has so much to 
say about life today, we wanted to make it more accessible," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students snickered as actors scrambled across the concrete gymnasium stage, 
throwing off a pink frock in favor of a green sash, a skullcap or a chiffon 
scarf. The group rapped love songs and flirted with one another to the tune of 
a synthesizer. Complicated sentence structures were traded for conjunctions and 
phony accents. 
</P>
<P>
 In one scene, Mercutio is slain by a Capulet armed with a plastic sword. He 
dies valiantly, loudly, with Romeo by his side. It's important that death 
scenes are dramatic, said Valente Rodriguez, a company member who directs the 
audience in the art of dying obnoxiously. 
</P>
<P>
 During a workshop after the performance, actors asked students what they liked 
and didn't like about the play. Students agreed Spanish verse was in, rap was 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also solicited students' suggestions about how to change the way 
it performs the marriage proposal scene from "The Taming of the Shrew." 
Teen-agers advised Kate and Petruchio to speak Spanish to each other, act like 
slobbering monsters with their hands tied behind them, and have Petruchio be a 
6-year-old while Kate was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: They call me Katherine 
that do talk of me," said Alicia Henriquez, 19, who acted out the proposal 
scene between Kate and Petruchio with a fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made sense when I got up there and did it; it was real," Henriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was invited to Odyssey as part of an effort by administrators and 
teachers to expose students to the outside world. "We're trying to bring 
community resources into the school to get the kids involved in the community 
and the community involved in the students," said Bob Engel, special education 
chairman at Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers plan to introduce Shakespeare into their classrooms with the hope 
that this performance has given students a greater interest in Old World plays 
rather than modern-day mischief, Principal Lupe Paramo said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; 3% UTILITY TAX IS KEPT TO FUND 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to continue a 3% utility tax -- with the 
blessing of residents who supported higher bills to pay for additional police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, added to water, electric and telephone bills, has helped stabilize 
the city's general fund, officials said, and has allowed the Police Department 
to hire one sergeant, six officers, five jailers and two clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident and business owner Sergio Palos said the tax has been a small price 
to pay for the protection of his family. "A 3% tax is well worth the investment 
for the safety of my five children. Everyone here is for it," Palos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Palos has moved his business, Clockwork Printing Co., out of the 
city, his wife still owns a wedding invitation shop in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the City Council initiated the tax in October, 1992, to keep the Police 
Department fully staffed, crime has dropped, Mayor Ric Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
 To thwart vehicle thefts and curtail fake-document vendors, the Police 
Department used tax revenues to institute a bicycle patrol in the central 
business district, said Police Chief Frank Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the funds also were used to open a substation at Salt Lake Park last 
month, he said. Although the police chief said it is difficult to track drug 
dealers and transient and gang activities, he has declared the park "clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the tax was instituted, property values have increased by 8%, Loya said, 
and the city has fallen from "car theft capital of the nation" to fourth or 
fifth. Police have documented a 7% decrease in vehicle thefts in the city's 
central business district since additional patrols hit the streets, Sullivan 
said. More than half of all vehicles stolen in the city are taken from the 
central business district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility tax revenues are also diverted into the city's operating budget to 
offset losses from state "take-aways," according to a report by Donald Jeffers, 
the city's chief administrative officer. The tax generated about $101,000 a 
month over the last three months and constituted 10% of total general fund 
revenue, Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials predicted the tax could add $1.2 million to city coffers 
annually but have been unable to determine if that goal has been reached 
because of inconsistent revenues during the tax's first few months, Jeffers 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park joins other Southeast-area cities keeping their general funds 
out of the red with utility taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maywood instituted a 5% utility tax in November, 1992, to build up its 
reserves and to replace property and sales-tax revenues lost in the recession, 
said Ron Lindsey, Maywood chief administrative officer. The tax, which brings 
in about $50,000 a month, has prevented Maywood administrators from laying off 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell and Cudahy have 10% and 4% utility user taxes, respectively. Vernon, 
South Gate and Bell Gardens do not have utility taxes. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved adding a youth center to a community 
facility that will be built in Lugo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund the youth center, the city is applying for $250,000 from the county 
Regional Park and Open Space District's Safe Neighborhood Park grant 
program.The funds are needed because the cost of adding a youth area to the 
community center were higher than expected, said Nick Mull, assistant city 
manager. The city received $1.3 million in Proposition A funds last year that 
cover the park expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cudahy needs additional athletic facilities because its after-school sports 
programs, including basketball, volleyball, baseball, flag football, 
cross-country, and track and field, have tripled in size, said Rob Gaylord, 
parks and recreation director.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the community center, the expansion of Lugo Park will include a 
soccer field and expanded picnic and parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth center will provide students with a place to come after school to 
relax, watch television or do their homework, Mull said. The facility will 
feature a private area with computers and reference materials, and a social 
area that will include a TV, VCR and jobs board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids on the community center will be sought in May. The park expansion is to 
be finished in 1995. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 The Crescent Arms project team is doing a seismic retrofit of an 11-story 
building at 8th Street and Beacon Avenue, but its assistance to several 
families left homeless by the earthquake did even more to reinforce goodwill in 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A donation of $5,000 from the project team, plus $5,000 from World Vision, 
enabled 22 families to move to other apartments after their building at 744 S. 
Beacon Ave. suffered significant damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction crew, working across the street from the damaged building, 
became worried when they saw their neighbors suddenly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were families living on the sidewalk and the kids were running around 
in the street," said Steven Rhodes, project manager for Morley Construction 
Co., a member of the Crescent Arms team. 
</P>
<P>
 A call went out to Father Philip Lance of Pueblo Nuevo, a congregation that is 
active in the neighborhood. Lance helped organize a relief effort with funds 
from the Crescent Arms team and World Vision, an international Christian relief 
and development agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake we were sleeping in the parking lot," Dora Escorcia said 
of her family of five. "When we got the money to move we found a place just 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "First I thanked God and then Morley Construction. If it hadn't been for them 
and Father Philip, I don't know what we would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the families also applied for federal emergency assistance, the money 
from the Crescent Arms team allowed them to move immediately. Many found 
apartments in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crescent Arms project team, which includes the Crescent Bay Co., the Los 
Angeles Neighborhood Development Corp., Morley Construction Co. and Killefer 
Flammang Purtill Architects, also donated food and diapers to the families, and 
clothing and other items to a thrift store run by Pueblo Nuevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crescent Arms, at 1709 8th St., was built in 1924 and originally was 
called the Beaux Arts Building. It contained a stage and a theater; more 
recently it was used as an insurance company's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the retrofitting and other extensive modifications are complete, possibly 
by the end the year, the building will have 231 apartments for senior citizens. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase of the project calls for construction of a 68-unit building 
for senior citizens and a 66-unit complex for families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pueblo Nuevo congregation, established in the spring of 1992 with the 
support of the Episcopal Church, is expanding its work through its nonprofit 
community development corporation. In addition to the thrift store, Pueblo 
Nuevo Enterprises manages a property maintenance company employing janitors, 
general repair workers, landscapers and others from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A retail center next to the church in the 1700 block of 7th Street and a 
business training course are planned for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a ceremony to celebrate the local relief effort, residents thanked members 
of the project team and World Vision. A colorful banner hung from a trailer at 
the construction site with the words "Juntos Somos Comunidad" (United We Are a 
Community). 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't build a community just by building houses," said Joel McLafferty, 
president of the Crescent Bay Co., one of the developers. "That's why we wanted 
to help out here." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; LEADERSHIP PROGRAM GRADS SHARE IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 12 graduates of the Pico-Union Neighborhood Leadership Program want 
neighborhood youths to have the opportunities and resources to become effective 
leaders and productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 And to achieve those goals, the program participants -- all of whom live or 
work in Pico-Union, Westlake or Koreatown -- will apply the lessons they 
learned in the 14-week program. 
</P>
<P>
 Coro Southern California, a nonprofit educational foundation, polishes the 
skills of people already recognized for their leadership abilities and 
dedication to improving their communities. In addition to completing Coro 
training exercises, the participants interviewed public officials, police 
officers, church leaders, teachers, students and parents, collected demographic 
data on Pico-Union and worked on group projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us knew one another before but we'd never worked together as a team," 
said Marino Minino, a health educator with Core Latino Project. "One thing we 
learned was that whatever it is, it is not." 
</P>
<P>
 Minino explained that with the complexities of issues in Pico-Union and the 
diversity of the residents, every problem has several layers. Individuals' 
perceptions vary and simple answers don't apply. "Differences exist between 
everybody," he said. "We just have to know how to work it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Davis, another participant and director of programs at the Alcoholism 
Center for Women, agreed that group interaction was the program's most valuable 
element. Looking at a problem from the perspectives of all the group's members 
helped her remember "not to jump to conclusions and to look at all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The culmination of the group's efforts was "Youth in Crisis: The Effects of 
Crime on Education in Pico-Union," a report citing census data that show the 
area's levels of unemployment, poverty and overcrowding exceed city averages. 
Those conditions especially hurt local youths, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As more educational resources and recreational programs are being cut 
countywide, communities that already have limited resources are suffering and 
we are presently feeling its effects," the report states. "In Pico-Union, there 
is a correlation between the lack of adequate school resources and the violence 
it breeds in a community that is socially, politically and financially in 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 Among its recommendations, the group called for increased parental 
participation in school activities, enhanced community-based policing around 
schools, English and literacy classes for parents, more recreation centers, job 
training, greater political participation and additional funding for social 
services and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The other graduates and their organizations are: Juan Carlos Cristales (El 
Rescate), Juan Flores (Centro Santo Tomas de Ayuda al Necesitado), Mariana 
Francisco (Clinica Monsignor Oscar Romero), Thelma Garcia (Hoover-Berendo Adult 
Education Centers), Rafael Gonzalez (field deputy, City Councilman Mike 
Hernandez), Sophia Park (Korean Youth and Community Center), Sushma Raman 
(Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law), Landy Rosales, (Pio Pico 
Elementary School parents group), Gloria Soto (Angelica Lutheran Church) and 
Noe Mendez-Vides (Clinica Monsignor Oscar Romero).

 About 800 young business professionals volunteered last week at the Nissan Los 
Angeles Open golf tournament, a 68-year-old event that raised $400,000 last 
year for more than 40 charitable and community service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized and hosted by the Downtown-based Los Angeles Junior Chamber of 
Commerce, the tournament in Pacific Palisades is the oldest civic-sponsored 
Professional Golfers Assn.Tour event and the Junior Chamber's major annual 
fund-raiser. The Junior Chamber uses the proceeds for its community service 
projects, which include hosting an annual foster family picnic and helping 
coordinate the L.A. Watts Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. became the title sponsor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteering at the tournament, held at the Riviera Country Club, provides 
Junior Chamber members with not only a chance to rub elbows with golf 
professionals and Hollywood celebrities, but also to help disadvantaged youths, 
spokeswoman Susan Forte said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Archibold, one of the Junior Chamber members who helped at the 
tournament, said that despite the long hours that many volunteers devoted to 
the internationally televised event, "it wasn't really work because you know 
it's going to a worthy cause. Plus, it's good people involved and a lot of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 One thousand volunteers worked behind the scenes organizing crowds, escorting 
golfers and managing parking and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also said the closure of the Santa Monica Freeway and other 
earthquake damage did not deter volunteers or tournament visitors. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; AGREEMENT SOUGHT ON DEVELOPER'S RENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city Community Redevelopment Agency has begun negotiations with Bunker 
Hill Associates, developer of the California Plaza, to collect at least part of 
the $3 million in back rent the company owes the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials hope the developer will pay at least $2.1 million of the 
overdue holding rent the company was supposed to pay to reserve land in the 
California Plaza project, which is three buildings from completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both sides expressed optimism that an agreement will be made. 
But if the two sides fail to renegotiate a new holding rent agreement in two 
months, the agency could still force Bunker Hill Associates to pay $2.1 million 
in bond proceeds -- as well as drop the company as developer of the 
yet-to-be-built towers -- by pursuing default actions. Agency officials said 
they hope to avoid those default proceedings, in part because the agency must 
then find another developer to finish the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to keep up the relationship with (Bunker Hill Associates) because 
they have performed so well and proven themselves as willing and capable 
developers," said Jeffrey Skorneck, project manager for the redevelopment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1981 development pact, Bunker Hill Associates agreed to build out the 
five-block California Plaza in phases over 10 years. An L-shaped area bordered 
by Grand Avenue, 2nd, Olive, Hill and 4th streets, the plaza offers a mix of 
commercial, residential and cultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Bunker Hill Associates has constructed two office buildings, one 
condominium tower and the Hotel Inter-Continental at the plaza, which also 
houses the Museum of Contemporary Art. A third office building and two 
residential buildings, with a total of 523 units, remain to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bunker Hill Associates has not submitted drawings for the remaining 
construction phases and stopped paying holding rent in March, 1992, when the 
monthly rent ballooned from $12,000 to $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge rent jump was negotiated in the development agreement to encourage 
the plaza's timely development and prevent the land from being tied up 
indefinitely, the agency's staff said. The project was expected to have been 
completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bunker Hill Associates now wants the agency to reconsider this rent 
increase in light of the local economy and real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer wants to remain in the project and is committed to finishing it, 
said Peggy Adams, senior vice president and general counsel for MS Management 
Services, the local representative for Bunker Hill Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adams would not say if her company would agree to pay the $2.1 million the 
agency seeks. She said a number of related issues must also be addressed during 
the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those considerations is how to accommodate a local performing-arts 
school that is interested in moving to the California Plaza. The R.D. Colburn 
School of Performing Arts, which provides music, dance and drama classes to 800 
students aged 3 to 18, is now housed near USC in "inadequate facilities," the 
agency's staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school said it has sufficient money to construct and operate the school at 
California Plaza, but has asked the agency for a long-term lease at a nominal 
cost. The agency's staff spoke favorably of the idea, noting that the school 
would benefit from California Plaza's proximity to the Music Center, the future 
Walt Disney Concert Hall and the potential to interact with professionals, 
while California Plaza would benefit from having a school that would be open 
evenings and weekends as a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's the sort of institution that can add a lot of activity, culture 
and opportunity," Skorneck said. IRIS YOKOI

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teen Post Inc. is sponsoring a penny drive to raise funds for its third annual 
trip to Africa for local youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds from the drive, which began earlier this month, will help pay for 
a two-week tour of Egypt scheduled for July, said Georgia Hunt, director of the 
South-Central Teen Post. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 10 youths from Teen Post's Cultural Education Project will be 
selected for the trip, Hunt said. Each participant is expected to contribute 
about $2,500 toward air fare and lodging, and Teen Post will provide additional 
monies, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, started in 1989, focuses on providing a cultural and educational 
vacation for youths ages 9 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the program has taken students to Ghana and the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Credit Union is among local businesses supporting the program by 
collecting pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in (this program) because we're interested in all community 
projects that add to the quality of life here," said Jim Taylor, chief 
executive officer of the Watts Credit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging our members to support this program." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen Post Inc. provides field trips and mentoring for local youths in 
Chinatown, Venice, Pueblo del Rio and South-Central.

him a chance to spend the weekend in the snow-covered mountains, he envisioned 
a relaxing weekend away from South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 But what he discovered was a forum to frankly discuss race relations, drugs, 
family values and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what surprised me was when people talked about things like getting 
raped," said Lambern, a sophomore at Manual Arts High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought nobody could do nothing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambern is among 95 students from South-Central schools who took part in a 
retreat this weekend at Camp Big Pine near Snow Summit sponsored by the 
Community Drug Free School Zone Safe Passage Project.  
</P>
<P>
 During the retreat, known as "youth lock-ins," students from Locke, Dorsey, 
Jefferson and Washington high schools agreed to spend three days away from 
radios, Walkmans, and families to talk about their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is remove them from their everyday experience so we 
can give them a new experience not only physically but emotionally," said Sandi 
Hamilton, Safe Passage project director at Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way the kids will feel safe enough to share and talk about sexual abuse, 
molestation, drugs and other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began in 1991, places students with 20 adults -- including 
teachers, counselors, licensed psychologists and college professors -- in small 
workshops where they take on issues such as race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try and let them know what they have in common," said Daniel Santa Cruz, a 
Safe Passage program manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll talk about the common bonds between African Americans and Latinos in 
terms of history, economics and music. And we get into this thing that we often 
see of territorialism that happens in our community and try and foster a 'we' 
approach instead of this color thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For students such as Lambern, the program's allure lies in its promotion of 
frank talk that helps them deal with parents and peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually learned to talk to my dad about sex," Lambern said. "I learned how 
to ask him questions, like 'When you're ready to do something, what should you 
ask your partner?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend program, which is funded by a grant from the state Department of 
Alcohol and Drug Program, costs about $15,000, Hamilton said. The payoff comes 
in combatting the area's high dropout rates and letting teen-agers know help is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen tremendous changes in people," Santa Cruz said. "We've had young 
people in the program who have literally turned their lives around." 
</P>
<P>
 While the promise of change is not the primary reason newcomers Wendy Escobar, 
18, and Cathy Thorns, 17, enrolled, they hope to learn something about their 
peers and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to hopefully get a better attitude and maybe think differently, learn 
new stuff and bring back some of that here," said Escobar, a senior at Manual 
Arts.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance to get away to the snow," said Thorns, "but I'm also thinking 
about the workshops." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

AT THE CROSSROADS; CAN DEVELOPERS AND MERCHANTS RETURN BROADWAY TO ITS GLORY 
DAYS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its heyday, it was Los Angeles' classiest strip, a bustling thoroughfare 
studded with bright lights, fine department stores and architectural works of 
art. Before Hollywood Boulevard, its palatial baroque- and rococo-style 
theaters showcased glitzy world premieres and lively vaudeville performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than 50 years after it reigned supreme, the Downtown Broadway 
corridor is a shadow of its once-glamorous self, struggling to find its place 
in an urban culture dominated by suburban sprawl. Its sidewalks are dirty and 
die at night. Its opulent movie palaces play to sparse crowds or have been 
converted to discount retail outlets. The fear of crime pervades. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers and city officials, seeking to lure more people to live, work 
and shop in the area, are pinning their hopes on ambitious redevelopment plans 
and increased private-sector involvement to recapture Broadway's faded luster. 
</P>
<P>
 The area, stretching roughly from 2nd Street to Olympic Boulevard, is already 
a major shopping district for Southern California's growing Latino market and 
features one of the city's liveliest daytime street scenes. Aiming to build on 
those strengths, city bureaucrats have commissioned a $150,000 study to help 
establish an entertainment district centered around the historic theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 With a mix of shoppers and a unique street scene, developers and officials 
hope to create a diverse, festive environment teeming with activity at all 
hours, as envisioned in a recently released Downtown Strategic Plan. The 
137-page document, prepared over the past four years by citizens and government 
officials, sets forth far-reaching proposals to guide Downtown business and 
residential development into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the face lift already are under way. Near 3rd Street, a $65-million 
renovation will improve the Grand Central Market, add a parking structure and 
build 121 mixed-income apartment units next door at the Million Dollar Theater 
building. The developers hope to keep the current Latino clientele and attract 
a wider mix of customers ranging from several thousand state office workers who 
will be relocated Downtown over the next several years to tenants of new 
residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, in what has become a nationwide trend of private groups reclaiming 
blighted downtown areas, Broadway business owners recently formed an assessment 
district to raise funds for street cleaning and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see an extraordinary set of opportunities," said Ira Yellin, developer of 
the Grand Central project and owner of the Bradbury Building across the street, 
where a $12-million renovation restored the office structure to its 
turn-of-the-century splendor. "We have one of the great boulevards that the 
city has ever built." 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics say that it could be years before the plans for Broadway yield 
benefits, which could be too long for the street's businesses that are on the 
verge of going under. "It's a good idea, but the question is how long is it 
going to take?" asked Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development 
Corp. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Business and marketing experts say a successful turnaround could take five to 
15 years and would need to include improved parking and more restaurants and 
stores that attract middle-class customers of all ethnicities. Most of the 
street's shoppers are low-income immigrants, 57% of whom earned $10,000 or less 
a year, according to a 1988 Community Redevelopment Agency study. 
</P>
<P>
 Patronage of stores along Broadway has also declined by as much as 20% since 
1990, according to a Community Redevelopment Agency draft report prepared in 
December. The decrease was attributed mainly to the recession, but was also due 
to competition from nearby malls and commercial areas that are drawing away 
Latinos, such as Pacific Avenue in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long many of us are going to be able to hang on," said 
Richard Blitz, owner of Farmacia Million Dollar near 3rd Street, who has been 
doing business on Broadway for 25 years. Like many other business owners, he 
supports plans to revitalize the strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway's glory days date back to the first third of the century. From 1907 
to 1932, the Broadway and Bullocks department stores and more than a dozen 
movie houses and performing arts theaters were built between 3rd Street and 
Olympic Boulevard. During that era, the strip reigned as the state's 
largest-grossing theater district, according to the Los Angeles Historic 
Theatre Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cameo Theater, which opened in 1910 at 528 S. Broadway, held the 
distinction of being the oldest continuously running movie house in California 
until it closed in 1991. It is now a retail clothing outlet. Also opening on 
the same block in 1910 was the Pantages Theater, which showcased the renowned 
vaudeville circuit of the same name. It was founded by entertainment magnate 
Alexander Pantages, who built the Hollywood Pantages Theater in 1929. The 
Pantages on Broadway changed its name to the Arcade and has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most splendid movie palaces was the Los Angeles Theater, which 
opened at 615 S. Broadway in 1931 with the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's "City 
Lights." Celebrities attending the gala included Chaplin, Albert Einstein and 
prominent architect S. Charles Lee, who designed the Los Angeles and a number 
of other movies houses across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-million rococo-style theater featured an ornate facade of Corinthian 
columns, a luxurious lobby modeled after the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and 
a ballroom where patrons waiting for the next show could dance or dine in an 
adjacent restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area was very different back then," said theater impresario Bruce Corwin, 
whose family has owned a number of Broadway movie houses for three generations. 
"It was just a wonderful place. It was the spot to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin owns the Los Angeles and three other Broadway theaters, which now show 
English- and Spanish-language films. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1950s, competition from theaters in Hollywood and suburban department 
stores had begun to take a toll on the boulevard. The area suffered a slow but 
steady decline that continues to this day, longtime business owners say. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, the scene at Nelson's clothing store at 341 S. Broadway 
reflected the current business climate: The only people in the shop were the 
owner and two employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dead," said Joyce Weintraub, who, along with her husband, has owned 
Nelson's and another Broadway clothing outlet for 40 years. The family plans to 
close Nelson's at the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s and early '60s, Weintraub recalled, the Broadway at 4th Street 
and Bullocks three blocks away were the magnets that attracted droves of 
customers with money to spend. But Broadway shut down in 1973; Bullocks and the 
May Co. followed about 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The street's clientele has also changed, from middle-class whites to 
lower-income, predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino immigrants. "We lost the 
white people," said Weintraub, who adds that the Latinos are loyal customers 
but lack the disposable income of their white counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they lack spending power, Latinos have energized the boulevard, turning 
it into a traditional Latin American paseo , where people flock to see and be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daily, the rhythmic sounds of salsa and cumbia blare from discotecas , or 
record shops. Store displays, with everything from cowboy boots to exotic 
chiles, spill onto crowded sidewalks. And shop owners, such as Young-Sun Kwon 
-- a Korean immigrant who speaks impeccable Spanish -- shout " Buen precios! 
Entre! Entre! " ("Good prices! Come in!") to anyone who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the festive atmosphere, the signs of urban decay abound: Sidewalks 
are littered, panhandlers work the crowd and drunks often urinate in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmond Khanian, whose family owns Empire Wholesale electronics, complains that 
the homeless, drug addicts and winos have scared away his customers. "I've seen 
people shoot drugs right in front of the store," he said, adding that he 
doesn't blame people for staying away. "Honestly, if I wanted to go shopping, I 
wouldn't come here." 
</P>
<P>
 The derelicts have helped fuel a perception that Broadway is unsafe -- a 
perception that police say is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not that bad," said Sgt. Mark Weissmann, whose Metropolitan 
Transit Authority officers conduct daily foot patrols from a substation in the 
Million Dollar Building. He could not recall a single arrest for a violent 
crime in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, such assurances are of little consolation to would-be customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women in my office don't like to come down" to Broadway, said Chris 
Gorstad, a deputy state attorney general who works at the Ronald Reagan State 
Office Building on Spring Street. He said the women fear crime, but added that 
their concerns are "based more on impressions than experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorstad, sipping a latte at the Grand Central Market, said he has never had a 
problem in nearly three years of frequenting the area. Like other patrons who 
were interviewed, he said cleaner streets, better marketing, more parking and a 
few upscale establishments would polish Broadway's tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to come here more . . . but there's not many bathrooms, which 
makes it difficult for your children," Ernesto Ponce said as he watched his 5- 
and 7-year-old boys battle each other in a martial-arts video game at an arcade 
near 7th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey resident also complained that whenever he visits Broadway, he must 
pay $5 to park. However, most shoppers rely on public transportation or 
hitching rides with friends and relatives. According to the 1988 redevelopment 
agency report, 61% of Broadway's shoppers do not own a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, developers and the local business association are taking such 
figures and complaints to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 2, the City Council approved the city's first assessment district that 
requires tenants to pay a percentage of their gross business receipts. The 
fees, which will range from $200 to $7,000, are expected to raise $500,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment district resulted from several years of work by Miracle on 
Broadway, a business association that will submit an assessment-fee spending 
program to the City Council for approval. Likely uses will include street 
cleaning and marketing, said Estela Lopez, the association's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 To augment the assessment funds, redevelopment agency officials have applied 
for a $2.1-million federal grant to pay for Broadway sidewalk improvements. A 
decision on the grant is expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the $500,000 is small compared to the need, Lopez said just the fact 
that a district has been formed will send a strong message that businesses are 
taking steps to improve the area. Similar efforts have succeeded elsewhere, as 
private groups have taken back blighted downtown areas across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reclaiming of the public environment that we have let fall into 
disarray," said Paul R. Levy, executive director of the Center City District in 
Philadelphia, where business owners pay for security patrols and street 
cleaners who wear bright uniforms. A recent survey there found that an 
overwhelming majority of shoppers feel safer, Levy said, and retail sales have 
jumped as much as 25% since the program began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Yellin is hoping that his multimillion-dollar project will be the 
tonic that cures the ills between 3rd and 4th streets. Plans for the Grand 
Central Market include creating a 1930s look on the inside, restoring the 
original facade to its turn-of-the-century elegance and adding a restaurant on 
the Hill Street side to attract Bunker Hill workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 121 apartments at the Million Dollar building will be one- and two-bedroom 
units with mahogany fireplaces, varying in price from affordable to market 
rate. A gym will be included in the development, which Yellin hopes will 
attract tenants ranging from the elderly to artists and young professionals 
seeking a diverse urban experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The two projects are expected to be completed in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fantastic," Yellin said. "This area could become like 
Greenwich Village." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others are hoping for relief from the state government, which plans to 
transfer about 3,500 office workers Downtown over the next several years. State 
officials are considering renovating the old building that housed the Broadway 
at 4th Street to house some of the workers, said Donald R. Spivack, who is 
heading the redevelopment agency team overseeing renovation in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But real estate agents point out that the state workers will occupy only 
750,000 square feet of office space throughout Downtown -- a paltry amount 
considering the huge vacancy rates on Broadway. According to CRA statistics, 
Broadway alone has about 2 million square feet of vacant or underutilized 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents also add that since rental rates are equally priced 
throughout much of Downtown, most private companies are likely to continue 
opting for cleaner, upscale sites on and around Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where would you rather be?" asked Brian Edwards, a leasing agent for Cushman 
& Wakefield, which is having difficulty renting a refurbished commercial 
property in the 600 block of South Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most ambitious proposal is to establish an entertainment district. 
Similar efforts have been unsuccessful. But Spivack said any new attempt will 
rely on solid marketing and be linked to larger Downtown development and 
transportation projects outlined in the Strategic Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 redevelopment agency study, expected to be completed in March, 
will recommend that several Broadway theaters be used for concert, theatrical 
and motion picture uses aimed at the lucrative Latino entertainment market, the 
authors say. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Latino music industry grossed $130 million in Los Angeles County, 
and more than 2.5 million people filled sold-out entertainment venues, said 
consultant Charles Loveman of Kostmon & Associates, who is helping to prepare 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a market that is really emerging," Loveman said. "What we're saying 
is that the theater spaces are already there. Let's make an investment that 
solves the blight problem, restores Broadway to the street it once was and 
makes Los Angeles the Hispanic entertainment capital." 
</P>
<P>
 The total costs and financing sources have not been determined for the 
entertainment district. But a draft report puts the price for refurbishing five 
Broadway theaters as high as $31 million. That would include building a 
multiscreen complex in one of the theaters, fixing worn-out interiors and 
upgrading sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater owner Corwin, who as a child experienced Broadway's heyday, is 
optimistic that the faded strip can once again shine brightly. "We're hanging 
on by our fingernails," he said. "But we're hopeful things can change."

CITY ARTS: ABCS OF REEDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Musicians can learn about jazz from reedsman Buddy Collette and join him in a 
jam session Saturday at the California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event is the first in a series of "Jazz Mentorship" programs 
sponsored by the city Cultural Affairs Department.Jazz Mentorship events will 
be held periodically through June and are designed to give musicians, 
particularly young people, an opportunity to learn from and work with 
professional jazz artists. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-hour sessions, the professional musicians will perform as well 
as teach various aspects of music, such as rhythm.  
</P>
<P>
 Collette, a saxophonist and one of the top flutists in jazz, has been an 
influential figure in West Coast jazz since the early 1940s. He began his 
career playing with fellow Los Angeles musicians Charles Mingus and Red 
Callender. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained prominence in the orchestras of Louis Jordan, Benny Carter and 
Gerald Wilson, and performed on television and radio during the 1950s. He 
became the first African American musician to play in a television studio 
orchestra when he performed on the Groucho Marx show "You Bet Your Life." He 
still leads his own band, teaches, composes and performs for films and 
television.

JOBS PROGRAM SERVES RIOT-TORN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years after the Los Angeles riots, a federally funded program 
administered by the Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment is breathing life 
into a community still suffering from the effects of joblessness and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Projects for Restoration program in Los Angeles, with $19 
million in federal funds, is targeting social welfare and law enforcement needs 
in Pico-Union, Koreatown, Westlake and South-Central through a variety of local 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, PACE received $250,000 to administer a CPR job-training program 
for low-income and chronically unemployed residents in areas hard hit by the 
rioting. PACE recruited 34 participants for the program, which includes 
classroom sessions, public service work and on-the-job training, primarily in 
clerical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to putting people back to work," said Alberto Costa, a PACE 
employment specialist. "What we have on our side is training that helps people 
to find jobs and retain them." 
</P>
<P>
 Using an outline based on a college-level course, Costa begins by teaching 
participants how to assess their skills and conduct a job search, how to deal 
with co-workers or employers with different cultural backgrounds and what their 
workplace rights and responsibilities are. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa also encourages the program participants, many of whom have lived in 
this country for only a short time, to begin thinking about continuing their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people haven't been told that there's such a thing as college," he 
said. "I try to simulate a college environment here. And I tell them that if 
they can make it here, there's no reason why they can't make it in college. 
There's all kinds of financial aid if you know where to look for it. We want to 
show them that there's more out there for them than minimum-wage jobs if they 
get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also involves 400 hours of employment with a nonprofit 
organization. Javier Villa, 21, of Westlake just completed his work with the 
Central American Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really liked it," Villa said. "I learned how to work with computers, 
especially WordPerfect, and I can make phone calls now without being nervous or 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, armed with a beefed-up resume, Villa is ready for interviews with other 
employers who will provide additional training, subsidized through the CPR 
program. About 60% of the participants have commitments from employers for at 
least 240 hours of on-the-job training, Costa said.

VOICES: 'I'M HERE TO CARRY A MESSAGE'; A FORMER BUSINESSWOMAN RECALLS THE 
LOSSES, GAINS AND ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS SHE HAS EXPERIENCED AFTER LEARNING 
SHE IS HIV-POSITIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dora Gallagher, 33, will be a volunteer group leader at Women for Positive 
Living, a free seminar Feb. 19-20 for women infected with HIV. Her involvement 
with the Los Angeles Shanti Foundation, sponsor of the event at T.H.E. Clinic 
for Women in the Crenshaw area, began in 1992 when she attended a Shanti-run 
HIV seminar. She was interviewed by Mike Wyma.  
</P>
<P>
 I was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1987, but I say it's been 12 years because 
it was back then that I was using IV drugs and was having sex with what I would 
call bisexual men, but that I guess were really gay. One has died of AIDS, so I 
could have been infected there, and the people I was using with, sharing 
needles with, I don't know of anyone who has AIDS. But one supposedly has 
hepatitis and has all the symptoms of being HIV-positive, so maybe they're just 
not telling the truth, because I didn't tell the truth for a long time either. 
</P>
<P>
 I took the test because I wasn't feeling well. A friend of mine said he should 
go with me to get the results and I said OK. He was a client of mine in the 
hair business. Long story short, he spread a rumor that I had AIDS, which was 
not true and still isn't. I don't have AIDS all these years later. But my 
business dropped from about $60,000 a year to about $8,000 a year over the 
following five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a year ago I realized I was in a deep depression. I realized I had had 
small seizures all that time. I went to a doctor and they tested me and said 
that probably was happening because I was in a deep depression. I had decided 
to give up my hair and nail business and I'd started working in someone else's 
shop, and this last February the owner was uncomfortable with the fact that I 
(had tested) positive. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to stress that people have to give up being scared of someone who's 
positive. I went into a nervous breakdown and it pretty much destroyed me for 
several months. I went onto disability and I'm pretty much in financial limbo 
now, getting ready to move to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not able to handle anything with three components. If I'm washing dishes 
and the stove is next to me and I have water boiling for something, I'm pretty 
much OK. But if the phone rings I just freak out. So it's not really good for 
me to be in a work environment, because there's stress almost all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After being diagnosed, at first I was married, but we didn't have much of a 
sex life. He had a lot of problems and I finally got out of the relationship 
because I couldn't deal with it anymore. He really didn't care to use a condom 
but we had to, so he did when he had to, but that wasn't enough for me. I was 
young, I was in my mid-20s, and frankly I came into my prime at about 28, and 
you know, I gotta have it hormone-wise, and I decided to get out of the 
relationship. I had an affair and I told that person in the heat of passion, 
and he said, "That's what condoms are for," and I never saw him again after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 I met someone else and was afraid I wouldn't be able to have what I was 
looking for. I wanted to be loved, and so I didn't tell him. I tried to tell 
him many times but didn't deal with it. What happened is I felt suicidal every 
morning in the shower. We were practicing unprotected sex. We had a 
relationship for two years. He's tested negative twice and it's been about 19 
months since we broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I went to the Shanti seminar I met the man I'm in the relationship with 
now. We started out as friends and fell in love. He has progressed to AIDS. Our 
sex life has been very healthy for the most part. We're both in lots of 
different kinds of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been diagnosed as having deep depression, HIV-related. I had held all 
this in for so long and hid it. I was a prominent businesswoman in Venice Beach 
and couldn't tell anyone about it. It really messes up a person. I really 
understand what it is to be gay and not be able to tell someone, or whatever 
secret you have. And I really know what the rewards of coming out are. Who 
knows where I'd be now if I was still having to hold all this in? It would be 
even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 I look at it that I don't know what's going to happen. I ride a Harley because 
I'm not going to die of this disease; I'm going to go down on my bike. There's 
so many mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanti has changed my life. The seminar Women for Positive Living, it changes 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I'm sober I'm able to enjoy the fullest life I can while being 
positive. I don't think Shanti would have me as a facilitator at their seminar 
if I wasn't sober. I have spirituality, which to me is being awake. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been close to God. I've always had God in my life. I used to have 
Him in my pocket and when I wanted I'd pull Him out. Now I have a conscious 
contact on a daily basis, and I'm in tune. I know that I'm alive because I'm 
here to carry a message. I really believe that. And I believe that it's a 
message from God that you can live with this. You don't have to look skinny and 
decrepit. You can have a life.

CALTRANS RESPONDS TO PUPILS' PROTESTS OVER CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the article concerning Caltrans construction near the 61st Street 
School ("The Power of the Pen (or Pencil)," Dec. 26): 
</P>
<P>
 Because we realized early on that dust and noise could pose a problem for the 
school, Caltrans implemented the following measures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Built sound walls, 
</P>
<P>
 * Monitored air quality and performed soil testing, 
</P>
<P>
 * Offered to move the cafeteria away from construction, 
</P>
<P>
 * Built an alternative access for supply trucks, 
</P>
<P>
 * Offered to stop heavy equipment operation between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
(lunchtime), 
</P>
<P>
 * Made it possible for the contractor to work weekends, 
</P>
<P>
 * Delayed the paving operation until school was closed for the holidays, 
</P>
<P>
 * Ran water trucks frequently to prevent dust from traveling, 
</P>
<P>
 * Stayed in constant contact with Principal Don Marzullo, who was very 
supportive of our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Caltrans held meetings with parents and other concerned groups to 
keep them apprised of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' policy is to be a good neighbor and work with the affected community 
whenever we construct a project. 
</P>
<P>
 Major freeway construction in an urban area is always difficult because no 
matter how we schedule work, we impact either residents and/or motorists. The 
work on this project involves widening the Harbor Freeway and constructing a 
transit way from the Artesia Freeway to the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 This project is important to the community because it will help to provide 
better access to jobs and other services outside the area while helping to 
improve air quality via the transit way, which is for the exclusive use of 
buses and other car-pool vehicles.

NEW PRINCIPAL AT SOUTH GATE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Times published an article on the selection of the principal at South 
Gate Middle School ("Dispute Erupts Over Choice of Principal," Jan. 23). It is 
important for me to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The reporter called me Jan. 13 with the premise that she was doing an 
article to profile the new principal, Tony Sandoval. Obviously the article was 
not a profile of the new principal and in fact contained little or no 
information on the qualities and/or experiences of Mr. Tony Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The article refers to the school district being forced to assign Mr. 
Sandoval within a 48-hour period. This is not the case. I recommended Mr. Tony 
Sandoval for the principalship of South Gate Middle School and also recommended 
he be assigned as of Jan. 3, with the beginning of the new semester. Neither I 
nor the district was forced. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The article states that I said Mr. Henry Torres could not be considered for 
the principalship because of district policy. I did not state this. There is no 
such district policy. I did say that it was my judgment not to recommend any 
assistant principals, at any of the three schools with principal openings, to 
be acting principal. I further stated that my non-recommendation of the present 
assistant principals was not due to a lack of confidence in the abilities of 
those assistant principals. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The article states, "Liechty agreed Sandoval's appointment was a 'bad 
judgment call.' " I did not say this! I am the individual who recommended Mr. 
Sandoval and I am confident Mr. Sandoval will provide outstanding leadership 
that will serve the South Gate students, staff, parents and community well. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears to me that the focus of this article never intended to profile an 
outstanding individual, but in fact was written to support those individuals 
who wanted another individual assigned to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 I fully respect those who have different opinions, but I believe the Los 
Angeles Times has an obligation to be fair and honest.

A BALLPARK FIGURE; PITCHER ALONSO LOPEZ IS KING OF THE MOUND AT SOUTH GATE HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alonso Lopez's fastball doesn't leave a vapor trail like Roger Clemens' of the 
Boston Red Sox. His slider doesn't make a catcher's mitt smoke like recently 
retired Nolan Ryan's of the Texas Rangers. And he doesn't play with a rock band 
in his spare time like Jack McDowell of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 18-year-old South Gate High School senior has something in common with 
these Major League pitchers: winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Lopez enjoyed the best season of any pitcher in Rams' history. He 
was a perfect 11-0 on the season, with a 1.58 earned-run average. He collected 
one of his two saves in South Gate's 9-5 City 3-A Championship win over 
Crenshaw. Lopez, who didn't give up a home run all year, struck out 63 batters 
in 79 innings while walking only 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alonso's key thing is control," said Coach Mike Ryan. "Lots of kids in high 
school can't throw the curveball across the plate, but Alonso can." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to throwing an accurate breaking ball, Lopez can bring the heat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Alonso's fastball is not overpowering, but it has lots of movement, which 
makes it difficult to hit," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mound, Lopez is the picture of composure, never changing his stoic 
expression from the first out to the last. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is so focused that he doesn't even like to bat," assistant coach Scott 
Pearson said of Alonso, who did go three-for-four on the year with two runs 
batted in. "I can't remember a team having a big inning against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's City 3-A championship would showcase Lopez against Crenshaw's 
Mark Jones, the area's pitching ace. Jones was selected City Times Pitcher of 
the Year and City 3-A MVP. During the regular season, Jones was 16-0 with a 
remarkable 1.00 ERA and posted back-to-back no-hitters against San Pedro and 
Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones did not make it past the fourth inning, giving up six hits and six 
earned runs while walking eight batters. Ironically, after Jones' exit, Lopez 
came on in the fifth inning to get the save for South Gate, establishing 
himself as the new king of the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted Alonso to go in and bring home the win, and that is exactly what he 
did," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those at the 3-A championship game were Lopez's brother, Jorge Luis, 38, 
and sister, Martha, 23, who live with him in South Gate. "I knew he had a good 
record," said Martha Lopez, "but I didn't realize he was as good as he is. 
After I watched him pitch, I was amazed." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's parents and 10 other brothers and sisters live in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to America to get an education, and my primary goal is to finish 
school," Lopez said. "Maybe one day I can own a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez tried to enroll at South Gate in 1990, but because the school was 
overcrowded, he attended Reseda High in the San Fernando Valley. There he 
pitched on the varsity team as a 15-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez entered South Gate the following year and pitched on the Rams' junior 
varsity team. "The varsity staff was already set, and (the coaches) wanted to 
bring him along slowly," Ryan said. "He was 5-1 in the Central League that 
year, and by the end of the season, I knew he would be my No. 1 pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez doesn't mind bearing that responsibility again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I like about pitching is that I am more responsible for our team 
winning and losing than any other player," Lopez said. "I have a lot of 
confidence that I am going to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is not only confident but competent, possessing great mechanics on the 
mound and being in superb physical condition. A member of the school's Marathon 
Club, he runs six miles a day as well as up and down the bleachers in the 
football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alonso is probably the best athlete on the team," Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the running he does, Alonso has grown a lot in his legs, which 
will give him even greater stamina," Pearson said. "A lot of pitchers get tired 
from standing as the innings go on, but Alonso pitched seven complete games 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez needs to gain velocity on his fastball to compete professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said this too will come in time: "Alonso is still growing. He has 
gotten two inches taller and gained 12 pounds since last season. As his legs 
grow, he will pick up speed on his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez will anchor perhaps the area's best pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Rick Alcantar, who was 6-1 last season with a 2.77 ERA, and junior 
David Correa, who was 6-1 with a 1.95 ERA, top South Gate's five-man pitching 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a big chance to win the championship again because we have most of 
our key players back," Lopez said. "I will be even better as a pitcher because 
I have more experience and know more about the batters."

GAME OF THE WEEK; ROUT OF BELL MAKES FREMONT HUNGRY FOR CITY TITLE 
</P>

 The consensus is that Crenshaw High School has the most dominating team in the 
City Section. Still, teams are lining up to take a shot at the Cougars, who 
should repeat as 4-A champs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont wants a title bout with the 'Shaw. The Pathfinders put themselves in 
position for a top seed after pounding Bell, 77-55, Wednesday in a game that 
matched the two best Southeastern Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crenshaw may have a better team, but I know that on any given night you can 
get beat," Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said. "I would like to get them on a big 
court. . . . We're bigger and faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont (16-5 overall; 9-0 in conference) expects to be a seeded team behind 
Crenshaw (18-2, 8-0) and Westchester (21-3, 8-0). Carson, Fairfax, Manual Arts 
and North Hollywood are the other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pathfinders have additional incentive to play the Cougars in the 
finals. First, there was the controversial transfer of Tommie Davis to Crenshaw 
from Fremont. Then there is 6-foot-2 guard Dion Champion, who left Crenshaw to 
play at Fremont. Champion felt rebuffed by Coach Willie West after playing two 
years on the Cougars junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Champion has developed into a dependable scorer and rebounder for the 
Pathfinders. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those transfers came in and I lost my spot on the varsity," Champion 
said. "I feel I've accomplished something playing varsity this season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders also have been aided by the return of 6-8 forward Louis 
Radford, who moved back from Denver in January. Radford, who scored 19 points 
against Bell, shoots well enough outside to switch positions with 6-2 Calvin 
Patterson, who scored a game-high 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Donnie Wilcher, forward Jamaal Johnson and Leon Jones are talented 
underclassmen. 
</P>

SOUTH GATE, HAMILTON RUNNERS IN OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Humberto Sanchez of South Gate High and Genevieve DeBose of Hamilton High 
participated in the Olympic Torch Relay Feb. 5, part of a 5,000-mile relay that 
ended Saturday at the Winter Olympic opening ceremonies in Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, 18, and DeBose, 16, both seniors, were two of five U.S. runners 
chosen by the International Torch Bearers program, which included participants 
from outside the host country for the first time at the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than his 500-meter leg on the 7,000-person relay, his first 
exposure to subfreezing weather or his first airplane flight, Sanchez said the 
friendships he developed were the most memorable part of his four-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a whole new experience," Sanchez said. "It was a great honor to meet 
the other runners, and we stuck together like one big family. That's the one 
thing I do remember." 
</P>
<P>
 DeBose, who lives in South-Central, was impressed by the cultural diversity 
she encountered: "The Norwegians spoke a lot of English and some spoke a little 
Spanish but I was able to communicate with runners from Japan who did not speak 
English. I learned you don't have to speak the same language to become 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 DeBose and Sanchez were selected to participate in the Olympic Torch Relay 
after their performances in the City Section cross-country finals last 
November. DeBose became her school's first runner to win the title. 
Participating in his first season of cross-country, Sanchez finished second in 
the boys' race and went on to place 11th in the State Division I finals -- the 
highest finish ever by a South Gate runner.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; PICKING UP THE PIECES; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
STRUGGLES TO REOPEN AND REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Located little more than a mile from the epicenter of the deadly Jan. 17 
temblor, the nearly 38-year-old campus of Cal State Northridge suffered 
significant damage in the 6.8-magnitude earthquake and subsequent aftershocks. 
Among the structures most severely affected were an $11.3-million student 
parking structure that collapsed and the university's Oviatt Library and Fine 
Arts building, both of which suffered serious structural damage. The final 
damage estimate has yet to be determined, but CSUN administrators have placed 
the figure between $250 million and $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will begin returning to campus Monday for the start of the spring 
semester -- two weeks later than originally scheduled. Work to reopen the 
university has proceeded at a breakneck pace since the quake, but because of 
the damage to major buildings, classes will be held at numerous off-campus 
sites and in about 350 portable classrooms clustered across campus. "We're 
laying out an entire new city," said CSUN spokesman Bruce Erickson. Finding 
Your Way 
</P>
<P>
 Though classes will resume Monday, students and staff should expect 
significant changes in campus operations, including the loss of several major 
buildings and some 5,500 parking spaces. Administrators have said, however, 
that no classes have been canceled and that many student services will be 
available in their usual locations. Below is a guide to the post-quake campus: 
</P>
<P>
 Modular classrooms: Many classes and university services will be available in 
approximately 350 "modulars" arranged in 10 formations across campus. Modular 
room numbers will be indicated on the revised class schedule using the 
following notations: A. Zelzah Court, ZC-1500 B. Halsted Houses, HH-1100 C. 
Student Services, SS-1200 D. Lindley Avenue, LA-1300, 1400 E. Admin Park, 
ADM-700 F. Engineering Field, EF-600 G. Prairie Street, PS-400 H. Science 5, 
SC-500 I. Art Annex, AA-100 J. Music Lawn, ML-200 
</P>
<P>
 Information stations: Revised class schedules, maps and other campus 
information will be available at each of these 22 locations scattered across 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking: Students are encouraged to park in lots A, B, O and P. Faculty and 
staff are encouraged to park in lots B, E, G and J. Permits will not be 
required until Feb. 28 and daily parking updates will be available at each of 
the campus information stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio updates: Campus radio station KCSN 88.5 FM will provide daily updates at 
12:30 and 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

ON PRO TOUR, SURF'S UP INLAND! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says you have to be in Southern California to enjoy the region's 
much-envied lifestyle? 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, the world's top professional beach volleyball players 
have been digging, setting and spiking in sand-filled parking lots in inland 
cities from Phoenix to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the world's top surfers are getting ready to move their sport inland, 
too. They'll be riding eight-foot waves generated by wave-making machines at 
water parks in Japan, South Africa and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for an initial round of inland surf contests at Walt Disney 
World in Florida, Palm Springs, Tokyo and Sun City, in the Bophuthatswana 
region of South Africa. The inland tour eventually will be expanded to other 
water parks in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian-based Assn. of Surfing Professionals has identified 38 inland 
"beach venues" where it will stage "rock 'n' roll" surfing events that feature 
live music and light shows along with top surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can erect huge stages for the world's top rock bands," said Bob Pritchard, 
a Santa Monica marketing consultant who is helping to arrange the inland 
events. "With this combination of music, light shows and surfers, we can create 
a combination music-lifestyle event." GREG JOHNSON

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO PUSH US BEYOND 
BUSINESS AS USUAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing amid broken freeways and collapsed homes, the people of Los Angeles 
have mourned yesterday's passing. Visions of tomorrow have come harder, 
especially belief that the city in future could be grander, more powerful and 
more downright livable than it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that may well be the case. This crossroads of Asia and the Americas could 
become one of the great cities in history. But nothing is guaranteed. Only if 
the region is capable of putting aside old assumptions and making strenuous 
efforts to think and act anew, will it fulfill its destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge goes beyond patching up the masonry and making firm resolutions 
about our love affair with the car. What's needed is a new habit of thinking 
that always strives for the innovative, the new 
</P>
<P>
 In this special section, The Times presents some fresh ideas on critical 
issues facing our community -- from transportation to education, to government. 
The aim is to begin a great conversation about the realities of today's Los 
Angeles, and the possibilities of the next Los Angeles.

<P>
 The earthquake was the end of the beginning. For some years now, through 
recession, riot and fire, Los Angeles has been like a hypochondriac, taking its 
pulse every five minutes, asking itself what's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it expire from a declining economy as defense spending dried up, or from 
an influx of diverse new populations, or perhaps from clogged arteries as words 
like "freeway" and "mobility" became merely ironic? 
</P>
<P>
 Even the movies were gloomy. In "Grand Canyon," middle-class folk abandoned 
the city; in "Falling Down," Michael Douglas suggested even engineers could go 
berserk. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the earthquake, and it was a release of tension in more than 
geological terms. The city took a terrible hit, with loss of lives and 
property, but immediately its people knew Los Angeles would go on. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a shock of recognition. This is a big place, not limited by abstract 
political boundaries. If you live in the San Fernando Valley or Fountain 
Valley, you are connected to the whole; when friends and relatives call from 
across the country or around the world, they know you live in Los Angeles and 
worry about how you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken but OK, you tell them, and the same goes for the city and the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has been through a life threatening illness -- even hypochondriacs 
can be sick -- and like any survivor, it is re-examining its values and 
behavior, thinking anew and determined to change. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is much confusion. For every problem, from transportation to the 
economy, there are many answers -- from trains to telecommuting, local councils 
to regional authorities, agriculture on vacant lots to multimedia start-ups in 
converted garages. 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning is healthy, but priorities are wanted. We need to have a 
vision of where we are, what will be required, where the evidence says we are 
going and how we will come out. As the saying goes, there are no good answers, 
only good questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, Los Angeles is a world city that could become grander and more 
powerful in the next decade than it has ever been. 
</P>
<P>
 A historian would see similarities to Venice in 1300, as it was about to 
become the great trading city of the Renaissance world, or New York in 1929, 
about to become -- despite the Great Crash -- financial capital of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 World cities are clamorous, incredibly diverse and energetic. That's why 
people come to them. "If you are curious to see men from every part of the 
earth, go to St. Mark's Square or the Rialto," the French historian Fernand 
Braudel wrote of Venice in "Perspective of the World." 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance Venice, at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and Asia, 
made itself the warehouse of the world. Today international bankers and traders 
talk in similar terms of Los Angeles, at the crossroads of Latin America and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing is guaranteed. For the Los Angeles region to fulfill its destiny, 
we will have to pay new costs and rethink old assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftermath of the earthquake will bring more than $7 billion in federal 
funds into this community. In truth, it will be only Southern California's tax 
money coming back to it, but it's a good bet that local taxes will rise to help 
pay for rebuilding roads and houses and providing jobs. Tax changes could even 
extend to the hallowed Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of behavior modification -- and public revenue -- there may be 
charges for traveling alone in a car at rush hour. No free parking may become 
as axiomatic as no free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 For industry and jobs, new thinking is imperative. Before the quake, Southern 
California worried about losing companies to the blandishments of other states, 
which wanted not only to create jobs but somehow to spirit away the technical 
and scientific brilliance that made this a region of advanced industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake hasn't stilled those worries, but it has spurred fresh 
thinking. The future will see more cooperation between government and private 
business in Southern California as the region prepares for new industries and 
tries to bolster its position in international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the Manufacturing Technology Initiative, a federally funded 
project led by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Panorama City, who has persuaded Detroit 
Central Tool, a company skilled in computer techniques, to teach Southern 
California companies about new manufacturing in return for a chance to work 
with fuel cell technology developed by Caltech and the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperation throughout the region, from UC Irvine north to the San Fernando 
Valley, is also needed as Southern California bids for the Advanced 
Transportation Research Center, a federally funded effort that would give work 
and know-how to underemployed aerospace subcontractors -- and out-of-work 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alameda Corridor, an improved rail and truck route to speed cargo through 
Los Angeles, is taking shape with cooperation of the Ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach and federal, state and local governments. But more will be needed: 
Two-thirds of the corridor's $1.8-billion cost remains to be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an enormously fruitful, job-creating investment. Light industry 
would spring up all along the corridor from the Civic Center to the ports, 
predicts Joel Kotkin, a longtime analyst, author and teacher of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all is not cooperation. The region's entrepreneurs are as active as 
ever, pushing into the new multimedia fields which range from video games to 
digital software for entertainment, medicine and education. But they may not be 
getting a helping hand from big business in Los Angeles.

 "Multimedia companies tell me that dealing with the movie studios is very 
difficult," says Tom Turney of NewCap Partners, an investment bank that backs 
small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there is ferment with clusters of interactive video and video game 
entrepreneurs in Woodland Hills and Canoga Park, with the growth of innovative 
financing and with new thinking undoubtedly percolating in frequent meetings 
between Michael Ovitz and Bill Gates of Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, to most of Los Angeles, multimedia can be a yawn. What do 
Hollywood deals, or, for that matter Caltech and computer-aided manufacturing, 
do for a city in which tens of thousands live in poverty -- people for whom the 
information revolution promises only another low-paying job? 
</P>
<P>
 They do a lot. Economic development anywhere in the region can offer 
opportunity to all, especially if they have education to handle the work and 
transportation to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the thinking that informs the economic policies of Mayor Richard 
Riordan's Administration at City Hall. True economic development comes from 
creating jobs wherever possible, improving education and transportation so the 
poor can take the jobs and then providing social work to deal with the many 
other problems of poverty, from malnutrition to despair. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a policy that reflects new thinking in other cities, notably 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Jersey City and Houston, which are trying to get away 
from the often self-defeating system of interest-group politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it's a policy that fits the coming times, in the vision of futurist 
Alvin Toffler, who makes his home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Toffler sees communication being substituted for transportation wherever 
feasible, moving work close to people, relieving the burden on freeways and air 
quality at the same time. "A set of intermediate institutions will spring up, 
companies that facilitate home work and contract services," Toffler says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such developments will put even more pressure on the education system -- a 
California institution critically in need of new thinking -- to prepare 
youngsters for independent, self-starting work. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than the education system, or earthquakes and recession, there is 
another big issue looming over Los Angeles, and that is crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is so acute that James Q. Wilson, criminologist, philosopher and 
UCLA professor, is frightened by it. As recently as 1980, Los Angeles' crime 
rate dropped, Wilson notes, but it turned up again in 1985. It has many causes, 
drugs among them, he says. And a revived economy would alleviate the problem by 
giving young men jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But crime, and many other problems of Los Angeles and other cities, demand new 
thinking about citizens' obligations to live in harmony with their fellows. 
Wilson's new book, "The Moral Sense," attempts to define and reawaken very old 
and yet very new ideas: self-control, fairness, duty, morality. As much as on 
repairing freeways, Los Angeles will have to work on rediscovering those 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 New thinking is needed to get over the nostalgic illusion of Los Angeles as an 
idyllic seaside resort or a leafy small town; the city's novelists, James M. 
Cain, Raymond Chandler, and John Gregory Dunne, never saw it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a village in Michoacan or Fujian or Kansas, it is Los Angeles. And 
perhaps it needs new bravado, too. In 1969 there was a billboard towering over 
Olympic Boulevard, advertising a radio station that said: "Smile Los Angeles, 
you're the center of the universe." There was no truth to the sentiment then. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, there is some truth to the sentiment today, but no one would think 
of putting up such a billboard. Maybe someone should.

IDEAL CITY (DON'T PANIC -- IT'S ONLY A GAME) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How to play the game 
</P>
<P>
 You're the mayor. Your goal is to make your residents happy. Figure out how to 
maintain their quality of life without taxing them so much that they move away. 
Try to attract business but strike the right balance between light and heavy 
industry. Divide up spending on police, firefighters, health and welfare, 
public transit and education. Work out a damage control plan for earthquakes, 
riots and fires. Don't be intimidated. Eighth graders seem to handle this just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Start by creating residential, commercial and industrial zones. Install power 
lines and surface roads. Soon the "Sims" will start moving in. And don't worry: 
If they're unhappy, they'll let you know. What if? 
</P>
<P>
 No freeways and few surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 How it works: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't touch that road icon -- the little picture that looks like a highway on 
the left side of your screen. Instead, hoist the rail icon and start laying 
rail lines and don't stop till everything of consequence is connected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benefits: 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic jams vanish as people take the trains. Air pollution noticeably 
declines. The old, selfish one-driver, one-car standard vanishes. Residents 
read the newspaper more on their way to and fro, so they are better informed -- 
although it's hard to tell because the Simses don't talk much among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Check out that budget window. To pay for all that mass transit, taxes have 
been raised across the board to an astronomical 20%. Other city services like 
education, police and fire stations have been slashed by 75%. Voters form 
picket lines right there on the computer screen. The mayor's popularity rating 
plunges into negative numbers. Simses are moving out. What if? 
</P>
<P>
 An environmentally correct city 
</P>
<P>
 How it works 
</P>
<P>
 Build a power grid based solely on windmills and solar power. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Air pollution almost nonexistent. People can breathe easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Low industrial development. Wind and solar power cannot generate enough power 
(or jobs) to support a sizable metropolis and a large educated work force. What 
if? 
</P>
<P>
 A crime-free city 
</P>
<P>
 How it works 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Sim rules, the more police stations you build, the less crime there 
is. To achieve a zero crime rate, put a police station on every block. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 No crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for all that police power, you have to slash just about everything 
else. Most seriously cut is education. An uneducated population leads to 
soaring unemployment due to an untrained work force. In the long run, this 
erodes the tax base, creating a budget deficit. Sim City goes down the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those struggling to satisfy all of the Simses all of the time should know 
about the embezzle key. It balances even the reddest budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But watch out. Embezzle four times and your city gets an earthquake.

<P>
 Structural engineers at UC San Diego and the defense industry are exploring 
ways to build the world's first quake-resistant highway bridge, made entirely 
of lightweight composite materials like those used in bulletproof vests, boat 
hulls and the Stealth Bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a $10.5 million federal grant was awarded to the landmark bridge 
project, which will connect the east and west campuses of UC San Diego over 
Interstate 5 in La Jolla.Construction will begin in three years and take about 
a year. When completed, the project will cost about $55 million including, 
research, development and construction. Bridge Characteristics 
</P>
<P>
 Support: Bridge supported by series of cables connected to an A-frame pylon 
</P>
<P>
 Width: 60 feet 
</P>
<P>
 Span: 450 feet 
</P>
<P>
 Lanes: One 12-foot wide traffic lane in each direction, one bicycle lane in 
each direction 
</P>
<P>
 Walkway: 13-foot-wide pedestrian walkway 
</P>
<P>
 Pros and Cons 
</P>
<P>
 * A lighter bridge would be less sensitive to ground motion from earthquakes. 
A chunk of composite bridge deck big enough to fill a shopping cart can be held 
by two kindergarten-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's uncertain whether composites can withstand rain, heat or sun over long 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some composites are patented, which complicates Caltrans' attempts to set 
generic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Composites can cost up to $150 a pound, compared with 50 cents a pound for 
concrete. But supporters say composites require less labor and are quicker, 
easier and less costlier in the long run. CAROLINE LEMKE

 Though long the target of ridicule, Angelenos have been willing to sit in 
smog-choked traffic for the privilege of living in Southern California. Maybe 
it was the beach house with floor-to-ceiling picture windows. Or the cabin up 
in the mountains that made the commute bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a choice. A decision we all made living in a land where congestion 
is so renowned that a traffic reporter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we sit in traffic because the roads are broken. Some of us drive three 
hours to get to work because we must. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region where 79% drive alone to work, the far-fetched has become 
probable: Thousands of passengers flock to commuter rail trains, dozens hop 
buses, and scores try what they had once resoundingly scorned -- car pools. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, traveling less than 10 miles around battered Interstate 5 
takes motorists up to two hours during rush hour. Not surprisingly, ridership 
on the Santa Clarita commuter train line reached more than 20,000 -- a 
twentyfold increase over pre-quake days. 
</P>
<P>
 From Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena on down, transportation 
officials hailed the development as a signal that Angelenos would embrace mass 
transit and car pools. Get real. We won't snub freeways until mass transit is 
as convenient as driving. Or until driving is so awful that the freedom it 
affords us no longer means much. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time to reassess the transportation system, to shore up mass 
transit so people might actually stay aboard. To re-think roads so they carry 
more than the usual flow of single-passenger cars. To re-configure the 
workplace so people don't have to drive there. Can we design it all better? Can 
we stomach the change? 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt it would be painful. If trains and buses were fast and comfortable 
and ran with great frequency to places near where we needed to be, would we 
ride? Yes, particularly if it was no longer easy to drive. There is not one 
solution, but there may well be a combination of approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 We would have to pose powerful incentives for staying off congested roads 
during rush hours. Just as a telephone company charges higher rates for 
peak-hour calls, motorists could be charged a fee for driving during rush hour. 
Special devices on your dashboard could log the time of day that you drive, and 
whether you had chosen a congested thoroughfare. This way, a San Joaquin Valley 
farmer driving on a country road at 5 p.m. would not be penalized. But those of 
us who braved the Harbor Freeway would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Or we could make it inconvenient to drive by eliminating free parking. In one 
study, researchers found that providing free parking induces more travel than 
offering free gasoline. If shopping malls, libraries and schools charged for 
parking, for instance, would you drive there? If your employer offered you free 
parking or its equivalent amount in cash, which would you take? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we need to introduce another mode of transportation. A jitney, for 
instance, would offer the main perk of a car -- going door-to-door -- combined 
with the benefit of carrying several passengers. It could be cheaper than a 
taxi, more convenient than a train or bus. Sure, a jet pack would be better but 
that's decades away. 
</P>
<P>
 The other solution would be to reduce the numbers of us who have to wend our 
way to work. If we telecommuted from our homes or neighborhood workstations, we 
could diminish the crowds on our freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake showed us that freeways have become our Achilles 
heel. If we had more options in the Santa Clarita and the northern San Fernando 
valleys, motorists would not face the devastating commutes to and from the 
workplace that will be typical for months, drives around downed freeways that 
take nearly as many hours as the workday itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, normally punctual workers clock in hours late. Oranges, Brussels 
sprouts and tons of other cargo trucked on the major north/south artery -- 
Interstate 5 -- become mired in hopeless traffic jams.  
</P>
<P>
 When the quake snapped portions of six thoroughfares as though they were 
matchsticks, our one-hour commutes became morning-long ordeals, suburban 
nightmares. No longer can we simply turn on the ignition, flip on the radio, 
rev the engine and weave into crowds of commuters on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we are forced to map out elaborate strategies for the normal commute, 
calculating traffic flow on mountain roads versus city streets. The wrenching 
blow to the roadways immediately rippled through our lives: We set alarm clocks 
four hours earlier, page through want ads for extra baby-sitting help, snap at 
spouses and scold children. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we must ask: Can we do any better? This is no ordinary Sig Alert. NORA

RAIL NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Rail transportation includes everything from subways and trolleys to elevated 
monorails and bullet trains. Los Angeles County transit officials are in the 
early stages of building a rail system of more than 450 miles of tracks during 
the next 30 years. The web of lines would include hundreds of stations 
connecting with park-and-ride lots, bike paths, buses and taxis. Some stations 
are planned with child care facilities. The Metrolink commuter train has 
operated for more than a year, with lines running to Moorpark, Santa Clarita, 
Lancaster, Riverside and San Bernardino. The Blue Line trolley runs between 
Downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach. The Red Line subway runs between MacArthur 
Park and Union Station. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Rail lines remove motorists from congested freeways and surface streets. 
Short-Term or Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much benefit in the short term. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Local, state and federal transit officials endorse construction of rail lines 
because they provide an appealing transportation alternative for solo 
motorists. A recent survey found that about 30% of commuters in Southern 
California would consider using commuter rail instead of driving. Rail travel 
allows passengers to get to work without the stress of driving. Unlike bus or 
car-pool users, rail passengers are unaffected by traffic conditions. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Some urban planners and advocates for lower-income bus riders say that the 
cost of building and operating rail lines is exorbitantly high compared to the 
relatively small numbers it serves. The subway, for instance, cost more than 
$230 million per mile to install. Critics point out that many more commuters 
can be served for less by improving bus service. Other critics argue fixed rail 
lines are inflexible and cannot respond to changes in commuting patterns and 
employment trends. They also argue that rail lines are impractical in serving a 
sprawling, low-density region like Los Angeles. Some community advocates say 
that lines are designed primarily to serve the upper-income suburbanites while 
low-income workers use overcrowded, crime-plagued buses. Passengers complain 
that they are restricted by rail schedule hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, critics note the danger of rail. Pedestrians and motorists have been 
killed and injured as they cross in front of trains. Underground and elevated 
rail lines raise concerns about safety during an earthquake. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The rail system proposed by Los Angeles county transportation officials would 
cost $163 billion, funded largely by bond measures and government subsidies. 
Most of the subsidies would come from two half-cent sales tax increases 
approved by voters to pay for improved transportation projects. Because of 
budget shortfalls, transit officials are now considering drastically reducing 
their plans for a regional rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayer subsidies per average passenger trip are $21 for Metrolink, $2.92 for 
the Red Line subway, $11.34 for the Blue Line light rail and $1.17 for buses. 
REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Rail transportation is an expensive alternative, but the voter-approved 
sales-tax increases sent the message to politicians that commuters want it. 
Rail lines are not expected to eliminate the need for cars but can serve 
commuters on a fixed route and schedule. Maybe.

<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Just as a telephone company charges callers higher rates for peak-hour calls, 
motorists would be charged a fee for driving during rush hour. Cars would be 
equipped with transponders that log the time of day that the vehicle is driven, 
and indicate whether it travels on a congested thoroughfare. This way, a farmer 
driving on an isolated country road in Imperial Valley at 5 p.m. would not be 
penalized, but a motorist on Interstate 5 would be charged a fee. Drivers would 
receive a monthly bill. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers would avoid crowded freeways during peaks hours. Short-Term or 
Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say that, unlike a gas tax that indiscriminately forces all drivers 
to pay, a transponder would penalize only those who drive during peak hours in 
congested areas. It would all but eliminate unnecessary trips on freeways 
during rush hour. No one would go out for a recreational drive at 4 p.m. 
Motorists would schedule shopping trips during the middle of the day. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Many motorists would see this as crimping their independence. No longer would 
they be able to drive anywhere at anytime unless they were willing to pay the 
price. It would forever change the way people drive. And critics say it could 
infringe on individuals privacy. Highway officials would have a virtual log of 
each individual's road trips. It would also necessitate the creation of a 
governmental arm to handle billing and issuance of transponders. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The technology exists to place credit card-sized transponders on vehicles. In 
fact, they are currently used on several roadways and bridges. Traffic 
engineers would determine a price rate steep enough to make motorists only use 
the car during peaks hours if they had no alternative. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Transponders would probaly achieve their goal but would be very unpopular with 
voters. Yes.

 Fred Flintstone powered his car with his own feet. Speed Racer drove the 
Special Formula Mark Five. The Jetsons flew rocket ships. Wonder Woman piloted 
an invisible aircraft. Captain James Kirk beamed up to the star ship 
Enterprise. Captain Video hopped a rocket named Galaxy. Captain Midnight flew 
the Sky King to battle the evil Tut and Ickky. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that these characters faced snarls of traffic on the freeways. But 
they and countless others, all had the same basic desire: To travel faster than 
everyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 From the fundamental to the fantastic, zany ideas of how to travel from one 
destination to another have long been the legacy of transportation. Thwarted by 
man's limitations, many fertile minds have devised alternatives, such as 
beaming up to space ships, or matter transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible? We don't rule anything out. In your lifetime? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matter transport -- as in Star Trek -- has the undesirable side effect that 
the people who are transported that way are actually killed and resurrected 
later. It is barely, marginally within the realm of physical possibility," said 
Gregory Benford, professor of physics at UCI and a consultant for the 
television show, Star Trek: The Next Generation. "It would create a duplicate 
of the person and some people would tell you that's enough. But speaking as an 
identical twin, I can tell you it's not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are these slightly off-the-wall transportation options limited to the 
fictional realm of entertainment. A seemingly under-utilised resource -- like 
the L.A. River -- catches someone's imagination. Then it becomes: Why don't we 
do something with that?  
</P>
<P>
 A Texan once proposed setting up a Disneyland-like monorail over the L.A. 
River bed. And county officials contemplated deploying hovercraft, which travel 
on a layer of compressed air, in the L.A. River basin in 1985. The idea, 
however, was scrapped when the vehicle's engine wouldn't start. Nora Zamichow

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; TRANSPORTATION; IDEA FILE: SMART 
FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Smart freeways, or smart corridors, are congestion-fighting projects that 
concentrate a combination of technologies and tactics to increase vehicle 
capacity on heavily traveled corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a smart corridor planned along the Santa Monica Freeway will use 
a communications system to transmit traffic information to drivers so they can 
react and avoid congestion.It will also provide a rapid response towing team to 
quickly clear accidents and a computer system that can gather large amounts of 
data from surveillance cameras and sensors in the pavement and transmit that 
information to state and city traffic-control centers and police dispatchers. 
Traffic experts in the control centers can use the data to adjust traffic 
signals to move cars along faster. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 They increase the traffic capacity on existing roadways. Short-Term or 
Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 They have only long-term impact because it takes time to build and implement, 
especially on a large scale. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 State and local transportation officials support smart corridors as a way to 
increase capacity on existing roads by up to 15% by improving available 
roadways instead of building new thoroughfares. They say it is less expensive 
to improve existing roadways than to build new roads and freeways. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Critics cite the expense; it's too high. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The 12.3-mile smart corridor project along the Santa Monica Freeway has a 
price tag of $47 million, funded by the local, state and federal governments. 
It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to install smart corridors on the 
region's major traffic routes. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cost, smart corridors will probably only be feasible in a 
limited number of the area's most heavily congested roadways. Maybe.

 More than 1 million employees in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties 
already use computers, faxes, modems and phones to work from home on a regular 
basis. It's difficult to measure how many cars stay off the roads because most 
telecommuters have varying schedules.By one estimate, telecommuting removes 
30,000 to 45,000 cars from the roadways each day in the tri-county area. 
Telecommuting allows employers to reduce costs on offices and parking. A recent 
survey of more than 2,000 commuters found that 9% worked out of their homes 
about four days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Futurist Alvin Toffler is a big advocate of telecommuting, which he thinks 
will go a long way toward easing Los Angeles' traffic problems. He sees 
electronic communication replacing the need to jump in a car and drive to a 
workplace. He also argues that "companies will begin to realize the hidden 
costs of concentration their work forces" in a few locations. When workers are 
redistributed in dispersed locations, companies save money on parking, 
cafeterias and medical facilities, among other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But telecommuting is not for everyone. Assembly workers, for instance, need to 
be at a factory. Also, old patterns die hard. Although telecommuting rose 
sharply immediately after the Bay Area quake, it eventually lost its luster for 
many workers and their employers.NORA ZAMICHOW

 Doomsday prognosticators tell us that if we don't change our woeful one-car, 
one-driver ways, we will be spending more time on the road than anywhere else. 
Here is the world that transit planners now offer you, a tapestry of options 
replete with miles of rail lines and bus and car-pool lanes. But let's 
remember: the same folks who brought us a rail system that doesn't go to the 
airport, Dodger Stadium or, say, the Hollywood Bowl. Could we do better? 
Outside the Envelope 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone believes trains and trolleys will bust Los Angeles' gridlock. 
Less traditional alternatives abound, though some might have trouble getting 
off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 PACK POWER: Forget your Lexus. Strap on one of these backpack-like units and 
say goodby to traffic. One problem: it costs more than $30 million to purchase 
and another $30 million annually to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 LEVITATION: It could happen to you. Picture Disneyland, only much faster. 
Magnetic levitation trains zip along cushions of air, propelled by 
electromagnetic force. 
</P>
<P>
 OLD RELIABLE: Bicycles are still the most politically correct, least 
polluting, healthiest way to go. What's next? Diamond lanes for tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 ROLL OVER, RALPH KRAMDEN: Buses will get a technological facelift. No more 
wheezing, diesel-spewing behemoths. These are streamlined, sleek, fuel 
efficient wheeled wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 METROLINK: After the quake, beleaguered commuters swarmed the trains. But in 
recent weeks, ridership dropped, confirming what officials feared: Angelenos 
love their autos. 
</P>
<P>
 PLANNED CAR-POOL LANES: If we won't get out of our cars, why not get more 
Angelenos in our cars? 
</P>
<P>
 EXISTING CAR-POOL LANES: Eleven-mile lane on San Bernardino Freeway opened in 
1973 and serves 12,600 motorists in peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
 RED LINE: At a whopping $230 million per mile, L.A.'s first modern subway won 
its reputation as the nation's most expensive public works project. 
</P>
<P>
 BLUE LINE: Why did one of the county's least-congested corridors, between Long 
Beach and Los Angeles end up with the first train line? 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN LINE: Going to the airport? Hop on this trolly -- scheduled to open this 
year -- a mere mile from the airport. Tote your bag to the bus, which brings 
you to the airport shuttle.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EDUCATION; IDEA FILE: CUT CLASS SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: In the Los Angeles Unified School District it would mean hiring 
another 25,000 teachers to teach, allowing elementary school classes to be cut 
from 30 to 15 students. Junior high and high school courses would be reduced 
from 40 to 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Most educators agree that individual attention is the most important 
variable in student success: Learning problems are spotted early, questions are 
answered quickly and each student participates more. Now, about 40% of city 
school students fail to graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-Term or Long-Term Impact?: Somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Some educators say it would lead to a better educated community 
and work force and reduce the dropout rate. They say children of working poor 
would have a better chance to advance to the middle class and new businesses 
would be attracted by the higher quality labor pool. Likely to have support of 
teachers unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: They argue that this idea is very costly in the short-term and the 
long-term. They also say that, to find all the teachers, a massive, nationwide 
recruiting effort would be required. In addition, morning and afternoon 
sessions or other staggered scheduling would have to be implemented. 
Non-traditional classroom space would have to be found to accommodate twice the 
number of classes. Likely to face strong opposition from voters and elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: More than $1 billion a year, based on average annual salary of 
$40,000 and a doubling of the 25,000 classroom teachers now in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Unlikely.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EDUCATION; IDEA FILE: ALTERNATIVE 
SCHOOL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Private schools with empty seats would accept students from Los 
Angeles Unified and other districts who lost classroom space in the quake. The 
school district could keep any difference between the tuition and the $4,200 it 
receives from the state for each child. In addition, private firms would make 
classroom space available at their offices or production facilities, 
contracting with the district to provide teachers and run the education 
program. Surplus office, industrial or retail space also could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Based on the high volume of empty office space in Downtown L.A., 
near crowded schools, and the numbers of seats available on some private 
campuses (mostly Catholic or other religiously affiliated schools), it could 
quickly provide space for the hundreds of quake-displaced students. Because 
tuitions at most private schools with empty seats are lower than what the state 
provides for each child in public school, the plan could be a source of cash 
for the financially strapped district. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or long-term impact? Both. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Work site schools, sometimes called satellite schools, are quite 
feasible and already are in operation on a limited, experimental basis in 
California and other parts of the nation. Advocates say it would give parents a 
wider choice of schools. If schools were to be set up at parents' work sites, 
it also would enable parents to be closer to their children during the day and 
might cut down on commuting time by eliminating the need for a separate trip to 
school. Using empty office space would reduce the need for busing thousands of 
students from crowded neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: The taxpayers, through the district, would no longer have oversight 
of the students they would be paying to educate in private institutions, which 
are much less regulated than public ones. Work sites may not meet the same 
safety standards as traditional school buildings, and they would almost 
certainly lack gyms, athletic fields, science labs or other special facilities. 
The students with special needs probably could not be accommodated at either 
private schools or work-site schools. Ensuring quality control would be a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: They would vary, depending on the arrangements, but using private 
facilities could save money for the school district, especially if employers 
picked up the tab for readying and maintaining the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Work sites and office-space proposals: Highly likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools: Unlikely.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; CYBER SCHOOL: THE NEW COMMUNITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The campus of the future actually gets back to basics, to a time when schools 
were an integral part of a neighborhood. The educational environment would 
include: Expanded operating hours; various community services; time-saving 
technology; and the freedom of teachers, parents and administrators to custom 
tailor the academic programs to the individual school. The arrangement would 
not only make better use of scarce public resources, experts say, but also help 
combat the alienation that contributes to low student achievement and high 
dropout and crime rates. NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
<P>
 To help the school in its role as the center of the community, the campus 
serves primarily students within the surrounding neighborhood. Some are bused 
to another school or attend from another neighborhood, but that is because 
their parents, under open enrollment rules, have requested that. OPERATING 
HOURS 
</P>
<P>
 The school is open weekdays from early morning through evening, and for 
several hours on weekends to accommodate working parents and to enable 
community groups to meet on campus. The extended hours also give students more 
access to the library, computers, science labs and other study facilities. 
Teacher aides, many of them working on college degrees and credentials by day, 
staff the labs evenings and weekends. GOVERNANCE 
</P>
<P>
 The principal, who was hired by a committee of parents, faculty and district 
administrators, operates the school with a lump sum, dispensed annually. A 
council of staff, parents and community members helps decide how the funds 
should be spent. Students are tested in academic subjects annually, with the 
schoolwide (not individual) results posted and analyzed by comparing them to 
state and national standards and to the achievement goals set by the school 
council at the start of each academic year. ORGANIZATION 
</P>
<P>
 All age groups -- from preschool through 12th graders -- are clustered in a 
series of mini-schools on the same campus, enabling older youngsters to help 
with the younger ones and providing continuity for each student as he or she 
moves through the system. Contracts with colleges, private firms and other 
public schools allows students time away from the home campus for specialized 
courses or work experience. TEACHING STAFF 
</P>
<P>
 A few highly paid master teachers head teams of instructors of various 
experience and pay levels; having several lower-paid aides and beginning 
teachers makes it possible for the school to have a 15-to-one student-adult 
ratio on its shoestring budget. The teams have time daily to plan and 
coordinate lessons, as well as help set longterm goals for their students. 
Teaching teams and students remain together for three years. The multi-lingual, 
racially diverse teaching staff mirrors the ethnic makeup of the students. 
SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 Under contracts with the state, county and a private hospital and funding from 
two local industries, the campus has immunization clinics, a nurse, a physician 
training for a career in family medicine, a social worker and a psychologist 
for students and their families. After daily instruction ends, these 
professionals also are available to other community members. TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
 Computerized data on each student and staff member help streamline 
record-keeping, class assignments, and payroll. A central computer system 
enables the school to tie into state and district offices. School-trained 
parent volunteers do some of the electronic paperwork. Cable networks, 
computerized libraries and faculty workroom allow the campus to tap others' 
resources. The school council has decided to splurge on providing enough laptop 
computers for every student from seventh grade up to check out for up to a 
month. A Day in the Life of the School of the Future

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EDUCATION; IDEA FILE: SELF-GOVERNING 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: A school would receive a lump sum annually, based on the number 
of students and allowed to operate in any way its educators, probably with 
parents' participation, believed was best. Clear performance goals, set and 
overseen by the state or district, would be used to measure the school's 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Schools would be free from most time- and budget-consuming 
regulations and paperwork and could custom-design programs and activities based 
on the needs of their own students, much as most private schools do today. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-Term or Long-Term Impact?: Medium term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Such a system is already being tried on a limited basis under 
California's fledgling "charter schools" program. There is growing consensus 
among experts that school autonomy would foster greater creativity in teaching 
and stronger student enthusiasm and achievement. It could also make better use 
of the dwindling funds available for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: If there is no good system for holding schools responsible for 
results, the system could produce a series of school failures. Initially at 
least, it would require a great deal more work on the part of faculty and more 
participation from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: Self-run schools would cost no more to operate, and possibly less, 
than traditional ones. Would heighten the importance of developing a good 
system for evaluating results. It also could threaten the gains of employee 
unions if each school were allowed to negotiate its own contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Likely.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EDUCATION; IDEA FILE: DISTRICT-WIDE 
OPEN ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Parents would be able to send their children to any public 
school that has a room for them. Residents of a district would have first call, 
then seats would be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.A lottery system 
could be used for schools in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: t would make more efficient use of schools with empty seats, and 
would help ease the crowding in some urban districts, especially in 
quake-ravaged Los Angeles Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or long-term Impact?: Long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: They say it would give families a wider choice of schools and 
might improve schools in some cases by encouraging competition for students and 
could foster greater ethnic and racial diversity in suburban schools. It would 
work best if coupled with a system that allowed each school to chart its own 
course. Thereby increasing the likelihood of every parent finding a suitable 
school for the needs of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: They argue that unless transportation were provided, the most needy 
families would have the narrowest range of choices. It could create 
administrative headaches and cause the least desirable schools to lose money as 
they lose students. Political opposition from suburban residents or from 
advocates in inner-city schools could gut the program.  
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: There would be some costs to taxpayers for the county Office of 
Education to set up and administer the program. 
</P>

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EDUCATION; IDEA FILE: BILINGUAL 
TEACHING AND U.S.-BORN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Only immigrant children would receive instruction in their 
native language until they could learn English. U.S.-born children would be 
taught English in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten. In first grade, teaching 
would be done in English with the assistance of bilingual aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Clearly this is an explosive issue, but the problem is that too few 
students are becoming proficient in English. This puts them at a distinct 
economic and social disadvantage when they come out of the public school 
system. Nearly 90% of students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are 
born in the United States. But 44%, mostly Spanish-speakers, speak little or no 
English. As a result, there are few immediate incentives to learn English in 
neighborhoods where Spanish is spoken at home, at stores and at school. A 
shortage of bilingual teachers is already fostering a generation of students 
who aren't literate in either language. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-Term or Long-Term Impact?: Short-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: They say it would establish English as the primary language for 
all students, setting an easily understood, common standard. It would reduce 
language barriers dividing communities and would better prepare area students 
for college and the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: School administrators and bilingual teachers as well as some civil 
rights and immigrant advocacy groups. Opponents argue that it would be "forced 
assimilation," could limit students' fluency in their native languages and 
would hinder their overall academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: A savings for taxpayers. City schools could eliminate the bonus of 
$5,000 a year paid to bilingual teachers, and the cost of bilingual materials 
would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Unlikely.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; HEALTH CARE; IDEA FILE: UNIVERSAL 
PRIVILEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All medical professionals -- including doctors, nurses and technicians -- 
would be licensed and credentialed to work at any hospital or other health 
facility. Doctors would be able to admit patients to the type of facility that 
best suits the patient's needs, not simply to the hospital where the doctor has 
admitting privileges, as happens now. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: After an earthquake or during riots or other disasters, health care 
workers could be dispatched to serve where they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or Long-term Impact? Long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Advocates say that universal licensing and credentialing would do 
away with some of the fragmentation that currently blocks people from 
contributing skills where the health care system most needs them. There already 
is movement toward basic universal credential standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Credentialing by individual hospitals, clinics and other health 
facilities has been an important mechanism for maintaining quality. Doctors and 
other medical professionals are not equal in their experience, skills or 
competence. A universal credentialing system would require rigorous 
professional standards and enforcement. In addition, health care facilities are 
unlikely to go along with the idea unless they get immunity from malpractice 
suits for mistakes these universally credentialed professionals might make 
under their roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: The main financial issue would be how to pay the doctors and 
hospitals. Many insurance plans today require doctors to admit patients to 
certain hospitals and refuse to pay the bills if another hospital is used. 
Similarly, these plans require patients to seek care only from affiliated 
doctors. And health insurers now also pay different rates to individual doctors 
and hospitals for the same work.

immunization, TB testing, etc. -- more widely available, thus cutting down on 
the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-Term or Long-Term Impact?: Short term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: This is already being tried in various forms in New Mexico, Alaska 
and Florida, where paramedics in Tampa are making scheduled house calls. 
Advocates say it would improve public access to basic preventive health care 
and assure better emergency response in times of disaster. In addition, they 
argue, paramedics and EMTs have time when they are not handling emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: It would likely face stiff opposition from doctors and nurses, and 
might not go over well with some EMTs and paramedics, who prefer the status 
quo. American College of Emergency Physicians is also debating the concept. 
Opponents say it would not work well on a day-to-day basis in a congested city 
like Los Angeles, where EMTS and paramedics are extremely busy with emergency 
calls, but might be appropriate for the Antelope Valley and other less 
populated areas. Would require change in state legislation as well as some 
system of additional medical backup. Additionally, it might keep some people 
from seeing doctors when they really need to. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs: Nominal charges for services. Funding necessary for advanced 
training of EMTS and paramedics, which would drive up their salaries. Might 
create liability problems for paramedics and also shift some costs of medical 
care from emergency rooms and local clinics to fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Possible. The system is in place and ready for expansion given 
training and money.

A BETTER HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. IT' CLOSER THAN YOU THINK.

 UCLA Medical Center. Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Long Beach Memorial. White 
Memorial. St. Johns. St. Vincent. Childrens Hospital. Kaiser. Torrance 
Memorial. Valley Presbyterian. Century City Hospital. Motion Picture and 
Television Hospital. Glendale Adventist Medical Center. Santa Teresita 
Hospital. Mission Hospital. Hospital of the Good Samaritan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Too many hospitals -- 148 in Los Angeles County alone. Too many hospital beds 
-- 31,300 in the county, more than half of them unoccupied at any given time. 
Too much expensive high-tech equipment clustered in one area and not enough in 
another. Trauma centers in the wrong places. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lot about about Southern California's health-care system that makes 
no sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It grew up, as nearly every regional health care network in the nation did, in 
parochial fashion -- a little community hospital here, a religious medical 
center there, a teaching hospital to help train the local university's medical 
students. Each with its own sense of mission and not much interest in working 
cooperatively with the hospital around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this era of concern about rising health-care costs -- when the trend is 
toward keeping people out of the hospital instead of letting them in -- these 
facilities are competing for a shrinking pool of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the best minds in health-care policy have tried to come up with 
ways to make the system more efficient, to scale back the number of hospital 
beds. They call this "rationalizing," a policy wonk word for getting the system 
to make sense. But hospitals are, after all, businesses, and who in business 
wants to downsize or close up shop? 
</P>
<P>
 Now an earthquake -- which damaged several area hospitals, knocking 2,500 beds 
out of commission in the Los Angeles Basin -- has done what the experts could 
not. "The 30 seconds of the earthquake," said UCLA surgeon Michael Zinner, 
"potentially did more to rationalize health care than years of health-care 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
 So the experts and the analysts and the pie-in-the-sky dreamers are wondering. 
Imagine . . . imagine if an earthquake leveled every health-care facility in 
Southern California. Imagine what we could build. This, then, is their vision: 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Southern California would lose about 200 its 260 hospitals. The 
60 that remained would be perfectly dispersed across the region and would eat 
up much less of the health-care budget than hospitals do today. The job of the 
hospital would be a limited one: to provide short periods of intensive care to 
the sickest or most grievously injured patients. Most people's health needs 
would be met in doctors's offices or in one-day treatment and diagnostic 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house call is over," declared David Rothman, director of the Center for 
the Study of Society and Medicine at Columbia University in New York, "and so, 
in many ways, is the local hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, Rothman said, would be the highly personal relationship people have with 
their local community hospitals. Hospitalized patients might not even know the 
doctors treating them there. "It's going to be the efficient interaction of 
strangers," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But there would be an upside to this cold, clinical world: The care for many 
would improve. Current distinctions between well-to-do and charity patients 
would be erased. "In the high-tech hospital, everybody is on the same level," 
Rothman said. "We're going to deliver to you the best medicine, whoever you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals, clinics and other satellite facilities would be situated according 
to population needs, not by money-making incentives that concentrate 
specialists and medical centers in such affluent areas as Los Angeles' West 
Side while leaving poorer areas with few choices. Everyone would have health 
insurance -- without it, a system based on regional distribution of hospitals 
wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 The measurements of success would change. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a hospital that makes money is considered successful even if the people 
it cares for don't fare well and the community it serves has high rates of 
preventable disease. In the perfect health-care network, said health-care 
systems designer Jacque J. Sokolov, all parts of the system -- hospitals and 
clinics, the people who care for the sick and the insurers who pay for the care 
-- would be linked to one another. The system's financial success or failure 
would be determined by the health of its community. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticated communications networks would be key, connecting hospitals 
directly to police, fire and civil defense command posts. Patient records -- 
with such vital information as drug allergies or chronic illnesses or test 
results -- could instantly be called up on a computer screen. That way, if a 
neighborhood hospital -- or the freeways -- went down in a disaster, people 
could be treated wherever they showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Goldsmith, a health-care futurist: "You don't need the freeways to 
be properly diagnosed or treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake preparedness would be a must, said Stephen Gamble, president of the 
Hospital Council of Southern California. Medical facilities would be designed 
to withstand a magnitude 8 earthquake. In times of disaster, all would function 
as "lifeboats" with independent utility systems and a week's worth of fuel, 
water and generating capacity for electricity and medical gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this vision work? Can it be achieved? There are many forces conspiring 
against it -- inertia, turf battles, greed, lack of funds. But Zinner, the UCLA 
surgeon, said people at least ought to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can take this tragedy and turn it into an opportunity," he said. "Is 
anybody asking the question, 'Do we need to be what we were?' " SHERYL STOLBERG 
and IRENE WIELAWSKI

 Health care in the Southern California of the future would, in the vision of 
experts, be delivered in an entirely different manner than today. A highly 
coordinated network would replace the current fragmented system. The network 
would function as well in times of disaster as it would in meeting people's 
day-to-day medical needs. The Network 
</P>
<P>
 Health care would be organized around geographic sectors, each with a hub. 
Such a system would ensure that ambulances are where they need to be, that 
supplies are stockpiled and that patient load is distributed most effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Acute-Care Hospital 
</P>
<P>
 These super hospitals would act as the hub of each geographic network. They 
would provide basic emergency services, general surgery and intensive care and 
would have some transitional beds for patients prior to discharge home or to 
outlying facilities. Most would have about 150 beds, but a few would be 
designated as major trauma centers with as many as 500 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The "Sub-Acutes" 
</P>
<P>
 The next level down in this system would be "sub-acute" hospitals. Functioning 
much like today's community hospitals, they would be spaced around the main 
hospital and would take patients for short recuperative stays. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The Satellites 
</P>
<P>
 Physician groups would be based in medical office satellites. Such facilities 
would be equipped to treat minor injuries and dispense medication. Each 
facility would have on-site storage or generation capacity for electricity, 
fuel, water and medical gases for at least a week. Ambulances would be based at 
the medical office satellites. The Super Hospital 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the acute-care hospitals would be larger, with up to 500 beds, and 
specially equipped to handle major disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special procedures: Trauma center backup, extra beds 
</P>
<P>
 * Surgery: Full-capability operating rooms 
</P>
<P>
 * Sterile supplies: Protected storage 
</P>
<P>
 * Imaging center: X-rays, MRIs, EKGs, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trauma center: Emergency room and communications center Helipad: Ambulance 
helicopter would be stationed at acute-care hub hospital, with a triage area 
nearby The Lifeboat Concept 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional hospitals are sitting ducks in a disaster. In the health care 
network of the future, all medical facilities -- the super hospital, the 
sub-acutes and the satellites -- would be constructed to remain fully 
functional after a magnitude 8 earthquake. Each would act as a "lifeboat" for 
the community in times of disaster, with backup generating capacity for 
electricity, fuel, water and medical gases for at least a week. Ambulances 
would be based at satellite medical centers, while an ambulance helicopter 
would be based at each hub hospital. The medical facilities would be directly 
linked to the police, fire and civil defense communications networks. Among the 
features: 
</P>
<P>
 * Security safeguards, including limited entry points, a minimum number of 
windows and metal detectors 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion joints to keep entire building from collapsing if one section 
gives out 
</P>
<P>
 * Microwave dishes placed on top for communication with the city's emergency 
command bunker and other hospitals 
</P>
<P>
 * Independent ventilation and exhaust system

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; HEALTH CARE; IDEA FILE: THE ULTIMATE 
PAPERLESS MEDICAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How it works: Anyone who receives any type of medical care has a computer 
file. Every hospital room, doctors' office and medical emergency vehicle would 
be equipped with computers that tie into this central regional medical 
database. Paper charts become a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Paper charts often get lost or destroyed. Sometimes care is 
fragmented because one doctor doesn't know what another has done. Paramedics 
who treat patients in emergencies may have no idea of their medical histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or Long-term Impact?: Could be implemented in stages. Short-term 
implementation could done on a small scale within existing health networks. A 
regional or even national database would be long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: They say it might save lives and improve health of the public by 
giving paramedics and doctors quick access to patient histories. Would save 
money and reduce the risk to patients of duplicative diagnostic procedures such 
as X-rays. Would streamline care and make the medical system more efficient, 
particularly in huge public systems such as Los Angeles County's. Would 
eliminate need for storage space. A paperless system is incorporated into the 
design of the proposed Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, scheduled to open 
in 2003. The design calls for computers in every patient room. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Twinges of Big Brother -- would open up possibilities for violating 
patients' privacy. A field day for computer hackers -- unauthorized users might 
be able to gain access to the database. Implementing the system is an enormous 
bureaucratic hassle. For example, Los Angeles County has already tried 
computerizing billing records in a first step toward a paperless system, but 
the $64.7 million system is in a state of near collapse due to bugs in the 
software and poor management. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: For a regional system, the best estimates to launch a system range 
into the hundreds of millions. But long-term savings could defray start-up 
costs. The costs to consumers and taxpayers would depend on the type of system 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Possible.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE WORKPLACE; IDEA FILE: REWARD 
DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Companies would directly reward managers for the promotion and retention of 
minorities and women. Each manager's job description would include fostering 
diversity by hiring minority and women workers and helping them thrive in the 
organization.Periodically, managers would be evaluated on how well they met 
these goals and a portion of their annual raises would be tied to meeting these 
goals. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Managers have a personal interest in promoting diversity and making sure their 
employees want to stay with the company. Short-term or Long-term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Changes can be made immediately and the effects felt soon after. But the 
changes also can be lasting, depending on the company's commitment. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts agree that a diverse work force can respond better in today's 
diverse marketplace. Women and ethnic minorities have been blocked by "glass 
ceilings" from moving up in business organizations. Rewarding managers who 
diversify would go a long way toward smashing the glass ceiling. Media giant 
Gannett Corp. has used such a system with marked success. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say such changes could damage the morale of workers not targeted 
for assistance and create dissension in the work force. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 They would vary depending on the company and the size and success of the 
program. "REALITY CHECK" 
</P>
<P>
 Several corporations have found this to be an effective tool. Considered a 
very realistic possibility. Yes.

 Near the end of a century that began with bruising battles over the 40-hour 
workweek, this is the daily grind of a representative resident of Greater Los 
Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 Up at 4:30. Shower and dress. Grab coffee and a roll for the drive. In the car 
by 5:15. Sit in traffic that was bad before the earthquake -- and now is worse. 
6 a.m.: Books on tape. 6:30: Mark and Brian. 7: Try side streets. At work by 
7:30. Work all morning. Lunch at desk. Work through afternoon. Call kids at 4 
p.m. to check on school day. Gather up work at 6 to take home. Home by 7:30. 
Check homework. Bathe kids. Microwave dinner at 9. At 9:45, fall asleep on 
couch talking to spouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Up at 4:30 . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Southern Californians' work lives are out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the meaning and satisfaction we take from our jobs, they are eating us 
alive. In pursuit of a higher standard of living -- or simply to keep a roof 
over our heads in one of the world's costliest cities -- we work overtime, take 
second jobs, start businesses on the side. More than likely, our spouses are 
working, too. One in five of us takes work home. Of those who do, three out of 
five aren't paid for the extra effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Our work, meanwhile, grows more and more demanding. Rare is the workplace 
where fewer people are not being asked to do more. Deadlines are tighter. 
Tempers are shorter. Expectations are higher, as the drumbeat of global and 
local competition pounds away. The picture is the same for manufacturing 
workers and service workers, in companies big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 We have responded. Americans -- and certainly Californians -- have registered 
stunning gains in productivity over the last 20 years. Yet after factoring out 
inflation, our take-home pay has steadily declined. 
</P>
<P>
 We make sacrifices. Less time for our spouses. Less time for our organizations 
and leisure pursuits. Less time, surely, for ourselves; ministers and 
psychologists tally the psychic toll. And less time for our children. Is anyone 
really happy with the amount of time his or her children spend in someone 
else's care? The amount of time they go uncared for? Making time to be a good 
parent is hard work again. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the freeways have fallen down.  
</P>
<P>
 "There must be a coming to terms with the fact that life isn't as simple as it 
used to be," says Linda Poverny, a social worker who heads the staff and 
faculty counseling center at USC, "yet we expect workers to continue to 
function at the same level or better than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there another way? There are glimmerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider VeriFone, based up north in Redwood City, with a big operation in 
Costa Mesa. This is the firm that makes the little terminals used by stores and 
restaurants to authorize credit card purchases. The merchant swipes your card; 
VeriFone's equipment and information network lets her know if you're over your 
credit limit.  
</P>
<P>
 VeriFone operates in cyberspace. Its commodity is a collection of electronic 
blips. And its employees are out navigating the electronic superhighway, 
instead of commuting to offices on gridlocked concrete. All 1,500 workers have 
a laptop or personal computer. They communicate by electronic mail, hooked up 
over the Internet. They shuffle assignments across oceans or continents to meet 
deadlines. They return phone messages.  
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit, VeriFone people 
were able to get their work done from home. 
</P>
<P>
 VeriFone takes the notion of the "virtual corporation" to an extreme: The 
chief information officer works out of his home in New Mexico; the chief 
executive flies 400,000 miles in a year.  
</P>
<P>
 But in smaller ways, other companies -- and many workers, sometimes innovating 
against the resistance of their hidebound organizations -- are finding the 
flexibility to meet the needs of both the firm and the employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: Young physicians flock to Kaiser because the HMO gives them something 
a private practice cannot: a clearly defined work schedule, with clearly 
defined time off. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: The Towers Perrin consulting firm, teamed with Pepsico Inc., is 
promoting a service called "Xtra Hours." The program brings hair stylists, dry 
cleaners and convenience stores to the workplace; think of it as a "corporate 
concierge" or post-industrial catering truck. "It enables people to take care 
of a lot of their chores and a lot of their social life through work," says 
consultant Barbara Adolf. "We give them back their Saturdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Parallel concepts? Not exactly. But all are responses to a desperate need for 
workers to reclaim control of their working lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Control is the workplace issue for Los Angeles in 1994. Know the people in 
your company -- or in City Hall, for that matter -- who really get things done, 
whether they have the big titles or not, and you have your hand on a lever that 
controls things. Give up a little control, and the people you are used to 
controlling will do remarkable things. Know that you can change things. "We 
don't need a great revolution to do it," says Betty A. Walker, a professor at 
USC's School of Education. "We need a lot of people willing to say, 'It's not 
over yet.' And then go push on it." JIM SCHACHTER and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

 At the epicenter -- at Roscoe and Balboa boulevards -- the morning shift had 
been at work for half an hour when the Jan. 17 quake mercilessly shook the 
Northridge plant where Harman International Industries makes electronic 
components for premium car audio systems. You know the names: JBL, Infinity, 
Harman Kardon. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the line, it was like somebody just hit the whole machine forward," one 
worker recounted later in the company newspaper. "The ladies yelled and they 
all ran toward me. . . . The lights went off, and the sprinklers came on." One 
supervisor was sure the plant, with 1,400 workers, was a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman is not a typical company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman and CEO Sidney Harman says he hires "poets" as his top executives. 
The work force is organized into teams. Job security is assured: When falling 
orders from Ford and Chrysler slow the assembly line, workers can take jobs in 
security or landscaping without a pay cut or loss of benefits. Harman set up a 
line assembling clocks -- made from the wooden plugs knocked out in mounting 
car speakers -- to keep surplus workers occupied. Some will be trained as sales 
people to staff the company's first outlet store, scheduled to open April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 An MBA could slash costs at Harman International. But Harman believes that 
people who are secure in their jobs will "deliver a level of productivity 
beyond our wildest imagination." The marketplace endorses his assumption: The 
stock price has almost doubled in the last year; profits tripled from 1992 to 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And the production line in Northridge was up and running one week after the 
quake -- every worker wore a hard hat but was at his or her place. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of teamwork, Harman says, "nothing I've ever seen came close to what 
this awful disaster produced." JIM SCHACHTER

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE WORKPLACE; IDEA FILE: COMMUTER 
MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 A market in commuter miles -- similar to a market in smog credits -- would be 
created to control how workers get to and from their jobs. Companies would be 
allotted miles based on a formula that takes into account the number of people 
a firm employs. Then companies could trade these commuter miles in an orderly 
market. Companies whose employees telecommute, work out of satellite offices 
near their homes, car pool, have staggered schedules or use public 
transportation would accumulate excess commuter miles. Companies whose 
employees tend to drive from home by themselves would run short of allotted 
commuter miles and would face financial penalties. But companies with excess 
commuter miles could sell them to companies that need more, much as pollution 
credits are now bought and sold. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 It would give businesses a strong financial incentive to reduce traffic 
congestion and encourage new forms of work, such as telecommuting. Short-Term 
or Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 It would take time for a system to be put in place. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting advocates and others endorse the idea as a sure-fire way to 
change work habits. They say it would force businesses to either change, or pay 
a price. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say such a plan probably would make some companies relocate out of the 
area, resulting in a net loss of jobs. They say it also would unfairly penalize 
some companies and force some smaller firms out of business. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies would end up paying steep costs to continue to have workers 
commute. The program could be funded through penalties collected against 
offending companies or through a percentage of the proceeds from the 
transactions. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 If it works for smog, why not for traffic congestion? A similar program to 
control development density and preserve historic structures in downtown Los 
Angeles by buying and selling unused "air rights" above low-rise buildings was 
successful in the 1980s -- until the bottom fell out of the real estate market 
and developers stopped building office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 Good chance if political will is there.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; IDEA FILE: WORKER TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton called for a 1.5% tax on 
private employers' payroll to finance a program of continuous, lifelong 
education for American workers. A similar effort could be implemented in 
California -- but at only one-third the cost of Clinton's plan. It would be 
financed by a state-imposed 0.5% payroll tax on private employers. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Given the state's estimate that private, non-farm payroll in California 
totaled about $306.5 billion in 1993, a 0.5% tax would raise more than $1.53 
billion. By comparison, Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed budget for the year 
beginning July 1 would lay out $18.8 billion for elementary and secondary 
education and community colleges and $4.6 billion for the Cal State and UC 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised by the training tax would fund an infinite variety of 
training efforts. Technical workers could deepen their computer skills. 
Supervisors who speak only English could learn Spanish or Vietnamese, to better 
communicate with their employees. Workers displaced when their plant closes 
could obtain the skills they need to land new work. With most people expected 
to change jobs repeatedly in their working lives, nearly everyone ultimately 
would take advantage of the programs supported by the new tax. And hard-pressed 
colleges, adult schools and other training facilities would gain a steady new 
source of funding. Short-Term or Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 With support, the program could be implemented quickly. The payoffs would be 
both short- and long-term. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates argue that the need for training is immense. As workers get older, 
in almost any field, their skills need to be refreshed. Doctors and lawyers can 
jet to Aruba for continuing education courses -- and then write off the costs 
on their tax returns -- but most Californians lack access to affordable 
advanced education. Nationally, the Labor Department says more than 2 million 
Americans are permanently laid off each year. In the post-Cold War defense 
downsizing, the burden of job loss has landed disproportionately on California, 
which has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Many workers whose jobs 
disappear will never again work in their old field. They need help identifying 
their aptitudes, building new skills and getting new jobs. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say piling a new cost onto California employers will cripple some -- 
maybe drive some out of the state all together. Money that companies have to 
pay into a state retraining fund won't get spent on new equipment or on hiring 
additional workers. The hit to the economy could be significant. In addition, 
government-funded job training has proved notoriously ineffective. The money 
too often is squandered by inept contractors who too often train the vulnerable 
unemployed for jobs that don't really exist. So a big new spending program 
would require costly oversight provisions. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Business would hurt the most, facing a new $1.53-billion tax bill. At worst, 
business would pass along every penny of the new tax. That would add 5 cents to 
the cost of every $100 worth of goods or services purchased. If the new 
training programs reduced unemployment, taxpayers would save. If they ended up 
damaging job creation in the economy, unemployment and its related costs would 
grow. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stopped talking about his campaign plank the minute he got elected. 
The entire federal government now spends just $1.4 billion on re-employment. 
Wilson does not want to raise taxes to pay for rebuilding freeways destroyed in 
the recent earthquake. So this proposal may go nowhere. No.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE WORKPLACE; IDEA FILE: WORK FEWER 
HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime pay would be eliminated. Employers would establish a standard work 
week for every job -- for example, 30, 40 or 50 hours. For work beyond those 
hours, employees would be compensated in time off -- one hour off for every 
extra hour worked. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 By earning free time, workers would gain flexibility. They could save time for 
longer vacations -- or for the freedom to attend their child's school play. 
Workers now paid time-and-a-half for overtime would be stripped of some of 
their incentive to work longer hours. Free time might seem a better deal if the 
alternative is straight pay rather than time-and-a-half. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, white-collar workers who now are obliged to work an unlimited number of 
hours for their weekly or monthly salary would regain some control over their 
work time. If only one big firm in an industry begins using shorter hours as a 
recruiting tool, all its competitors may be forced into line. Short-Term or 
Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the need to change the federal wage-and-hour law, there's nothing 
to stop it from being implemented immediately. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists say it would make workers happier and more productive by 
increasing their leisure time. They acknowledge that workers who now depend on 
overtime pay to support their families initially would be hurt. But they cite 
studies showing that employers who rely on overtime tend to pay less per hour 
overall. So in time, wage rates might rise to make up for the lost hours. Also, 
supporters note that productivity tends to rise as people work shorter hours. 
So companies may be surprised at how little hiring they need to do. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Employers worry that they would have to hire more workers to get tasks done. 
That would be good for the job picture, but tough on corporate balance sheets. 
The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Companies bear the cost of retooling their personnel systems. And their 
shareholders may have to swallow some of the costs of adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on consumers depends on how companies respond. If they can keep the 
costs of any new hiring in balance with the savings from reduced overtime 
wages, the price of goods and services will be stable. Lots of added hiring of 
full-time workers with costly benefits could raise prices. 
</P>
<P>
 If unemployment falls, taxpayers save. If fewer overworked people abuse or 
neglect their children, society benefits immensely -- and saves in costs of 
public social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, workers who need money -- either to survive or to support a grander 
lifestyle -- may seek second jobs, further crowding the market for part-time 
work and undermining the goal of restoring to people their free time. REALITY 
CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Probably zero chance. The average work week has been rising for 20 years, and 
it would take immense effort to reverse the trend. There's little evidence that 
stressed workers are prepared to translate their cries for help into a campaign 
to shorten the work week. No.

 "A metropolis that exists in a semidesert, imports water 300 miles, has 
inveterate flash floods, is at the grinding edges of two tectonic plates, and 
has a microclimate tenacious of noxious oxides will have priorities among the 
aspects of its environment that it attempts to control." - John McPhee, "The 
Control of Nature" 
</P>
<P>
 Is anywhere completely safe? The answer is no. The strongest freeway overpass 
ever engineered will topple if it's sitting on the epicenter of big quake. Your 
house may be quake-safe and perched on the local granite, but if it is, it's 
likely to be near a chapparal-covered hillside that will one day become an 
inferno. You may be on "The Flats," safely away from burning hillsides and 
beach erosion, but guess what: The potential for urban flooding by the Basin's 
arid rivers is vast. 
</P>
<P>
 The metropolis is not for the timid, nor is it for the arrogant. The city will 
come back from this latest nightmare, full of new ideas for rebuilding and 
retrofitting, but remarkably short of ways to get residents out of the danger 
zones. We love our panoramas from hilltops above the smog, even if the hills 
explode from time to time. We love our hilltop panoramas and ocean views, even 
if we're threatened by fire and mud. We want our summer weather in January, and 
we're willing to risk a few bricks and some freeway overpasses to have it. 
ZONING FOR DISASTER 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the Northridge earthquake, predictions envisioned a Los Angeles 
whose population would grow by about 2 million -- to a total of more than 11 
million -- by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor may slow down that growth: Quake-weary people could leave, fewer 
immigrants could come here. But birthrates and continued immigration still are 
expected to keep the population growing and increase the need for decent 
housing -- particularly housing that families can afford -- and the jobs to 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some zoning and planning changes may result from our recent cycle of natural 
disasters. But experts say that wide and stringent no-growth rules are unlikely 
to be passed -- even for fire, flood and seismically risky zones. Any 
earthquake-related zoning is complicated by the sense that much of developed 
Los Angeles County could be liable to temblor damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "To suggest that you are not going to rebuild in urban Los Angeles -- that's 
beyond the pale for political discussion," said William Fulton, editor of the 
California Planing and Development Report. Instead, he and others predict the 
emphasis likely will be on rebuilding and retrofitting for more safety. 
BUILDING IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY Since the 1933 Long beach earthquake, the city 
has periodically strengthened its building codes, usually after a major quake 
exposed new weaknesses. In 1973, for example, two years after the Sylmar quake, 
the city building code for new apartments was amended to require plywood in 
exterior walls to help resist sideways stress during earthquakes. Ten years 
after the Sylmar quake, the city began requiring owners of unreinforced masonry 
buildings of more than four units to strengthen walls to prevent collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, the City Council passed an ordinance requiring buildings with 
so-called prefabricated "tilt-up" walls -- walls lifted into place but without 
sufficient binding to their roofs -- to reinforced the connection between walls 
and roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also considering measures to retrofit other types of buildings 
damaged in the earthquake: non-ductile concrete structures, including 
hospitals; older woodframe buildings that lack plywood reinforcement in stucco 
walls; and precast (concrete) parking structures, several of which suffered 
major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are also considering whether to require retrofitting some older 
homes, in particular woodframe dwellings that lack plywood or particle-board 
sheathing that connects floors with foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such measures are costly, but future construction may be affected. The 
Quake-Safe House 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to build one? Here is a list of possibilities, ranging from 
realistic to way out there: 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel-frame construction to flex in a quake and resist fire 
</P>
<P>
 * Shock-absorbing base or floating foundation to resist shocks 
</P>
<P>
 * Deep-drilled piers to steady house in liquefaction zones 
</P>
<P>
 * Automatic shutoff valve to close down gas meter 
</P>
<P>
 * Flexible plumbing that won't break in a quake and resists extreme heat 
</P>
<P>
 * Light metal prefabricated chimneys that can be secured to the frame; 
fireplace could be converted as a grill or oven in emergencies 
</P>
<P>
 * Diesel or propane-powered generator with battery packs for electricity 
</P>
<P>
 * Rainwater recovery system funnels it into holding tanks for later use 
</P>
<P>
 * A large vegetable garden to supplement diet when stores are shut down. WATER 
IN THE DESERT 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is a desert, prone to years of drought. Wet years, 
however, can be memorable. Despite the region's vast network of catch basins, 
storm drains and ugly concrete river channels, the federal government considers 
the Los Angeles and Santa Ana rivers to comprise one of the largest flood 
threats west of the Mississippi River. Yet development pressures are 
unrelenting, with such major flood control basins as the Hansen Dam presenting 
the tantalizing prospect of some of the latest undeveloped land in urban Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 So much of the region is flood prone that the odds are against any major 
rezoning. Building for Flood 
</P>
<P>
 Most builders have this advice for those contemplating construction in a flood 
zone: Don't. The lengths required to construct such a fortress are enormous. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Raise the foundation level by bringing in fill dirt and raise it above the 
flood plain level. It may be helpful to build a concrete block wall around the 
fill (Fill dirt, however, may be seismically unsound) 
</P>
<P>
 * Build a "riprap" -- often seen in flood control channels -- along the 
upstream side of the pad to divert water and control erosion (A riprap is made 
of two chainlink fences with boulders between them) 
</P>
<P>
 * Pilings should elevate the house above the so-called 100-year-flood level. 
They must meet seismic and soil requirements 
</P>
<P>
 * Build a dike around the house, with a bridge driveway so floodwaters won't 
be blocked 
</P>
<P>
 * Pumps should be placed inside the dike area to pump out water that may build 
up during a rain THE COASTAL QUESTION 
</P>
<P>
 Standards for building along Los Angeles County's coastline vary according to 
different coastal communities and the California Coastal Commission, which 
issues permits for building in those areas that have not adopted plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, coastal plans require both environmental and geological analyses 
that consider the potential for landslides and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticated building techniques have made slope construction safer than in 
years past, but environmental issues remain in coastal wetland areas from 
Ventura County to San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of beach erosion surfaces with each heavy winter storm. 
Communities from Malibu to Seal Beach must often take drastic -- and very 
expensive -- measures to protect shoreline development from encroaching waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The political will seems to exist to take action where coastal development is 
concerned, but costs could stand in the way. THE ANNUAL INFERNO 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's storied hillsides nurture native vegetation that is 
literally explosive. Many types of chaparral plants reproduce only after a 
wildfire has moved through. But these hillsides also provide what much of the 
area can't: a rural feel, scented air, spectacular views of ocean and city. 
They are among the most desireable, expensive real estate in California. And 
they burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires are a complex phenomenon, creating, as they do, the danger of flood and 
mudslide in denuded watersheds. The fall's devastating wildfires -- terrible, 
but not the worst the area has seen -- renewed the endless debate on whether it 
is advisable to build where brush fire is inevitable. Financially strapped 
governments at all levels are increasingly hard-pressed to devote the resources 
required to ensure safety before a fire and to rebuild after. Building for Fire 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the quake, the fires provided vivid and sometimes visual examples 
of what works and what doesn't. For houses in fire zones, experts advise these 
measures, among others. Many are aesthetically distasteful, and others are 
prohibitively expensive: 
</P>
<P>
 * Houses set back as far as possible from slopes to avoid fires racing up 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 * No flammable roofs. Roofs must be non-combustible with no gaps or places for 
embers to lodge. No wooden decks or fences. 
</P>
<P>
 * In areas that abut wildlands, non-combustible stucco siding or stucco over 
cement building panels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Double-glazed windows, fireproof curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 * No tree or tall shrub within 30 feet of the house. No juniper, eucalyptus or 
other "pyrophytes" 
</P>
<P>
 * Wider streets to ease access for firefighters and trucks 
</P>
<P>
 * Swimming pools should be accessible to firefighters' pumps. Owners might be 
required to own pumps and do their own firefighting until help arrives Mapping 
Disaster 
</P>
<P>
 Clouds of aftershocks mark the lingering effects of the 6.7 Northridge 
earthquake in this computer-generated topical map, above, created for The Times 
by Caltech. Southern California's arid terrain, sculpted by eons of quakes, is 
also host to the tinder-dry and highly explosive vegetation known as chaparral. 
Fragile watersheds and mountain slopes ringing from the Basin are vulnerable to 
wildfire. PLANNING FOR PREVENTION 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few of the myriad dangers identified by Los Angeles County's Department 
of Regional Planning are shown below: soil liquefaction in earthquake, faults 
and historic epicenters, landslides and floods. The maps show that there are 
practically no areas affording total safety from potential disaster.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; HABITAT; "THE MOST RADICAL APPROACH TO 
REBUILDING LOS ANGELES IS NOT TO BUILD OR REBUILD AT ALL IN RISKY PLACES" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Again, Los Angeles looks longingly to its past as it tries chart a future. 
</P>
<P>
 It is spending billions rebuilding its long-abandoned commuter rail system. 
For the first time in more than 30 years, voters elected a Republican mayor who 
radiated nostalgia for that safer, more manageable city of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than ever, people seem preoccupied with the idea of going back -- as 
if the collapse of the freeways revealed the ruins of a more stable, civil 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, where fire and earthquakes are perhaps more a part of the 
life-cycle than in most other places in Los Angeles, Mayor Carolyn Van Horn 
ponders a new kind of general plan that both shapes and reflects the sense of 
community she recalls from growing up in the San Fernando Valley. "Nature was a 
part of life. People had chickens in their back yards. Everybody had a 
vegetable garden. The adults always knew where the children were. You could go 
next door if you needed something. If they didn't have it, you could walk to 
the store. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of Los Angeles as a collection of self-sufficient communities 
-- where people know their neighbors and where King Car no longer reigns -- has 
nourished the frustrated dreams of local architects and planners for years. The 
concept of the urban village lies at the heart of two grandiose plans. Playa 
Vista, just south of Marina del Rey, will be a mostly low-rise cluster of 
homes, stores and offices for 28,000 people of varying incomes. The other, 
Central City West, just across the Harbor Freeway from Downtown, is meant to 
provide an even larger mix of residential and commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these projects were planned in an era that seems eons ago, before 
recession, riot, wildfire and earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the building blocks for urban villages are already dotting the 
landscape, to hear architect Craig Hodgetts tell it. He points to the outdoor 
farmers' markets, the swap meets and the empty storefronts that could become 
neighborhood offices for a decentralized bureaucracy. Linking them together 
would be the electronic highway that people enter from their home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Red Car, which went out of business, the city's urban villages 
didn't disappear so much as become dysfunctional, casualties of crime, job 
flight and middle-class exodus. And as in small towns elsewhere, the corner 
stores were upstaged by the big suburban malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the outlines remain of the place this once was -- in neighborhoods from 
Watts to Echo Park, from Boyle Heights to North Hollywood. They have relatively 
compact housing patterns yet still offer many pleasant side streets of 
single-family homes that are within easy strolls of shops and schools. Why 
then, as so many planners ask, struggle to create entirely new towns on a 
nostalgic model, when the real ones still exist and need cash and encouragement 
to come back? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most visionary thing of all would be using this as an opportunity to 
strengthen what we have. Invest in South-Central and South Bay and East L.A.," 
said Culver City community development director Mark H. Winogrond, who also 
heads the Los Angeles section of the American Planning Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most radical approach to rebuilding Los Angeles is not to build or 
rebuild at all in seismically or otherwise risky places. In densely populated 
parts of the city, why rebuild every condemned building, when a park or a 
community garden might serve better? 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding is "part and parcel of decline. If all we do is repair the 
earthquake damage, it's not going to stop the cycle of deterioration and the 
linking of that deterioration to other social problems like drugs, crime and 
gangs," said Barbara Zeidman, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles city 
housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 Within those neighborhoods, planners envision building more apartments and 
opening others into three- and four-bedroom flats to accommodate the larger 
families of an immigrant population. The old model of ground-level retail and 
living above the store could be revived; so could living above the office. 
Density would go up in these neighborhoods, but the housing could remain 
affordable.  
</P>
<P>
 What matters most is trying something different. Hodgetts talks about "more 
improvisational and transitory forms." Hodgetts' best-known design, UCLA's 
temporary library, may be appropriate for a city whose faith in bricks and 
mortar has been shaken: It's a huge tent, actually a cluster of interconnected 
tents complete with heating, air conditioning and the electronic capacity for a 
40-station computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is foolhardy enough to predict the death of the single-family house 
with its lemon tree in a sunny California yard. But what of that house? 
Although the model of a wood frame bolted to its foundation withstood the 
temblors well enough, some have conceived houses better equipped for the 
aftermath of natural or man-made horrors. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean a survivalist's fortress, a post-apocalypse "Road Warrior" 
compound, with its own power generator, heavy security devices and an awesome 
telecommunications ability. And in case all else fails, maybe a helicopter 
waits on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The kindler, gentler version is an eco-house built with recyclable materials 
proven to withstand quakes. A house that also has its own septic and compost 
systems independent of city pipes that can break down, a house that collects 
rainwater and uses it wisely, taps solar energy and has, perhaps, some chickens 
or goats in the yard. Instead of an escape helicopter, maybe several bicycles 
sit in a shed. 
</P>
<P>
 For a less extreme lifestyle change? Craig Kronenberg, an architect with the 
Johannes Van Tilburg firm in Santa Monica, suggests more plywood, less marble; 
garden block walls replaced by old-style wooden fences; masonry chimneys 
replaced by prefabricated metal flues or maybe fewer fireplaces altogether; no 
more houses on stilts; less unnecessary heavy ornamentation. "It's an 
aesthetic," he says, "born of necessity." FRANK CLIFFORD and LARRY GORDON

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; HABITAT; IDEA FILE; RESETTLE DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 Vastly increase the number of housing units and residents in and near Downtown 
Los Angeles, making it a district where people can work and live. A new 
strategic plan for Downtown calls for 18,000 more housing units inside the 
central freeway ring and an additional 24,000 on the periphery. That would add 
about 100,000 residents to Downtown, which now has a population of 26,000 in 
the core and 50,000 on its edges. 
</P>
<P>
 It would convert the enormous empty spaces in historic office, loft and retail 
buildings into residences through the Broadway, Spring Street and Seventh 
Street corridors. Even a relatively new high-rise along Figueroa might have 
offices on its lower floors and apartments above, with a special emphasis on 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Downtown boosters call for much more density, for building family-size 
apartments, condos and townhouses while adding the shopping, education and 
recreation opportunities that thrive in the suburbs but are sadly missing 
Downtown. BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners suffering from the crash of the commercial real estate market 
Downtown. Construction companies specializing in new apartment development or 
in restoration of historic structures. Commuters who can't stand their long 
drives. The many workers in Downtown's industrial, garment and warehouse 
districts who can't afford suburban homes but who would benefit from the 
stability of moderate rents and prices and a good choice of housing. Existing 
amenities would be better used--gas lines, libraries, old movie theaters--and 
it would rescue many fine older buildings now facing neglect and decay. 
SUPPORTERS 
</P>
<P>
 People who want to make Downtown's economy less dependent on the freeways and 
seek to create the lively urban feel that L.A. has always been faulted for 
lacking. Mass transit proponents who see a populated downtown filled with 
ready-made riders. Historic preservationists. Even homeowner groups in 
peripheral areas, otherwise hostile to Downtown funding and interest, might 
support it as a tradeoff to relieve development pressure in their own areas. 
OPPONENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Forces political and soci-cultural. The dream of a house with a nice back yard 
and a two-car garage has an overwhelmingly powerful grip on the California 
public. Debunkers say it is foolish to try to force a European-East Coast model 
on Los Angeles, destroying what has been the city's greatest attraction. 
Previous attempts to revive Downtown have not been successful. Besides, 
Downtown has an unshakably nasty image as a place to avoid at night. Fears 
about crime and concerns about ethnic integration are harder to overcome than 
any required zoning changes. And some experts say many people will feel 
quake-safe in rehabbed historic buildings or in new high-rises. Jealously 
divided political power will never allow massive infusions of public or private 
funds into Downtown without similar investments around the region. THE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 Enormous in money, and a big shift in the regions centrifugal psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 To consumers: Depends on how expensive the housing turns out to be. Could save 
money in commuting and automobile costs in addition to housing. However, a 
Downtown life can prove to be quite expensive if, for example, there are no 
competitively priced suburban-style supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 To others; May require large public subsidies at first through the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency. Might be encouraged through tax credits. May 
take huge efforts to first tackle homelessness and drug sales. REALITY CHECKS 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 50-50. If the demand were there, this might have happened 30 years 
ago. The artist's district in Downtown, which was to have been the vanguard, 
has seen an exodus to Venice and other spots.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; PREPAREDNESS; IDEA FILE: SATELLITE 
COMMUNICATION NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How it works 
</P>
<P>
 A communications network would be based on a satellite placed in orbit and 
used by residents with cellular telephones. It would replace the current system 
of ground-based phone lines. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite would eliminate reliance on land-line networks, which are 
vulnerable to earthquake and other disasters. Short-term or Long-term Impact 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts believe such satellites will be lofted by the end of this decade. 
But problems of cost, opposition by telephone companies and government 
regulation could delay them. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Satellites already have the channel capacity to handle millions of telephone 
customers, backers say. Those with cellular phones would simply install small 
ground-station dishes at their homes and dial away. Because such a system would 
not rely on wires or fiber optics, it would be "unbreakable" during a quake or 
other disaster. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 The current telephone system is cheap and reliable, and it performed well 
during the Northridge quake, critics note. A satellite system would be very 
expensive and probably encounter strong political opposition from existing 
telephone companies. Even if the phone company ran the satellite system, it 
would have to find ways to recoup its huge investment in the ground-based 
network. Ratepayers would probably wind up footing the costs, which could lead 
to further political resistance to satellites. In addition, there are only so 
many orbit slots in space, and it is unclear how many would be needed for a 
nationwide, much less a worldwide, satellite network. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Launching and maintaining a single satellite in space costs tens of millions 
of dollars, and many such satellites could be required for a nationwide hookup. 
Reality Check 
</P>
<P>
 Possible on a limited scale.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; PREPAREDNESS; IDEA FILE: DECENTRALIZE 
AND TOUGHEN EXISTING POWER GRID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How it works 
</P>
<P>
 Utilities such as the Department of Water and Power rely on complex systems of 
large, expensive components that can be damaged during earthquakes. These 
components could be strengthened and the overall system altered so it relies 
more on smaller power generators and that are spaced farther apart. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 During the Northridge quake, ceramic insulators cracked and shorted out. 
Receiving stations were badly damaged and a transmission tower near Castaic 
toppled over. Technology could be developed to harden these components. For 
instance, the utility industry is developing a plasticized material to replace 
ceramic insulators. The system also could be restructured so that it relies 
less on large-scale, centrally located components and more on smaller ones 
scattered across the region. Short term or long term impact 
</P>
<P>
 Designing stronger components is a near-term strategy. Decentralization is far 
more expensive and would take longer. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Those who support this say that decentralizing the system could involve 
switching to different power sources such as solar, wind and thermal energy. 
These sources are more environmentally "clean" than traditional sources, such 
as coal or nuclear energy. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 The utility industry is developing ways to harden the system all the time. But 
it is less impressed with decentralization. That option involves switching to 
new systems that may not be as reliable as the current grid. Solar energy, for 
instance, cannot be collected at night and must be stored then, requiring 
reliance on highly expensive and bulky batteries. The cost 
</P>
<P>
 For each electrical utility, it might take tens of millions, if not billions, 
of dollars to strengthen and decentralize. Over time, however, the savings from 
natural disasters might be worth it. Reality Check 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale decentralization is unlikely.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; PREPAREDNESS; SEISMOLOGISTS COULD WIRE 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH SENSORS AND SEISMOMETERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and JACK CHEEVERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In preparing for an earthquake, as in the art of war, knowledge of the enemy 
is the key to victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet in Southern California, perhaps the most intensively studied earthquake 
region in the world, scientists readily acknowledge they have only the barest 
inkling of what's going on beneath the grass, rock and asphalt on which the 
region rests.  
</P>
<P>
 What they do know is unsettling: The San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles 
Basin balance on a cobweb of hidden thrust faults, and the surface of Southern 
California is crisscrossed by 42 major faults that mark the fractured 
boundaries between tectonic plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, scientists paid most attention to the faults they could see 
easily at the surface -- such as the infamous San Andreas fault -- but 
earthquake experts are now aware that subterranean faults can be equally 
dangerous, adding an ominous new dimension to the earthquake threat in the Los 
Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 seconds last month, that threat became manifest.  
</P>
<P>
 A single deeply buried fault ruptured between 11 and 12 miles under 
Northridge, slamming the Earth above in a violent uppercut. The energy it 
generated was enough to kill at least 57 people, injure thousands, cripple 
parts of the freeway system and cause an estimated $30 billion damage. The 
forceful shaking from the quake was two to five times what San Francisco 
experienced in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of the dozens of other hidden faults could rupture at any time, with 
just as much damage or more.  
</P>
<P>
 Decades of scare stories about the Big One had done much to prepare Southern 
California for a major earthquake, but -- as the Northridge quake made 
instantly clear -- not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to predict an earthquake -- or even provide some early warning of 
a major shock as it begins -- could revolutionize the region's ability to 
withstand a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists today can no more predict the next earthquake than they can predict 
the winning number on a roulette wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they could afford enough of the new technology now becoming available, 
they might one day dare to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists and geophysicists dream of weaving all of Southern California 
together in an elaborate skein of thousands of motion sensors, seismographs, 
accelerometers and satellite links. Tied together by a high-speed satellite 
cellular network, the instruments could provide crucial early warning of a 
major earthquake and serve as the heart of an automated regional earthquake 
safety system. 
</P>
<P>
 A network of seismographs could be installed along major known faults in 
Southern California, such as the San Andreas fault, and tied into a wireless 
emergency network that would automatically be triggered by the first rumbles of 
a major earthquake seconds before the ground shocks could reach Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists and geologists say such a system could give 20 seconds' or 30 
seconds' warning in the event of a San Andreas earthquake -- long enough to 
automatically shut down critical utility lines, sound school alarms, send 
high-rise elevators to open at the nearest floor, trigger stop lights, warn 
trains and wave off approaching aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 That elaborate sensor system would also start giving scientists the kind of 
continuous detailed information they need about the region's hidden landscape 
of fault scarps and buried fissures.  
</P>
<P>
 One earthquake expert recently spoke wistfully of planting seismographs every 
100 yards throughout Southern California. "Then we'd learn something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More detailed seismic profiles would mean better pictures of the buried faults 
under Southern California. That will help scientists pinpoint the source of 
earthquakes and better understand the stresses that trigger them. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope that once they can fathom the causes of the region's 
earthquakes, they will one day be able to issue earthquake forecasts, like 
tornado warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 They are close. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely two months before the Northridge quake, for example, a geophysicist at 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory warned in the prestigious science journal Nature 
that the strain building up in the Ventura Basin -- 60% greater than that at 
the San Andreas fault -- could result in an earthquake of magnitude of 6.0 or 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no one was able to predict just when that strain would trigger a 
lethal temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to develop a detailed seismic image of the entire Los Angeles Basin could 
cost millions of dollars. No state or federal agency has the money for seismic 
mapping on that scale. Major oil companies that hoard a trove of detailed 
seismic data on the area are reluctant to open their files to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the open desert, fractured faults exposed by erosion are easy to spot, but 
penetrating the mask of urban concrete that hides evidence in the Southland's 
heavily populated centers is almost impossible. Occasionally, geologists can 
gather the necessary city permits to set off a blast that will generate the 
seismic echoes used to map new faults, but the experiments generate an 
avalanche of hate mail and thousands of abusive telephone calls from people 
afraid that the research itself will trigger the next earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the effort to better understand earthquakes is hindered by regional 
factionalism and the federal budget crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven states have a significant earthquake problem, but the hazard 
still is perceived mostly as a California problem. No one has been willing to 
sponsor additional earthquake research utilizing Southern California's local 
seismic hazards as a model for a hazard that could, in principle, just as 
likely strike the Midwest, New England or the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Japan, where the resources devoted to earthquake preparedness dwarf 
those invested in California, the survival of freeways and buildings in a major 
earthquake is considered as much a matter of luck as rigorous preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Tokyo alone spends an estimated $1 billion a year on earthquake 
preparations ranging from mandatory emergency drills to meticulous 
fire-prevention precautions.  
</P>
<P>
 Japan is the only country with a major earthquake-prediction program 
integrated into its emergency disaster-planning program. Among other things, 
Japan has set up an early-warning system in areas where most great quakes 
strike to transmit a warning as soon as the Earth begins to shake. The warning 
is used to safely shut down the country's high-speed rail system before the 
damaging shock waves reach the rails.  
</P>
<P>
 The only emergency seismic warning system in Southern California -- a paging 
system -- is funded privately through Caltech because the U.S. Geological 
Survey (USGS) doesn't have the money to pay for it.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many federal geologists are frustrated by their inability to command 
the kinds of resources necessary to carry out important earthquake research. 
For $100 million - less than the cost of the spy satellites accidentally 
destroyed in a launch mishap at Vandenberg Air Force Base last summer - 
seismologists in Southern California could wire the region from top to bottom 
with the sensors and seismometers necessary to understand the area's earthquake 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The USGS hasn't hired anyone in so long that the average age of survey 
scientists is 51 years old," says one senior survey geologist who specializes 
in earthquake predictions. "We're such a peanut outfit we couldn't afford our 
own paging system." By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and JACK CHEEVERS

 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Give earthquake experts veto power over local zoning decisions and 
construction plans to ensure seismic safety. As part of every zoning request or 
construction proposal, an earthquake engineer would have to certify that a 
proposed building or home incorporates all precautions necessary to ensure they 
can withstand a major earthquake. To make certain that contractors comply, no 
building would be certified for occupancy until independent earthquake 
specialists had inspected the actual construction. To ensure that owners of 
older buildings comply with retrofitting requirements, the earthquake engineers 
would have authority to close a building or bridge if repairs are not 
undertaken in a timely way. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Northridge quake underscored the effectiveness of proper 
engineering when it comes to avoiding damage or injuries. Experts say that 
making a building strong enough to withstand most quakes only adds about 10% to 
its cost. Although earthquake engineers and scientists often serve as 
consultants on major projects or advise local governing bodies on building 
codes, their advice often is ignored. As memory of a major quake fades, so 
usually does the zeal with which earthquake regulations are enforced. 
Short-term or Long-term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term. Enough is known already about earthquake engineering precautions 
that stringent enforcement of existing regulations would dramatically enhance 
safety. Already building codes are being strengthened as a result of the 
Northridge quake. As engineering expertise improves and new techniques are 
developed, however, earthquake experts could ensure they are adopted in new 
buildings and retrofitted to older structures. With sufficient local political 
power, scientists could ensure that quake safety is not sacrificed in the name 
of keeping down costs or encouraging local development. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Rental tenants, office workers, students tend to back the idea. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Many developers and building owners oppose the idea. Governing bodies may be 
reluctant to cede such power to non-elected experts. There also is nothing to 
prevent scientists from being co-opted by real estate interests or the 
construction industry. The Costs

 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Using detailed fault maps and seismic data to strengthen zoning and building 
codes on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. Incorporate neighborhood seismic 
profiles into zoning regulations, so that buildings would be constructed to 
withstand the actual ground shaking a particular block might be expected to 
experience in a major quake. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the most severe earthquake damage experienced in Southern California 
during a major temblor could be prevented, or at least alleviated, by requiring 
stringent engineering precautions be taken in areas most prone to earthquake 
damage. Short-term or Long-term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Short term. The U.S. Geological Survey is already considering updating its 
seismic hazard maps, but detailed block-by-block risk assessments are not yet 
possible. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Many local building codes already require engineering measures designed to 
minimize earthquake damage, but earthquake experts say that many of the 
regulations are laxly enforced. The state's 20-year-old Alquist-Priolo Act, for 
example, bans construction within 50 feet of active faults, but it is left 
largely to localities to enforce. It is now evident, based on such recent 
quakes as Landers, Loma Prieta, Whittier Narrows and Northridge, that faults 
are zones, sometimes a half mile wide, rather than lines, and that shaking 
intensities can affect areas very far from the faults. So, Alquist-Priolo is at 
least out of date and should be strengthened. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 There probably is not the political willpower to carve out large areas and 
rule out building there, even if scientists knew enough to do so. To accurately 
profile seismic risks at the neighborhood level would require more precision 
and understanding of the region than seismologists and geologists today can 
command. Nearly every big quake of recent years has come on a fault that had 
not been identified before, usually a thrust fault that cannot readily be seen 
on the surface. The Los Angeles Basin has dozens of such faults.

 Any effort to assign an earthquake risk to specific neighborhoods is likely to 
have a profound impact on housing values. The Costs

 Automatic shut-off valves would be required on all gas meters and home

in the 1987 Whittier quake, about 20,000 households had their gas cut off by 
such devices. In Japan such devices are mandatory Benefits

</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Gas Co. does not recommend such devices because they 
often switch off the gas when there is no leak. Restoring customers' power then 
takes much longer because utility crews must check every house and every gas 
appliance for real leaks. Of the 150,000 customers who were without service 
after the Northridge quake, only about 10% were actual pipeline breaks. Most 
had turned off the gas as a precaution. The Costs

 Earthquake experts and seismologists say that with $100 million they could 
wire Southern California into a comprehensive early warning and damage 
reporting system which could give precious seconds of warning of a major quake. 
The sensors could help emergency workers determine where damage was worst and 
help scientists better understand the forces that produce severe temblors. THE 
EARLY ALERT SYSTEM 
</P>
<P>
 A network of seismographs could be installed along major known faults in 
Southern California and tied into a wireless emergency network. The network 
would automatically be triggered by the first rumbles of a major earthquake 
seconds before the ground shocks could reach Los Angeles. Seismologists and 
geologists say such a system could give between 20 seconds and 30 seconds of 
warning in the event of a San Andreas Fault earthquake -- long enough to 
automatically: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shut down critical utility lines 
</P>
<P>
 * Alert reservoir workers 
</P>
<P>
 * Sound school alarms 
</P>
<P>
 * Send high-rise elevators to open at the nearest floor 
</P>
<P>
 * Trigger stop lights 
</P>
<P>
 * Warn trains 
</P>
<P>
 * Wave off approaching aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check: Such a system already exists in Japan, where it has been in use 
for more than a decade to shut down that country's high-speed bullet trains 
safely at the first sign of a major quake. Seismologists and geophysicists say 
it would take a decade to create an effective early warning system in 
California. HELP FROM SPACE 
</P>
<P>
 Global positioning system links monitoring stations to satellites, allowing 
scientists to measure the movements of the Earth's crust over long distances 
with unprecedented precision. The GPS system gives them the opportunity to 
analyze the stresses and strains building up along fault lines in enough detail 
to better understand where major earthquakes might be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check: There are already 10 GPS stations in Southern California 
continuously monitoring crustal motion. Geologists say they need a minimum of 
50 permanent ground receivers. INSTANT DAMAGE REPORTS 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive earthquake monitoring devices would measure the strength of the 
actual local ground motion from an earthquake. Tied together by radio 
telemetry, they would help emergency workers instantly pinpoint the areas of 
most severe damage while providing scientists the precise data they need to 
better diagnose the long-term vulnerability of specific neighborhoods to 
earthquake tremors. Engineers could use the data to strengthen local building 
codes and zoning ordinances. Sensitive earthquake monitoring devices would be 
installed on every major: 
</P>
<P>
 * Highway overpass 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospital 
</P>
<P>
 * Dam 
</P>
<P>
 * Pipeline 
</P>
<P>
 * Factory 
</P>
<P>
 * High-rise building 
</P>
<P>
 Reality check: Los Angeles already has 175 strong motion sensors, installed 
since 1972 by the Division of Mining and Geology. There are about 600 in the 
state. But many of the instruments are antiquated and geologists would need 
thousands more. EARLY ALERT SYSTEM SEQUENCE 
</P>
<P>
 1. As a quake begins, low intensity waves travel out from the epicenter at 
about 4 miles a second. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The earthquake's first wave triggers a seismic alarm system placed along 
the fault. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The fault seam continues to "unzip" as the quake ruptures the fault zone at 
about 2 miles a second and generates powerful but slower shock waves. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Alarm instantly transmits warning to computer at a central emergency 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Emergency computer system automatically sounds area alarms and shuts down 
critical utility systems.

 How it works 
</P>
<P>
 An independent, regional journalism review-press monitor is created to assess 
and critique the news media's role in the health of the region's civic culture. 
A group of residents will produce a monthly or quarterly critique of the print, 
broadcast and alternative media's coverage of civic and community affairs in 
Southern California. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 The news media play, or ought to play, an integral role in every aspect of 
regional problem-solving. How the media cover community affairs, the workings 
of state, local and regional government, as well as community, civic and public 
interest groups and nonprofit organizations is key to the success or failure of 
efforts to improve life in Southern California. The publication and the 
organization will critique such coverage, stimulate debate on the role of the 
news media, and thus encourage public media literacy. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 An array of community and business leaders, activists, gadflies, and 
journalists interested in seeing greater responsibility by the organizations 
that hold the rest of society accountable. Opposition 
</P>
<P>
 The uninterested. If Southern Californians wanted serious coverage of state 
government, television stations would have Sacramento bureaus. And how many 
journalists care what outsiders, even informed outsiders, say about their work? 
Opposition can also be expected from news media outlets and vested interests 
whose sacred cows get gored. And ideological biases and hidden agendas of the 
board's members could undermine respect for the undertaking. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Publication would have nominal subscription and cover price. Funding would be 
sought from various sources, and there could be links to colleges and 
universities. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 50%. No-strings funding may prove difficult to find. People are more 
interested in what's on "Nick at Night." Maybe.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The myth of the West is of a frontier pounded into submission by rugged 
individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Californians, according to more modern mythology, are the nation's 
social tumbleweeds, stampeded west by a solipsistic lust for wealth and fame 
and a loathing of the claustrophobia of small-town America. 
</P>
<P>
 Both myths are truthful in part. ATMs, freeways, drive-throughs and drive-bys 
all attest to many Angelenos' fidgety aversion to direct human contact. 
</P>
<P>
 But individuals here have never been entirely autonomous. Cults are as 
Californian as the car culture, for instance. And by the 1992 riot, it was all 
the rage for people to band into aggrieved interest groups. The "African 
American community" and "Korean American community" soon found themselves 
elbowed by the "surfer community" and the "tattooed community." Balkanized 
became the region's latest defining cliche.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 4:31 one morning, Southern California's alarm clocks went off in 
unison, so to speak. Now a lot of people want to hang onto the feeling of 
connectedness that came with instant membership in the community of quake 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of reasons to think that's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "All over America, people are in deep doubt about the culture of the 
individual," says social theorist Michael Lerner, whose writings have shaped 
the Clinton Administration's "politics of meaning" spiel. "The healthy human 
being is the one who can recognize his or her need for other human beings, our 
mutual dependency." 
</P>
<P>
 Columnist George Will has observed in America "a yearning for the community 
feeling that comes from collective undertakings. . . . The question is whether 
any enterprise other than war can tap that yearning." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California may have provided an answer on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be silly to tell Sweet Alice Harris of Watts, the folks at All Saints 
Episcopal in Pasadena, or other Californians who -- myths be damned -- have 
long cherished their connectedness, that this thing so facilely called 
"community" is a hip new trend. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days institutions from the Catholic Church to author Amitai 
Etzioni's "communitarian" movement are rethinking and experimenting with the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional community and the extended family began to erode with the 
industrial revolution as factories and offices lured people who had once worked 
side by side on the farm or in the home, says futurist Alvin Toffler. As the 
power of family and community diminished, their traditional functions, from 
child care to health care for the elderly, gravitated to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Toffler has hope that the emerging interactive media and access to the 
information highway will reverse the work of two centuries, allowing parents to 
work at home again and making it possible for so-called bedroom "communities" 
to become more neighborly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most cohesive community, though, can send repercussions through the 
region that surrounds it. When well-meaning people in the Valley organize to 
oppose a light rail project through their turf, they might also consider the 
stunningly low lung capacity of children in such communities as Compton, Boyle 
Heights and Hancock Park and acknowledge that automobile emissions are the 
likely cause. Urban life is an intricate web of rights and responsibilities 
between rich and homeless, Vietnamese and Armenian, supplier and demander. . . 
. Unless the us-and-them boundaries of community break down, riots will remain 
as inevitable as earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In heaps of broken china, though, is hope. True community, argues Lois Arkin, 
who is helping to create an "eco-village" in the central city, makes people 
question their priorities at a fundamental level -- makes them notice, she 
says, the distinction between "standard of living" and "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The first term, Arkin says, "has to do with your relationship to your material 
level of comfort, goodies. . . . Quality of life has to do with your 
relationship to people and to the environment. . . . When people think about 
community, they think about how we care for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Arkin adds, the burden on government drops in direct relation to that 
caring. 
</P>
<P>
 Building community isn't easy though. It's not all pancake breakfasts and 
uplifting chat with like-minded neighbors. Community also means, it has been 
said, tolerating "bores, boors, and people who smell bad." 
</P>
<P>
 So, how far can we go in foisting community upon individuals already juggling 
demands of work, home and chores and at the same time searching for some sense 
of oasis in an increasingly crowded place? 
</P>
<P>
 The question becomes not how we reconstitute an old-fashioned goldfish bowl of 
a neighborhood but how we define and make a new community in which the spaces 
between people are as important as the places where they choose to gather. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. suggested that America's sense of 
existential loneliness might be cured by the creation of artificial extended 
families. Similar radical steps for building community may now be in order, he 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only Los Angeles but most American cities," he says, "should be thinking 
now of what they ought to have been instead of what they allowed themselves to 
become." BOB SIPCHEN and CARLA HALL

 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Local communities would tap into the information highway. Neighborhoods would 
have 24-hour individual and community access to an on-line computer bulletin 
board.During emergencies, the board could put people in immediate contact; the 
phone lines remained largely intact after the Northridge quake, and emergency 
power sources for computers are likely to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Public Electronic Network (PEN), a sort of digital town hall 
meeting, receives about 7,000 calls each month from residents. Ojai has a 
similar project in place and Simi Valley and Moorpark have on-line access to 
city government. Short-term or Long-term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Both. Easy to get started; yields long-term benefits. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Some community activists say it would give neighbors immediate access to 
information and would help bring people together. Neighbors could overcome the 
shyness and fear that inhibit face-to-face meetings. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say it has the potential to further diminish direct human contact and 
might exclude non-computer owners and the technologically incompetent, 
exacerbating class disparities. Also, the medium could be abused by community 
creeps. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 A used computer with modem is cheaper than a 19-inch television. Expertise in 
hookup and use could easily be supplied by locals; every neighborhood has a 
computer "nerd" or two. A community center could also offer free access to 
computers. The software could be part of neighborhood association dues. 
Taxpayers might have to shoulder a subsidy to help offset on-line costs. Local 
businesses could be tapped for contributions. Reality Check 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely. It can happen here.

 HOW IT WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood-oriented communities would catalyze around innovative community 
centers, possibly on school grounds. Community councils, with bona fide powers 
to resolve local planning issues and liaisons with city government, would 
blossom at these sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A library with computer learning centers, lectures, concerts and plays would 
be the centerpiece of each. The landscaped grounds would include a park and 
other small-scale recreational facilities. A police substation and day-care 
center would be included at most sites, and other social service providers 
might also set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As public-private ventures, the centers would also include what author Ray 
Oldenburg has termed "great good places" -- a coffee shop, tavern or similar 
such establishment to which people naturally gravitate for conversation and 
conviviality. BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 The councils would draw residents together to hash out all variety of local 
concerns, from zoning ordinances to ugly lawn ornaments. the common grounds 
would enhance community, and strong community helps to solve an array of 
problems spawned by societal detachment, from ethnic conflict to the 
rootlessness that encourages short-term pollution. SHORT-OR LONG-TERM IMPACT 
</P>
<P>
 Long term. The idea is hardly new, but the ways in which people are thinking 
about it have evolved and grown more comprehensive as people have come to long 
more for a sense of "belonging." SUPPORTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Decentralized problem solving is often effective, supporters believe. 
Residents get to know each other, Libraries increase literacy and information 
sharing. Substations give real meaning to "community based policing." If there 
aren't enough police, the local patrol agency could move in. Cynicism and 
despair diminish. Neighborhood pride flourishes. OPPONENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say a previously quiet corner of a neighborhood may become more active 
-- i.e. nosier. Some local business may see the center as a threat. THE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 A fee might be required for some services: video rentals, admission to 
lectures, day care. As private-public cooperative efforts, the centers would 
grow, in most cases, on existing city property. Capital improvements could be 
shared by local corporations in exchange for access to community resources or 
other considerations, and a half of 1% local property tax might be levied. 
Sister-center pacts would be encouraged. REALITY CHECK

 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of town hall meetings, citizens appoint a 20-member 
anti-crime commission, to devise innovative ideas for reducing violent crime in 
the region by 65%, by 2004. These could include: 
</P>
<P>
 * With matching funds from local businesses, police and sheriff's departments 
offer significant pay incentives to officers to live within the areas they 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Departments recruit men and women 35 to 45 from other lines of work for 
mid-career switches to law enforcement tours of duty. Older officers, according 
to some studies, are less volatile and better at "problem-oriented" policing. 
</P>
<P>
 * College students interested in law enforcement careers get job-application 
points for spending a semester teaching children in the public schools, 
especially in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers identify disadvantaged 10-to-12-year-old children most at risk for 
involvement in criminally oriented street gangs. Community-backed network 
offers them a 10-year diversion into outdoor adventure activities usually 
available only to the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 CYA and youth camps become centers of technological training. Wards receive 
good time and other incentives to learn skills in the budding information 
culture. Benefits

 Residents who are concerned about crime and believe traditional measures now 
being implemented are only part of the solution. Opponents 
</P>
<P>

responsibility, and liberals who think crime could be reduced if government 
would generate more jobs. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 High. But not as high as the cost of crime. REALITY CHECK

 How It Works: Immigrants regardless of legal status would be eligible for a 
kind of work-amnesty based on proficiency in English language usage (for 
everyday living -- not the kind of memorization-of-Bill-of-Rights required for 
citizenship tests), public service, employment record and length of stay. 
Citizenship applicants become eligible for such publicly funded services as 
admission to public colleges and universities and eligibility for Medi-Cal and 
welfare. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 It would resolve the status of illegal immigrants and reward good residents 
with social services, the right to vote and schooling. It would encourage 
assimilation and stability in a population inclined to move fluidly between the 
United States and Mexico, especially at a time when halting illegal immigration 
has taken on political importance. It would penalize transient population and 
require volunteer work in a government or charitable project. Short-Term or 
Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 A five-year pilot program. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 It would set standards while providing opportunities for advancement and 
establish a common reference and shared stake in the community, proponents say. 
It would reduce the number of people isolated on the fringes, both 
linguistically and culturally. It could be harsh for many who are here only to 
work. It would require a change of allegiance and might encourage more to enter 
the United States illegally. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Schools, employers and some local governments might oppose it. Some 
conservatives could approve language requirements and conditional social 
services. Conservatives may oppose large numbers of new citizens, especially 
those who broke the law to enter the United States. Liberals may dislike it 
because of the same requirements. Initial opposition from voters is likely. The 
Costs 
</P>
<P>
 To consumers, not specific. Taxpayers would pay for program administration. It 
would appear to penalize those who immigrated legally. Formation of a new, 
hidden immigrant population is possible for those who do not want to be 
citizens. REALITY CHECK 
</P>

 Very iffy. Could require lengthy federal action. Maybe.

 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Southland bankers and other lenders should rethink how they finance small 
businesses. Also, local government should boost efforts to encourage 
entrepreneurship. For the banks, a key step would be to change small-business 
lending policies that now are dependent on the use of real estate as 
collateral. Because of the Southland's depressed real estate market, many small 
businesses no longer have the option of using property as collateral. That 
requires more creative lending rules on the part of banks. For government, 
economic development officials should support "networking" programs to link 
people who have small-business ideas, such as former aerospace workers, with 
investors who have money and knowledge to inject into new businesses. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Small- and medium-sized businesses create most of the jobs in the economy, 
nationally and locally. By giving those businesses greater access to capital 
dramatically improves the potential for job growth in the Southland. Short- or 
long-term impact? 
</P>
<P>
 It would take several years to see benefits. Supporters: 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America, for one, says it has successfully de-emphasized real 
estate-based lending for its small business customers, allowing many borrowers 
to qualify for loans based on other criteria. Federal bank regulators also have 
urged banks to accommodate struggling small-business borrowers, especially in 
the wake of the recent earthquake. Meanwhile, proponents of entrepreneurial 
networking programs say that government, private or university-sponsored 
initiatives can provide the bridge to success that many small-business people 
are searching for. USC is currently developing a program, called L.A. Venture 
Network, to link entrepreneurs with investors. Some experts say the most 
effective approach could be local government-sponsored "fairs" that invite 
entrepreneurs and potential financiers (such as retired executives) to meet. 
Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller banks worry that by loosening lending standards, especially for 
high-risk small-business loans, they will run afoul of government regulators 
and boost their risk of loss. Also, bank critics say lenders who loosen some 
collateral rules may simply tighten other aspects of loan qualification. 
Meanwhile, increased opportunities for networking among entrepreneurs and 
financiers also creates increased opportunities for swindlers and fast-buck 
artists. The costs 
</P>
<P>
 For local government and universities, there would be a cost in staff time and 
use of facilities to promote more entrepreneur-financier links. For banks, 
higher-than-expected loan losses from any expansion of small-business lending 
could ultimately raise borrowing costs for other businesses and for consumers. 
REALITY METER 
</P>
<P>
 Strong likelihood. Market forces are already changing banks' approach. And 
networking has great potential, though more facilitation by local government 
and by universities would help.

BUSINESS-FRIENDLY.

<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Make permanent the recent one-stop shopping efforts to slash red tape for 
earthquake rebuilding. Also, the state's push to streamline permitting 
procedures for business are pushed harder at the local level.Bureaucracies 
would be made "business friendly" through meetings that sensitize government 
employees to the cost pressures and regulatory burden on local manufacturers. 
Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders say companies have been fleeing Los Angeles because of 
excessive regulations and bureaucratic red tape. Manufacturing has been 
especially damaged and high-wage industrial jobs traditionally have given 
unskilled workers an entry point into the economy and chances for upward 
mobility. Manufacturing strengthens the local economy by stimulating service 
firms such as finance, insurance and transportation. Short-Term or Long-Term 
Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't do much in the short term but can yield results later. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Such a strategy is critical to restore the state "business climate," which has 
led to companies fleeing to more attractive locales, supporters say. They note 
that state officials last year approved a set of business incentives, which may 
already be improving the climate. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Such local policies are not sufficient to erase the worst minuses for Los 
Angeles, such as crime and high costs, critics say. Any backsliding on 
enforcement of environmental regulations creates new problems, they argue. 
Laissez-faire advocates oppose any such programs that get in the way of the 
open market. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, saving time and bureaucracy could eventually save money; enhancing 
the business climate might result in lower business taxes, which would drain 
public revenues. But more economic growth would help offset this. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 In the realm of possibility. But coordinating local and regional 
bureaucracies, much less getting them behind a bona fide campaign, won't be 
easy, especially if the economy picks up a bit.BUSINESS

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE ECONOMY; IDEA FILE: THE BIG EXPORT 
PUSH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Government aids would-be exporters through a combination of information, 
technical assistance and financial support. Public-private efforts to enhance 
the transportation infrastructure, such as the proposed Alameda Corridor, 
should proceed. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 Exports are considered a major area of future growth for the local and 
national economies and create jobs by drawing money from overseas. Short-Term 
or Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Some export financing already exists through the government, such as the 
state's Export Finance office. But experts believe that perhaps 75% of 
potential exporters aren't even aware of opportunities. Already, international 
trade -- imports and exports -- helps support some 800,000 jobs in Southern 
California, estimates Richard Davis of the California Trade and Commerce 
Agency. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Most international economists and entrepreneurs embrace such a priority. They 
argue it is essential to promote Southern California's position as a trade 
center, especially with nations in the Pacific and Asia. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians and business executives argue that export aid wastes 
government money, because Southern California exports are growing in response 
to market forces. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 The state already spends about $3 million annually on export-financing 
guarantees, information, marketing services and overseas trade promotion. 
Modest cost increases could focus on spreading information and know-how. The 
private sector would bear costs through such proposals as the Alameda Corridor 
-- a $1.8-billion rail and truck route between downtown Los Angeles and the 
Port of Los Angeles, to be partly financed by per-train user fees. REALITY 
CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Very good chances. Many government officials and entrepreneurs are 
enthusiastic about exports as a growth area.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE ECONOMY; A GLIMPSE AT THE CORNER 
STORE OF THE FUTURE

<P>
 The economy of tomorrow may include Jetsons-like offices and factories. Or it 
may look something like the scene today at a nearby Kinko's Copy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, the future may be jammed between the nail salon and the taqueria 
with the ka-whump, ka-whump of hard-working copy machines in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Once known primarily for an ability to turn out a quick, clean photocopy, the 
more than 650 Kinko's outlets are steadily metamorphosing into something 
futurists say we'll see a lot more of in Southern California in the years 
ahead: one-stop shops for telecommuters, videocommuters and small businesses 
with limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Betting that the future may be a growth industry, Kinko's recently launched an 
advertising campaign touting itself as "Your Branch Office 24 Hours a Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kinko's is in a tremendous position to help telecommuters because we do offer 
everything you're used to having in your office, but at a neighborhood site," 
said Tammy Gentry, spokeswoman for the Ventura-based privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 You can still walk into a Kinko's and make a single copy of your resume 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kinko's also rents out desks and computers in its desktop publishing area, 
rents out private conference rooms, offers free local phone calls, and provides 
a variety of reproduction and mailing services. Many of the outlets will store 
a company's blueprints and spec books so that subcontractors can get their own 
copies. You don't even have to supply your own coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can arrange to be billed monthly for the services they use, Gentry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's currently stops short of being a full-time teleconferencing center 
where workers from various companies camp out at desks for weeks or months at a 
time. But Gentry did not rule out that possibility in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wrinkle is videoconferencing, which Kinko's recently began rolling 
out nationwide in conjunction with Sprint and PictureTel Corp. Kinko's 
initially will feature PictureTel room video systems for multi-person 
conferences and next year plans to add PCs that allow computer users to see 
each other and work on shared files. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not cheap: The videoconferencing service costs $150 per hour after the 
$20-per-hour introductory price wears off. Kinko's also envisions other data 
communications services, Gentry said. NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE ECONOMY; RESIDENTS WHO FLINCHED AT 
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT DURING BOOM TIMES WILL HAVE TO WEIGH THEIR VIEWS ANEW.

<P>
 It wasn't so long ago that Southern Californians took their economy for 
granted. Sure, it was young and a little wild -- but it performed the most 
amazing feats. 
</P>
<P>
 Who thought the mid-life crisis would hit so soon? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to do an agonizing rethinking," declares Larry Kimbell, director of 
economic forecasting at UCLA. "What are the trade-offs, and where do they lie?" 
</P>
<P>
 The climate that created prosperity wasn't just 72-degree sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rough-and-tumble landscape peopled by deal-making, hustling 
individualists. They thrived in exquisite independence, aloof to each other and 
unbridled by bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the rules are going to change, because of forces bigger than any natural 
disaster. A bonafide economic rebirth, creating wealth and opportunity for 
millions of Californians, will require interdependence, a radical credo for the 
nation's most fragmented society. 
</P>
<P>
 Recovery alone -- and the date is uncertain -- will not mean economic 
salvation, most economists believe.  
</P>
<P>
 That is a troubling, new state of affairs. Jobs will continue to be scarce and 
lenders wary. It will take years for property values to regain their past 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers may continue to eye locations to the north or out of state. Disaster 
news doesn't help.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the ingredients of renewal -- ideas, energy, people and investment dollars 
-- are here right now, and they are bountiful. The trick is stirring them 
together in creative new ways, a trick that will mean tough, new choices for 
residents, business people and public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders who wish for a revitalized, more unified city may have to 
donate their own time and effort to neighborhoods, working with schools, 
clinics, anti-crime programs, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Californians might learn lessons from newer immigrant communities if 
they can blend together more successfully. The Korean kye and Chinese hui are 
communal credit schemes that free up cash for fledgling enterprises, the sort 
that displaced aerospace employees might dream of launching. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who flinched at growth and development during boom times will have 
to weigh their views anew in an era of stubborn unemployment and chronic fiscal 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of environmental regulation may consider how ill-conceived rules, 
red-tape snafus and insensitive bureaucracies can chase out new investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering over all of these issues is the confusing matter of government's role 
in the economy. Neither knee-jerk dismissals of government nor naive faith in 
the bureaucracy will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, hard-pressed local governments are wooing employers with special tax 
deals and other incentives. Yet these measures can anger existing employers 
and, ultimately, are of questionable value, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Even enterprise zones, touted as a way to revitalize the inner city through 
financial incentives for employers, have a mixed track record. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, a public-private consortium, fueled with federal funds, has 
taken the lead in promoting an electric car industry -- an uncertain if 
commendable quest. Experimental public-sector efforts to finance new 
technologies and provide technical assistance all will be on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's time for soul-searching. But the exercise should neither ignore 
Southern California's strengths nor fail to recognize the many promising 
efforts already under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrant population, however controversial and costly for now, is also a 
source of energy and enterprise. The manufacturing base, while embattled, still 
employs almost 18% of Los Angeles County workers, a bigger share than in the 
state or nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's role as a key hub in the global economy must surely expand. Even 
the much-maligned business climate has improved a bit, due to recent tax 
incentives, changes in workers compensation and other efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what tomorrow's great new industry will be. But if it has 
anything to do with entertainment, technology or information, Angelenos will be 
at the forefront, exploiting talent and know-how in their own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, amid a numbing barrage of negative news about the city, 
an economic development official was marveling at renewed interest in Los 
Angeles by more than 20 potential employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just sitting around and saying, 'Holy mackerel. What's going on 
here?' " recalls Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County 
Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense suggests that whatever inherent appeal attracted those employers 
to Los Angeles will last longer than today's earthquake woes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also suggests the days of rugged individualism are gone forever.

 What will the economy of the future look like? No one can predict exactly how 
economic growth patterns will evolve. But, based on past and current trends, 
it's possible to project which jobs will grow -- or shrink in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * The geography of the economy will be as uneven tomorrow as it is today. A 
coming boom in multimedia and interactive technology, for instance, could 
benefit the Hollywood area and the San Fernando Valley. Continued growth in 
biotech industries could further help the Valley prosper. Development in the 
Alameda corridor would spur light manufacturing along its route. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industries such as entertainment and tourism, which are powerhouses now, 
stand to become more powerful. Others, such as those dependent on defense 
spending and commercial construction, may continue to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Futurist Alvin Toffler believes that many new companies will spring up to 
help workers do their jobs away from their main office. And he says the 
region's airports -- and the businesses surrounding them -- should thrive as 
miniaturization of products and new, lightweight manufacturing materials give 
an advantage to air transport over ocean shipping and rail. 
</P>
<P>
 * The North American Free Trade Agreement and growing trade with Asia should 
spur exports of many kinds and create jobs in and around the Port of Los 
Angeles. At the same time, new jobs in some industries -- from medical 
technology to information services -- will be more evenly dispersed throughout 
the region.

 How It Works: The entertainment industry, and local government- and 
university-directed economic initiatives, should focus on creating and 
retaining the entertainment jobs of the future, especially in the areas of 
multimedia, digitalization (CD/ROM) and "access lanes" to the information 
superhighway, such as on-line services. Local government should promote Los 
Angeles as the creative and technological heart of the information revolution, 
and emphasis on new-business development should target emerging technologies -- 
not just faster permitting for film shoots. Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of spectacular new technology is changing the way movies and TV 
programs are made. One danger is that Silicon Valley, with its technological 
base, will siphon away Los Angeles's power as the entertainment industry's 
creative center, because so much more of the product will be created, or 
enhanced, with computers. Any erosion of the entertainment job base in L.A. 
would strike another blow to the local economy. Short-Term or Long-Term Impact? 
</P>
<P>
 Can have both. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Many argue that by encouraging Los Angeles' role as the center of the 
information revolution -- not just traditional movie-making -- local government 
would provide a beacon for the industry and a strong message to the rest of the 
country. A multimedia "zone," say in Burbank, could encourage start-ups in 
emerging technologies and provide a testing platform and clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, expansion of university programs that emphasize new media technologies 
would provide the labor pool that studios and support businesses will need to 
create the product and control the flow of the information highway. USC Film 
School Dean Elizabeth Daley, for example, says USC is eager to train students 
-- including technically oriented, non-traditional students -- in new-media 
applications. "Where we need help is to know that there are jobs for them on 
the other end," Daley says. That will require closer relations among the 
universities, the studios and the new technology providers. Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say emphasis on emerging information technologies by the studios could 
hasten the shrinkage of the traditional Hollywood labor base. A simple example: 
If a computer can create a "crowd" in a movie background, real extras may not 
be needed. But fighting technology has usually proved a losing battle. The 
Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Potential new incubator complexes to encourage developing technologies 
(interactive software, for example) could be set up in existing vacant 
industrial space. Cost to government would vary depending on how ambitious the 
plan is. In San Jose, the city seeded a Center for Software Development in 1992 
for $350,000. The center, which allows software developers to test their 
products, now operates on a not-for-profit basis. An intangible cost: New 
technologies could weaken the power of Hollywood trade unions by changing the 
nature of how movies are made. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Could go either way. Resistance on the part of some studios and other 
Hollywood elements to the technology revolution probably won't die easy. Also, 
Silicon Valley has an edge in keeping and breeding technology-oriented jobs.

BUSINESS-NEIGHBORHOODS PARTNERSHIPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, large and small, should establish much stronger ties with 
neighborhoods in which they're located. Grass-roots hands-on links would be 
stressed, not simple check-writing to schools or umbrella charitable 
organizations. Neighborhood groups, in turn, should pursue accommodative 
policies toward businesses rather than antagonistic, anti-growth policies. 
Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 In many parts of Los Angeles, common complaints are the lack of community and 
perceived lack of involvement by residents and business, which lead to 
alienation or indifference on both sides. Reinvigorated business/neighborhood 
partnerships could halt the trend, improving the quality of life and ultimately 
protecting neighborhood jobs. Short-Term or Long-Term Impact 
</P>
<P>
 Impact can be immediate and long-lasting. Supporters 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities say they have come to realize that they are only as strong as 
their individual neighborhoods. Glendale's neighborhood services department, 
for example, in December designated a full-time employee to work on building 
better ties between local businesses and residents. In particular, many 
community activists believe greater business participation in local public 
schools, modeled after Los Angeles' Adopt-A-School Program, could stop the 
growing feeling of abandonment on the part of public school children and 
teachers. Likewise, business involvement or sponsorship in local health 
clinics, recreation centers, clean-up brigades, churches and other local groups 
can cement neighborhood ties -- and bring the businesses new customers. 
Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Recession-stressed business owners may not see enough potential benefit in 
raising their community involvement, especially if relatively few other 
businesses join in. Also, some political leaders and community groups may see 
offers of help as veiled attempts to sell products. And some residents may fear 
that encouraging businesses growth will increase neighborhood traffic and 
pollution. The Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts encourage businesses to think in terms of low-cost neighborhood 
sponsorship ideas, which may be as simple as providing small grants to schools 
for needed supplies. Sponsoring graffiti-removal squads also can be low cost. 
For neighborhood groups, the cost of such alliances is usually volunteer time. 
For city government, the cost is in staff time devoted to linking business and 
neighborhood groups. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 50-50. Distrust between businesses and neighborhood groups could be tough to 
surmount in some areas, and the general stress of running a business in a weak 
economy may prohibit many well-meaning business owners from getting more 
heavily involved in their communities.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; "IT'S A WONDERFUL 
OPPORTUNITY. . .TO PICK UP ON THE THINGS IN THE CRISIS THAT WORKED."

<P>
 After our institutions have been strained to the breaking point by the riots, 
the fires and now the earthquake, maybe it's time to wipe the slate clean and 
start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pain of this last trauma slowly receding, now could be the occasion 
to examine every one of our battered governmental entities, throw out the 
useless ones, keep those that work -- and invent entirely new mechanisms 
capable of meeting the challenges of the soon-to-arrive 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Southland government hasn't worked since the deadly morning of 
Jan. 17. In Los Angeles and Santa Monica -- the cities hit hardest -- cops, 
firefighters and other emergency personnel moved quickly into action. Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief Willie Williams and other city 
officials effectively grabbed hold of a government long criticized as creaky 
and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But futurists, academicians and even a few politicians see in the 
post-earthquake period, with its unprecedented demands on local government, an 
opportunity to begin to plan a structure capable of meeting the demands of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a wonderful opportunity for the people . . . to really pick up 
on the things in the crisis that worked and that didn't work," said Xandra 
Kayden, a visiting scholar for the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Colleges and a leader in a new drive to modernize Los Angeles city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afflicted areas, weaknesses in the present government structure can be 
seen as readily as the quake damage itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the subdivisions nestled in the canyons not far from the 
shattered freeways of the northern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved construction of large 
numbers of single- and multiple-family dwellings. Favoring growth, the 
supervisors said their job was to provide housing and employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including residents of the area, objected that too many homes were 
being packed into a limited amount of land, and that the thousands of new 
residents would overtax the capacity of once-rural roads and of schools built 
for a smaller population. They said the supervisors were overly influenced by 
lobbyists for campaign-contributing developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, when those subdivisions were opened, the roads quickly became 
packed with commuters bound for the freeways. And when the freeways were 
destroyed by the earthquake, the roads became impassable and the situation 
became impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications futurist Tracy Weston is a USC professor, and, with Robert 
Stern of the California Commission on Campaign Reform, they are, in effect, 
dreaming up a new government for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins with interactive television. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable already brings city councils, as well as Congress and the Legislature, 
into living rooms. With interactive TV, you will be able to tell your views to 
your representatives from your home, instead of traveling to City Hall. When 
California Channel viewers last year were given a chance to call an 800 number 
and express their views to a legislative committee hearing, the response was 
tremendous. Perhaps one day we could have instant recalls of public officials, 
or instant approval of voter initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Political campaigns will be revolutionized. You will be able to call up 
speeches, statements and commercials on your television set from a central 
CD-ROM library, retrieving the essentials of the candidate's position on Santa 
Monica Bay from a long environmental speech. Campaign contributions and 
lobbyists' spending reports would be there at the push of a keyboard button, 
filed on discs, available to your personal computer or interactive TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But there might be few reports to see; campaign spending would be limited by 
law. And anyway, big advertising campaigns in politics would no longer be 
needed in the interactive Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive TV would go hand in hand with another type of people power under 
discussion by activists, from Los Angeles neighborhood preservationist William 
Christopher to liberal state Sen. Tom Hayden: the decentralization of 
government. Community councils would have the power to make local zoning 
decisions and have a say in running neighborhood parks, libraries and, to some 
extent, policing. 
</P>
<P>
 These strong neighborhood councils would work with, and sometimes in 
counterbalance to, mega-governments -- powerful regional bodies, along with 
some existing city and county structures, that would be in charge of the 
big-picture concerns that affect us all: controlling air and water pollution, 
regional land development and transportation, running law enforcement and 
firefighting operations. 
</P>
<P>
 And, brought into the political system by interactive TV, their skills honed 
in neighborhood councils, a new breed of citizen-politician would emerge, a 
grass-roots resident more accomplished at the computer byte than the sound 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the heart of it is individual citizens acting in concert with their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we see working out of the earthquake is a neighborhood 
sense," said Kayden, the visiting scholar. "Neighborhoods are getting more 
cohesive. People are getting to know each other." Bill Boyarsky and Tracey A.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; IDEA FILE: THE TRUST FACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Reviving trust in government. The voter feels little if any 
kinship with the government, let alone any clout.Their good ideas rarely get 
heard beyond the porch swing or the dinner table. Start with the schools, with 
hard-hitting interesting civic classes instead of the boring, bland garbage 
taught today. Bring government into the living rooms and classrooms with 
interactive cable TV, so you can see candidates, watch legislators in action -- 
and tell government what you think immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: It would create a more informed electorate and make government more 
accountable to the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or Long-term Impact? Long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Good-government believers, the disenfranchised, residents who want 
to take part but find it time-consuming and "geographically undesirable" would 
back it. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Those who would argue that it would amount to mob rule and a waste 
of money. Schools and textbook publishers may be reluctant to have interesting, 
provocative civics courses because it might embroil them in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs: Paid for by cable companies under their public access obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 "REALITY CHECK": Televising government sessions is happening all over, from 
C-SPAN to city councils. Interactive TV was successful during the last 
legislative session and will be expanded. It's coming. Thumbs up.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; IDEA FILE: CLEAN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Imposes campaign contribution limits and a spending ceiling. 
Provides matching public funds and bans off-election-year fund raising. 
Requires lobbyists to register and to report income and spending.Computerizes 
all records for easy access by public and press. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Opens up hidden relationships between office holders and special 
interests. Reduces influence of big campaign contributors. Allows the little 
guy to run. The only real headaches it would create are crooks'. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or Long-term Impact?: Long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Those who feel shut out of the process, and who believe this would 
help rid Southland government of the back-room dealings that now dominate many 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Lobbyists and campaign contributors would balk at what they would 
consider undue regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs: Undetermined short-term costs, big long-term savings from cleaner 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Most of these proposals have been around for some time, have 
been extensively studied and have worked elsewhere. Public pressure for them is 
increasing every year and chances of approval are getting better. Hands out of 
the public pocket and thumbs up.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; IDEA FILE: MORE AND/OR 
BETTER TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Raise state taxes to pay for education, freeways, parks and 
libraries. Expand the sales tax to include services like dry cleaning and 
amusement park admissions, while lowering the tax rate. Modify Prop. 13 to 
split the property tax rolls, leaving homeowner assessments alone but using 
current market values to assess taxes on businesses. Right now, businesses and 
homeowners are assessed exactly the same way -- at a base rate of 1% of the 
purchase cost, which can only be increased 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Tax increases would generate billions of dollars in additional 
revenue to maintain and improve schools, parks, libraries and such, bolstering 
the critically important government services that have deteriorated since the 
state's boom days of the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a short-term or long-term idea?: Long-term 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Many advocates for better schools, transportation and health care 
agree that improved services and facilities are worth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Those opposed argue that increased revenues could hinder the drive 
for more efficient government, and hit taxpayers yet again. The so-called split 
roll proposal might keep some businesses from relocating to California because 
they would be taxed at a higher rate than under Prop. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs: Consumers could pay an extra $1 billion to $5 billion a year, 
depending on which services were taxed and how much the existing sales tax rate 
was lowered. Businesses could pay at least an extra $8.5 billion annually. 
County tax assessors would have to beef up their staffs, but the cost would be 
more than offset by the increased revenue. If legal and accounting services 
were taxed, for example, consumers might buy them from companies in other 
states, hurting local businesses. And the tax burden would fall more heavily on 
small businesses than on large corporations with in-house accountants and 
lawyers.  
</P>
<P>
 "REALITY CHECK": Both proposals would require a two-thirds vote of the 
Legislature or the electorate. Previous attempts have failed, but many 
observers say raising taxes is inevitable because the state is in such dire 
need of the money.

 A commonplace project -- expanding a business, or adding a room to a home -- 
runs straight into a web of overlapping government entities that often hinder 
rather than help citizens. Even exercising civic responsibilities such as 
voting can be complicated and time-consuming. Here's how some ordinary 
scenarios of life in Los Angeles could be changed. The hypothetical subjects: a 
couple who owns a small dry cleaning shop. They are concerned about local 
issues and vote faithfully. The hero: technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Expanding Their Dry Cleaning Shop 
</P>
<P>
 NOW they will have to get permits from: 
</P>
<P>
 * South Coast Air Quality Management District 
</P>
<P>
 * State Air Resources Board 
</P>
<P>
 * State Water Quality Control Board 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, two or three new one-stop "superagencies" deal with regional 
issues like building, zoning and air quality. Our couple visits the new 
Enviro-Building Agency, which handles their permit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Hiring Two New Employees for Their Shop 
</P>
<P>
 NOW, they must deal with: 
</P>
<P>
 * State Employment Development Department 
</P>
<P>
 * State Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Social Security Administraton 
</P>
<P>
 * Internal Revenue Service 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, a one-stop Economic Development Department will handle all the 
relevant permits. Or the arrangements can be made from home with a personal 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Adding a Room to Their House and a Fence Around It 
</P>
<P>
 NOW they must consult: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Building and Safety Department 
</P>
<P>
 * City Planning Department 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles County Public Works Department (for flood control permit because 
their house is near a stream) 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, they visit a Neighborhood Council, which has authority over 
local zoning issues and works in concert with a superagency over the issue of 
flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Seeking Tax Relief 
</P>
<P>
 NOW, they must apply to county Tax Assessor and may have to go through 
protracted hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, they file appeals with tax agencies on personal computer-cable 
TV home communications center. Such facilities would also be available at 
public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Participating in the Voting Process 
</P>
<P>
 NOW they watch TV news and innumerable political commercials, pore through 
newspapers and magazines, write letters, drive to distant meetings and then, 
finally, travel to their polling place. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, they can pick relevant information from a central CD-ROM 
library, watch and send opinions to government committees on interactive TV and 
vote from their living room on the same TV or similar interactive device. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Activity: Stopping a Mini-mall from Being Built Nearby 
</P>
<P>
 NOW, they must testify before several city planning bodies, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * City zoning administrator 
</P>
<P>
 * Board of Zoning Appeals 
</P>
<P>
 * City Council 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE FUTURE, they ask the Neighborhood Council, with authority over local 
zoning matters, to kill the project. Hearings are viewed on interactive TV.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; IDEA FILE: HONORING GOOD 
DEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How It Works: Institute a monthly luncheon hosted by the mayor. Invite a dozen 
or 20 people who have given something to the community: someone who has written 
an interesting and workable idea for improving trash service, a long-time 
volunteer at animal shelters, local heroes who have done unsung good deeds.City 
Council members could be vigilant for people in their districts to nominate for 
the honors. This would be a way to express thanks for civic participation and 
thereby encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: It would enrich the city; when civic-mindedness is rewarded, it 
becomes more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-Term or Long-Term Impact?: Both. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Council members would appreciate the chance to reward their 
constituents more tangibly but without big expenditure of public money. 
Charitable and public service groups would be glad to see their volunteers 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Few would be critical. Perhaps those challenging incumbents in 
elections would object to the favors the office-holders can hand out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: Very little. We're not talking caviar here. Maybe the honorees 
would want their picture taken with the mayor, and the city would have to 
validate their parking. The city already has a protocol office that could 
surely handle something like this, including scheduling and invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Piece of cake, with the will to get it up and running.

THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; GOVERNING; IDEA FILE: GRASSROOTS 
GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How it works: Give neighborhoods more power over government while preserving 
the present regional bodies, which worked well during the earthquake. Set up 
neighborhood councils with power over local planning, policing and other 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits: Southland residents feel a strong connection to their communities. 
But by their very nature, big decisions in the huge basin on such important 
matters as transportation and air pollution are made by distant, powerful 
regional bodies. Neighborhood councils would restore people's power over the 
decisions that really matter to them -- policing, libraries, parks, senior 
centers, whether a mall will be built nearby. It would put people in control of 
the services they value most, and pay for. This, for example, is what community 
policing is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term or long-term impact? Long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters: Grassroots and neighborhood groups have been pushing for this for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents: Those opposed can argue that it would fragment government and 
encourage rampant NIMBYism. Politicians don't want to give up power, and 
business interests such as developers woul be reluctant to lose their "in" in 
city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs: There would be little additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "REALITY CHECK": It's a good idea, growing in acceptance around the country 
and locally. An 8 out of 10.

ANGELENOS MUST CREATE WAYS FOR POLITICIANS TO ACT DECISIVELY -- AND THEN BE

<TEXT>
<P>
 If California has long seemed an exaggerated version of America, Los Angeles 
has been California squared. Think of the car culture, suburbanization, even 
the recasting of the melting pot with new ores from Asia and Latin America: 
California has led America and Los Angeles had led California. 
</P>
<P>
 In no respect has this pattern been more powerful than in the denigration of 
the public sphere. America was founded in an effort to escape distant 
government control, and it has never fully shed its suspicion of centralized 
power. Throughout its history, that current has been especially powerful in 
California. With rare exceptions -- the Progressive Era most notably -- 
politics and public life have had a dim presence in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 To most Californians, at most points in the state's history, government has 
seemed moribund, sluggish and irrelevant -- especially when compared with the 
thriving, dynamic private energy that built Hollywood and Silicon Valley and 
extended a manifest destiny of subdivisions and shopping malls to hillsides and 
deserts and valleys. In the wake of such relentless thrust, the common wisdom 
in California commands that the best thing government can do is get out of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Has this been true anywhere more powerfully than in Los Angeles? In cities 
like Chicago, Boston and New York, local government is theater, sport and 
spectacle, the funnel through which all grievances are processed; in Los 
Angeles, most people probably couldn't point a tourist in the direction of City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its history, the Southern California dream has been defined in units 
of one: one driver, in one car, commuting to a single-family home with a yard 
and a pool that made public spaces redundant. In that environment, the role of 
collective decisions -- and collective responsibilities -- recedes to the point 
of erasure. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's natural advantages -- especially a climate that attracted a 
steady stream of settlers and made economic growth appear as dependable as the 
sunshine -- reinforced this tendency to slight the importance of public 
decisions. But, in fact, viewing Los Angeles as the triumph of individualism 
has always been a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anything else, the city is a concrete manifestation of public will 
expressed through government: "an artifact of public works," as Mike Davis, a 
guerrilla local historian, wrote in his acclaimed book "City of Quartz." With 
its fragile foothold in the desert, Los Angeles simply would not exist without 
vast public works -- water projects and freeways -- and vast public spending, 
particularly in the defense budget. On that foundation, California has built a 
sprawling university system that constituted a vast public investment in its 
own future.  
</P>
<P>
 And yet it is the myth of Los Angeles as a product of private imagination that 
defines the city's civic life -- with tangible results. One has been a stunted 
sense of public possibility. In the last two weeks, as commuters have crowded 
the Metrolink and other forms of public transportation, the same conversation 
has been repeated at countless dinner tables across the basin: "Everyone for 
the first time is talking about why don't we have mass transit," said 
screenwriter Gary Ross, president of the Los Angeles Library Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to freeways has forced the city to look to such innovative -- for 
Los Angeles, borderline revolutionary -- ideas as turning major east-west 
surface streets like Pico Boulevard into reversible one-way thoroughfares 
during rush hour. But, as Ross noted, it's not as if people were satisfied with 
the flow of traffic before the freeways buckled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why weren't any of these solutions discussed until there was an earthquake?" 
he wondered. He could just as well have asked why there has been so little 
serious discussion of seismic safety -- or, for that matter, so little 
regulation of development in canyons vulnerable to wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may be insufficient expectation that public actions can alleviate 
problems like these, and thus insufficient pressure on politicians to search 
out and push solutions past the inevitable resistance. It's not that Angelenos 
are fatalistic: it's just that relatively few seem inclined to see elections 
and government as a way of resolving their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a pothole or a problem with trash collection, they may be more 
likely to call their homeowners' association than their city council 
representative. "The first instinct of a Californian or Angeleno is not to look 
to government for a solution to a problem," said Bill Carrick, a Los 
Angeles-based Democratic political consultant who has worked in municipal 
elections around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an environment, it should be no surprise that politics rarely attracts 
innovative thinkers and visionaries. California has produced some smart, 
tenacious politicians like Reps. Henry Waxman, Maxine Waters and former GOP 
Senate candidate Ed Zschau. But the overall quality of the state's political 
leadership is disappointing. Longtime California political activists like Steve 
Merksamer, a top Republican strategist, have often observed that talented young 
Californians overwhelmingly view politics as a dusty road to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As the largest state in the country, California over the past generation has 
not produced its share of national figures. Since Richard Nixon (who was first 
elected to office in 1946), the only Californian who has had a lasting and 
significant impact on the nation's political life is Ronald Reagan, born a 
Midwesterner. And Reagan represented a purified version of the Southern 
California ethos that government is the problem, not the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, in many ways, governments at all levels, from the county to the 
city to Congress, prove Reagan right. But the disasters of the last two years 
that have struck Los Angeles like so many hammer blows teach another lesson: 
There are problems that people and the market, however dynamic, cannot solve 
alone. If individuals cannot by themselves respond to the sudden disaster of an 
earthquake, is that lesson any less relevant for the slow-motion disasters of 
poverty, frayed race relations, freeway congestion or crime? 
</P>
<P>
 In re-imagining Los Angeles, the first step may be nothing more basic than 
saying this: The public sphere matters. That does not necessarily mean that Los 
Angeles needs bigger or more government; it means that Los Angeles needs 
smarter, more imaginative and more ambitious government. 
</P>
<P>
 What should that government look like? Many analysts believe that Los Angeles 
isn't organized to solve its problems. These reformers divide primarily into 
two camps: One looks up, to larger regionwide units, and one down, toward more 
neighborhood control. 
</P>
<P>
 The regionalists argue that because the basin's problems don't respect 
municipal boundaries, it needs more institutions with regional powers, like the 
Air Quality Management District and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we are in a debate that says local control is a good above all 
other, we are never going to get to the point where we realize that freeways, 
for instance, work only if they work in total," said Jane G. Pisano, dean of 
the School of Public Administration at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood advocates say that government is already too distant from 
average people and that regionalism would just worsen that problem. They want 
to break down representation into smaller units, perhaps by doubling or 
tripling the size of the City Council. (Los Angeles City Council members now 
represent 235,000 people, compared to 144,000 in New York City.) Historian Mike 
Davis has put forward a more audacious proposal to create "a new tier of 
elected community or neighborhood government with, at minimum, advisory power 
over local land use, environment, policing and development issues." 
</P>
<P>
 That might help connect residents more closely to government and incubate a 
new generation of local leaders. But political essayist Harold Meyerson worries 
that it might only intensify the parochialism that now asphyxiates city council 
debates; he suggests that Los Angeles emulate cities like Boston and add to the 
City Council members elected citywide, who would thus be compelled to consider 
the concerns of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Others talk about strengthening the mayor's office -- now one of the weakest 
in the country -- or expanding political control over the bureaucracy. Some 
would like to retire another vestige of the Progressive era: the nonpartisan 
nature of local elections that inhibits political organization along party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Might any of these measures help Los Angeles move more purposefully toward 
decisions? Regional government can impose order on unnecessary local chaos; it 
can also be a way to remove decision further from public reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Local control can be democratizing; it can also be a form of secession. In 
thinking through these choices, the guiding principles should be creating 
forums through which Los Angeles' many diverse communities can feel invested in 
the decisions that are made -- but devising mechanisms that demand that 
decisions be made. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be already anachronistic or naive to speak of common interest in Los 
Angeles. Like all American cities, it is truly many cities, with many divergent 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But this earthquake teaches that the city shares at least common 
vulnerabilities. Natural disasters aren't entirely democratic, but in the 
traffic jams clogging the Westside and San Fernando Valley, Ferraris sit as 
helplessly as rusting Chevys. The downturn in Los Angeles' fortunes over the 
last five years, capped by this biblical series of natural disasters, has left 
no one entirely unscathed, psychologically if no other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake has made very clear what the common interest is: common 
survival," said Valerie Lynne Shaw, the administrator of a community 
development corporation in the Crenshaw District. "The atmosphere after the 
earthquake is totally different than the atmosphere after the riot. After the 
riots, everybody was afraid of each other; after the earthquake everybody wants 
to hug each other. The fact is that everybody was scared out of their wits." 
</P>
<P>
 This tenuous -- probably fleeting -- sense of common vulnerability is a point 
from which to build. In truth, the most pressing problems affecting Southern 
California are beyond the capacity of local government to fully address. Even 
the national government, with vastly greater resources, is finding its hands 
full with the trends remaking the region -- from the end of the Cold War to the 
cost and challenge of integrating a large immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Los Angeles, like any other city, cannot solely determine its 
fate, neither is it helpless. No one pretends to have a blueprint for 
rebuilding from earthquake, riot, fire and economic upheaval. But to find one, 
the city may first have to clear the path for public officials to act 
decisively -- and then be more vigilant in holding them accountable if they 
don't.

 If there was a moment when it became clear that Los Angeles had departed one 
era in its history and entered another, it was hour of 4:31 on Jan. 17. The 
earthquake's arrival at that precise moment, of course, was the product of mere 
geological coincidence. Coming at another time, it would have meant little 
beyond the random mayhem of a major tectonic shift. But in choosing that hour 
and day, and in its power to shut down the city, the earthquake punctuated a 
truth that has become increasingly evident: We have seen the closing of a wild 
and wooly epoch in Los Angeles, and we will not see its like for some time to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 You could argue with my selection of the earthquake as the historical marker. 
History is messy and rarely respects clean borders. So the riots of April, 
1992, might also serve. Or, if you want to stretch it, you could make a case 
for Congress' decision to gut the defense budget, setting into motion Southern 
California's economic nose-dive. No matter, really. They all signify the end of 
a heady, 20-year epoch, one in which many of us grew up here and others of us 
grew old. 
</P>
<P>
 What that period represented was Los Angeles' coming-of-age as a city. I came 
here in 1972, several years before it began. In 1972 the typical house in Los 
Angeles sold for a price somewhat below the national average. Below . No one 
had yet conceived of the notion that Southern California real estate contained 
a preciousness far beyond that of Chicago's or Atlanta's. Back then, a classy 
meal in a Los Angeles restaurant meant the steak and the green beans were 
delivered floating in little pools of butter. The butter signified the French 
touch. Melrose Avenue remained a depresssed strip of abandoned plumbing stores. 
Los Angeles was a hard-edged, overgrown town where everyone and everything 
seemed to have hit the dead spot of middle age. How did the next two decades 
manage to so change the city? It remains a partial mystery. Other cities grew 
in the 1970s and '80s, but not like Los Angeles. At times it seemed as if an 
endless line of trucks was arriving at the mountain passes and rolling bags of 
money down into the city. Was the money coming from the feds for all those 
Stealth bombers? Was it drugs? Was it Barry Diller? Who knows. Probably it was 
all of them. Los Angeles went from a bored cowtown to a city that was nervous, 
original, dangerous and fun all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 During the beginning of that period I left the city for three years. When I 
returned I could sense the change. Sometimes you have to leave a place to 
understand its transformation. The city had taken on a style of its own, a 
sense nf occasional grandeur. I had a friend who bought a house early in the 
period and then traded up to a place on Mulholland. She tripled her net worth 
and became insufferable, the first of many like her. Public architecture grew 
brash or whimsical. Disney put up a headquarters whose giant support columns 
were carved in the shape of Sleepy and Sneezy. The grandeur could extend even 
to the city's unique set of natural disasters. Novelist Gore Vidal described 
the style thus: 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles had been on fire for three days. As I took a taxi from the studio 
I asked the driver, "How's the fire doing?" "You mean," said the Hollywoodian, 
"the holocaust." The style, you see, must come as easily and naturally as 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Los Angeles was a comer. Whole streets in the city were reborn 
and the core of Los Angeles began to do what all great cities do: draw crowds. 
You could walk down the major streets of West Hollywood or Santa Monica and 
actually mingle. The phrase "Pacific Rim" emerged and we began to think of Los 
Angeles as its "Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, almost as suddenly as it began, the coming-of-age shut down. Try to 
remember the last time you heard someone refer to the "Pacific Rim." It seems 
to have disappeared sometime around 1990. I am not sure why. Perhaps it went 
underground for the same reason that the city now seems quieter. Or the same 
reason that conversations about real estate stopped providing dinnertime 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, I like the city better now than in the '80s. Easy for me to say, 
I suppose, since I still have a job. Restaurants seem grateful to take my 
business. And perhaps it is my imagination, but the entire city seems to 
operate at a slower pace. The city does not appear to have regressed so much as 
it has paused, stopped in place, as if waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 We should have known that every coming-of-age must end, although they don't 
have to end with an earthquake or the most destructive riot of the latter 20th 
Century. It'sjust that they appear to end that way in Los Angeles. Will we 
learn from our cataclysms and strive to do better as result? I doubt it. We may 
gain some modesty, and in some neighborhoods people actually get to know each 
other after wandering around in the dark streets wearing slippers and 
bathrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles will be Los Angeles. It has never been a city to provide the 
kind of security offered by other places. The very landscape, the fact that we 
live in a land given to cataclysms, dictates that. And for those who understand 
and accept the risks of Los Angeles, there can be some peace. After the 
earthquake, television and the newspapers talked continuously of the "terror" 
felt by citizens. But that word does not describe what happened in my 
neighborhood or, I would guess, in many others. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shaking stopped, we emerged from our houses and talked to each other 
across the hedges. Are you OK? Yes. Are you OK? Yes. We were unsettled, 
spooked, maybe. Not terrified. This was Los Angeles, after all. We knew the 
ground could move underneath us. We knew this thing was coming. We knew. We 
live here.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; COMIC HERO GETS A SUPER RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 23-year-old Crenshaw native is now distributing a second issue illustrated by 
a new partner, has a literary agent and is speaking with show business types 
about developing his comic book into a film or television production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured I would keep pushing, no matter what," said Townsend, a UCLA 
graduate who seems genuinely taken aback by the flurry of attention. "But I 
never expected this." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention enabled Townsend to enlist the help of another artist, Otis 
Parsons School of Design student Rodney Clouden, while he concentrated on 
developing the story line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Steve had a good cause with this comic book, plus I thought it was a hot idea 
artistically," said Clouden, an Inglewood resident. "It took a lot of time, but 
it's been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The series' main character, 19-year-old Anton Peters, is something like 
Townsend: an ordinary man who is inspired to fight crime after his brother, an 
innocent bystander, is killed in gang cross-fire. After the deaths of two 
friends in similar situations, Townsend took up his pen and began shaping his 
hero, "The Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 While the first issue recounts the story of how Anton decides to don a mask 
and battle crime by night, the second delves more deeply into Anton personally 
and shows the context of his life.  
</P>
<P>
 "He starts to think about his goals, about exactly how he's going to go about 
fighting crime and not killing people," Townsend said. "I also take a closer 
look at gang members, drug dealers as real people, not as cardboard cutouts. 
It's a lot to include in 24 pages, but I want to bring in as much realism as 
possible without making it preachy." 
</P>
<P>
 With 2,000 copies of his new issue in hand, Townsend is passing most of them 
on to three national comic book distributors -- Diamond, Capitol City and 
Hero's World -- while he works to get them in local bookstores. The new issue 
is priced at $2, and Townsend expects to have a third issue out by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Levin, a William Morris agent representing Townsend, said "The Hood" is 
an idea whose time has come: "It really resonates with a lot of people these 
days. This is only the beginning of what Steve can create." 
</P>
<P>
 However successful the venture becomes, Townsend doesn't want to continue "The 
Hood" indefinitely. "I don't want to do 300 issues," he said. "I want this to 
be sort of a historical document. People can look back on this one day and say: 
'Wow, this stuff happened in the '80s and '90s, but thank goodness it's not 
happening anymore." ' ERIN J. AUBRY

BACK TO THE BEACHWEAR; CLOTHING: O.C. SURF-WEAR FIRMS ARE POISED TO BENEFIT 
FROM AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the '80s, surf wear practically sold itself to consumers who couldn't get 
enough of the Day-Glo shirts and shorts designed by Southern California 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry wiped out late in the decade, though, as neon colors fell from 
favor on the beach and off. Teens and young adults seeking a new look turned to 
the dark, baggy urban styles inspired by rap and hip-hop groups, adopted by 
skateboarders and broadcast nationwide on MTV. Sun-drenched was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf-wear makers were forced to regroup, and some, including longtime leader 
Ocean Pacific Sunwear Inc. in Tustin, eventually wound up in bankruptcy court. 
National sales of surf apparel and accessories, worth about $1.5 billion 
annually in the late 1980s, sank to $500 million by 1991, industry observers 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beachwear," said Alan G. Millstein, editor of Fashion Network Report in New 
York, "is no longer the fair-haired child of the department store." 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry is positioned this year to catch a ride on an unprecedented 
wave of marketing opportunities. In June, legendary surf filmmaker Bruce Brown 
and New Line Cinema will release "Endless Summer II," a sequel to the 1964 
mother of all surf flicks. There's also talk of a sequel to "Big Wednesday," 
the 1978 surf classic. 
</P>
<P>
 And Disney is considering a movie about the late Dewey Weber, a legendary 
surfer whose remains were scattered on the waves at Redondo Beach in 1992 while 
hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going back and using surfing as vehicle, as a window to a time that 
wasn't so complex," said Weber's ex-wife, Carol. "And in doing that, we found a 
great untapped reservoir of interest. Surfing is something that Hollywood 
thinks is very marketable." 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion industry thinks so, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "America is a sport-driven country, and there's still a romance with this 
sport," said Shaheen Sadeghi, a former executive of surf-wear maker Quiksilver 
in Costa Mesa. "It's got an almost mystical attraction because it's not 
something most of us are exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing will also be getting big play this year on the small screen. Prime 
Ticket plans to televise 11 U.S. surf contests this year, including the U.S. 
Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach in August -- the first world-class surf 
contest on the U.S. mainland in three years. And Coca-Cola has signed a 
multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with the Assn. of Surfing Professionals 
for TV programming to be beamed to viewers in 23 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of surf wear will surely benefit, said Lesa Ukman at IEG Consulting in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like beach volleyball," she said, which was unknown in most of the 
United States until the TV networks started covering it. As its popularity 
soared, so did demand for clothes like those worn by the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on television, Ukman said, "can do great things for lifestyle products." 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the new surf movies should refocus attention on Southern 
California as a playground rather than a recession-torn region pummeled by 
earthquakes, wildfires and floods. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Los Angeles had the riots and fires, the Southern California fashion 
industry inherited the ashes," editor Millstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the most optimistic beach-wear makers expect the surfer look to be 
the rage again. But the manufacturers' group notes that Americans will buy 
approximately 315,000 surfboards, 162,500 snowboards, 450,000 volleyballs and 
467,500 wet suits this year -- and are expected to spend $405 million on 
clothes to wear while using that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiksilver, which is licensed to produce "Endless Summer II" shirts, hats and 
accessories, is among companies that intend to ride the media wave. Standing to 
benefit are those "with the most credible surf images -- Quik, Rusty, 
Billabong, Stussy -- . . . not the surf wanna-bes," said Robert B. McKnight 
Jr., chairman of the company. "This isn't going to help launch fake labels like 
'Surf Fetish,' 'Maui & Sons' and that kind of crap." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparel makers say what they're looking for now is not a fad like Day-Glo but 
a profitable niche under the broad "beach lifestyle" umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in being a trend or fashion driven," said Mark Price, a 
former Gotcha Sportswear vice president who is now an executive at Tavarua 
Island Surf Co. in Laguna Beach. "We want to serve customers who don't change 
the way they dress." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Tavarua is developing a line of casual clothing, including 
T-shirts, hats and sandals, with "a South Pacific look," Price said. Tavarua -- 
the name of a South Pacific island known for spectacular surfing -- will be 
carried by 70 retailers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Pacific, which led the charge in the Day-Glo '80s, is trying to revive 
its apparel lines. The company last year sold its remaining assets through 
bankruptcy court to a Bay Area investment group that is now producing designs 
that incorporate the well-known OP label. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Bull, a 2-year-old Long Beach company, is focusing on styles like those 
worn decades ago by long-board surfers. Similarly, Hang 10 in San Diego is 
building on its line of "retro" clothing that borrows heavily from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders maintain that surf wear will always play a role in the 
larger fashion scene. "I think the story is that this industry is still alive, 
that after all these years it's still here," said Paul Holmes, a Hang 10 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners express some doubts about whether movies and TV alone can bolster 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "People buy clothing because it's cool . . . (not because) they know anything 
about surfing or care anything about surfing," said Ron Jones, who sells surf 
apparel through B'Jammin', a Winter Park, Colo., specialty store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers, too, question whether the wave of media interest means anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another tide change in surfing's hype," said Shawn Stussy, a surfer 
and creator of the highly successful Stussy Designs in Irvine. " 'Endless 
Summer II' and 'Big Wednesday II' aren't soul movies like the original 'Endless 
Summer.' These are Hollywood epics. They're apples and oranges. " And there's 
no guarantee that they will sell clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the Super Bowl," said Don Meek, a Prime Ticket vice president 
who is also a surfer. "I can deliver to the advertiser the most highly rated 
show in history. But it's up to the industry to put product on the shelf that 
people want to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike major sports, which can drive clothing sales by licensing a popular 
team's logo, surfing hasn't had a single, dominant focus since the demise of 
Day-Glo. And, while the popularity of dark, slouchy street styles is waning, 
surf wear now faces a new challenge: the "Northern Exposure" look, which 
borrows from the outdoorsy, Pacific Northwest styles worn by the cast of the 
award-winning TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New York, Boston and Chicago you see these people dressed up like they're 
going mountain climbing," Millstein said. "But the only hill they'll ever see 
is the one in Central Park where they walk their dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 While male teen-agers may still crave Southern California labels like Mossimo, 
Quiksilver and Rusty, many older men are instead choosing "that outdoor, 
wholesome Eddie Bauer look," said Tom Campion, owner of the Zumiez specialty 
store in Everett, Wash. "And it's definitely something that had its origination 
here in the Northwest, not in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Cherbak, a retail expert in the Costa Mesa office of accounting firm 
Deloitte & Touche, acknowledged that "the Timberlands of the world are out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 But "I'm a firm believer that the beach lifestyle never goes out of style," he 
said. "Surf has dealt with hip-hop, it's dealing with grunge. The wholesome 
look is just one more look coming through." Surfing U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing industry observers predict that 1994 will see a comeback of the sport 
and a return of surf wear to the retail limelight. Influential events: 
</P>
<P>
 * TV coverage: The Prime Ticket cable network will air 42 hours of surf 
programming to 41 million homes, an increase of 50% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Open and Op Pro: Huntington Beach will be host to back-to-back surfing 
events. The prestigious U.S. Open of Surfing, a sanctioned World Championship 
Tour event considered the largest and most heavily publicized surf event in the 
world, will be held July 26-31, followed by the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing 
Championship Aug. 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * Surfing Magazine Turns 30: The magazine, founded in 1964 during the surfing 
boom, will celebrate its 30th anniversary with several collector editions and 
will serve as the official publication for the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Endless Summer II": A sequel to the classic surf film "Endless Summer" is 
scheduled for release in April or May. The director is Bruce Brown, who did the 
original. Who Surfs? 
</P>
<P>
 Baby boomers who surfed in their teens are returning to the water along with 
their kids. In 1994, the sport's core age group is expected to be 18-23, 
slightly older than in previous years. Most surfers, 90%, are men. California 
Rules 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of America's surfers live in the Golden State: California: 45% 
Hawaii: 20% Florida: 20% Other states: 15% Catch a Wave 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Americans who surf at least four times a year is expected to 
increase 10% in 1994. Estimated number of active surfers, in millions: 1992: 
1.1 1993: 1.4 1994* : 1.5

about in your paper ("A Yellow Light on Alameda Corridor Deal," Commentary, 
Feb. 3) shows exactly why the most critical transportation project in 
California is still on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the state Transportation Commission, Epstein criticized the 
path which negotiators followed on the price and terms for the corridor. He 
argued that Southern Pacific got too much money and that California should have 
just seized the Alameda Corridor under eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Land seizure would only have resulted in a terribly expensive legal battle 
which would stall the Alameda Corridor for years and leave California's 
taxpayers footing the bill for a case that would certainly end up in the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for everyone to stop kicking dirt at the Southern Pacific 
railway or second-guessing the bargaining tactics of Long Beach or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We must put aside our differences to make this project happen. If only our 
state Transportation Commission would declare that the Alameda Corridor should 
be the No. 1 priority for Caltrans, then California would have a much easier 
time getting federal money to help put the Alameda Corridor on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The time we waste hemming and hawing in hindsight over a deal that has already 
been swung just adds more cargo trucks to our freeways and bigger clouds of 
diesel smoke to our air.

 * Epstein's commentary was misguided and fraught with contradictions. On the 
one hand, he correctly lauds the Alameda Corridor as "an important catalyst to 
our economic revival." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he condemns the purchase price and the lack of committed 
funds for the project. The project has passed many hurdles and has many to go 
before completion. The right-of-way negotiations have been tough and 
protracted, savings the ports tens of millions off the original asking price. I 
am amazed that Epstein honestly asserts that the whole $1.8 billion should be 
committed before purchasing the corridor right of way. This onerous and 
unrealistic recommendation would put the whole project in a Catch-22 situation 
as no public money can be spent and little appropriated before a right of way 
is secured.  
</P>
<P>
 Stimulating California's languid economy is not a task for the faint of heart. 
As chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Alameda Corridor Project, I 
can assure you that there is broad support for this project regardless of 
economic and natural disasters. We will get people back to work.

ASSISTANCE FOR QUAKE VICTIMS

 * In response to "U.S. Officials Misjudged Magnitude of Disaster," Feb. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 While the article focused on the huge numbers of non-English-speaking people 
requesting assistance from the FEMA sites, I think the National Guard's role in 
servicing those individuals should not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within one week of the earthquake, as soon as the need was identified and the 
decision made, approximately 110 foreign language experts from the 223rd 
Military Intelligence Battalion (Linguist) were brought in from all over the 
state to provide translator support for the disaster assistance centers. These 
soldiers were desperately needed and greatly appreciated by both the victims of 
the quake and FEMA representatives at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the linguists involved in this recovery process have spent 
many years learning and perfecting not only their language of specialty, but 
also their direct communication skills. With these tools they were able to 
offer more than simple communication; they soothed frazzled nerves, offered 
comfort in the face of disaster and provided a feeling of calm control. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time a battalion of linguists has ever been called out to 
provide language support for a major disaster in any U.S. city.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, with downsizing such a large issue in the National Guard, the linguists' 
contribution in this disaster and the potential for an even greater 
contribution in future emergencies only serve to strengthen the California 
National Guard's position as an important and extremely necessary part of our 
state's emergency preparedness team.

 * Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) deserves the fullest support of all 
Californians for his bill to remove limitations on taxpayer deductions for 
losses occurring in an area the President has declared as a disaster area (Feb. 
8). 
</P>
<P>
 At present the only bone Internal Revenue Code throws the devastated taxpayer 
is the option of taking the deduction in either the year of the disaster or the 
year preceding. Otherwise IRC restricts the deduction to the amount in excess 
of 10% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income plus $100. Berman's bill removes 
these limitations under such circumstances as our recent quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the federal government can provide only very limited financial aid, 
Berman's bill is badly needed to relieve distress and get our economy moving 
again.

 * I can't recall reading as percipient an editorial about the financing of the 
cost of repairing damage to the state's transportation facilities in Los 
Angeles County as yours of Jan. 21 ("Necessary Evil: A Temporary Gas Tax"). Too 
many people who advocate the use of bonds to raise money for payment of such 
repairs disregard (and so does the unsuspecting public) the enormous interest 
expense of issuing bonds; for every $100 million of bonds, California taxpayers 
would pay an additional $70 million in interest over the lifetime of the bonds, 
and that money would emanate from the sorely beleaguered general fund of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1922, Californians have built highways with a user fee; it's called the 
gasoline tax and it's based upon the principle that those who use the 
facilities should pay for the facilities. It's less regressive than the totally 
regressive sales tax and it's fiscally as prudent a method as can be devised 
for repairing the earthquake-damaged highways in Los Angeles.

 * All federal aid related to the earthquake should be loans, to be paid back 
at market interest rates. The same goes for aid related to floods, hurricanes, 
brush fires, etc. It's completely predictable that, over a long period of time, 
all these disasters will happen. If people want to live in an earthquake or 
flood zone, that's fine, but the rest of the country shouldn't have to 
subsidize their choice.

 * Larraine Segil's call for government and business to focus time and 
attention on telecommuting (Commentary, Feb. 4) was right on target, but it 
left out one critical component of our work force: home-based businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine years of debate, the city of Los Angeles still doesn't have an 
ordinance allowing a person to obtain a business license to work out of his or 
her home. What's also troubling is a plan recently approved by a Los Angeles 
City Council committee. It allows city workers to operate from home with a 
phone, fax and computer, but someone with a home-based business doing identical 
tasks can't be licensed and is subject to prosecution if he or she is caught.  
</P>
<P>
 Over 350 of California's more than 450 cities and 42 of our 58 counties allow 
people to work at home under certain conditions. Because some 2,500 residents 
applying for such a permit are turned down by Los Angeles each year, the city 
is losing licensing revenue.
