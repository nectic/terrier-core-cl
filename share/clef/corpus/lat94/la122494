RELIEVING HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to Sonia Nazario's "Hunger Wars" series (Nov. 20-23) and additional 
articles on Dec. 12 and 14, increased attention to the problem of hunger is 
being paid by The Times' readers. More schoolchildren in West Covina will be 
receiving much-needed free or reduced-price breakfasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of other children can receive breakfast at school. The Southern 
California Interfaith Hunger Coalition has successfully worked to bring the 
program to communities as diverse as Tustin and Inglewood, and works to let 
parents know that the program is available. Parents and communities can contact 
us for help in bringing breakfast to their school through our child nutrition 
hot line: (800) Eat-N-Gro, or (800) 328-6476. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as more children are being fed, our real worry is that the Republican 
"contract on America" will take away the limited safety net that exists for 
hungry children in this country. We commend The Times on tackling this issue.

REPORTING ON LOCAL ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are writing in response to "Crisis May Be Used as Bait by Other States" 
(Dec. 11). Although The Times has made noticeable efforts to provide more 
balanced perspectives on the local economy in recent months, this article, 
which featured many negative quotes about our economy from economic development 
officials in other states, represents the kind of reporting that inhibits our 
region's burgeoning recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 We have three specific concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 * Most local officials would strongly dispute the analysis and conclusions 
offered by the out-of-state individuals your article cited. The Economic 
Development Corp., for example, has reported a record number of relocation 
requests back to the area in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Times itself has documented that the "business flight" problem was 
overstated in the past, and has markedly slowed down in the last year. You have 
recently published, for example, a piece on the continued (if surprising) 
vitality of the post-earthquake San Fernando Valley economy, an article about 
an Edison study showing that relocations out of the area have slowed 
considerably and several features on firms that have moved back into Los 
Angeles. * Statements made by out-of-state officials to the effect that 
California "has a real problem," that several hundred firms had moved to 
Arizona and other anti-regional assertions were apparently not challenged 
adequately by your reporters. There is a growing consensus among nationwide 
development officials that the kind of business relocation methods detailed in 
your article do not work.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem with such articles is that they needlessly fan the sense of 
pessimism and defeat that is crippling our indigenous economic activity, and 
divert investment and global attention from our region's still considerable 
industrial strengths. While recognizing that The Times must report the news as 
it happens, it is also incumbent on your newspaper to provide balanced, 
accurate accounts of critical economic issues facing greater Los Angeles. 
Unfortunately, and especially in comparison with recent, welcome trends to the 
contrary, this article fell short of that standard.

ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times report (Dec. 17) on the 1993 work of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP for 
Orange County suggests that failures in financial statement disclosure and 
financial controls occurred and contributed to the county's bankruptcy. That is 
false. What got Orange County into trouble was its investments, not its 
accounting. In a nutshell, an external financial statement audit does not 
include giving investment advice or evaluating investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's remember the essential facts: An elected official over several years 
pursued a legal but aggressive and leveraged investment strategy. That strategy 
produced substantial gains. In recent months, the county's approach -- even 
more aggressive and more highly leveraged, according to published reports -- 
produced substantial losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, KPMG Peat Marwick was retained to audit the county's financial 
statements. Our audit shows that the 1993 financial statements were fairly 
presented and in accordance with government accounting principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article asks, implicitly, "How could this be?" 
</P>
<P>
 Typically conducted once per year, such an audit determines whether the 
financial statements prepared by an organization's officials fairly present the 
financial status of that organization at a specific point in time. In short, 
such an audit is concerned with the statements themselves -- their fairness and 
comprehensiveness. An external financial statement audit also looks at 
financial controls -- the organization's policies and procedures for recording 
and reporting its transactions in its financial statements. However, the task 
of assessing the wisdom of entering into the legally permissible transactions 
reported in such statements lies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In this situation, one of the important services that you can provide the 
community is to identify with greater clarity the specific roles that various 
entities, public and private, played in Orange County.

 * Richard Peiser (Commentary, Dec. 15) began his article with the statement: 
"People outside of Orange County may feel it made its own bed and deserves to 
lie in it -- as the county would be expected to preach if another county went 
bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Hoover withheld food needed by the hungry unemployed in 1932 for fear 
that feeding the hungry would create a perpetual dependent class. Newt Gingrich 
wants to abolish welfare and bring back orphanages. The views of Hoover and 
Gingrich are held by many residents of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wish to aid Orange County should select a worthy family, city or 
public agency, and send them money either as a gift or a loan, to tide them 
over. The awkward, heavy hand of impersonal government should not intrude in 
what is a matter of neighbor helping neighbor.

LEGALIZING PROSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the commentary by Gloria Allred and Lisa Bloom on legalizing prostitution 
(Dec. 6): 
</P>
<P>
 It has been my pleasure for the past 15 years to work with prostitute women 
through the Mary Magdalene Project. Living and working with these women has 
taught me a great deal about why women go into prostitution, and about what we 
as a society do to keep them enslaved. I assure you, legalizing prostitution is 
not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Nevada provides our primary model for legalized prostitution. 
Legal brothels exist in the rural counties. For the women in these whorehouses, 
it means paying for their room and board, paying a certain amount (sometimes as 
high as 50%) of their "take" to the house, paying for mandatory medical exams 
and no right of refusal (they must take any man who requests them). They must 
also be willing perform any of the sex acts that appear on the "menu." Apart 
from that, they are not allowed to be in the community or to vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most compelling argument against legalization, apart from the 
treatment of the women involved, is the fact that prostitution flourishes in 
the two remaining counties in Nevada where it is illegal. Another compelling 
variable is the presence of children who survive on our streets through their 
participation in the sex industry. Surely Allred and Bloom are not suggesting 
that these kids be cloistered in brothels?  
</P>
<P>
 All of the women with whom I work were abused as children. Perhaps we would be 
better served to place our energy in resurrecting incest taboos and providing 
men, women and children alternatives to prostitution as a means of survival. 
This is not an easy task and would require generations of intervention and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no illusions about stamping out prostitution in my lifetime. Until we 
raise our daughters free of abuse and with an understanding of themselves as 
independent and equipped with job skills, we will have female prostitutes. 
Until we raise our sons with the understanding that it is not an option to buy 
or sell another human being, we will have prostitution, legal or not.

THE MEXICAN INVESTMENT; PESO'S PLUMMET PUTS U.S. RELATIONSHIP TO TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has been rocked by the 
economic events of the last few days. While some part of the turbulence is no 
doubt of the weeks-old government's own making, it is absolutely vital that 
Mexico's neighbors do all in their power to help the new government through 
this storm. 
</P>
<P>
 So far both Ottawa and Washington have reacted very well indeed. The United 
States extended a $6-billion line of credit and Canada chipped in with $1 
billion. Clearly Mexico's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) recognize that the continent's political and economic stability depends 
on a Mexico that is politically and economically stable. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for partnership exists not only in the economic realm; bilateral and, 
in some areas, trilateral efforts are vital whether the issue is legal 
immigration, illegal immigration, border control, drug trafficking, temporary 
labor or whatever. No North American nation is an island; Mexico City, Ottawa 
and Washington must work as a close-knit team. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the Zedillo government has had a terrible week. Not long after highly 
respected Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche had reassured international 
investors that Mexico had no intention of devaluing the peso against other 
world currencies, Mexico devalued the peso. Not only that, it let the peso 
free-fall in currency markets. Mexico's currency is now trading at about 30% 
less value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zedillo government can be criticized for its tactics, and it should learn 
early on that the confidence of foreign governments will reflect in part the 
degree to which it keeps its word. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the root of the problem transcends Mexico. Currency volatility can be 
described as the Great Satan of the present world economic system. As last 
Sunday's Times editorial argued, without global monetary reform the world 
currency exchange system will remain vulnerable to wild swings, risky hedging 
and ruthless speculation. This is what happened this week. But it should not 
happen. It's bad stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major foreign investors are furious with Minister Puche for saying one 
thing and doing another; some, like Ross Perot, even see a dark conspiracy to 
devalue American investments, cheapen Mexican goods for U.S. purchasers while 
making U.S. goods in Mexico more expensive and effectively lowering Mexican 
wages, thus adding to migratory pressure northward. 
</P>
<P>
 But we think the Mexican government deserves the benefit of the doubt. The 
United States needs to look at its partnership with Mexico as a long-term deal, 
and at the current downturn as a temporary cost of doing business. We must 
remain close, understanding and helpful. Recriminatory finger-pointing will 
solve nothing, and can erode the enormous progress.

CUTS THAT HURT THE MOST; IS ORANGE COUNTY SPREADING THE PAIN EQUITABLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County financial debacle took the shape of real pain for real 
people this week, with the first county employees being told they will be out 
of work soon after the holidays. Hundreds more, perhaps 1,000, will be laid off 
in the weeks ahead as two dozen agencies and departments seek to save about $40 
million overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The manner of deciding which employees go first appears fair. Seniority and 
performance reviews will be the factors. Union officials, concerned about the 
abrogation of their contracts specifying layoffs be based only on seniority, 
promised to monitor the procedure carefully, which is their right. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads were given the latitude to decide who goes and who stays, but 
their budget cuts were imposed by a three-man management team that spent more 
than a week studying the county's woes after it filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
The Board of Supervisors, which was inattentive while the county treasurer made 
the bad investments that cost the county more than $2 billion, delegated the 
actual recommendations for cuts to a management team consisting of the county 
sheriff-coroner, the district attorney and the Health Care Agency director. 
</P>
<P>
 That trio was given a miserable job, made more difficult by questions about 
possible conflict of interest that emerged as soon as they announced their 
decisions. The supervisors could have foreseen that reaction. The sheriff and 
the district attorney escaped with cuts of about 1% each, but a program 
providing lawyers for those who cannot afford them suffered a 29% cut; the 
Human Resources Agency was slashed nearly 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and law enforcement are major political concerns, as the sheriff and the 
district attorney have shown over the years in skillfully fighting attempts to 
trim their budgets. An independent numbers-cruncher just might have reached 
some of the same conclusions as the management team. But asking a few major 
players to make budgetary decisions for all left a question of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is making extremely difficult decisions, with more to come. Part 
of getting beyond this crisis will be a perception that the pain is being 
spread evenly.

AUTHOR! AUTHOR ! . . . AUTHOR? ; MOVE OVER, NORMAN MAILER AND TOM CLANCY -- 
HERE COMES NEWT GINGRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why does a man as smart as Newt Gingrich see nothing problematic in his 
$4-million book deal? Doesn't the House Speaker-to-be see the hypocrisy, 
questions of conflict of interest and damage to his credibility resulting from 
his cashing in on his powerful new position? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, no. Gingrich, the self-proclaimed citizen-legislator, maintains 
his contract is a "normal book deal" that was an "arm's length transaction." 
Never mind that his publisher, HarperCollins, is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, 
the Australian native whose ownership of the Fox television network is being 
investigated by federal regulators. Would Gingrich have been offered such a 
handsome fee if he were not soon to become Speaker of the House? 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally it has been acceptable for senators and representatives to earn 
income from books. But there have been controversies, and Gingrich is quite 
familiar with this fact. In 1989, Gingrich, then assistant minority leader, 
accused House Speaker Jim Wright of violating conflict-of-interest rules in 
accepting 55% royalties on a privately published book sold to special interest 
groups. That same year, Gingrich admitted having his own unusual arrangement 
for a book, "Window of Opportunity," that he co-authored with two others. 
Besides enjoying the standard 10% hardcover royalty, the authors set up a 
limited partnership that raised $105,000 from Republican supporters to market 
the book. The authors were to share any profit, but sales turned out to be 
modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich says that before he signs the deal he will submit his book contract 
to the House Ethics Committee. Rather than receive all of the reported $4 
million upfront, Gingrich might entertain this idea: He should take a 
relatively small advance instead and collect royalties as books are sold. Vice 
President Al Gore, for example, was guaranteed $100,000 for "Earth in the 
Balance," which he wrote while he was in the Senate, but he earned $700,000 in 
royalties when his book sold very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has admitted in the past that his personal behavior often does not 
jibe with his politics. This is a case in point.

MCNALL NOT GETTING A LOT OF SYMPATHY

 I have a question regarding Bruce McNall's assertion that he had planned all 
along to pay back the "borrowed" $2.36 million. Oops, multiply that by 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he ever offer to return the coins he smuggled to the countries he took 
them from? I didn't think so.

 Poor Bruce McNall. The Walt Disney of his time, Bruce sought only to make the 
world a happier place.Now, admitted felon that he is, Bruce is maligned by 
Helene Elliott, and, worse yet, Tom Pollack, McNall's attorney, had his 
feelings hurt! 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Mr. Pollack's righteous indignation, I am left with the 
following question: If Mr. Pollack feels so strongly about the injustice of his 
client's public vilification, why doesn't he represent Bruce on a pro bono 
basis?

SALARY CAP AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would think that the baseball players' union would recognize by this point 
that ample precedent has been set for the owners' institution of a salary cap. 
Didn't Congress recently cap executive salaries by removing the deductibility 
of everything above $1 million? 
</P>
<P>
 I would think that the players, many of whom are above that threshold already, 
could bend to the reality of the world around them -- particularly when they 
recognize that those executives are accountable for advancing the interests of 
employees and shareholders, not merely for playing a child's game into 
adulthood.

THEY HAVE THEIR OWN NOTES FOR MALAMUD . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allan Malamud (Dec. 13) states, "It's time for the most routine play in 
football, the conversion kick, to be eliminated. Instead, teams should line up 
at the three-yard line and try to run or pass for a one-point conversion." 
</P>
<P>
 Malamud is partly right. The conversion kick should be eliminated, but so 
should the conversion attempt altogether. A former NFL commissioner, Bert Bell, 
long ago tried to eliminate the PAT, but to no avail. He wanted to count a 
touchdown as seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 He reasoned that most PATs are about as exciting as watching an ice cube melt. 
More important, if a touchdown counted seven points, then two field goals would 
not equal a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Bell was ahead of his time. His reasoning was accurate and logical, which 
is why it will never be fulfilled.

THEY HAVE THEIR OWN NOTES FOR MALAMUD . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am both puzzled and annoyed by a remark made in Allan Malamud's Dec. 14 
column. He said that if Bart Giamatti had been commissioner in Ty Cobb's time, 
Cobb would have been kept off the Hall of Fame ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several things wrong with this statement. Even if Ty Cobb was a 
rotten human being, he still did more for ex-players than Marvin Miller and Don 
Fehr combined -- which should tell you something about Miller and Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his faults, Cobb never broke the rules the way Pete Rose did, and he 
never sued the commissioner to avoid punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule forbidding players on the commissioner's ineligible list from 
appearing on the Hall of Fame ballot was passed two years after Giamatti's 
death -- never mind that sportswriters like Malamud took it upon themselves to 
keep Joe Jackson off the ballot for 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, why the cheap shot against a dead commissioner who cannot defend 
himself, and whose actions prove he considered the game far more important than 
any one individual?

NOTRE DAME (6-4-1) DIDN'T DESERVE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just how bad would Notre Dame's record have to be for it not to receive a 
major bowl bid? Notre Dame, with a 6-4-1 record, will rake in big bucks for its 
Fiesta Bowl appearance, while more deserving teams such as Alabama (11-1) and 
Kansas State (9-2) play in lesser bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame brings in fans and has a strong football tradition, but this squad 
has no Gipp or Lujack or Hornung or Montana.Notre Dame's 1994 team should have 
had to earn its way to a major bowl the way that every other team in the nation 
had to. 
</P>
<P>
 It damages the integrity of the entire bowl structure, the NCAA and the 
coalition to show one team such preferential treatment.

NEWSWIRE: HEYWARD RE-SIGNS, STAYS WITH FALCONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons signed running back Craig Heyward, having the best year of 
his career, to a two-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward has 1,041 combined yards this season, the highest total of his 
seven-year career. He also has career highs with 746 rushing yards, eight 
touchdowns and 30 receptions for 295 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A former No. 1 draft pick from Pittsburgh, Heyward signed a one-year deal with 
the Falcons before this season after spending last year in Chicago and five 
years in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 His rushing average of 4.5 yards per carry is third in the NFL and his eight 
touchdowns are the most by a Falcon running back since Gerald Riggs in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (6-9) play host to Arizona today. Hockey

 An attempt to schedule talks on Monday between NHL and union representatives 
fizzled when Bob Goodenow, executive director of the players' association, said 
he had no reason to meet if the league remains intent on imposing a payroll tax 
or exacting more concessions from players on salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 A league source said negotiators expected to meet Monday but canceled the 
session after Goodenow told union attorney Bob Riley the union had nothing to 
discuss if the tax was still alive. They did not set another date. The lockout 
is in its 85th day and has wiped out more than 40% of the NHL season.  
</P>
<P>
 A union source said Riley talked briefly with Jeff Pash, the NHL's general 
counsel, and added that no talks will take place before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The last full-scale negotiations were held Dec. 6, although delegations from 
each side have met three times since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Aubut, president and part owner of the Quebec Nordiques, is quitting 
three corporate board positions to see his NHL team through the labor crisis, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubut resigned from the board of Hydro-Quebec and the Quebec 2002 Winter 
Olympic bid committee. He also announced he would step down as chairman of the 
board of a technology park once a new management team is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The three positions took about 25 hours a week of Aubut's time, a Nordique 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubut, a leading voice for small-market clubs on the executive committee of 
the NHL's board of governors, said he wants to "concentrate all my energies on 
the Nordiques." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubut said his club cannot survive without a new 17,500-seat arena with 
corporate boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Top priorities are negotiations with the federal, provincial and municipal 
governments to build a new arena in Quebec and on reaching a settlement with 
locked out NHL players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordiques contend they will lose between $10 million and $14 million if no 
season takes place. Miscellany

plane and continued the trip. Oklahoma will play Brigham Young in the Copper 
Bowl.

 The men's World Cup giant slalom scheduled for Meribel, France, next Thursday 
was called off because of lack of snow. No immediate decision was made on a new

 The new conference that includes Memphis, Cincinnati, Houston and Louisville 
doesn't have a name, but does have a television deal for football starting in 
1996. The contract signed in Memphis, Tenn., with Liberty Sports Inc. 
guarantees the league's football-playing schools $20 million in a five-year 
deal. Each of the football schools will receive nearly $167,000 a year starting 
in 1996, with more money based on the number of live TV appearances. The deal 
calls for 12 to 14 games a year. Liberty, associated with Prime Sports Network, 
will offer the games to cable systems throughout the nation.

DEVELOPER KOLL ORDERED TO PAY $20.8-MILLION TAX JUDGMENT; CHARGE: AT ISSUE IS 
PREVIOUS TAX-SHARING AGREEMENT. NEWPORT HOME BUILDER SAYS IT WILL APPEAL, 
STANDS BY ITS BOLSA CHICA PROJECT.

<P>
 Koll Real Estate Group Inc. said Friday that it has been ordered to pay $20.8 
million to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll, a home builder based in Newport Beach, said it intends to appeal the 
decision and insisted that the situation will have no negative effect on its 
financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will really be no impact," said Raymond Pacini, chief financial officer 
at Koll. "Once there is a final judgment, and if we have to pay, we have 
arranged to borrow the money to pay for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has lined up financing of as much as $25 million for an appeal bond, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacini said the decision will not affect the development of the company's 
Bolsa Chica project, which was approved for up to 3,300 homes last week by the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll was sued earlier this year by Abex Inc. and Wheelabrator Technologies 
Inc., both based in Hampton, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 All three companies are former subsidiaries of Henley Group Inc. and were spun 
off as individual entities from 1988 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Henley Group bought an interest in Santa Fe Pacific Corp. The 
following year, the company sold its stake in the Santa Fe Southern Pacific 
railway to Itel Corp., the Chicago-based conglomerate. Henley reported a loss 
on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS conducted an audit, completed in 1993, and declared that the company 
had gained from the transaction. The agency demanded payment of taxes from the 
sale and filed suit against Wheelabrator. 
</P>
<P>
 In settling the suit, the IRS found Koll responsible for $20.8 million of the 
$72 million owed because of a tax-sharing agreement it had signed when it was 
spun off from Henley Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacini said Friday, however, that "the only way we could be held responsible 
is if the other two companies had obtained our consent with respect to the 
settlement with IRS." 
</P>
<P>
 Current managers of Koll, he said, should not be held accountable, for they 
were not responsible for drafting or signing the tax-sharing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreements were entered into by prior management," Pacini said. "It was 
the same people signing for Abex, Wheelabrator and Koll." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Wheelabrator said that Koll is bound by the tax-sharing 
agreements to pay its share. He said there is no stipulation in the contract 
saying that Koll must be consulted on settlements made by Wheelabrator with 
federal tax authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all in agreement on the tax-sharing arrangement," Kevin Stickney 
said. "Our position has always been that it was enforceable." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll has struggled financially in recent years during Southern California's 
real estate slump, and its revenue has declined steadily. For 1989, Koll 
reported revenue of $133 million. By sharp contrast, the total last year was 
$16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1994 so far, the company has reported losses of about $4 million for each 
quarter.

LAST-MINUTE SATURDAY; RETAILERS HAVE VISIONS OF RECORD LAST-DAY SALES; SHOPPERS 
WARY, WORN

<P>
 With a little help from the calendar and incentives such as discount 
promotions and perks, the nation's merchants are in position to parlay today's 
last-minute holiday shopping into the biggest single-day sales gross of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For retailers, this Christmas Eve -- a work-free Saturday for most consumers 
-- is the last opportunity to move enough merchandise to limit the kind of 
post-Christmas price-cutting that reduces profits. 
</P>
<P>
 For consumers, it's time to confront a frenzied retail arena fraught with the 
perils of last-minute shopping -- dangers such as the impulse buy, the panic 
purchase and slick merchandising, not to mention potential gridlock in the 
stores and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there'll be bonuses and bargains aplenty. Retailers are promoting 
price-cuts, mall entertainment and amenities such as free gift-wrapping. 
However, the smart consumer will have to scrutinize displays and shop with a 
modicum of patience to avoid the kind of budget-busting spending that can 
create post-Christmas headaches. 
</P>

 Greg Milton, a self-described procrastinator, doubts his ability to ferret out 
a good deal. Milton, who shopped for jewelry at various stores at the Westside 
Pavilion on Wednesday evening, said he would probably be among those shopping 
on Christmas Eve because he had not yet bought gifts for his wife and friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's a good deal and what's hype?" he asked rhetorically. "I'm out of my 
element." 
</P>
<P>
 Such indecision will be the bane of many of those shoppers. The deadline 
urgency to complete that shopping leads to some poor purchasing choices, said 
Doug Hope, publisher of Display & Design Ideas, a trade publication for 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last-minute shopper tends to be panic-prone and is less conscious of 
pricing because of that desperation," Hope said. "There'll be bargains but 
retailers will also prominently display more expensive items because many of 
these late shoppers are not smart shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope said many consumers make unplanned "impulse" purchases when confronted 
with attractively displayed items on tables. Shoppers will notice extra display 
tables of the sort in many stores today, he said -- tables of the type that 
normally contain discount items. 
</P>
<P>
 Music is another mood-altering resource, and holiday sounds from taped 
playlists provided by companies such as Muzak Corp. and AEI Music -- two 
Seattle-based competitors -- are the soundtrack for shopping in many stores. 
One school of thought -- ascribed to at the Glendale Galleria -- says that 
higher volume makes for higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, shoppers at the Galleria this week will note that the decibels 
have been turned up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the finish line of the retail marathon, retailers here and 
elsewhere are feeling pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close of business today, retailers nationwide will have generated 
overall holiday sales increases of 5% to 6%, predicts Richard Giss, partner at 
the retail services group of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche. Southern 
California retailers will record an increase of 6% to 7% over a year ago, Giss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But today could provide a powerful finishing kick. And while mall managers 
pull out all the stops -- with carolers, free-vacation contests and so forth -- 
the biggest lure will be the season's peak sales bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Visions of discounts danced in Lydia Ramirez's head as she shopped for 
clothing at the Century City Shopping Center. "I'll be shopping early tomorrow 
because the best deals will go fast," Ramirez said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Prachner and his daughter, Alexandria, already had several bags of goods 
by 9:30 a.m. Friday at the Westside Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to beat the crowds and we're just about done," he said. "The 
bargains are better the last few days before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 To accomodate the early birds, most malls will open today at 9 a.m., an hour 
earlier than usual. Mall managers are primed for a real rush. The Baldwin Hills 
Crenshaw mall expects 20% to 30% over the normal Saturday turnout. And mall 
managers predict increases are 30% to 40% for the Sherman Oaks Galleria -- and 
about 50% for the Century City Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have big, orderly crowds Friday," said Cindy Chong, general manager of 
the Glendale Galleria. "The frenzy begins Christmas Eve."

MEXICO'S FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; PESO SETTLES AMID FEAR OF SHORT-TERM DAMAGE; 
FALLOUT: ONE WALL STREET FIRM DOWNGRADES THE NATION'S FOREIGN DEBT. MEXICAN 
RETAILERS ALREADY BEMOAN A DROP IN HOLIDAY SALES.

 The peso stabilized on international markets Friday, but the Mexican 
currency's plunge this week led a top Wall Street firm to cut its rating of 
Mexico's foreign debt and shattered efforts to forecast what will happen to the 
nation's economy in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and shoppers here also said the devaluation -- which began Tuesday 
and drove the peso down nearly 30% against the U.S. dollar before rising 
slightly in Friday trading -- cut into last-minute purchases heading into 
Mexico's bleakest Christmas weekend in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample of the reaction in international financial circles to the Mexican 
government's sudden decision to stop defending the peso, just 24 hours after 
lifting the trading ceiling on the currency, came from Baring Securities Ltd. 
It issued a special report Friday titled, "The Mexican Crash." 
</P>
<P>
 "Owing to the volatility of exchange and interest rates, it is unrealistic at 
this time to produce a plausible economic scenario for 1995," the report 
declared, sharply criticizing the new government of Mexican President Ernesto 
Zedillo for the impact of the free-float. 
</P>
<P>
 Baring echoed many Mexican economists who believe that Zedillo's initial move 
Monday to expand the peso's trading band would have been a sufficiently painful 
move to adjust an overvalued currency and strengthen Mexico's export economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that the (government's) economic management team has lost 
credibility through its handling of the crisis," the Baring report stated, 
adding that confidence can be restored only through the announcement of a 
credible, new economic plan for the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's announced Friday that it was lowering to "Double B-plus" its 
rating on about $30 billion worth of Mexico's long-term, foreign currency debt, 
and indicated the rating could fall still further. 
</P>
<P>
 But S&P struck a more upbeat tone for Mexico's long-range economic outlook, 
noting, "Public finances -- the anchor of Mexico's (economic) reform program -- 
are fundamentally strong, with government debt under 25% of GDP (gross domestic 
product)." 
</P>
<P>
 Other financial analysts agreed. And J. P. Morgan went a step further, 
defending Zedillo's financial advisers as "one of the best economic teams in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the government is attempting to accomplish through the devaluation and 
the accompanying macroeconomic measures is (to) adjust the economy to the new 
external reality" of international markets, Morgan concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But its analysts, too, said the initial impact on the Mexican economy will be 
slow overall growth and that banks and other corporations with large dollar 
exposures "will be hurt, in many cases badly." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the day, however, when all the dust has settled and the 
recriminations have ceased, Mexico will have a much more competitive exchange 
rate . . . and a much more viable long-run development strategy than it had 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican peso stabilized against the dollar as panic about the country's 
financial crisis ebbed. The peso was last quoted at 4.6750 pesos to the dollar, 
stronger than 4.80 pesos, where it was quoted late Thursday. At that level, the 
peso buys 21.05 cents, down 27% from 28.87 cents a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Stock Market also stabilized after a roller-coaster week of heavy 
trading. The Bolsa index on Friday edged up 1.54%.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO'S FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL; THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEVALUED 
COIN: TRADE SHOULD BENEFIT; CURRENCY: MEXICAN EXPORTS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME MORE 
COMPETITIVE AND ITS TRADE DEFICIT SHOULD NARROW SOON. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as Mexico's currency plunge has sparked a financial crisis and tarnished 
the nation's image, its long-term effects could yield quite the opposite: 
Mexico's exports are likely to become more competitive, and its global trade 
deficit should narrow soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheaper peso "should stimulate Mexican exports to the United States -- no 
question about it," said Richard N. Rosencrance, director of UCLA's Center for 
International Relations. In fact, he added, the cheaper peso "is a very 
positive advantage" for Mexico's export efforts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one lesson of recent U.S. history is that a decline in the domestic 
currency may help narrow the trade gap. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, when the United States' global trade deficit was a source of 
financial instability and political embarrassment, the government encouraged 
the dollar to fall, particularly against the Japanese yen. Although the degree 
of the fall varied with each foreign currency, U.S. exports took off and have 
remained a far more important part of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the peso's plunge of some 35% this week has the potential to shift 
fundamental trade realities in North America, economists said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 A permanently weaker peso would mean Mexican products can be sold more cheaply 
to the United States and Canada. Similarly, it could make the products Mexico 
buys from its North American neighbors more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the space of a week, Mexico has positioned itself to enjoy greater 
sales to the United States, accelerating a trend that began emerging when the 
North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in January.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Mexico is doing this partly because of (its worldwide) trade 
deficit," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 For companies like Kaydon, an industrial bearings manufacturer in Monterrey, 
Mexico, that ships most of its products to the United States, the devaluation 
will be beneficial. The firm is in essence enjoying a windfall from its U.S. 
customers, who are now paying 30% more in pesos per product. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sell to the American market, you will have a big increase in revenue," 
predicts plant manager Alfredo Sanchez, who now expects to hire 20 more workers 
this year to meet a growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the peso's jarring fall -- reflecting global investors' questions 
about the stability of Mexico's economy -- has had negative effects. Suddenly, 
the Mexican market poses new uncertainties for American exporters whose prices 
are rising -- to the consternation of their Mexican customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors from the United States and other countries have lost money on the 
stock market and are pulling much-needed capital out of the country. Some U.S. 
firms are reconsidering their expansion plans. Wal-Mart may delay the opening 
of new stores in Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 James Meinert, director of international marketing for Snider Mold, a 
Wisconsin toolmaker, recalls the reaction of his Mexican customers to the peso 
devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that happened was the phones started lighting up, and people 
wanted to make advance payments on their tooling," he said. For now, management 
at the Mequon, Wis., firm is wary: "I'm not alarmed, but I'm watching things 
real close," Meinert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring interest rates and inflation are also compounding Mexico's problems. 
Mexican companies that use a lot of dollars, common for enterprises near the 
U.S. border, now must pay a lot more for their greenbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 To combat inflation, the Mexican government this week imposed along with the 
devaluation wage-and-price controls that were meant to stabilize the peso on 
foreign currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 If costs continue to shoot up, though, the devaluation would be for naught, 
and capital will continue to flow out of the country, said Tony Ramirez of San 
Diego-based Made in Mexico, a firm that consults for U.S. manufacturers moving 
operations to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Mexican trade in both directions has been rising sharply over the past 
year, and Mexico is already close to achieving a trade surplus with the United 
States. (The United States ran a $1.7-billion trade surplus with Mexico for the 
first 10 months of the year, but the surplus has dwindled of late.) 
</P>
<P>
 The troublesome aspect of Mexican trade, apart from that with the United 
States, is the tens of billions in deficits it is running with other countries, 
a key source of concern among investors and of pressure on the peso. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing that deficit is the first target goal of the peso devaluation. But 
such a strategy will only work if it is buttressed by real strides in 
industrial efficiency, said Jasinowski. Referring to the more orderly decline 
of the dollar in the 1980s, he said, "The U.S. devaluation was for the most 
part successful because it came in tandem with real improvements in 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has also moved to boost its industrial efficiency in recent years, but 
it has often relied on foreign technology to enhance its uneconomical older 
facilities. With a weaker peso, equipment purchases -- such as tooling from 
Snider Mold -- will now cost more. 
</P>
<P>
 But the long-term view of Mexico's industrial competitiveness remains 
positive, provided an atmosphere of stability settles over the economy. "The 
key is for the peso to go down and stay there in a stable way," Rosencrance 
said. "If it does, that will be acceptable financially and economically."

WOMAN SUES HER HMO FOR NOT COVERING MATERNITY COSTS; INSURANCE: HEALTH NET 
REFUSES TO PAY BECAUSE THE MORENO VALLEY TEACHER GAVE BIRTH AT THE 
ORGANIZATION'S OCEANSIDE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Moreno Valley schoolteacher has sued Health Net, the state's second-largest 
health maintenance organization, for refusing to pay her maternity bills 
because she delivered her baby at a Health Net facility in Oceanside instead of 
at her "home" facility in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time mother Sara Israel said she was stunned when Health Net rejected 
her $5,000 medical claim, citing a policy that forbids women in their ninth 
month of pregnancy to travel more than 30 miles from their home clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ludicrous that they'd put a 30-mile leash on a woman," Israel, 33, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Claremont-based William Shernoff, contends that this and similar 
restrictions, which he said are becoming increasingly frequent among HMOs, are 
adopted in the name of cost savings to consumers but are in fact mainly meant 
to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an element of sexism in the policy as well, Shernoff charged, since 
Health Net does not restrict a man who has heart disease and risks a sudden 
heart attack from traveling 30 miles away from his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net, with 1.25 million members in California, says its policy is firmly 
grounded in concern for the health of both mother and child. "The medical 
consensus says women should not travel in the last month of pregnancy," a 
spokesman for the Woodland Hills-based company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He branded as "absolute, utter nonsense" Shernoff's contention that the policy 
is meant to boost Health Net's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit complaint, filed in Riverside Superior Court, Israel said she 
and her husband took an 80-mile vacation trip to Oceanside last April during 
spring break from her Moreno Valley elementary school, where she teaches 
second- and third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, just before leaving, she visited her obstetrician, who told her 
that her cervix was not dilated and the delivery did not appear imminent, 
according to the complaint. The doctor scheduled another visit for April 20, 
two days before Israel's April 22 due date. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 2 a.m. on April 17, the complaint continues, Israel awoke in labor with 
contractions so frequent and strong that she and her husband decided it would 
be dangerous to try to drive to the Riverside Medical Clinic, their home Health 
Net facility. Instead, they called an ambulance and instructed the driver to 
take Israel to Tri-City Medical Center, the Health Net facility in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:08 a.m., barely two hours after beginning labor, Israel delivered a 
7-pound, 13-ounce baby boy, William Travis. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days later, Israel got a letter from Health Net informing her that it 
was denying her claim for coverage of the delivery, hospital stay and ambulance 
ride. The letter said that normal deliveries in the last month of pregnancy are 
not considered emergency care and are not covered except at the member's home 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said she was completely unaware of the restriction despite having 
attended Health Net's prenatal classes and having had frequent office visits 
with her Health Net obstetrician. Shernoff contends that the restrictive 
language is "buried" in her insurance contract and is not contained in the 
pregnancy benefits section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health Net's policy keeps a pregnant woman under virtual house arrest," the 
complaint states, adding that the restriction "could force many gainfully 
employed women to lose their jobs" if they commute more than 30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a discretionary pleasure trip and she was five days from her due 
date," the Health Net spokesman said. As for the policy threatening women's 
employment, he said: "If you're that close to your due date, you should be on 
maternity leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said that similar policies are widespread if not universal among 
California HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, CareAmerica Health Plans, a Chatsworth-based HMO with 225,000 
members, will cover deliveries at any of its network facilities in seven 
Southern California counties, a spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Jimenez, a staff attorney for the nonprofit Center for Health Care 
Rights in Los Angeles, said the policy seems to conflict with the way that HMOs 
like Health Net tend to market themselves to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "HMOs advertise and get members by saying, 'We have all these providers in our 
network and give you all these choices,' " she said. "But when it comes down to 
it, with this policy they're saying, 'No, you don't have a choice. You can only 
go to one place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shernoff said the lawsuit seeks payment of Israel's medical bills, 
compensation for the emotional distress that the incident has caused her and 
her husband, plus punitive damages to discourage Health Net or other HMOs from 
such practices. He is also seeking an injunction to suspend the policy 
immediately.

GARAMENDI TELLS FARMERS TO PAY $183.5 MILLION; REBATE: COMMISSIONER ALSO ORDERS 
INSURER TO STOP OFFERING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE WITH 20% AND 25% DEDUCTIBLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Friday ordered Farmers Insurance 
Group to pay $183.5 million in rebates to policyholders under Proposition 103, 
the 1988 insurance rate-rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, Garamendi also ordered Farmers to stop offering 
earthquake insurance with 20% and 25% deductibles, claiming that such high 
deductibles are illegal. In a cease-and-desist order, Garamendi told Farmers to 
roll its deductibles back to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merry Christmas from the commissioner," joked Farmers spokesman John Millen, 
in a less-than-jolly tone of voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers -- which faces Northridge earthquake claims of at least $1.35 billion 
-- believes that it was within its rights last July to raise earthquake 
deductibles to 20% for commercial policies and 25% on residential ones, Millen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree entirely that our action was illegal, and we will immediately 
seek a stay from (Los Angeles) Superior Court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers also contends that it owes no rebates under Proposition 103 and will 
fight the rebate order, as have such other large insurers as State Farm Mutual 
Automobile Insurance Co. and 20th Century Insurance Co. State Farm has hearings 
on its dispute scheduled with the Insurance Department early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, in a legal challenge by 20th Century, the California Supreme Court 
upheld Garamendi's method of implementing Proposition 103. Facing payment of 
$120 million in rebates, 20th Century obtained a court stay in order to appeal 
the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. After originally ordering rebates from 
insurance companies in 1991, Garamendi withheld new rebate orders while the 
20th Century case was pending. Shortly after the California Supreme Court's 
August ruling, he started issuing new rebate orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $183.5-million rebate, including 10% annual interest dating back 
to May, 1989, is the third highest of the 42 that Garamendi has ordered so far, 
reflecting Farmers' No. 3 position in the California market. 
</P>
<P>
 However, few of the companies that have settled their Proposition 103 
liability have paid anything close to the amount they were ordered. No. 2 
Allstate Insurance Co., for example, last year agreed to pay $110 million of 
the $243.6 million it had originally been assessed in October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Garamendi is playing politics with these numbers, since he had 
offered our member companies a substantially lower settlement number" in 
negotiations with Farmers representatives, Millen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to give the number, but sources close to the negotiations said 
that under one proposal on the table before the talks broke down, Garamendi 
would have granted Farmers most of the earthquake insurance rate increase it is 
seeking in exchange for Farmers agreeing to a substantial Proposition 103 
rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who leaves office Jan. 2, considers his defense of Proposition 103 
as one of his administration's strongest accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers applied for an earthquake rate increase averaging 174% statewide. The 
application is scheduled for hearings in January, under incoming Commissioner 
Charles (Chuck) Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Farmers, like most other large insurers, continues to 
maintain a moratorium on writing new homeowners and earthquake insurance in 
California, fearing additional earthquake exposure.

DELTA WINS SUIT BROUGHT BY FAILED PAN AM; AIRLINES: FEDERAL JUDGE FINDS THE 
SURVIVING CARRIER NOT LIABLE FOR THE DEMISE OF PAN AM, WHICH SOUGHT $2.5 
BILLION IN DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines Inc. won a major court battle Friday when a federal judge 
ruled it was not liable for Pan Am Corp.'s demise and said the bankrupt 
airline's estate must repay Delta for emergency financing. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson ruled that Pan Am has 10 days to repay 
Delta a $115-million loan plus interest. That means a total of about $150 
million, a Delta lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling lifted a cloud of uncertainty that had been hovering over Delta and 
its stock leaped on the news, gaining $3.875 to $49.625 at the close on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is consistent with our view all along that Delta was on strong legal 
ground, but it certainly is as nice a Christmas present as Delta could ask 
for," Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber said of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan Am filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, 1991. It stopped 
flying in December of that year after Delta unexpectedly pulled out of a 
financing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan Am and its creditors then sued Delta in bankruptcy court for $2.5 billion 
in damages, alleging Delta had agreed to finance a reorganization plan that 
would have allowed Pan Am to emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta maintained there was no signed agreement between the two airlines and 
that it had given Pan Am emergency financial support that allowed the troubled 
airline to operate longer than it would have otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Patterson agreed, ruling there was no "clear and unambiguous promise" by 
Delta that it would provide funding to the reorganized Pan Am without certain 
conditions being met. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conditions had not been satisfied, he said, noting the company's 
reorganization plan had not been confirmed and Pan Am had not obtained new 
contracts with all of its unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pan Am was not ready, willing and able to satisfy those conditions. Delta 
therefore cannot be held liable for breach of such an obligation," Patterson 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 David Brodsky, a lawyer representing Pan Am, said he obviously was 
disappointed but had not had a chance to read the entire ruling. He said he 
would not know until next week whether Pan Am would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based Delta said its victory validated its longstanding position. 
</P>

 "This is great news. Delta's position has always been clear. We fulfilled all 
our obligations to Pan Am and even went the proverbial extra mile in providing 
assistance in their reorganization efforts," said spokesman Todd Clay.

 Consumers Keep on Spending: Despite smaller incomes in November, consumers 
kept up the furious spending pace that has fueled economic growth this year.At 
the same time, orders for big-ticket durable goods posted the biggest jump in 
three months. The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.6% in 
November, the seventh straight advance, including a 0.7% gain in October. 
Analysts also said the 3.4% jump in factory orders for durable goods was 
exaggerated by an unsustainable surge of aircraft and automobile bookings in 
November.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; HOLIDAY RALLIES; STOCKS UP 18.51; BONDS, DOLLAR LESS 
SPIRITED

 Blue-chip stocks closed with strong gains for the third day in a row Friday as 
investors snapped up stocks before the long Christmas holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But if stocks were infected by the holiday spirit, the currency and bond 
markets slipped into a pre-holiday lull. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 34 points at its highest level 
of the day, retreated on profit-taking to close at 3,833.43, up 18.51. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market indexes also finished under their highs for the day but were 
still in the positive column. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing issues led decliners by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
where volume was a very light 196.54 million shares. On Thursday 339.67 million 
shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 For a third consecutive session, the U.S. markets benefited from this week's 
financial crisis in Mexico, whose government allowed a sharp devaluation of the 
peso earlier this week. The resulting nose-dive for the Mexican currency and 
stock market sent investors out of Mexican securities and into U.S. stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The light volume strengthened the moves, in this case on the upside. "In light 
volume, you can push stocks up with facility," said Larry Wachtel, Prudential 
Securities' market analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Equities also benefited from a decline in the Treasury long-bond yield. The 
rate on the 30-year bond dipped to 7.83% from Thursday's 7.85%, and its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, rose 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto stocks attracted bargain hunters for a second consecutive day, and 
airline shares were also strong performers. Latin American stocks rebounded 
from the beating they took earlier because of the Mexican peso devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexican stocks recovered some ground in the U.S. market. Telefonos de Mexico 
rose 1/4 to 40 7/8, and Grupo Televisa added 1/2 to 32 7/8. Grupo Tribasa rose 
1/4 to 19 7/8, but Empresas ICA slid 3/4 to 19 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the Latin American stocks, Telefonica de Argentina gained 1 3/8 to 51 
1/8, and Compania de Telefonos de Chile rose 1 1/2 to 79 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Motors Corp. gained 2 to 41 1/8 after Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette 
raised its fourth-quarter earnings estimate for the car maker. Ford Motor Co. 
tacked on 1/4 to 27, and Chrysler Corp. rose 3/4 to 48 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline stocks benefited from bargain hunting. Delta Air Lines Inc. surged 3 
7/8 to 49 5/8 after a federal judge ruled that the carrier did not breach good 
faith in negotiating Pan Am's bankruptcy reorganization plan. American 
Airlines' parent AMR Corp. ended up 2 to 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets ended lower. Mexico's Bolsa index closed up 39.59 points at 
2,341.85. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average ended down 6.64 points at 
2,094.01, and London's Financial Times 100-share average finished 8.3 points 
lower at 3,083.4. The Tokyo market was closed for the Emperor's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, ended mostly higher in an abbreviated session, deriving 
strength as investors continued to exchange pesos for dollars amid Mexico's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the peso closed at 4.625 to the dollar, down from 4.60 Thursday. 
The U.S. currency also ended the week at 100.18 Japanese yen, down from 100.23 
yen Thursday and at 1.579 German marks, up from 1.575.

 Ameritech Gets Cable OK for 6 Cities: Federal regulators cleared the way for 
the regional telephone company to build cable television-like systems in six 
Midwestern cities. The systems, which will be separate from Ameritech's phone 
networks, will transmit TV programs and other services to a potential audience 
of 1.3 million. The FCC's action breaks through a backlog of several dozen 
requests by telephone companies to provide video services.

PUNK SHOW VIOLENCE PROMPTS CALL FOR CHANGE; CLUBS: POLICE AND PROMOTERS SAY ICE 
HOUSE SECURITY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED AFTER TWO ATTACKS. VENUE'S BOOKING POLICY 
MAY BE MODIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A night of punk rock in which one fan was stabbed and another beaten has 
brought the Ice House under scrutiny by police, who want assurances from the 
club's operators that rock shows at the cavernous brick building can be run 
without further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble occurred last weekend at a concert headlined by the Vandals, one 
of Orange County's longest-running punk bands. According to a police report, an 
18-year-old Long Beach man was punched and stabbed, and another concert-goer, a 
21-year-old man from Orange County, told police that he was knocked down by a 
punch, then kicked by several assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, police said, the victims said that their attackers fit the 
shaven-headed, tattooed appearance of skinheads, a punk subculture whose look 
is frequently just a fashion statement, but also can be a sign of allegiance to 
neo-Nazism and white supremacist ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing victim, who asked that his name not be used, said Friday that he 
was standing on the Ice House's floor, waiting for the Vandals to play, when he 
was accosted by a skinhead. The skinhead objected to the Jimi Hendrix T-shirt 
he was wearing, uttering a racial epithet demeaning the black rock hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, he hit me in the face," the victim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man said he then "got jumped" by about 11 or 12 skinheads. "I felt about 
seven more (blows) to the head. . . . I didn't even know I was stabbed until I 
was at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman, Sgt. Glenn Deveny, said that the stabbing victim sustained 
a punctured left lung and was taken by ambulance to UCI Medical Center. A 
family member said he was recuperating at home after a two-day hospital stay. 
There was no arrest, Deveny said, because when police arrived, many others in 
the crowd matched the attacker's description. 
</P>
<P>
 After police responded to the stabbing, Deveny said, the night's second victim 
approached them and said that he had been punched, then kicked in the head, 
while dancing. He suffered a cut lip and bruises but declined to be treated by 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both incidents occurred Dec. 16 after 11 p.m., during a lull between 
performances on the four-band bill. Promoters said that after huddling with 
police, they decided to allow the remaining band, the Vandals, to play a brief 
closing set of about 15 minutes so that a crowd police described as "unruly" 
would not be further angered by a cancellation of the headliner. Police 
estimated there were 600 to 700 people in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 A promotion company called Culture Shock has been overseeing concerts at the 
Ice House since July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done over 40 shows, and that's the first incident we've had," said 
DennisLluy, one of the Culture Shock partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Another partner, Amy Toten, said the Ice House, which serves no alcohol on 
rock-concert nights and is open to all ages, will immediately change its 
security arrangements for rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Culture Shock, as well as John Pantle, an independent promoter 
who has used the Ice House under Culture Shock's supervision (including last 
week's violence-plagued show), had raised objections recently because the house 
security staff hired by the building's general manager did not have special 
training in concert security. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the general manager, Francisco Roman, agrees now that a change is 
needed and that Culture Shock plans to hire Event Control Security, a company 
specializing in concerts, in time for shows scheduled Wednesday, Thursday and 
Saturday. Lluy said promoters also will consider installing metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously that knife got into the facility, and that was a main problem right 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toten said the Ice House is proceeding with seven of the eight events that 
were booked before last week's violence raised questions about the future of 
the venue, which is at 112 E. Walnut Ave., near the Fullerton Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the upcoming shows feature grass-roots, Southern California ska, 
alternative and melodic punk bands, the types of groups that have been an Ice 
House staple. 
</P>
<P>
 A February show by Greg Ginn, former leader of the influential hard-core punk 
band Black Flag, has been canceled; its promoter, Pantle, said he was told by 
the Culture Shock partners that city officials were concerned it could lead to 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley said Thursday that he plans to meet 
with the Ice House operators after Christmas to discuss the building's future 
as a rock venue, with the main issues being "security and what they're booking 
in the place." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to lay down the ground rules," he said. "What occurs at that meeting, 
and what kinds of commitments we get (will) determine whether we (revoke) their 
conditional-use permit" -- the city permit needed to stage events. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley said one new condition he may propose is that the Ice House hire 
off-duty Fullerton police for concert security. He added that promoters are apt 
to object to such a requirement because the police would work at a 
city-specified overtime pay rate substantially more costly than private 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he would insist that no more punk rock be booked, McKinley said, 
"I may." But he added that he also is reluctant to be an arbiter of what styles 
of music are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll meet these guys and see what kinds of assurances they give us," he said. 
"If you're going to have that kind of activity, (the Ice House) is as good a 
place as you can have for (punk shows). 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess all cultures need some place to meet. We just have to control it," 
McKinley said. "We have to have appropriate security, know (in advance) how 
many people are going to be there, and if more come, cut it off. . . . They're 
cutting corners with their security, and they just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ice House manager Roman said Friday that he always has met or exceeded the 
police-mandated security standard of at least one guard per 100 people 
attending an event. He said the security staff at the Dec. 16 show was seven 
men to handle a crowd of 600 to 700. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley said police have sometimes been told by promoters that an Ice House 
concert is expected to draw about 300 people, only to have twice as many turn 
out, raising concerns about whether enough security will be on hand. The 
venue's capacity is 578 for the main concert area, according to Lluy; factoring 
in a side room and backstage area, he said, its total capacity is 718. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ice House, which is owned by Bushala Brothers Inc., a Fullerton 
construction company, has had a sporadic, problem-plagued history as a rock 
venue. Various managers and promoters have leased the building in recent years 
and tried to establish it as a rock-concert venue and dance hall. In some 
cases, crowd-control problems have led to loss of permits or the imposition of 
restrictions that made concerts difficult to stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the summer, the new manager, Roman, has leased the Ice House, booking 
wedding receptions and Latino dance nights on Saturdays and Sundays, while 
contracting with Culture Shock to program rock music on weeknights. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley agreed with the Culture Shock partners that until Dec. 16, problems 
had been held in check under the new management. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to have done a better job (than past operators)," the police chief 
said. "I haven't had any real complaints. I've been out to a couple of Friday 
night (concerts). Although the kids looked weird to me, or different, (the 
shows) seemed to be going relatively well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lluy blamed last weekend's violence on "a group of 10 or 15 Nazi skinheads 
that showed up. . . . We're going to be more careful now" to avoid booking acts 
that might attract such a following. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hall, guitarist of the second-billed band, HFL, said that a contingent 
of racist skinheads that has dogged the Huntington Beach band's performances 
"was definitely there, maybe 50 (of them). They're usually the ones who have 
their hands sticking up in the air (in Nazi 'Sieg Heil' salutes), and there 
were people doing that" during the Dec. 16 show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to make it clear that (in) no way do we endorse anything like that," 
Hall said. "We're a very anti-(racist) band. It's been nothing but headaches 
for us. We tell them not to show up, and it makes them show up even more. They 
bum us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said the neo-Nazis simply seem to like the musical style of HFL, whose 
initials stand for Hard, Fast and Loud. Hard-core is a punk sub-genre that 
typically emphasizes speeding, thrashing beats and angrily barked lyrics, in 
contrast to the catchier, more rhythmically varied melodic-punk style. 
</P>
<P>
 Punk rock has exploded commercially in the past year. Melodic punk bands such 
as Green Day and the Offspring -- an Orange County band that opened for the 
Vandals at the Ice House about two years ago when the Offspring was a virtual 
unknown -- have become staples on MTV and alternative-rock stations such as 
KROQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Pantle said he hopes that the wave won't be held back in Orange County by a 
ban on punk at the Ice House. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a much better chance of (punk) being shut down because of the stigma 
behind the name," he said. "Unfortunately, something like (the violence on Dec. 
16) has the potential of turning into a hot-button issue that could turn back 
years of work these bands have put into making a vibrant, energetic music scene 
in Orange County that helps everybody and rarely causes any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure what the outcome is going to be," he added, insisting that 
punk shows, if properly staffed and secured, will not pose a threat to public 
safety. "Hopefully, everybody is going to understand."

MOVIE REVIEW; CAN A FEATURE FILM REALLY BE INSPIRED BY VIDEO GAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Movies inspired by video games are a tacit admission that the filmmakers 
couldn't come up with any idea better than replicating two-dimensional 
characters that exist only as fuzzy images battering one another senseless in 
mall arcades. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of whether the movie "Street Fighter" is "faithful" to its video-game 
inspiration is pointless -- video games cost a quarter and last a few minutes; 
seeing the film costs much more and goes on interminably. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Col. Guile, who leads an insurrection against 
the "power-mad dictator" Gen. Bison (Raul Julia) in a piece of real estate 
called Shadaloo. 
</P>
<P>
 A rainbow coalition of ethnicities and accents battle on both fronts, the 
film's one and only progressive aspect. After 95 minutes of random explosions, 
jaw-dropping plot holes, wooden acting and special effects that would have made 
Ed Wood Jr. proud, the good guys claim victory, pick up their toys and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter Steven de Souza, who has written such hits as "48 HRS." and the 
"Die Hard" films, writes and makes his directorial debut here; clearly, his 
action sensibility (diluted for younger audiences) has hit autopilot. If the 
story isn't quite incoherent, then De Souza's klutzy direction renders it so. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a movie where a character must pause in the middle of the action to 
remind the audience, "Those guys are good guys, like us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Street Fighter" features some of the worst editing to grace a studio film in 
a while -- nearly every stunt is interrupted mid-cut in an effort to conceal 
the fact that a piece of action really didn't take place; there are major 
continuity errors and a number of scenes that are glaringly missing. 
Apparently, De Souza failed to cover himself on many shots, so this 
Cuisinart-style editing was as good as any. 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples of the narrative and technical ineptitude at work here: 
Everyone falls for it when Guile fakes, badly, his own death; after the opening 
sequence, all journalists covering the Shadaloovian conflagration disappear 
save one; a speedboat is hidden by a "cloaking device," but the wake it cuts in 
the water remains completely visible; one character, who has had hair 
throughout the movie, shows up bald in his last scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances scarcely seem a consideration: De Souza didn't even bother to get 
takes where his actors deliver lines without awkward pauses. Van Damme remains 
a glorified stunt man: agile as all get-out, but no thespian. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia, appearing in the last theatrical release before his death, does little 
more than shout histrionically and try to pop his eyes from their sockets -- a 
depressing way to remember him.  
</P>
<P>
 De Souza's wit, which gave his earlier action scripts a tart edge, has failed 
him here. He pitches this entire movie at the sub-literate set that, with 
glassy eyes, unthinkingly pumps quarter after quarter into video games. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's best gag is a visual one, so twisted and arcane it clearly must 
have eluded the Studio Taste Police: Bison has a painting of himself rendered 
in the same style that mass murderer John Wayne Gacy used for his creepy clown 
self-portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA-rating: PG-13, for "nonstop martial arts and action/violence." Times 
guidelines: Also nonstop idiocy. The violence is generally of a cartoonish 
nature. 'Street Fighter'

 Call it the Christmas rush of Oscar hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the Hollywood studios and independent film companies pop certain 
movies into theaters a week or two before the end of the year so they can 
qualify for Academy Award consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually they appear in select major markets, namely Los Angeles and New York. 
Sometimes runs in Toronto, Chicago and San Francisco are included. After the 
mandatory seven-day qualification run, some films are plucked from the screens 
and re-released in late January or early February. Others cling on, trying to 
grab for more screens, vying fitfully for audience attention against the 
crowded season's big competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the strategy, last-minute Oscar qualifiers are a costly 
marketing maneuver -- in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 A one- or two-week Oscar push is expensive, says Samuel Goldwyn Co. President 
Meyer Gottlieb. "And you're not fooling anybody if you're trying to sell sizzle 
where it doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, an early release in limited markets can trigger critical reviews. 
Lower-budget art fare, in particular, needs positive reviews and strong word of 
mouth to build momentum for more playing time in theaters. Negative reviews can 
sink a film early, since word of a clinker spreads quickly through the national 
press. And stench on a picture can often kill its chances of opening in small 
towns months later, marketing and distribution executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's a gamble plenty are willing to take. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there is a plethora of such offerings: TriStar's "Legends of the 
Fall," Columbia's "Little Women" and "Immortal Beloved," Fine Line Features' 
"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" and "Death and the Maiden," Miramax's "Tom 
& Viv" and "Camilla," 20th Century Fox's "Nell," Goldwyn's "The Madness of King 
George," New Line's "Safe Passage" and Paramount's "Nobody's Fool." 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax's ads are already touting the nods from the Golden Globes and National 
Board of Review for Miranda Richardson as best actress for "Tom & Viv." The 
board nominated Rosemary Harris for best supporting actress as well. That film, 
which opened in New York and L.A. Dec. 2, was pulled back after a two-week run 
in New York. It is still playing in L.A. Miramax's other contender "Camilla," 
released in L.A. and New York Dec. 16, was pulled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein says that his reason for pulling films 
back and re-releasing them in mid-January is clear-cut. He doesn't want his 
"sophisticated" product getting lost in the traffic of some 20-plus films over 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the movies out there now. Twenty of them are going to be lousy 
anyway and many will disappear next month," says Weinstein. "Our purpose is to 
get (Oscar) nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, this has always worked. It worked with (1990's) 'The Grifters,' which 
we played for a week in L.A. and New York, pulled it and then brought it back 
in January," he explains. "We got five Academy Award nominations. That gave the 
film such momentum. (1992's) 'Passion Fish' was another. We had it out for a 
week, but we felt it did so well, we decided to let it run through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the pull-back strategy doesn't always work. Remember 1991's "Kafka"? 
</P>
<P>
 Most don't, Weinstein admits. "We opened that film for a one-week Oscar 
qualifier, pulled it and nobody cared."  
</P>
<P>
 Duds can sucker punch the studios too. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros., which used the one-week Oscar-qualifier strategy with blitzkrieg 
success for 1989's "Driving Miss Daisy" (a film that eventually grabbed four 
Oscars including best picture), saw its genius backfire with Bernardo 
Bertolucci's "The Sheltering Sky" the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened 'Sheltering Sky' the same way as 'Miss Daisy' but it got terrible 
reviews," says Barry Reardon, Warners' president of distribution. "I remember 
we opened it Dec. 12, 1990, in L.A., New York and Toronto, because a lot of 
academy members live there. I spread it the first week of January but I was 
dead in the water. It played about two weeks. 'The Saint of Fort Washington' 
was another terrific film that just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 So, says Reardon, "if you open the movie and you don't get the reviews you 
need, you're dead. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of early hype can be a killer on several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consider that the costs promoting a typical Miramax picture run anywhere from 
$150,000 to $250,000 in newspaper and TV ads," he says. "For a studio, early 
release on a big film with maybe 600 prints could run $2.5-to-$3 million. If 
you pull a picture back and put it out again, you're looking at repeating those 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting aside that expense for a minute, Reardon suggests, "you're still 
caught in an enormous trap." That being, "If you did an early release in 
limited markets and got lukewarm reviews, you've got the filmmaker and producer 
on your ass for rushing it out there in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the strategy does work, the results can be sweet indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Miss Daisy' has become the textbook case of last-minute Oscar qualifiers," 
notes Reardon. "I opened that picture in Toronto, L.A. and New York on Dec. 13, 
1989. My plan was to follow the (critics') best lists, the Golden Globes, all 
the way to the Oscar nominations (in February). Every time one of those things 
came up, I added more theaters. It was probably the best thing I ever did as 
far as the release of the movie and it's been imitated many times sense. 
Remember a little movie called 'Fried Green Tomatoes'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is banking on similar results for "Nell." Hoping to snare a best actress 
Oscar nomination for Jodie Foster, the studio opened the picture in L.A. and 
New York Dec. 14 and by Friday it was in 10 theaters. On Sunday, the movie, 
which picked up three Golden Globe nominations including best picture, will be 
in 835 theaters. Paramount too is shooting for a windfall with a best actor 
Oscar plug for Paul Newman in "Nobody's Fool," which bows Sunday in New York 
and L.A. Newman also picked up a best actor Golden Globe nomination. Paramount 
marketing/distribution head Barry London plans to widen the movie to about 800 
theaters on Jan. 13. He doesn't fear a ghost from Christmas past: "We did this 
last year with 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' We got an Oscar nomination for 
Leonardo DiCaprio but the public just didn't respond as we had hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other studios, Columbia and its sister company TriStar have three 
last-minute contenders between them. Columbia's "Immortal Beloved," with Gary 
Oldman playing the frenzied genius composer Ludwig van Beethoven, opened Dec. 
16 in four cities with plans to go wider Jan. 6 and Jan. 27. The other Columbia 
hopeful is "Little Women," based on the Louisa May Alcott classic, which opens 
wide Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar's "Legends of the Fall," which the studio anticipates could carry Brad 
Pitt over the top as a major box-office star, opens in six theaters in New York 
and L.A. Sunday and spreads wide Jan. 13. The movie was a surprise Globe 
contender with four nods, including best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Rich, head of worldwide marketing at MGM/UA, who formerly worked at 
Miramax, is a veteran at knowing when the process works and when it doesn't. 
"It really helps the independents' underdog films."  
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Rich says that when the accolades don't roll in and the film is 
pulled, then re-released later, there's often "a feeling with exhibitors that 
the picture is tainted goods." He says, "They may be hesitant about running it 
in the future. So it's impossible to relaunch without adequate fanfare." And 
"if you, say, had two movies you were going to relaunch, you could easily end 
up spending $800,000 total and that still may not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Relaunching is the last thing Fine Line, New Line and Goldwyn are considering. 
</P>
<P>
 All have last-minute Oscar qualifiers they plan to let run through and fan out 
into wider release over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn will release "The Madness of King George" in L.A. and New York 
Wednesday and by mid-January will show it in 10 markets. More cities will be 
added Feb. 17. "We don't think it's an effective marketing strategy to pull a 
picture once it's out there and re-release it months later. You confuse 
people," Gottlieb says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Fine Line President Ira Deutchman says he thinks Miramax is the only 
player who still follows the old rules. (Fine Line's "Mrs. Parker" opened Nov. 
23 in New York and Wednesday in L.A., while "Death and the Maiden" hit select 
theaters in those cities Friday.) "Everyone used to take Miramax's approach," 
Deutchman say. "But start-up advertising costs are so high. That's the point of 
launching at the end of the year -- to generate heat and keep it fresh in 
people's minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he adds, "you want to be at your widest release, if by chance, some 
lucky chance, you win the big one next year."

Q&A WITH KIM FIELDS; GROWING UP, 'LIVING SINGLE'; 'I DIDN'T WANT TO END UP LIKE 
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The facts of life for former child actors are not pretty.  
</P>
<P>
 Most never make it back to center stage again, relegated forever to cheesy 
reunions and cable reruns. The public and the industry refuse to accept them as 
adult artists. We can grow up. They can't.  
</P>
<P>
 But Kim Fields, who played Tootie on NBC's "Facts of Life," which ran from 
1979 - 88, has made it back. She earned a degree in telecommunications from 
Pepperdine University in 1990, and, three years later, landed the part of 
Regine in Fox's "Living Single," now in its second season. Critics said its 
characters were too obsessed with male-bashing, but that hasn't kept the public 
away. It currently ranks as the eighth most popular show on Fox and the most 
popular among black viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 Fields, 25, has also turned to directing. Her play, "Vanities," recently 
appeared at the Complex in Los Angeles, and "Silent Bomb," her 35-minute short 
about a black woman with AIDS, screened in town earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
 Fields sat down at a Studio City coffee shop to talk about her return to prime 
time:  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did you doubt you'd work as an actress again? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Oh, sure. There were days, weeks and months where you'd come back to 
your dorm or apartment after classes. You did your papers and go, "Now what?" 
Then, you start feeling like: Do I still have it? Or will I have it? Are they 
going to go for your look anymore? Your look isn't even defined yet. 
</P>
<P>
 And, with worry, for some people like me, comes eating. So it was gaining 
weight, losing weight, gaining weight, losing weight. I even did an endorsement 
for Slim Fast when I lost the weight. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to end up like the people who didn't make it. When I look at a 
cover of People magazine, and I see they're doing a big thing on "Where Are 
They Now?" and, nothing negative against the people they mentioned, but I'm 
grateful I wasn't part of that article. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you get through that period? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Just knowing I had something to fall back on helped. The work ethic didn't 
just disintegrate. The doubts fueled positive motivation that I needed to learn 
how to do something else, so I'm wouldn't be 20 years old and sitting around, 
waiting for my agent to call. I would have gone crazy sitting in my apartment 
doing that. I learned how to direct and produce. I got my education, so that 
validates me. My family and friends helped me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was it tough to overcome the obstacles of being black and a woman? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I didn't look at them as obstacles, just non-changing facts. My sex wasn't 
changing, my race wasn't changing. So it just became a part of the package. 
Even before I did "Living Single," when I was doing guest-starring work, people 
were saying I was back. I didn't go anywhere. What kind of comeback was I 
making? I didn't go away for 20 years. I did theater. I got myself together 
physically. I grew up. I continued to learn how to act. It's a major adjustment 
you have to make just in terms of your acting, from being a kid actor to being 
an adult actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the value of "Living Single"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We've never really had a show like this, where you have six African 
Americans that are in the work force, not in college, that is not a family unit 
or a dysfunctional family. The images the show portrays are very positive for 
women, regardless of race, and for black people, especially young people. We're 
professional women. We make our own money. 
</P>
<P>
 We're also dealing with very real issues. Women talk about sex. Women talk 
about either having a man and the problem with that, or not having a man, and 
the problems with that, and, yes, it does consume a lot of our thoughts. A lot 
of times, the guys are misunderstood. You really don't see professional black 
men on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They think we're not consumers. It's kind of irritating. It's as if we 
don't buy soap or we don't buy toothpaste. Well, we are consumers. That's 
absurd to even have such a thought, or to think that, "Well, that network has 
one black sitcom, so that's plenty." Excuse me. It's ridiculous that we're in 
1994, and there isn't still a black drama on the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, some people still think these images are unrealistic in the sense that 
these images don't exist, like the Huxtables (from the "Cosby" show), as if 
there was no such thing as an upper-middle-class black family. You go to these 
main cities, and we're lawyers and doctors and judges and own 
multimillion-dollar companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did your show get criticized so much? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it was because a lot of people didn't get it. And maybe out of that 
frustration, it's easier to slam it than admit you don't get it. That, to me, 
exposed their own ignorance. I was more concerned with what the audience had to 
say, and they have shown their support. The criticism has died down because the 
public shut them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you do the movie? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I knew I needed to get something on my reel in terms of directing. I wasn't 
just an actor's director, nor was I such a technical director I left my actors 
hanging. I wanted to do a very strong short film. I knew short films did well 
in terms of festivals. I knew they were a tremendous steppingstone in terms of 
picture deals. I was ready to play with the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
 At 35, I want to be on my estate on a lake somewhere outside of L.A., maybe 
even outside of California, with my husband and children. I go to church. My 
studios are running, my pictures are being made. Because I don't intend on 
working as hard as I'm working right now. I got kids to have. I'll have a 
husband to take care of. I have a church to help build. 
</P>

 Barbara Palermo, executive director of the Orange County Chamber Orchestra 
since 1993, will leave the organization to join the Newport Beach fund-raising 
firm of Lawson, Grubbs and Associates, effective Jan. 2. In a statement issued 
Friday, Palermo called the move a "friendly departure," although she added that 
"the orchestra is at a crossroads and the board needs to make important 
decisions regarding its continuance.There are no hard feelings. I just felt it 
was time to move on in my career." The orchestra has not named her successor. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra was founded in 1983 by Micah Levy, who led it until he resigned 
in May to pursue graduate music studies in Baltimore. Diana Halprin, formerly 
the concertmaster, took over to lead her first concert of the orchestra in 
October. A month later, however, financial problems proved so severe that an 
orchestra concert was cut back to a two-part separate solo recital by Halprin 
and pianist William Wolfram. Levy is scheduled to lead the orchestra on its 
next program, Jan. 22 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. (714) 450-3180.

'SOUND' IS MUSIC TO HER EARS; THEATER: COUNTRY SINGER MARIE OSMOND ADDS RODGERS 
AND HAMMERSTEIN TO HER REPERTOIRE IN THE CLASSIC THAT COMES TO COSTA MESA ON 
TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marie Osmond has always been a little bit country. Now she's a little bit 
Rodgers and Hammerstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond, who starred with brother Donny in ABC-TV's kitschy '70s 
musical-variety series "Donny and Marie," has been touring the country in "The 
Sound of Music" for more than a year. The classic Richard Rodgers and Oscar 
Hammerstein musical about the Von Trapp Family Singers arrives Tuesday at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center for a two-week engagement, directed by 
Oscar's son James. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Osmond stars as the perky novice-turned-governess Maria, who 
wins the hearts of the motherless Von Trapp children and the hand of their 
father, Captain Von Trapp (Laurence Guittard). Mary Martin originated the role 
of Maria on Broadway in 1959; Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 Oscar-winning 
film version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sound of Music" has become a family affair for Osmond. The eldest of her four 
children, 10-year-old Stephen, plays Kurt Von Trapp. "He asked to audition," 
Osmond says firmly. "They wanted him. He got it because he earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The producers of 'Sound of Music' are really the best to work for. They take 
great care of you and make life on the road pleasant. So it has been a 
wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black jeans and a black jacket, the devout Mormon is holding court 
in her penthouse suite at the Sheraton Universal. Two publicists for the 
musical and Osmond's manager observe the proceedings. Osmond is friendly, 
direct and interview-savvy, as well she should be after 32 years in show 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond made her TV debut at age 3 on Andy Williams' NBC variety series. Her 
older brothers were regulars on his show. She scored her first country hit, 
"Paper Roses," at 13 and still has a thriving country career. Before "Sound of 
Music," Osmond performed approximately 250 concerts a year. Osmond also has her 
own line of porcelain collector dolls, which are distributed on the QVC 
shopping channel and at the Disney theme parks, and she's co-founder of the 
successful annual telethon, the Children's Miracle Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond's children and second husband, music producer Brian Blosil, are 
accompanying her on this tour. "Everything we want in life is not easy," she 
says of juggling career and family. "The good part about it is that I work at 
night. It's not like I am gone all day from my children. It's a wonderful 
experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to fit "Sound of Music" into her schedule was difficult for Osmond 
because she was booked to do concerts nearly a year in advance. "The producers 
actually approached me on this and asked me as I was finishing up a big 
Christmas tour in '92. We didn't work it out until November of '93," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing such Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes as "The Sound of Music" and "My 
Favorite Things," she acknowledges, is vastly different from singing country. 
"The head tones, the round sounds. . . . You can't phrase too much. When we 
started, I said, 'I don't want to step into it as Marie Osmond.' If you sing 
Rodgers and Hammerstein, you really have to do it justice. It is this whole 
different stylization. I worked with some people on it. It has been really 
interesting to find another voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond doesn't see any similarities between her performing family and the Von 
Trapps. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were actually dysfunctional," she says of the Von Trapps. "The Captain 
never spoke to them. His wife had died. He made them march. Maria brought a 
purpose back in all of their lives. I'd say there are similarities between 
Maria's and my character in a sense that I'm a very positive person. I don't 
think you are born that way. I think you choose to be that way. We are all 
dished out the same amount of garbage. One of my favorite sayings is: 'Tragedy 
plus time equals humor, so you might as well laugh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether she had a normal childhood, Osmond says she honestly can't 
answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to compare it to. Was my life like my other friends'? 
No. But we did have the same kind of challenges. Sometimes I think mine were on 
an even grander scale. Did it affect me as much as it did them? Probably. I had 
to grow up on national TV." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, she laughs off her squeaky-clean image. 
</P>
<P>
 "People perceive Marie Osmond as naive, a goody-goody," she acknowledges. 
"'They have the teeth jokes. That's all fine, but if they believe I'm naive, 
they are very naive. You cannot grow up in this business and see the things I 
have seen. I have seen everything. I sat and watched friends of mine, and I 
could tell you names of people you would know, that threw their lives and 
careers away because of excessive behavior. I had a great family. I didn't get 
caught up in that. Not that we don't all have pressures -- you learn to deal 
with them. I'm still here, and I'm still young." 
</P>

County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Performances

BOEHM'S REVIEW WAS LIKE A BAD DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arguing opinion is much like pushing a car uphill with a rope . . . it's a 
frustrating, pointless, impossible exercise. But I must take serious exception 
to Mike Boehm's review of the Dream Theater show at the Galaxy Theater in Santa 
Ana ("A Dream of Very Little Substance," Dec. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 Mike's bashing of Dream Theater's music as "bombastic" and "(having) little 
purpose except to show off" demonstrates his superficiality and shallowness. 
The music of Dream Theater is emotional imagery delivered via the dynamic and 
impact of perfectly executed heavy rock. 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent that Mike was overwhelmed by the content, creativity and 
accomplished delivery of Dream Theater. Having said this, I find it no surprise 
that his mind wandered and could only focus on things like how the opening 
act's singer looked like "Brad Pitt's Louis the Vampire," Dream Theater's 
"drab" onstage attire and how the seats at the Galaxy were "positively 
luxurious." 
</P>
<P>
 To insult Dream Theater as indulgent nothings is hypocritical at best, 
considering one of the biggest paragraphs in Mike's review describes his 
fantasy of ". . . if I were king, I would issue an edict that singers like 
LaBrie . . . be forced to wear choke collars designed for dogs that are 
nuisance barkers." Yes, Mike, go ahead and indulge your fantasy that you're 
Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mike can't comprehend anything past the bland, three-chord pop I imagine he 
loves so much,have him stay at home. . . . One more devoted Dream Theater fan 
could've attended (the) show.

 Vampire Views: Anne Rice, who has already said a lot about the movie 
adaptation of her book "Interview With the Vampire," bought an eight-page 
insert in Friday's Daily Variety to offer a point-by-point critique of the 
movie. Rice had mostly praise for director Neil Jordan, the cast and the 
production. But she didn't hold back criticism, asking such questions as "Why 
didn't the vampires cry blood tears!" and "Why did the vampires break so many 
necks and spill so much blood? Aren't they too powerful to be so unskilled?" 
She also took issue with mostly negative reviews the movie has received in 
major newspapers and magazines. Of the ad, a Warner Bros. spokesperson said, 
"It's her own doing and Anne is her own person."

 Leibovitz Sues Paramount: Fashion and celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz 
filed suit Wednesday in Manhattan federal court against Paramount Pictures 
Corp. for allegedly superimposing her shot of actress Demi Moore over a photo 
of Leslie Nielsen to promote the movie "Naked Gun 33 1/2, the Final Insult." 
According to the suit, Leibovitz's lawyers asked the movie firm not to use the 
copyrighted photograph of a naked, pregnant Moore, which was shot by Leibovitz 
for the August, 1991, Vanity Fair cover. Paramount responded that the 
photograph was of a model hired for the campaign. Lawyers for Leibovitz contend 
that "intentional copying of the photograph" still violated the photographer's 
copyright.

 Setback for 'Last Seduction': A Los Angeles judge ruled Friday that "The Last 
Seduction" will not be included on the first batch of Oscar ballots, rejecting 
arguments by the film's makers that the movie was unfairly ruled ineligible for 
Academy Award consideration. In refusing to issue a temporary restraining 
order, Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien told attorneys for the filmmakers 
to come up with better arguments or he likely will rule against them at a Jan. 
6 hearing. The academy plans to mail ballots and a list of the 248 eligible 
films to about 1,000 out-of-state voters Jan. 5. Ballots to about 4,000 
in-state members are scheduled to be mailed Jan. 13. At issue is a key rule of 
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that states no film is eligible 
for Oscar consideration if it first aired on television. "The Last Seduction" 
was shown on HBO last summer and is currently in 50 theaters. October Films and 
ITC Entertainment Group sued the academy, claiming that making the movie 
ineligible for an Oscar did irreparable harm, especially to actress Linda 
Fiorentino, who recently won the New York Film Critics Circle best actress 
award for her role in the movie. Academy President Arthur Hiller hailed 
Friday's ruling, saying the suit is a "cynical publicity stunt." Attorney 
Pierce O'Donnell, who represents the filmmakers, also said he was pleased, 
noting: "The academy tried to blow us out of the water without even a hearing, 
but the judge thought there were significant issues to grant us a full 
hearing."

film version of Henry James' "Portrait of a Lady," which is to be filmed in 
Europe, unless she can get time off to spend with her three children, ages 2, 4

 Shakur Jailed for Holidays: Rap star Tupac Shakur, recovering from gunshot 
wounds suffered in a holdup, will spend the holidays locked up in New York's 
Bellevue Hospital after he was unable to come up with $3-million bail ordered 
by the state court. Attorney Michael Warren said the rapper surrendered early 
Friday and was placed in the prison ward two hours later. Shakur, 22, and his 
road manager, 23-year-old Charles Fuller, were both found guilty of sexually 
abusing a 21-year-old female fan in Shakur's posh Manhattan hotel suite in 
November, 1993, but were acquitted on more serious charges of sodomy and 
criminal weapons possession. Both men face up to seven years in a state prison 
when they are sentenced Jan. 17. QUICK TAKES

 "It's the kind of role everyone always wishes for," actress Emma Samms of

the fact that he's engaged to someone else makes it all the more wonderful."

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; NEXT GENERATION OF 'TREK' MARKETING: UNCUT VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1966, Gene Roddenberry's fertile imagination created "Star Trek" for 
television. Twenty-eight years later, after one of TV's more popular programs 
grew into three series as well as seven motion pictures, Trekkers can voyage 
back to where the phenomenon began by purchasing episodes from two home-video 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia House Video Library is offering the "Star Trek" and the "Star Trek: 
The Next Generation" collections for members. These episodes are not available 
in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Each volume contains two uncut, unedited episodes reproduced from the original 
master, with running times of 100 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both collections feature rarely seen pilot episodes: "The Cage" from the 
original series and "Encounter at Far Point" from "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation" series. 
</P>
<P>
 The original collection also includes "Where No Man Has Gone Before," a second 
pilot produced for the series in which William Shatner assumes the lead role 
and Sulu and Scotty are introduced. Sally Kellerman and Gary Lockwood guest in 
this one, which also stars Leonard Nimoy, James Doohan and George Takei. 
</P>
<P>
 The second episode on this first volume of the original series is "Mudd's 
Women," featuring Roger C. Carmel as a space pirate who believes women are the 
only acceptable payment for the lithium crystals the Enterprise must have. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia House Video Library can be reached at (800) 638-2922. The 
introductory "Star Trek" volume costs $4.95, plus shipping and handling. 
Subsequent volumes will be mailed every four to six weeks at $19.95 plus 
handling. Laser discs, slightly higher, are also available.

AMISH QUILT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in as many weeks, Cathy Curtis has attacked a show at the 
Laguna Art Museum. The show, "Lit From Within: Amish Quilts of Lancaster 
County," is an exhibition of visually stunning quilts made by the women of 
Lancaster County, Pa., between 1890 and 1940 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The quilts are accompanied by several black-and-white photographs of the Amish 
(people, architecture, landscape), simple explanatory text, and a wall of five 
authentic Amish dresses of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first piece ("A 'Cool' Collection of Funk and Fetish," Nov. 15), Ms. 
Curtis dismisses the exhibition in a few lines. The idea of showing quilts in 
an art museum, she says, is "no longer news from a stylistic or ethnographic 
point of view." Instead, she suggests visiting the show downstairs ("Too Cool: 
Assemblage and Finish Fetish in Los Angeles"), calling it "a show . . . that 
characterizes forward-looking art of the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Better Safe Than Risk Offending" (Nov. 29), she savages the quilt 
exhibition (and another art show in Orange County) for playing into the hands 
of political conservatives who have recently won many government seats. Ms. 
Curtis evidently had her agenda in place before she stepped into the museum. 
She disdains the exhibit because it does not deal with difficult, current, 
urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Curtis' main point is a fair and interesting one: that as political trends 
turn rightward, art exhibitions become more conservative. In her eagerness to 
make that point, however, she misses the essence of our exhibition. She also 
adopts the tactics of the very people she means to attack. Isn't it Jesse Helms 
and other enemies of the NEA who politicize apolitical material, who remove 
objects and ideas from their original intent for their own propagandizing 
purposes? 
</P>
<P>
 We all need criticism of our efforts to improve and grow. Ms. Curtis is 
clearly articulate and intelligent. It is a loss to all of us that she chose to 
"review" "Lit From Within" for what it isn't instead of what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 JULIE SILBER 
</P>
<P>
 Curator of "Lit From Within" 
</P>
<P>
 San Rafael 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Cathy Curtis' article "Better Safe Than Risk Offending," I 
submit that it is Ms. Curtis' and not the Laguna Art Museum's position that is 
safe. Let's review the real risks the museum was taking when it was considering 
"Lit From Within: Amish Quilts of Lancaster County." 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious one, of course, is the show is composed of quilts, not 
paintings or sculpture or any of the other "nobler" media. Ms. Curtis' 
observation that the same walls that were to display the "long-awaited, 
first-ever retrospective of John McLaughlin's abstract paintings" are currently 
"filled with austere designs in fabric, passed down by generations of Amish 
women" is curiously revealing. Surely, Ms. Curtis is not suggesting that 
austere, geometric designs in oil on canvas by a dead male painter holds more 
significance for the art world than austere, geometric designs in fabric by 
dead Amish women. Such a conservative, old-fashioned attitude couldn't possibly 
still be perpetuated by a young, highly educated writer in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the quilts were made by vastly traditional, Christian women. Safe? 
Think again. Even Ms. Curtis knows that for an art museum, this is not a hip 
move. What would this show do to our risk-taking renegade image that served us 
so well when "Kustom Kulture" was in the building? Will our new motorhead 
audience feel betrayed, left in the dust? 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably enough, the museum is called out on this very issue. Curtis 
writes, "The culture that created the quilts is about as removed as possible 
from the urban reality of welfare, sexual freedom, Godless youth and all those 
other vexing signs of unruliness that harden the conservative's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the museum is being scolded not only for not dealing with urban 
reality and unruliness but also for downplaying their importance. I think it is 
safe to say the Laguna Art Museum has been down that road and back. We'll 
return now and again, but for the moment, we're taking an alternative route . . 
. in a "snow-covered buggy." 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing to present "Lit From Within," the museum risked a detour from the 
safer, more-established museum practice of presenting "foreground history," 
which glorifies and perpetuates the ideologies and values of dominant cultures 
and, instead, focused on what can be viewed as "background history." Kenneth L. 
Ames of the New York State Museum in Albany describes the background as "the 
place where the rhythms of life are affirmed. Memory, connectedness and 
wholeness are valued. Meaningful accomplishments are made without cost to 
others." (Background and foreground history are terms borrowed from radical 
feminist philosopher Mary Daly.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, women take a leading role in background history as the 
sustainers of civilizations, not the destroyers. They are the generals in the 
remarkably unglorious struggle to lead our daily lives. Unfortunately, the 
importance of this struggle has long been devalued by the agents of the 
foreground, among them, the press. Ms. Curtis' article is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the Amish in America is a perfect example of a culture 
flourishing for centuries in the background. Dismissed as trivial and 
sentimental by scholars who have yet to discover they have a choice of 
perspectives, an examination of Amish society actually provides valuable 
insight into gender roles, family, work and spirituality -- the foundations not 
of Jesse Helms' political platform, but of everyday rural life throughout 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Curtis claims that because the art world is part of the real world, it is 
constantly being affected by political and social issues. But whose "real 
world" are we talking about? In a museum of American art, that answer must be 
as diverse as are Americans.

MUSIC CENTER BLAST TO BEAT THE DOLDRUMS; FAMILY: THE VENUE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
CELEBRATION WILL SERVE UP FOUR FREE DAYS OF ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Looking for something to cure the holiday doldrums? Look no further than the 
Music Center's 30th anniversary celebration, a free "Festival for Families" 
with four days of music, dance, storytelling, theater, puppetry and arts 
workshops, plus performances by the center's four resident companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The jam-packed event, to be held daily from Tuesday to Friday, will take place 
in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, on the Music Center Plaza and at the Los 
Angeles Public Central Library's KLOS Story Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours of the Music Center, including a sneak peek at the massive, 
$17.1-million renovation of the new Ahmanson Theatre, will be available to 
festival-goers as well, according to Music Center President Shelton Stanfill. 
Robinsons-May, which is underwriting the event, will provide free 
transportation from several of its stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that the community understands that the Music Center is 
open to everyone," Stanfill said. "If we're doing something that's free, we 
want families (to know they can) take advantage of that." The festival is also, 
Stanfill added, "a thank you to the general public for its 30 years of support 
for this institution and its resident companies." 
</P>
<P>
 The roster of performers and artists reflects L.A.'s cultural diversity and 
represents "the highest level of quality," said Aaron Paley, president of 
Community Arts Resources, the locally based organization that helped put the 
festival together. He added that part of the festival's intent is to "disprove 
completely" the "highbrow argument that multiculturalism is an excuse to lower 
artistic standards." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give people a sense of inclusivity and welcome them to the Music 
Center in a way that says all cultures are reflected here," said Elise 
Bernhardt, executive director and producer of Dancing in the Street, a New York 
group that creates site-specific arts events nationally and provided artistic 
supervision for the festival. "And we wanted to provide a window into various 
disciplines in a fun way." 
</P>
<P>
 With activities geared to both children and adults, festival-goers will be 
able to watch performances and participate in arts workshops, including the 
daily construction of a 34-foot "Winter Dragon" under the direction of artist 
Michelle Berne. 
</P>
<P>
 The program changes daily and repeat visits are encouraged. If the weather 
turns rainy, all outdoor activities will be moved into the Pavilion.

'READY' TO LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If I had been seated closer to the aisle at an invitational screening of 
"Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)," I'd have left the theater in the middle of the 
show. This is a movie that gives every impression of having been thrown 
together during a 12-minute cab ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It is astonishing to me that Robert Altman, for all his talent, could make a 
movie that is so empty of thought, that reflects pure arrogance in relying for 
success on a patchwork of totally uninvolving, unconvincing, artificial story 
lines that, in the end, make no point. Why characters behave as they do is 
beyond logic or comprehension. Worse, the movie is unfunny, if indeed Altman 
intended to do a sendup of the fashion business. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems axiomatic that you can't satirize something unless an audience is 
familiar with the subject satirized. Since few of us know anything about the 
fashion business, how would we recognize or appreciate seeing a lampoon of the 
industry?

SUPPORT FOR 'POPS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News that "Evening at Pops" may die for lack of sponsor support leads me to 
suggest a change in PBS' approach to listener support: Allow program-specific 
contributions (" 'Pops' Could Go Pop," Morning Report, Nov. 21).I'd be glad to 
pay to support the Pops but would hate to have my dollars supporting the 
appalling new PBS quiz show and the crass infomercial series for outdoor gear. 
</P>
<P>
 I recognize that PBS needs the flexibility of undesignated contributions. How 
about a compromise: Permit 50% of each contribution to be earmarked for a 
favorite series while the other half goes into the general fund?

 For years, KLOS-FM has billed itself as the "Home of Rock 'n' Roll."In one 
fell swoop, however, the station severed its living link to the heritage it 
pretended to claim ("KLOS Rocks Its Personnel," Morning Report, Nov. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 By firing Joe Benson, Bob Coburn and Gino Michelini, the Home of Rock 'n' Roll 
has slipped off its foundation. Thank God for KSCA-FM (101.9). Maybe this young 
upstart will show KLOS that its decline in ratings has been due more to the 
stodgy sameness of its album rock format than to any deficiency in on-air 
personnel.

A LAW TEST FOR PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his Dec. 17 letter, Tibor Zelig criticized Esa-Pekka Salonen and Ernest 
Fleischmann of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for making anti-Proposition 187 
remarks while in Mexico ("Proving Music Knows No Borders," Nov. 24). 
</P>
<P>
 Zelig says the statements "demean the majority of California voters, including 
Philharmonic supporters." I wish someone would tell Zelig that just because a 
proposition is passed, it does not necessarily mean that it is constitutional.

KEEPING A BETTER WATCH ON TV AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Rick Du Brow's column on the book "Prime Time: How TV Portrays American 
Culture" ("Has TV Lost Touch With Its Audience?," Nov. 26): 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that "TV has almost certainly lost touch with much of the audience," 
and I want to add a suggestion. What is needed is a rating system that actually 
works.By that I mean a rating system that will accurately reveal at least the 
number of households (and their demographics) that are watching a program at a 
given moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it conceivable in light of upcoming "two-way communication" between 
television sets and cable or satellite companies that it may be possible to 
discern how many households in what ZIP codes are watching a program without 
compromising privacy rights? I don't think anyone would want a listing of what 
individual viewers watch in private to be generally or even privately available 
without their consent. But surely this would not apply to households identified 
only by their ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
 I would welcome such a system. I believe that if programmers have access to 
accurate information about how many households in what demographic groups are 
watching which shows, the shows would quickly become far more representative of 
what people actually want to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't watch television very often myself. There never seems to be much on 
that I want to see. I'd really like to see that change.

TV REVIEW; 'HUMBUG!' A MASTER CLASS IN VOCAL READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bah! Humbug!," the Martin Sheen-James Earl Jones reading of Charles Dickens' 
"A Christmas Carol," might be seen as public television's idea of the 
electronic fireplace. And what better time for cranking up the fireplace than 
Christmas night, when the gifts are unwrapped and the games are over and the 
collective stomachs are stuffed? 
</P>
<P>
 Taped at New York's cavernous and imposing Pierpont Morgan Library (where 
Dickens' original 1843 manuscript is stored) and produced by host Robert 
MacNeil and Jim Lehrer, this broadcast (also airing on KCRW earlier in the 
evening) is especially designed for those families with enough money to have 
gifts and full stomachs. Dickens, as MacNeil reminds us in one of several 
background narrations sprinkled throughout the reading, meant his ever-popular 
tale to be "a sledgehammer" against the social injustice and selfishness that 
Ebenezer Scrooge embodies. "A Christmas Carol" is an emphatic reminder that the 
well-to-do will also have their day of reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
 So this broadcast might also be a kind of sledgehammer against Scrooge 
politics and attitudes. (Scrooge's admiration of London orphanages is 
headline-fresh.) Above all, "Bah! Humbug!" tries in its mild way to locate the 
story within Victorian English social conditions -- the enormous gap between 
rich and poor, the sea of laboring children, working-class families barely 
eking out a living. MacNeil adds intriguing factoids: Dickens' bitter childhood 
memories working in a shoe polish factory; 1843 saw not only the arrival of "A 
Christmas Carol," but the first commercial Christmas card; Dickens' rejection 
of friends' advice to write a political pamphlet denouncing social inequities, 
in favor of a moral fiction that would lure more readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheen and Jones, two actors whom Hollywood seems to have no clue what to do 
with, provide a clinic in the art of public reading. Jones uses his 
rhythmically unpredictable, basso voice for Scrooge, while Sheen delivers a 
highly energetic performance for the narrative passages -- one of his most 
energetic in memory. A tad stodgy for the small fry, this Dickensian electronic 
fireplace is still a good place to introduce kids to the English storytelling 
master -- and to the moral that good and bad acts have consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bah! Humbug!" airs 8 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV Channel 28. A radio broadcast 
airs from 6-7 p.m. on KCRW-FM.

TAPESTRY ARTIST CARPETS HIS OWN ROAD TO SUCCESS; COMMENTARY: THE SELF-TAUGHT 
KEITH COLLINS USES REMNANTS OF RUGS TO CREATE ARTWORKS COVETED BY CELEBRITIES. 
AND HE WORKS TOTALLY OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War signaled the coming of a new kind of culture and -- as 
a natural extension -- a new kind of artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Observers are aggravated by their inability to predict what new art will look 
like or who will make it. Will it be computer art or graffiti art? Will general 
cultural trends make it more conservative, more populist, less intellectual and 
more entrepreneurial than in the recent past? Will its masters be members of 
minority groups? 
</P>
<P>
 When such questions are finally resolved they invariably reveal that the 
sought-after art and artists were already there. We just looked in wrong 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Collins may not be one such, but what he has accomplished is so offbeat, 
pertinent and admirable that he's worth attention on his own merit. Moved 
straight into a museum of contemporary art and wrapped in an essay about 
American popular culture, his best work would play as seamlessly as that of 
many better-known artists and might appeal to a considerably larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Entirely self-taught, Collins, 39, makes tapestries out of carpet remnants. He 
virtually reinvented the technique as an expressive tool, adapting it from his 
Aunt Mabel's habit of fashioning little throw rugs from castoffs. In the 
beginning, he scavenged his materials from dumpsters, burrowing through strata 
of coffee grounds, cereal boxes and the occasional rat. 
</P>
<P>
 A native Southlander, he was born in San Pedro and educated in Los Angeles 
schools, including Daniel Murphy High and Cal State L.A. Reared a Catholic, 
Collins now regards himself as a Christian and ascribes his success to his 
faith. His father, Dr. James Douglas Collins, is a distinguished radiologist 
who practices and teaches at UCLA. Expecting his son to follow him into the 
profession, Dr. Collins was severely underwhelmed when the kid decided to be an 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins thinks his own professionalism and resilience came from his folks. To 
get started, around 1974, he sold his beloved '56 Porsche to buy materials and 
rent a studio. It promptly burned down. He recouped by winning $11,000 on a TV 
game show and gave it to a business partner, who promptly lost the bundle. He 
bounced back again, constructing his own portable booth for a crafts fair. It 
collapsed. Nothing sold. He just kept trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the artist has five children of his own, lives in Baldwin Hills and runs 
a studio in the Pico-Union district. He conceives of himself as being like an 
orchestra conductor, using assistants and graphic designers to help execute his 
ideas. All his assistants are guys from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They assemble his tapestries like jigsaw puzzles, and the results are 
surprisingly rich, varied and unself-consciously reflective of ideas from 
mainstream art. Collins started modestly by making custom floor mats for exotic 
cars. Now, with the help of designer Richard Pietrusca, he does big tapestries 
depicting sports cars, landscape, wildlife and portraits. Precisely executed, 
they closely resemble photo-realist painting, with a special twist. The texture 
of the carpeting creates an atmospheric haze that makes the best of the works 
border on dimensional hallucination. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' magnum opus is a recently completed image roughly the size of a 
tennis court. A site-specific installation in the museum Otis Chandler 
established in Oxnard, the Vintage Museum of Transportation and Wildlife, it 
depicts bears, mountain goats and other big-game animals in Alaska's Denali 
National Park. Mount McKinley looms in the background; art buffs are tickled by 
the works' Albert Bierstadt Manifest-Destiny grandeur blended with a very 
contemporary feel of light and space. Collins' art welds traditional 
tapestry-making to the gee-whiz delight of cinematic special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with little craft fairs in Westwood, Collins has dealt with an 
audience that can afford to buy what it likes without having to answer for 
taste. At first his admirers were just everyday folks who didn't care; now 
they're rich and famous. Collectors include such mega-stars as Michael Jackson 
and his sister Janet, Elizabeth Taylor, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy, 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Arsenio Hall and Bill Cosby, such sports figures as Mike 
Tyson, Eric Davis and Jack Clark and such fellow entrepreneurs as Otis Chandler 
and Enzo Ferrari. He did Malcolm X's portrait for daughter Atila Schabaz. He 
depicted Bugs Bunny with Mel Blanc -- the voice of many famous cartoon 
characters. Collins still has a victorious image of Mohammad Ali that a 
collector couldn't pick up because he went to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins unabashedly believes as much in the art of venture capitalism as in 
the art of art. He obtains most of his commissions by targeting a client, then 
presenting them with a highly personalized work he's completed on pure risk 
speculation -- a portrait, a scene from their kids' favorite fairy tale. 
Collins' prices range from $2,000 to $200,000, a fairly stiff sum for a work by 
an artist completely lacking the prestige of art world credentials. Most 
collectors require that cachet to insure a safe and status-affirming 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Collins has succeeded entirely outside the mainstream system may 
be the most important thing about his career, aside from the intrinsic interest 
of the work. Artists have been dissatisfied with the established 
dealer-collector-critic-curator loop for decades because it seems fickle and 
exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' willingness to cater to clients is also significant. It points to the 
fact that a small galaxy of art worlds already exist out there, not just one. 
Each tends to appeal to a special interest like Western art or art about 
sports, nature or whatnot. If the future sees the growth of a number of 
cellular art worlds, that would be a logical extension of current cultural 
fragmentation. 
</P>
<P>
 One the other hand, maybe Keith Collins is just another bracing American 
individualist rugs-to-riches success story.

REVIEW ROSEANNE BENEFIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to express my disappointment over The Times' critique of 
Roseanne, who performed at our Feminist Majority Foundation benefit ("A Rose Is 
a Rose, but Not Roseanne," Nov. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 The show was an important fund-raiser for our National Clinic Defense Project, 
which works to protect doctors and health-care workers nationwide from 
anti-abortion violence.Roseanne graciously came out to support us, as did all 
the comics who so generously donated their time and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a benefit, a one-time performance, not the beginning of a tour 
for Roseanne and certainly not appropriate for a review. Roseanne came to our 
event after a 14-hour shoot. That she was concerned enough about anti-abortion 
violence to appear at our show is a big statement about the clinic-violence 
crisis we face and the kind of person Roseanne is. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people found Roseanne shocking, but, then, women around the world 
live a shocking reality. Humor -- when used to raise consciousness about 
injustice and discrimination -- is not always funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Our contributors and supporters may express their own opinions about 
Roseanne's performance, but because of the nature of our event -- a benefit 
show -- The Times should not.

HEARTH WARMERS; HOW TO KEEP THOSE HOME FIRES BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deanne Wendleman loves the look and smell of a roaring fire, and she was 
excited last winter when a friend who lives in the mountains offered her as 
much pine firewood as she could carry in the trunk of her car. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she got to her home in Laguna Hills, she realized that the wood had 
been cut for his four-foot-wide firebox, and only one or two pieces would fit 
into her small living room fireplace. "I know it's stupid, but it never 
occurred to me to make sure I got smaller pieces. I thought firewood was 
firewood." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many local consumers feel the same way. Unless you were raised 
in a place where winter is winter and you counted on a fire for warmth, getting 
a roaring fire going probably means just lighting both ends of a packaged log 
and making sure the flue is open. 
</P>
<P>
 But those factory-made logs, usually molded from sawdust, wax and chemicals, 
just don't have the same crackle, scent and drama of real firewood. Burning 
real wood takes a little knowledge, skill and luck. And to start, you need to 
learn about the kinds of firewood available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Firewood is divided into three varieties: hard, medium and soft. The softer 
the wood, the softer the fibers it is made of and the easier it is to light. 
Softer woods, such as members of the conifer family and fruitwoods, also 
contain resins that make the distinctive crackling noise when burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softwoods like cedar and pine usually have an aroma, which makes them 
popular," says Don Sayles of Woodshed Firewood in Orange. "But they burn very 
quickly, and they tend to leave the most deposits in your chimney." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwoods such as eucalyptus and oak are more difficult to start, but when 
they catch on they'll burn longer than softwoods. Medium woods, such as the 
pinon pine, usually have the best of both worlds: They're easy to start, and 
they burn longer than softwoods. "A lot of people like to have a mix of woods 
so they can get the fire going and keep it going," Sayles says.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to look at your needs," says Frank Jank of the Hearthstone in 
Corona del Mar. "Then you've got to select your wood based on your fireplace 
and how you want the fire to look. Most people like to see the tops of the 
flames, so a fire that's too big with large pieces of softwood won't work. It 
can take some practice. Who wants a big fire where the flame goes halfway up 
your chimney?" 
</P>
<P>
 How do you know whether the wood you're getting is soft or hard? That you're 
getting orange and not eucalyptus? In most cases, there's no easy way to 
distinguish between species unless you're an arborist or you've burned a lot of 
firewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no 'truth in labeling' laws when it comes to firewood," Jank says. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why those in the business urge consumers to deal with someone who's 
been around for a while and who'll still be there if there is a problem with 
the wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time of year, everyone's in the business," Sayles says. "All (they) 
need is a few cords of wood and a phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood that's been "seasoned," or aged to dry it out, is preferred to new 
firewood, which takes longer to catch and is smoky when burned. Some woods, 
such as pine, can be aged after a few dry months. Others, such as eucalyptus, 
can take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll soon be cutting and splitting our eucalyptus for next season," Sayles 
says. "It can take almost a year before it's ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding good, seasoned wood can be difficult, especially during the colder 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an exceptionally cold November, and we've sold a lot of our 
seasoned wood," Sayles said. "When stocks run low, many people will try to pass 
off unseasoned wood as seasoned, which you should watch out for." 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious way to tell if wood has been seasoned is to look for moist sap 
running from the bark. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it has that, you probably don't want it," Sayles says. "You can also take 
two pieces and strike them together. Seasoned wood will have that 'clunk' sound 
like two baseball bats being struck together. Unseasoned wood makes a dull 
thud." 
</P>
<P>
 Weight is also used to determine how long wood has been aged. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy hands you a 10-pound log and says it's good, you're probably holding 
seven pounds of water and three pounds of wood," Jank says. "The lighter the 
log, the easier it is to burn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The question of how much firewood you need isn't always easy to figure out. If 
you only get the home fires burning a few times during the winter, you could 
get by with a handful of pieces at a time. If you plan to light up every night, 
you're probably better off buying a cord (120 cubic feet) or half a cord at 
once. A cord of quality firewood generally sells for between $150 and $375. 
Many supermarkets and hardware stores sell firewood in one-cubic-foot packages 
for about $4, or $480 per cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the right size wood is important unless you're good at guesstimating. 
No one likes to be in the back yard on a cold night chopping off an extra three 
inches from an unyielding piece of oak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Measure your fireplace before you buy," Jank says. "And don't measure just 
the opening. Many fireplaces are made so they taper in, so you'll need smaller 
pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to take the plunge and buy a cord to feed your fireplace through 
March, where do you store all that wood? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's usually a good idea to have a rack ready that keeps the wood off the 
ground," says Joanne TerBush of A & L Firewood in Costa Mesa. "That allows you 
to clean underneath the stack and helps keep it away from rodents and insects." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you'll want to keep your firewood dry; many people their pile in 
plastic to protect it from the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine if you can keep it covered, as long as it's already dry," Sayles 
says. "However, if your wood does get wet, the plastic probably isn't a good 
idea, since it will keep the moisture in." 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, starting a fire is simply a matter of putting a few logs on a 
grate, lighting the gas starter and watching the flames do their magic. For 
those without the benefit of a gas outlet, there are wax starters that can get 
a fire flaming in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should probably start off with softwood, then, once that catches, you can 
go to the hardwoods," TerBush says. "Most dealers also sell kindling, which 
helps get fires going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the physical warmth created by the average roaring fire may not be that 
significant, and other forms of heating your home are much more effective, the 
atmospheric warmth of a fire is hard to measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all its beauty, there is a downside to the traditional wood fire: It 
creates air pollution. 
</P>

 "Unfortunately, fireplaces contribute to particulate pollution, which probably 
causes more damage than we had thought," says Tim RuthStiver, spokesman for the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Colorado, the pollution from wood-burning stoves and fireplaces is so bad 
that there are restrictions on what (you can burn) and when you can use your 
fireplace," RuthStiver says. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of Southern California's mild climate during winter, most 
fireplaces here don't get used as often as the fireplaces in colder areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to be environmentally sensitive and still have a beckoning hearth, 
consider gas logs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They burn clean, and there isn't smoke or ashes to clean out," RuthStiver 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they don't have the noise," Wendleman says. "That crackling of a fire is 
like a Christmas carol to me."

HEARTH WARMERS; STOCKINGS BRIM WITH TRADITION

 The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas 
soon would be there.  
</P>
<P>
 "A Visit From St. Nicholas" Clement Clarke Moore, 1823 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, in time-honored tradition, children around the world will hang 
Christmas stockings by the fireplace in the hope that they will awaken to find 
them filled with presents, candy and other delights. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier times, the stocking was likely to be just that -- something worn on 
the foot -- when it wasn't being put to this nobler use. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Christmas stockings hung in most households were never intended to 
be worn . They are likely to have been created out of rich fabrics -- velvet, 
quilts and tapestry -- and festooned with ribbons or other trimmings. Some are 
knitted or feature intricate stitchery; still others are simply red felt 
trimmed in white. 
</P>
<P>
 Often handcrafted by a family member or an artisan, the stocking has become a 
fixture of Christmas decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone loves stockings," said Jean Smith, a doll maker who teaches 
stocking-making at Archangel, a Westminster shop that specializes in angel 
motifs and Christmas decor. Smith's stockings feature a porcelain head designed 
to resemble Santa Claus, Father Christmas or an angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stockings are very popular because they are unique and handcrafted," 
Smith said. "The folks who create them plan to hand them down for generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to let someone else do the creating can find intriguing 
stockings at import and holiday specialty shops or even from individual 
stocking makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Third World Handarts in Orange imports stockings from 33 developing nations as 
well as six areas of the United States, said Sue Fenton, director of the shop. 
The choices range from jute stockings from Bangladesh to miniature, 
multicolored knit stockings from Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people use stockings, particularly the miniature versions, as 
Christmas tree ornaments," Fenton said. "We've also had people buying suede 
medicine bags created by Native Americans of the Lakota tribe (in South Dakota) 
to use as stockings or wrappings for small items such as jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, Linda Quarry of Placentia has a virtual Christmas stocking 
factory in her home. Throughout the year, her stockings, shaped like a 
Victorian lady's shoe (and a new cowboy boot version), are sold at holiday 
boutiques throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love making them," she said. "I try to make each one unique. That way 
the work never gets boring, and I can add little embellishments wherever I see 
fit."  
</P>
<P>
 Quarry estimates that she has produced about 200 Victorian shoe stockings and 
about 100 cowboy boot stockings this year alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of her clients don't want to be confined to Christmas: "I have some 
people who have me make the stockings in colors other than green and red so 
they can keep them up year-round." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if there's not a chimney from which to hang a stocking, children (and 
their parents) come up with clever ways to entice old St. Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 Some use stockings to decorate staircases or hang them on the doorknobs to 
children's bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've also hung stockings from bookshelves, and they look just great staggered 
along the edge," said Pam Stovall, an interior designer from Fountain Valley. 
"I've also used wreath hangers to hang stockings on doors. It adds a very 
festive touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Others lay a stocking across a child's bed. (This has the added benefit of 
allowing exhausted parents a few more precious moments of sleep as children 
tend to immediately empty the contents of their stocking upon awakening and 
will likely spend several minutes admiring the largess.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a fireplace doesn't lend itself to stockings if the mantel is made 
of marble or mirrored or if it would be somehow damaged by tapping a nail or 
hook into its surface. In these instances, interior designer Lisa Weber of 
Placentia recommends a weighted hook that sits on the edge of the fireplace 
mantel or shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of different styles now," she said. "Everything from 
country-styled to contemporary. And if you're not interested in a weighted 
hook, I've sometimes used a heavy object, like a book or candelabra, to hold a 
stocking securely." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, the best bet is to remove the stocking once it's filled as 
the additional weight can tax even the strongest hook. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The custom of hanging Christmas stockings is found throughout the United 
States, England, Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, children often hang 
stockings as well, but generally they do so the night before St. Nicholas Day 
on Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition most likely began simply enough. Peasants would often hang wet 
stockings near the fire. When Santa (or other gift givers) began leaving 
presents in them is unknown, although different stories have circulated. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, children place their stockings on the hearth -- a tradition from 
when the French wore "sabots," wooden peasant shoes. Dutch children sometimes 
fill their shoes with hay and a carrot for St. Nicholas' white horse. It is 
believed that when Sintirklass comes down the chimney, he grabs a handful of 
hay from each shoe and replaces it with a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, it is La Befana, a good witch, that children try to attract by 
leaving their shoes out on Jan. 5, the night before Epiphany. In Puerto Rico, 
the custom is for children to place grass and flowers in boxes under their beds 
on the night before Epiphany for the Three Kings so the camels have something 
to eat. In exchange, the Kings leave gifts for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's always the possibility that children will be passed by if 
they have been naughty. Or they may awaken to a stocking filled with coal or 
twigs. Hungarian children, in addition to candy and other gifts, may well 
receive a small bundle of twigs as a reminder of what they will receive the 
following year if they behave badly.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the shape or size, the tradition of hanging a Christmas stocking is 
well-established -- and beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are often very sentimental about Christmas stockings," said Randy 
Bremer, one of the owners of Tall Mouse, a crafts store in Yorba Linda. "At the 
shop, we sell kits and materials to crafters so they can make their own 
stockings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of grandmothers making stockings for grandchildren, and, since 
they make the stockings themselves, they can add names or a particular design 
if they choose. These stockings frequently end up becoming a family heirloom. . 
. . People recognize that making a Christmas stocking takes time and love." 
</P>
<P>
 Bremer's stocking is made of felt, has his name on it and a snowman decoration 
made by his great-grandmother for him when he was a child.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every Christmas I get it out and hang it up," he said.

CELEBRATING THE 12 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS IS AN OLD TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christmases of yesteryear were simpler, less commercial and, in the eyes of 
many people, more meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still remote regions in the hollows and closed-in coves of the 
Appalachian backcountry where "Old Christmas" is celebrated as it was long ago 
in their ancestors' homelands in the British Isles and Europe.Those who adhere 
to the tradition of Old Christmas staunchly maintain that Jan. 6, not Dec. 25, 
is the proper day to celebrate the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 As George Monteith, who lived in the North Carolina Smokies, once said, "Dec. 
25 is a man-made Christmas!" Like others of his generation, he believed that 
the 12 days of Christmas (which end on Jan. 6) were times for reflection, quiet 
contemplation and the giving of simple, inexpensive gifts on each of the days.  
</P>
<P>
 These gifts were often lovingly crafted items such as tree ornaments, wood 
carvings or perhaps a potholder.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a great deal of folklore associated with Old Christmas. Beekeepers 
maintained that at midnight on Jan. 5, bees roared in their hives in 
celebration of the Christ child. 
</P>
<P>
 Harking back to biblical accounts, it was also believed that the beasts of the 
field took to their knees on the 6th. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Parris, who has long chronicled the folklore and past of the 
Great Smokies and the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was even a popular mountain 
ballad, sometimes called the "Cherry Tree Carol," which told of the birth of 
Christ on Jan. 6: 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sixth Day of January  
</P>
<P>
 His birthday shall be,  
</P>
<P>
 When the stars and the mountains  
</P>
<P>
 Shall tremble with glee.

A HELPING HAND: GETTING NEW SINK IN LIME GREEN MAY BE TOUGH MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. We have a home built in the '50s that has a lime-green toilet and sink in 
one of the bathrooms. The toilet works fine, but the sink has become chipped 
over time and is in need of replacement. I'd like to find a sink of the same 
color, because our paint and wallpaper in the room coordinate with lime green. 
Is that possible? 
</P>
<P>
 B.F. Anaheim * 
</P>
<P>
 A. You may not be able to get an exact match, says Rich Haagsma of Faucets N' 
Fixtures in Orange. Most of the major manufacturers of fixtures change their 
colors every seven years, so finding an older color, other than white, is 
nearly impossible. You could try a manufacturer of decorative sinks, which are 
generally made to match the colors of many manufacturers; they might have one 
that's close. Otherwise, you'll have to get a sink in a coordinating color or 
replace both the sink and toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not be such a bad idea. A 40-year-old toilet uses 7 1/2 gallons per 
flush, which is very inefficient, and there have to be water deposits in there 
that keep it from working right. It may be a good time to replace both. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The vent pipe on my water heater always seemed to topple over. Recently I 
replaced it with some extra flexible aluminum tubing that had been used to vent 
a clothes dryer. It connected easily to the water heater. Is it OK to use for a 
vent? 
</P>
<P>
 G.T. Westminster * 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. You need to use a vent pipe that's designed for venting water heaters, 
says Ron Albright of Albright Plumbing & Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. It's 
technically called double-wall code B vent pipe. It's made from two layers of 
sheet metal with an air gap in between. This keeps the pipe from being too hot 
to handle when it's in use. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with using a dryer pipe is it's not designed to handle the amount 
of heat that comes from a water heater. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're having a problem with your pipe not staying in place, screw it into 
place so that it's stable at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We bought a house three years ago that had a newly painted exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're noticing that in spots on the trim, the paint is developing an 
"alligator" finish. 
</P>
<P>
 What causes this, and what can be done to prevent it? 
</P>
<P>
 H.N. Orange * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Assuming that a latex paint was used, because that's pretty common, it was 
probably a latex low in vinyl acrylic, says Ken Kaczorowski of Tustin Paint 
Mart. Generally, with heavier, clay-based paints, the paint dries out more 
easily than do those that have more of an acrylic base. You're more likely to 
find this problem on your wood trim, because the sun is pulling out moisture on 
the exterior side of the surface, while the wood is drawing it in on the other 
side. Look for a paint that has a high acrylic content, or go with an 
alkyd-modified enamel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is it best to apply a stain with a rag? I've always thought that with 
intricate work, a brush is better to really get at hard to reach surfaces. 
Also, how soon does the stain need to be wiped away after it's applied? 
</P>
<P>
 D.D. Brea * 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's fine to use a brush, preferably a good, natural-bristled one, says 
woodworker Steve Mitchell of Laguna Niguel. Using a rag can make a job go 
faster, though, because a rag tends to hold more stain, and you're not having 
to constantly dip it. As for wiping, make sure you follow the directions on the 
can. Usually, the sooner you wipe, the lighter the stain will be, but that 
depends on the stain and the type of wood you're applying it to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have recessed lighting throughout my condo, and all the lights have 
75-watt bulbs. I want to get some 100-watt bulbs, but how can I tell whether 
the fixture is rated to take 100-watt bulbs? 
</P>
<P>
 E.Y. Costa Mesa * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Pull off the black or white (fixture cover) and look inside, says 
electrician Andy Maher of Huntington Beach. It may say what you can use on the 
inside. If not, check with other owners or the homeowners association to find 
out what everyone else uses before calling out an electrician to get a 
definitive answer.

 Environmental Graphics has developed a series of wall murals that -- 
especially when they've been placed well and integrated into the room -- can 
dramatically change one's outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall murals extend from floor to ceiling and bring indoors some unexpected 
views -- including a Hawaiian sunset, star-filled night, world map, golf 
course, forest, cloud-sprinkled sky, baseball game in progress or views of 
Earth from space. There are 17 designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The murals (about $90 each) measure 8 feet, 8 inches by 13 feet, 8 inches, but 
can be adjusted to fit walls of other sizes. Each mural is composed of eight 
panels that attach to the wall with cellulose-based paste. 
</P>
<P>
 The murals can be washed with a sponge, are easy to remove and don't damage 
walls, according to the company. On average, it takes an afternoon to put up a 
mural. They work best on painted surfaces, but that hasn't stopped some from 
experimenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know of some people who have put them on cinder blocks and someone who put 
one on a car," said Steve Madsen, special markets manager for Environmental 
Graphics, based in Hopkins, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 If a full mural is more than you had in mind, Environmental Graphics also 
makes pre-pasted Border Posters, sold in four-foot sections. The pattern in the 
borders (about $25) goes 20 feet without repeating. Among the designs are a 
musical score, piano keys, flags, aircraft and ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The borders and murals can be purchased at the Border Store in Huntington 
Beach, Barr Lumber in Costa Mesa, Wallpaper Express in Westminster, Home Depot, 
Glidden Paint and Standard Paint dealerships. Lead Detector 
</P>
<P>
 Are you concerned that some of your dishes or other household items may 
contain lead? A new product allows you to check quickly for the presence of 
lead in dishes, crystal, walls and woodwork, toys, furniture and soil. Exposure 
to lead can result in lead poisoning, a serious health threat, particularly to 
infants and young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hybrivet Systems Inc. of Framingham, Mass., developed LeadCheck swabs, a 
simple way to detect lead in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The swabs are self-contained, so there's no mixing of chemicals, and, because 
they are vacuum-packed, there's no expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
 To activate, squeeze the swab, then rub it across what you're testing for 
about 30 seconds. If a pink color appears, lead is present. After the test, the 
item should be thoroughly washed with an all-purpose household cleaner. The 
pink color is nontoxic and non-staining. 
</P>
<P>
 LeadCheck swabs (a two-pack is about $5, a four-pack about $10) are available 
throughout the county at hardware and drugstores and home centers. Cheers! 
</P>
<P>
 A spirited addition to a festive setting: dotted flutes that echo the bubbles 
from a favorite vintage. The flutes, which have raised gold dots for a little 
shimmer and sparkle, are made of recycled glass; the dots are hand-painted. 
</P>
<P>
 The flutes ($32 plus shipping and handling for a set of four) can be purchased 
through the Sutter Home catalogue, (800) 967-4663, and at specialty shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it isn't a black-tie event, there's no reason you can't use a top hat 
to dress up the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 A top-hat-shaped cooler made of acrylic not only keeps champagne and other 
spirits cold, but also is virtually indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
 Just fill the hat with ice and add your drink of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-hat cooler (about $30 plus shipping and handling) is available from 
the Sharper Image catalogue, (800) 344-4444.

KEMP VOWS TO HELP L.A. WIN URBAN AID PACKAGE; FUNDING: FORMER CABINET SECRETARY 
CRITICIZES CLINTON FOR NOT DESIGNATING THE CITY AN EMPOWERMENT ZONE. HE SAYS HE 
WILL WORK WITH NEW GOP MAJORITY IN CONGRESS TO WIN SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Cabinet secretary Jack Kemp, the leading Republican proponent of tax 
incentives to revitalize inner cities, said Friday that he is ready to work 
with Los Angeles and the new Republican majority in Congress to seek approval 
for a new and improved urban aid package to help Los Angeles and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to do what I can to pursue support in the Republican Congress for 
my original idea of urban aid," Kemp said in an interview. "I plan to talk with 
the Republican leadership soon about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, widely viewed as a GOP presidential contender in 1996, called it a 
travesty that the Clinton Administration did not designate Los Angeles as an 
empowerment zone where wage tax credits would be available as a lure to 
business investment. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, President Clinton identified six cities, including New York and 
Chicago, as winners of the competition to gain empowerment zone status for 
their most blighted neighborhoods. Los Angeles was offered a consolation prize 
worth $350 million, but not the tax credits and $100 million in social service 
funds that would have made the original designation worth $300 million to $600 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of Los Angeles' bid -- which would have created a three-part 
empowerment zone covering segments of Pacoima, South-Central Los Angeles and 
the Eastside -- dismayed and angered local civic leaders, including Mayor 
Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 A hallmark of Kemp's public career has been his advocacy -- first as a New 
York congressman and later as the secretary of housing and urban development in 
the Bush Administration -- of using tax incentives to draw business to invest 
in the inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Kemp noted Friday, such efforts were stalled for years until the 1992 
Los Angeles riots. The riots were the catalytic agent that led Congress to pass 
the empowerment zone aid program in 1993, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, it was unfair that Los Angeles should be left out of 
the program, Kemp said in an interview from Washington, where he is a 
co-director of Empower America, a leading conservative advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp noted that his efforts, with U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) during the 
1980s, to establish federal enterprise zones were backed by U.S. Reps. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Georgia) and Richard Armey (R-Tex.). Gingrich is set to become the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and Armey the majority leader in the 
new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was not available for comment Friday but a spokeswoman said Kemp's 
offer was welcome. Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose South-Central district 
was to have been part of the empowerment zone, agreed. "His support could be 
helpful," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said he will be pressing for a much bolder tax incentive plan than the 
one provided in the Clinton-backed empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've got is far too little . . . to win the battle to save urban 
America," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3,000-per-worker wage tax credits available to employers in the zones 
fail to address the top inner-city business problem -- attracting investment 
capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Kemp said, the empowerment zones need to be given a boost by 
offering investors a $250,000 tax deduction for pumping their capital into the 
stock of inner-city companies. "By giving investors in these businesses an 
upfront deduction of new equity investment, inner-city . . . entrepreneurs will 
receive the kind of seed capital they need to turn their entrepreneurial ideas 
into a successful, working business," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Kemp said he would support slashing the federal capital gains tax 
and offering an earned-income tax credit to give welfare recipients a greater 
incentive to work. The earned-income credit would offset the cost of payroll 
taxes that often make working less attractive financially than welfare, Kemp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp recently caused a stir in California when he and his co-director at 
Empower America, William Bennett, another leading Republican, opposed passage 
of Proposition 187, the measure to limit government services to illegal 
immigrants. It was approved by voters in the November election.

 Last Sunday, the Grateful Dead took the stage at the Sports Arena. The Raiders 
and Rams were on the tube. And Arnold Schwarzenegger was giving birth to a baby 
on five dozen screens from Whittier to Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But just west of Downtown, on a gritty side street around the corner from the 
Brooklyn Bagel Bakery, an event of a different magnitude beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Most Incredible Sight Anyone Has Ever Looked Upon!" read a full-page, 
full-color ad in The Times. "The Most Fantastic -- Magnificent -- 
Splendiferously Beautiful Event In 6,000 Years!!"  
</P>
<P>
 Like most theological affairs, the chromatic blurb offered multiple meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 On its face, it stated that a "24-carat polyester gold" Tree of Life, 
estimated to weigh 3.5 tons, was to be unveiled that morning at the Universal 
World Church at 123 N. Lake St. 
</P>
<P>
 On a second level, it signified that the church's operators, Velma Jaggers and 
her husband, O. L., were back in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a show-biz-driven town where publicists and their clients are never shy 
about accentuating the positive, Mrs. Velma Jaggers, known to her parishioners 
as Miss Velma, and her husband are true standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 40 years since O. L. Jaggers first came to Los Angeles, the pair 
have practiced a special brand of fiery, glitzy -- and to some observers, 
hyperbole-laced -- evangelism inside their cavernous world headquarters near 
Beverly Boulevard and Alvarado Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the mid-1950s, the Jaggerses talked of building a 26,000-resident city 
in Ventura County, situated under a perpetually hovering "glory cloud" that 
would emit a pillar of smoke by day and fire by night. Airliners would be 
diverted so passengers could witness the phenomenon, O. L. Jaggers asserted.  
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, the couple touted the church's Golden Altar, said to be 
five years in the making at a cost of $3 million, and described in one account 
of the era as "fulgently shimmering, bejeweled and dazzling." 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the Jaggerses have inspired scores of faithful worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as if I was chosen," explained Betty Dixon, a 43-year-old secretary 
who has been a member of the church for three decades. "Everything we do here 
is positive. It gives you hope and faith like you can go out and do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the church has attracted a goodly number of incredulous 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Frank Zappa, for one, was a charter member of this ecclesiastical 
looky-loo set, singling out the Jaggerses' house of worship as one of true 
curiosities of Los Angeles life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jaggerses' pulpit, the iconoclastic musician wrote in his autobiography, 
was "illuminated on either side by small clusters of red and blue lights -- 
like the ones they use in the driveways of apartment houses called 'Kon-Tiki.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the old days, the Jaggerses remained in steady public view with their 
weekly TV church service, broadcast on KCOP in the 1950s and later on UHF 
outlets. And when O. L. Jaggers was not bearing witness on the pulpit or in 
front of a television camera, he had a habit of providing testimony from 
witness stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the preacher made headlines when a process server broke in on his TV 
program, delivering two court summonses and shouting "You're served!" on the 
air. The papers, it turned out, involved accusations that O. L. had defaulted 
on a promissory note and had previously assaulted another process server. In 
this case, the process server was himself charged with disturbing a religious 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jaggerses disappeared from local TV several years ago and maintained a 
relatively low profile until trumpeting the Tree of Life last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt God had said this is the time to expose it," explained O. L. Jaggers. 
"It's like the building of the Tabernacle by Moses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jaggers and his wife, the Tree of Life took more than 20 years to 
build at a cost of more than $3 million. It has 7,000 limbs and branches, 
stands 21 feet tall and has its own air-conditioning unit.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the 24-carat polyester gold? Miss Velma failed to provide an 
explanation from the pulpit and it was not easy to ask. After all, an 
evangelical service of this sort, highlighted by a 10-member choir offering up 
reworded gospel odes to the melodies of the minor country hits "Tulsa Time" and 
"Telling Me Lies," hardly qualifies as a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, however, O. L. Jaggers gave a brief explanation to a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polyester gold is a 24-carat gold," he said, "but it is a spray instead of 
the normal way by electrolyte." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime churchgoers say the Tree of Life -- due to be removed from public 
display after Sunday's service -- has drawn the largest crowds in memory. In 
addition to the congregation's loyal membership -- a diverse group made up 
largely of elderly whites and younger black and Latino families -- the services 
attracted a healthy contingent of scraggly Generation Xers and other 
curiosity-seekers.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Miss Velma called on children to step forward for a close 
look at the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, they will be healed," she said. "They're going to find a brand-new 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 As several awe-struck youngsters gazed upward, the pastor continued: "I see 
attorneys, I see doctors, I see preachers, I see so many wonderful things in 
these young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Miss Velma returned to the pulpit, two young boys continued to hold 
tight to a set of horns that circle the tree. Behind the pulpit, a choir member 
fell into a trance-like reverie. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the pews, some first-time churchgoers seemed somewhat less impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tree of Life, ventured unemployed architect Dotty Haight, "looks like an 
ugly brooch worn by my dead Aunt Flo." 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, O. L. Jaggers acknowledged the presence of a significant 
contingent of nonbelievers, but made clear that he was unperturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The important point, he asserted in his Southern drawl, was to attract people 
so they could make their own informed decision about the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a drama, when you teach the Word with it," he said. "If the 
church were really on fire for God, all these people tonight would clearly 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those filing out without placing a donation in the church's golden 
treasure chest was veteran Los Angeles singer/songwriter Dave Alvin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to reserve comment," said Alvin, when asked his initial impression 
of the Tree of Life. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, after a few moments of reflection, he offered a second, more 
general, thought. "Faith," he said, "is a great thing."

HAWTHORNE FACES $11-MILLION DEFICIT, DEPRESSING OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne city officials, unable to pay a stack of bills that have added up to 
an estimated $11-million budget deficit, are eyeing a long list of depressing 
options that range from higher city taxes to cuts in services to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit is more than one-third the size of the city's annual $27-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the major creditors include the state Public Employees Retirement 
System, the West Basin Municipal Water District and numerous law firms. The 
city also owes the Hawthorne School District and a number of local firms, from 
Hawthorne Hardware to Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center. Some firms have said 
they can no longer deal with the city until they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the debt estimates include pending lawsuits. The city's 
redevelopment agency, which has borrowed at least a million dollars from the 
general fund, could owe millions more in unresolved lawsuits, a result of 
business deals gone sour, City Councilman Steven Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a bitter pill to swallow and the decisions (we) make are 
going to be very unpopular," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal officials in the city of 71,000 trace the problems back several 
years but say it was not until earlier this year that they discovered the scope 
of the debt.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, the council fired James H. Mitsch as city manager, citing fiscal 
mismanagement. At the time, officials estimated the city's debt at $2 million 
and hoped that a change of management and an improved local economy would 
remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mitsch's dismissal, the city went through three interim managers. One 
temporary manager balanced the budget by trimming the city's work force, 
raising the utility users tax and postponing maintenance on emergency vehicles 
so long that the engine in one of the city's paramedic vans broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newly hired City Manager Todd W. Argow and Finance Director Julia A. James say 
solving the fiscal mess will not be easy in a city where taxes already have 
been raised, jobs slashed and morale is falling quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will pick their remedies from what Argow calls a fiscal 
problem-solving menu. The menu, which is due by Jan. 9, will have hundreds of 
options, Argow said. Nothing will be left off the list, including the prospect 
of seeking protection from creditors under Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy 
Code, the same strategy employed by Orange County in its financial crisis 
caused by investment mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very possible," James said.  
</P>
<P>
 But declaring bankruptcy is not option No. 1 for many elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not considering it at this time. I'm ruling it out," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert, who has advocated calling for a grand jury 
investigation to sort out blame for the fiscal mess, also is not eager to file 
under Chapter 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it could be only a last resort," Lambert said.  
</P>
<P>
 But as unpaid warrants sit in the vault and interest on the city's debt 
continues to rise, the city's credit rating is falling, James said. She could 
not say how much it had fallen.  
</P>
<P>
 In a move to stop the short-term bleeding, the City Council has approved 
taking out a $1.5-million line of credit from Wells Fargo Bank and has told 
Argow to look into financing up to $9 million in loans, backed by next year's 
city tax revenue. That money, officials said, would be used to meet the city's 
payroll and most pressing bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options, officials said, include assessing residents to pay for fire 
services, closing the city swimming pool and shortening the workweek for 
employees. Officials also may consider a 10% pay cut for employees and layoffs.

TALKING IT OUT; CANCER PATIENTS FIND THAT A SUPPORT GROUP HELPS THEM DEAL WITH 
ILLNESS, FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of the Wellness Community's support group for young adults with 
cancer offered to cancel the December meeting, but the participants wouldn't 
hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there was Christmas shopping to do and holiday parties to attend. True, 
the organization's meeting place in Westlake Village was under reconstruction 
and barely usable. But to the cancer patients and their loved ones, the support 
group is so important that skipping a month is a scary thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where we'd be without this place," said Barrie Rubino, a Newbury 
Park woman whose husband, Richard, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 
November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990s Southern California, you can find a support group for just about 
every vice and affliction imaginable. They have even become the butt of jokes, 
as comedy writers poke fun at characters on their way to the next meeting of, 
say, the group for Children of Gambling Overeaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Nason, program director of the Wellness Community, said she sees the 
humor in such portrayals. But she insists that the reason support groups are 
proliferating is that they work. "We're meant to live in groups," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For cancer patients they may offer something more: a better chance to beat the 
disease. Early scientific studies suggest that support groups and a positive 
mental attitude may extend life expectancy and enhance the quality of life for 
cancer patients, Nason said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wellness Community's Valley/Ventura center has drawn more than 1,000 
patients and family members to its free groups since opening in 1991. About a 
quarter of the participants come from western Ventura County, a quarter from 
the east, and the other half from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The December meeting of the young adults group began with small talk over a 
potluck dinner, but quickly turned serious. Gathered in a circle amid the 
exposed steel skeleton of a redesigned center that will accommodate even more 
groups, the participants introduced themselves and their cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Tignac, 24, of Simi Valley, was resolutely optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brain cancer I have is not curable yet, but they're going to find one," 
she said, looking out from under her baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Tignac said she is six months pregnant and has a 2-year-old son. She missed 
the group's November meeting because of a 10-hour operation, and she smiled as 
other group members told her they were glad to see her return. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kimber Knight, whose boyfriend, Aaron Bell, has a rare soft-tissue 
sarcoma, it had been "a very stressful week." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, a manicurist, broke down in tears as she told the group about the 
strains of taking care of Bell. Sitting by her side, he watched stoically from 
under the brim of his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball caps were in fashion at the support group. They cover hair loss and 
the scars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was just the cancer, I think we could deal with it," Knight said. "But 
it's the insurance, the doctors, the friends and family, trying to figure out 
where you are going to eat, where you are going to pull over to the side of the 
road to vomit." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said Bell had lost 15 pounds in the last week, his body unable to hold 
food after intense chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 After introductions, the group split up to "raise issues." The discussion 
sounded like a gripe session: 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives either call too often or not enough. Medicine costs too 
much, and health insurance companies are heartless bureaucracies all too ready 
to deny life-saving treatment. People who really have no way of knowing tell 
you, "you'll be fine."  
</P>
<P>
 But what might seem like self-indulgent whining actually serves the purpose of 
reassuring other members of the group who are experiencing the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When Knight mentions a $93,000 bill for one month of Bell's treatment, Barrie 
Rubino interjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still getting bills from a year ago," Rubino said, advising Knight on 
the fine points of dealing with health insurance companies. "Go to the top, go 
to the supervisors, yell, scream and cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino's advice had Knight laughing and leaning on Bell's shoulder. She wasn't 
crying anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 While victory over an insurance claims supervisor is an attainable goal, 
beating cancer itself is a more mysterious and sobering mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is, what if I'm not here in two years?" said Angie Spear, 
24, who has breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 For a minute, no one responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just take one day at a time," Bell said, offering a cliche that made other 
group members groan. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rubino chimed in that life is transitory even for people without 
cancer, who could get hit by a car while crossing the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Those answers did not satisfy Angie or most of the other participants. But 
they agreed they found hope and comfort in facing the fear together. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tignac, "It's a lot helpful."

CHARITY HELPS PASTOR IN PAINFUL RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Gerald Buxton has preached the virtues of charity to his flock 
countless times in his 40-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charity suffereth long, and is kind," is a favorite Bible passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But until Buxton was maimed and nearly killed by an alleged drunk driver in 
Oxnard more than four months ago, he did not realize how long he would have to 
suffer for charity. Nor did he realize how kind it could be. 
</P>
<P>
 George Yu, his primary physician and several of the 12 doctors who have 
treated the uninsured 62-year-old since his Aug. 6 accident have either 
forgiven or greatly reduced medical bills that total more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital where the Pentecostal pastor stayed until Friday's checkout wants 
its $500,000 bill paid, but officials at St. John's Medical Center in Oxnard 
said they will not sue Buxton or go after his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 This came as a relief to Buxton and his wife, Shirley. They feared losing 
their Rialto home because of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The news made the two-hour ride home easier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a long, painful trip," said Buxton, pastor of New Life Center in 
Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buxton said it has been a "wonderful trip" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Local churches came to his family's aid with groceries as his wife and son 
moved into a room provided free by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been wonderful in every way," Buxton said, as he brushed away tears 
and said farewell to the hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu said he waived his $18,000 fee, because "Rev. Buxton has touched so many 
lives here." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu was on duty in the emergency room and was the first doctor to treat Buxton. 
Dozens of bones were broken and he was not expected to live. For the next two 
months, nearly every day brought a new life-threatening crisis. He was 
paralyzed below the neck for three months and could not eat solid food until 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, as he left the hospital in a wheelchair, Buxton talked of walking 
again. Doctors said they expect him to make a complete recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been amazing," Yu said. Even more remarkable, Yu said, have been 
Buxton's will to survive and his eagerness to help other patients cope with 
ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is why he is alive today," Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is why the medical bills will not become another tragedy for the 
Buxtons, Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the least we can do for this guy," Yu said. "He has touched so many 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said they will wait to see if Buxton gets assistance from 
several government agencies that he has asked for help. Buxton has received no 
help from the man accused of hitting him, David Christopher Estey, 28, of 
Thousand Oaks. And he is not satisfied with what has been done to prosecute 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Estey would not comment on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Estey at the scene on suspicion of felony drunken driving. A 
blood test showed Estey was legally intoxicated and had methamphetamine in his 
system at the time, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estey has not been charged with a crime because the district attorney's 
office twice has sent the case back to police for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said he wants to file felony charges against Estey, but cannot until 
police reconstruct the accident scene and establish where Buxton was standing 
when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buxton does not remember where he was standing, and no one witnessed the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, though, Buxton said he never lost his faith or his positive 
attitude. He said he does not hate Estey, but hopes he will be prosecuted. The 
bills are a worry, but he hugs his wife and said he is grateful to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, he preached simplicity. During his recovery, he said he 
practiced what he preached to help get him through each painful day. It is a 
practice he intends to make a routine at home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to sit in my easy chair next to the fireplace and scratch my 
nose," he said. "I haven't been able to do that much."

PARENTS OF DRUG ABUSERS DISCOVER A CIRCLE OF STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Christmas practically upon them, a Thousand Oaks couple was preparing to 
kick their son out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 They had given the 19-year-old all the love and support they could muster, 
they said, and it wasn't enough. Again and again, despite their repeated 
threats, he had turned to drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 And as terrible as the addiction has been for their son, who lost his athletic 
scholarship and dropped out of college, the emotional toll had been equally 
severe on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a quiet room behind a Thousand Oaks church, the tearful mother 
and father shared their story for the first time. They couldn't tell their 
friends, their neighbors or even their priest. But they opened up to a group of 
strangers called Families Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have been where we are now," said the boy's father, who, like 
the rest of the group, requested that he not be identified. "We came here 
because we want our son to know that we're going to get educated about his 
problem, so we don't make the mistakes that others have."  
</P>
<P>
 At Families Anonymous, a nonprofit support group that has operated without 
fanfare or self-promotion for six years in Thousand Oaks, more than 120 local 
parents have found help dealing with their children's bouts with drugs, crime 
and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of the holidays, many of those parents had returned to the 
circle to find help coping with the tense family reunions they faced.  
</P>
<P>
 "The holidays present a host of difficulties for families that are already in 
trouble," said one of the group's leaders. "Mostly, they are concerned about 
things not working out as they planned." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jack, who had been a member of the group for 2 1/2 years, the holidays had 
already turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills resident asked his son to take a drug test before coming 
home for Christmas, and his son refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will miss Christmas, and that's difficult," Jack said. "It tells me the 
drugs are more important to him than spending Christmas with his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the newcomers, Jack's tough stand with his son was a step Families 
Anonymous urges parents to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to set their guidelines and stick to them," a group leader said. 
"The children are incredibly skilled at manipulating a parent, breaking down 
their resolve. But that only makes things worse in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group swear by the tough-love philosophy, which was handed down 
to them in booklets and pamphlets prepared at the Families Anonymous Culver 
City headquarters and sent around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A least one counseling expert outside the group agreed that confronting the 
problems head-on is often the best policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need a lot of support to set down clear boundaries and say a very 
firm no," said Cheryl Heitmann, a Westlake Village family counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a certain amount of denial," Heitmann said, the hope "that the 
problem will just go away on its own, but that never happens."  
</P>
<P>
 For many of the parents who have attended sessions of Families Anonymous for 
years, experience has proved that denying the problem only worsens it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent meeting, all 14 participants told tales of abuse, each new 
account more startling than the last.  
</P>
<P>
 One father said he had suffered through his son's crack cocaine habit for 15 
years, watching the promising young man abandon his family and friends, sell 
his possessions and live on the street.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is the lunacy of it, the complete insanity of it that makes it so 
difficult to deal with," the middle-aged father said. "You want to just grab 
them and shake them and make them quit, but they don't."  
</P>
<P>
 A father of three said he was helpless to keep one son from falling in with a 
bad crowd and becoming an addict.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our middle son has really dealt us grief," the Thousand Oaks man said. "It's 
not like he's killed anyone or done anything terrible. It's just seeing someone 
close to you make a 180-degree turn. We're trying to deal with how disappointed 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Another parent described her shame as she bailed her daughter out of Ventura 
County Jail. By ignoring the problem and trying to help with rent money and 
food, she was enabling her daughter to continue to use drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who is abusing drugs and alcohol inevitably finds their life falling 
apart," the mother said. "And like I did, inevitably you're going to find your 
children in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the stories were difficult for the parents to hear, they agreed that 
the sessions are therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to talk openly about problems and discover that others share 
similar experiences helps parents refocus their attention on their own lives 
and on the other members of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new couple, who came to the meeting with fears about the future, the 
support helped solidify their decision to approach their 19-year-old son with 
renewed authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he admits with tears in his eyes that he screwed up, we know it's 
Chapter 101 in how to fool your parents," the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope by learning from these people that we can nip his problem in the bud. 
The last thing I want is to be back here years later telling the stories we 
heard tonight."

TAMALES GRACE MANY CHRISTMAS EVE TABLES; HOLIDAYS: FOR MEXICAN FAMILIES, IT'S 
'LIKE EATING TURKEY ON THANKSGIVING,' A SANTA PAULA RESTAURANT MANAGER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hot tamales. It's more than just a slang expression around Christmas, when 
restaurants and amateur cooks are making the morsels by the thousands. It's a 
piping-hot business. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before Christmas, Oxnard's La Central Bakery is in high grind. Long 
lines formed Friday at the bakery on Meta Street for masa , the doughy 
foundation of any good tamale. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local cooks had already begun the annual pilgrimage to fill their plastic 
containers with the white-corn mixture. Manager Carlos Rodriguez estimated La 
Central will sell 20 tons of the stuff before the holidays are over to 
customers as far away as San Francisco and out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else makes it like we do. It's an old family recipe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aroma of pork hung in the air at Corrales Mexican Food restaurant on 
Thompson Boulevard in Ventura earlier this week as owner Leonor Corrales and 
daughter Leticia Granados finished up an intense round of tamale-making. 
Granados estimated they had 150 dozen orders this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a real big mess to make," she said, wiping down a counter with a 
towel as another employee began wrapping the bundles in tinfoil for steaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Homemade or restaurant-bought, tamales will be the featured entree on many 
dining room tables tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eating tamales is a Mexican tradition on Christmas Eve, like eating turkey on 
Thanksgiving," said Dan Diaz, manager of Familia Diaz restaurant on 10th Street 
in Santa Paula, where his mother, Celia Diaz, and aunt, Nora Baca, boast more 
than 40 years of tamale-making expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said his mother and aunt began making their traditional pork tamales 
three days before Christmas. He will be called in today to do the actual 
cooking in the tinas , big tin steaming pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, tamales come in either pork with red chile colorado sauce or 
chicken with green tomatillo sauce. But Joannafina's Mexican Cafe at 1127 S. 
Seaward Ave. features vegetarian tamales and also offers a sweet tamale made of 
masa , cinnamon, raisins and crushed pineapple -- all dribbled with apricot 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Joannafina's tamales are tied at either end with twists of yarn and cornhusk, 
an elegant presentation that owner Delfino Lopez-Rojas says is typical of 
restaurants in his native Mexico City but rare here. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Lopez-Rojas, his wife and co-owner of the cafe, said their regular 
tamale customers include actor Harrison Ford, whose mother-in-law lives locally 
and makes sure he has a constant supply. But at Christmas the demand grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty big thing," Delfino Lopez-Rojas said. "We'll probably end up 
selling about 5,000 tamales this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Rojas said Christmas feasts in Mexico are usually rounded out with 
quesadillas, carnitas, "the ever present rice and beans" and bunuelos -- a 
tortilla-like, sugar-coated cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tamale is almost always the main item (chicken with mole sauce is 
also popular), it can have a different look depending on the region. Some areas 
in Mexico and Central America, for example, use folded banana leaves rather 
than cornhusks to wrap tamales. And some coastal region cooks use iguana meat 
for filling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never tried it but friends who have say it tastes a little bit like 
chicken," Lopez-Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a popular item on Christmas tables, tamales have become a tasty 
tool for church fund-raising. Members of the Guadalupana Society at San 
Buenaventura Mission were busy earlier this month making 55 dozen tamales to 
sell at the downtown street fair and raise money for the mission school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good fund-raiser because many people want tamales, and a lot of people 
don't want to make them because they're busy," said society President Mary Lou 
Roberts, who has personally committed to making 40 dozen tamales for friends 
and relatives this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, they're expensive to make, but if you make them in large quantities 
it's very reasonable," she said.

LANDMARK RESTAURANT CANCELS PLAN TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like a shot of hot sauce, an outpouring of passionate public sentiment has 
brought new life to Johnny's Mexican Food, the 33-year-old restaurant set to 
serve its last burrito on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With calls coming in from as far away as Virginia, Johnny Lopez and his family 
have changed their minds and plan to keep open the hole-in-the-wall eatery that 
has become a Ventura landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, after you get all the response that we did from people in the 
community, we realize that we are not just making burritos," said restaurant 
manager Tina Kraft, who is Lopez's daughter. "In fact we are making a 
difference in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 With Lopez ailing and the restaurant in need of repairs, his family had 
decided to abandon the Ventura Avenue business. So they posted an announcement 
at the restaurant counter saying Johnny's would close at the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people calling from San Diego, San Luis Obispo and even from Virginia 
asking that we don't close," Kraft said Friday. "They were really saddened to 
see the restaurant close. It was an incredible outpouring of love for my 
father." 
</P>
<P>
 Four former employees came in and offered to work for free so that the 
restaurant could remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 After the calls and support they received from faithful customers in the past 
few days, Kraft and her family had an "emotional meeting" Thursday night with 
her 83-year-old father. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who is seriously ill, asked the family to keep the restaurant open. 
Kraft said she will continue managing the eatery on Ventura Avenue as she has 
been for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers lined up at Johnny's Friday, thrilled to see a sign posted stating 
that the plans to close have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited that they changed their minds," said Jody Brown, a 15-year 
customer who works at Patagonia. "I've got to rush to work to tell everyone the 
good news. We had a big sign in our office saying that they were going to 
close."  
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Davis, 67, a Johnny's customer for 30 years, said he and his family are 
celebrating the restaurant's future by having Johnny's burritos for Christmas 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy that they are staying open," Davis said. "Ventura Avenue would 
not be the same without Johnny's." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft said the restaurant will be closed between Friday and Jan. 10 for 
repairs to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the renovations," Kraft said, "I plan to work here for another 33 
years."

SLUMLORD STARTS HOUSE ARREST AT RUNDOWN BUILDING; COURTS: LA HABRA MAN MUST 
SPEND 60 DAYS AT MID-WILSHIRE APARTMENT HOUSE HE OWNS. HE DISPUTES CITY'S 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a brief standoff at the front door, a convicted slumlord from La Habra 
began serving 60 days house arrest Friday in a run-down Mid-Wilshire apartment 
building he owns after failing to fully comply with a court order to make 
long-needed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph G. Tabello, 62, was sentenced to spend the holidays in his 840 S. 
Hobart Blvd. building by Los Angeles Municipal Judge Gregory Alarcon after a 
recent reinspection showed broken fire doors, missing fire extinguishers and 
cockroach infestation in the six-story structure. Under the court order, 
Tabello cannot leave the building except in case of emergency and must remain 
in Unit 408 from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Michael R. Wilkinson said a survey this week of Tabello's 
new quarters revealed chunks of loose plaster on the floor, two unhooked 
refrigerators and one unhooked toilet in the living room and what appeared to 
be the head of a four-cylinder auto engine on a kitchen counter. The prosecutor 
added that Tabello's view is of nearby rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 But the landlord did not go quietly into his temporary digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a phalanx of TV news crews, he at first refused to emerge from the 
103-unit building Friday morning to be outfitted with an electronic ankle 
monitor designed to keep track of his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilkinson threatened to go back to court and seek additional sanctions, 
Tabello finally stepped outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters to respond to the city's allegations, Tabello, sporting a 
salt-and-pepper beard, said they were untrue, employing a host of two-syllable 
epithets to make his point. 
</P>
<P>
 He should not be held responsible for the lack of smoke detectors in certain 
bedrooms, Tabello added, "because how would I know there are . . . children 
living in the closets?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You're making a mockery out of me," the landlord added. "I can't change the 
lifestyles of certain tenants. I've helped the poor. I've helped the needless." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson said later he insisted that Tabello come outside because Alarcon's 
court order specified that he surrender in front of the building.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "having the news media cover this is an important part of 
the deterrent. The most effective way is not only prosecuting repeat violators 
but letting the public know." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabello's son, George, felt otherwise. "What's the matter, isn't O.J. on trial 
today?" he shouted at the cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Tabello was convicted of slum violations for the third time 
in eight years after pleading no contest to 12 violations of fire, health, and 
building and safety codes, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tabello recently corrected some violations in the building, others 
remained unrepaired, Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabello owns three buildings on the block and more than $9 million in property 
in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the state, Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This office does not go and ask for house arrests except in the most serious 
situations where someone has a record of not complying with the law," the 
prosecutor said. "Some get the word fairly early and some we don't file cases 
against because repairs get made." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson said that two or three Los Angeles slumlords a year are sentenced to 
house arrest and that "the deterrent value of doing it occasionally sends a 
message to other owners." 
</P>
<P>
 However, not all slumlords clean up their acts after being placed in their 
apartment buildings. Dr. Milton Avol, who gained national notoriety in the 
mid-1980s as the first Los Angeles slumlord sentenced to house arrest, has 
continued to make headlines for the poor condition of his rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Avol was ordered to pay $16,000 in fines and costs and complete 200 
hours of community service for code violations at a 93-unit apartment complex 
on Western Avenue. The retired neurosurgeon was also cited for a variety of 
violations on rental homes he owned in an unincorporated area surrounded by 
Palmdale.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; STATE OWES WIDOW $500,000 IN FATALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state of California has illegally withheld payment of nearly half a 
million dollars to the widow and children of a Ventura man killed two years ago 
when a big-rig truck collided with his vehicle on the Simi Valley Freeway, a 
Ventura County judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane ordered the state to make the payment to 
Mary Waits and her two adult children, who were awarded $1.1 million last year 
from the state, the trucker and his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 The state was ordered to pay a total of $558,000 in damages. It has paid 
$105,000 for loss of companionship but has refused to pay the family about 
$453,000 for loss of wages, according to Lane's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The state argued that it should not have been assessed the entire $453,000 
bill for loss of wages, but Lane ordered the state to pay the money, with 7% 
interest retroactive to October. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Waits, 42, a self-employed electrician who earned $100,000 a year, was 
killed July 11, 1992, when his pickup truck was struck shortly after 8 a.m. by 
an 18-wheeler driven by Gerald Wilks. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred on the rain-slick road near Calleguas Creek, just east 
of Center School Road. Wilks, who was driving west at 50 m.p.h., lost control 
of his vehicle when he tried to stop to avoid hitting a car in front of him, 
court records said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Waits and her children sued Wilks and Ed Miller Trucking for negligence. 
The state was named as a defendant on the grounds that the highway shoulder was 
so steep and narrow there was no room for Waits to swerve to avoid the 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilks and the trucking company have paid the family $592,000 of the $595,000 
in damages for loss of companionship. DWAYNE BRAY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CHARTER 
SCHOOL TAKES 1ST STEP TO REGAIN STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edutrain Charter School has taken the first step toward court action aimed at 
regaining its status and funding by filing legal documents with Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 10 independent schools in Los Angeles, it began educating dropouts at 
its Downtown campus in July, 1993.Its charter was revoked Dec. 5 by the school 
board, which cited concerns about attendance and financial accounting 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the petition for a writ of mandate released Thursday, to be filed in 
Superior Court next week, maintains that the board acted without adequate proof 
that those problems had not been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governing board of LAUSD had no evidence and made no specific findings to 
justify revocation," the petition states. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Doby, president of Edutrain's board of governors, said the school will 
ask that its funding be restored pending a court ruling on the school's future. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The legal papers indicate that Edutrain cannot meet its current payroll -- due 
Dec. 31 -- and because of layoffs and attrition, has four teachers instructing 
more than 200 students.

 Chestnuts roasting . . . or is it something alive?Nancy Reynolds and Fred Moch 
of Bel-Air were gone the day their landlord repaired their quake-damaged 
chimney. When they returned, they agreed that the fireplace's new marble 
interior looked impressive. But they couldn't find their house kitten, Francy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they heard some meows from within the new chimney wall. And Moch 
remembered that whenever Francy got scared she would hide in a niche in the 
remains of the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called up the workman, who lived an hour and a half away," Moch said. "He 
thought we were nuts, but he came back. He heard the meows, too, so he 
disassembled the fireplace. We put some food out, and eventually Francy came 
down. All she wanted to do was eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Moch estimates that the kitten was trapped for about 12 hours. "The workman 
had even lit the fireplace to make sure it worked," he said. "Fortunately, he 
didn't have it on that long or she could have been roasted." 
</P>

 A parking cop who's not a Scrooge: If you're going to misplace your auto, 
maybe you should do it in Beverly Hills. After an infrequent shopping visit, 
Anne Martin was unable to find her parking place -- a one-hour zone, of all 
things. Martin (no relation to the TV anchorwoman) did find a parking officer 
and gave her the license number, asking her please not to have the car towed.  
</P>
<P>
 After more searching, Martin phoned Beverly Hills police, who checked and told 
her the address of the elusive auto. The officer, it turns out, had phoned in 
the location. Talk about service. Not only that: Martin wasn't even ticketed.  
</P>
<P>
 What a fine holiday gesture.

<P>
 Hope this item doesn't get the officer fired.

 Three temples in the Conejo Valley will host a dinner for 2,500 people on 
Christmas Day. The Conejo Community Holiday Dinner will be held from 11 a.m. to 
5 p.m. in the cafeteria at Thousand Oaks High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers put together the dinner as a way to repay the community for helping 
Temple Adat Elohim rebuild a section of roof burned in a $25,000 arson in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from three area high schools, churches and Jewish youth groups will 
help prepare and serve the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rescue Mission in Oxnard, about 200 people are expected to feast on 
ham, potatoes, vegetables and a dessert for a holiday dinner that starts at 
noon today. A Christmas Day dinner will also start at noon, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is at 234 E. 6th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Baskets of food and toys for needy families have been handed out in several 
communities as the holidays draw near. The Salvation Army distributed at least 
500 baskets filled with turkeys, canned food and toys to families in Ventura, 
Oxnard and Port Hueneme, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Food Share collected 50 turkeys and more than 30,000 cans of food in 
recent weeks, said coordinator Dan Williams. Those donations will help feed 
hungry families at Christmas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it seemingly one can and one turkey at a time," he said. "As soon as 
the (food) came in, we sent them to an agency preparing Christmas baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's homeless will also benefit from the holiday spirit. The Red 
Cross said Friday it will keep its emergency shelter in Oxnard open from 7 p.m. 
on Christmas Eve until 6:30 a.m. the day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter normally closes during daytime hours. But donations by community 
members and volunteers will allow it to remain open all day Christmas, serving 
breakfast, lunch and dinner to about 100 homeless people, said spokesman 
Richard Rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have decorated the shelter with holiday decorations and have 
donated toys for homeless children who will spend Christmas at the shelter, 
Rink said. The warming shelter is in the National Guard Armory at 351 S. K St.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; WORKSHOP OFFERED FOR BUDDING ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to nurture a new generation of actors, directors and stage hands, the 
nonprofit Gold Coast Performing Arts Assn. will sponsor a 16-week workshop this 
winter for budding theater buffs ages 8 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will learn how to spin a monologue and how to string up lights, 
how to put on makeup and how to film a TV show.Though the courses will focus on 
theater, the students will also learn how to perform on radio and television 
and will experiment with such new-age technology as CD-ROM interactive films. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the course, the students will stage their own production in 
Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have quite an ambitious program planned," said Stu Levin, a veteran youth 
theater teacher who will lead the workshop. "We want to introduce young people 
to the theater arts in all its aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 And they have an ulterior motive. By sparking kids' curiosity, Levin said, 
Gold Coast hopes to ensure the long-term success of Thousand Oaks' new theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you train kids, the more you make them feel it's their home, the 
more likely they are to grow up as the future audiences, trustees and donors 
who support the Civic Arts Plaza," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, which costs $160 per student, will run from 9 a.m. to noon on 
Saturdays, starting Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested students can sign up now for admission interviews, which will be 
held in late January. No audition is required, but Levin will screen all 
applicants to make sure they are genuinely interested in theater. STEPHANIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FINGERPRINT POLICY ON IMMIGRANTS ALTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Objections raised by 14 lawmakers, including Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), have prompted immigration officials to change the way they conduct 
background fingerprint checks of immigrants seeking residency in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office announced the change in a letter Thursday to the 
protesting lawmakers.Starting Jan. 1, businesses, charities and agencies that 
collect the fingerprints will have to be licensed by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the businesses and charities that collected the fingerprints were 
unregulated. Reports of fraud and abuse had been reported in the media, 
prompting the 14 representatives to protest to the GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the change, fingerprint providers will pay about $370 every three years 
for certification and will be required to check immigrants' photographic 
identification at the time of the fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 The fingerprints are used to check whether immigrants applying for residency 
have a criminal record. PAUL ELIAS

his full-size pickup truck into the back of a Ventura commuter bus, slightly 
injuring a passenger and himself.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOSPITAL NURSES EDGE CLOSER TO UNIONIZING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Registered nurses at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks took 
another step toward gaining official recognition for a union Friday, filing a 
petition with the National Labor Relations Board to request an election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the union wins a majority in the federally supervised vote, it would become 
the bargaining agent for about 300 registered nurses at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizing effort began earlier this year after a cut in benefits for the 
nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 An election is supposed to take place within 45 days after the petition is 
filed, but disagreements between workers and management about the details of 
the process can delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Moreau, an organizer for the American Federation of Nurses Local 535, said 
nurses voted to seek the federally supervised election by an overwhelming 
margin at a meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting chief hospital administrator Ken Underwood said the National Labor 
Relations Board had not yet notified him of the filing. IRA E. STOLL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE; 
$1.5-MILLION NASA PLANE BREAKS UP AT HIGH ALTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A faulty gyroscope sent an unpiloted NASA research airplane into a steep dive 
last month that caused the $1.5-million craft to break up high above the desert 
base, the space agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perseus A aircraft is designed to carry instruments into the stratosphere 
to measure erosion of Earth's vital ozone layer.Perseus is expected to fly 
thousands of feet higher than piloted aircraft, such as converted U-2 spy 
planes, that now are the workhorses of stratospheric research. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA said the Nov. 22 breakup of one of two Perseus A aircraft it is testing 
will not cause cancellation of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a setback but it's not a show-stopper," said Don Haley, a spokesman 
for NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards. "It's the type of program 
where you can expect incidents like this to happen with much greater frequency 
than with traditional aircraft because of the tender nature of these machines." 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft was struggling in hurricane-force winds nearly seven miles above 
Edwards when ground controllers decided to bring it home. As the craft 
descended, it began pitching and rolling uncontrollably.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; POLICE 
SERGEANT ARRESTED IN SHOPLIFTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood police sergeant faces possible criminal charges for allegedly 
shoplifting about $100 worth of computer equipment from a Manhattan Beach 
electronics store, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hoffman, head of the Inglewood department's forensics division, was 
arrested Dec. 17 a when a security officer at Fry's Electronics spotted Hoffman 
putting $16 worth of printer labels in his coat pocket and adjusting "something 
under his coat, near the small of his back," according to a Manhattan Beach 
police report.The object was a $90 computer part, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hoffman left the store without paying for the items, the store security 
officer placed him under arrest, according to the report. Because the crime is 
a petty theft, Hoffman was booked and released, said Manhattan Beach Police 
Sgt. Randy Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The case will be sent to the district attorney's office, Leaf said. Initially, 
Hoffman gave a fake name to store security officers and Manhattan Beach police 
officials, but Inglewood Police Chief Oliver M. Thompson said a former 
Inglewood officer now in Manhattan Beach identified Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman has been placed on administrative leave, Thompson said. Hoffman could 
not be reached for comment.

AL MARTINEZ: WINTER IN PAUL'S GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Monette's garden wears a winter face, with the leaves of a Chinese elm 
tree scattered about the patio and the bloomless rhododendron bushes oddly 
lackluster beneath an overcast December sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a brilliantly red poinsettia, placed carefully in the center of a small 
table, adds a flash of color to the small back yard, but that's an intrusion. 
Hothouse plants don't belong here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a type of night-blooming jasmine," Monette said, pointing to a huge, 
bushy tree that dominates a corner of the garden. "It will blossom in about two 
months, and its fragrance will haunt us once more." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase seemed to hang in the melancholy air, a representation of both the 
passing seasons and of the dwindling days of Paul Monette. The likelihood is he 
will not be here in two months. The man is dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 I had come to the garden this time as I have before to chronicle the 
relentless advance in one person of a disease that has infected another 2.5 
million human beings around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 I had seen the garden in the ebullience of spring and now I was seeing its 
wintry face, the final metaphor in the days of a gifted writer whose end I have 
unwittingly chronicled. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaunt and frail from the ravages of AIDS-related cancer, his immune system 
gone, Monette has ended what he calls the sewers of medication entering his 
body and will let the disease take him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time I have bought," he said, as leaves continued to fall. "I 
must confront it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I met Monette five years ago after reading "Borrowed Time," a sad, angry 
chronicle of his relationship with "beloved friend" Roger Horwitz, whom he had 
lost to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a powerful and a moving book that blended prose and poetry into a 
fabric of rage and grief against not only his loss, but the loss of a 
generation to a disease that had become a firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 He had seen 200 of his friends die of AIDS over the years and said, as we sat 
in his garden that first time, "I have no tears left." 
</P>
<P>
 Monette himself, then 44, had tested positive for HIV, the precursor of AIDS. 
He lived in a surrealistic world, trapped between the vibrancy of life and the 
shadows of death, and was acutely aware of both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wonder where did Paul Monette go?" he asked once. "You become the 
disease after awhile, and the you-person disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 He estimated back then that he had at most five years of life left. He did not 
squander the time in tears, but wrote two more books, making a total of 15, one 
of which won him a National Book Club Award for nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the five years have passed and the cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma has 
left him contemplating eternity; "God's ground of being," he calls it, quoting 
the theologian Paul Tillich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm part of a generation that continues to die," he said as we stood by the 
back door overlooking his garden. "I've tried to humanize and articulate the 
crisis. I am a symbol without anger, hoping that the war will continue even as 
heroes fall." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We talked for an hour. His decision to end all medications did not mean he was 
seeking death, Monette said. He was simply fighting the disease on his own 
terms. There was a quality of peace to that, a serenity that comes with knowing 
you are doing the best you can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe it to all the people I buried to keep fighting," he said in a voice 
surprisingly strong. "We all have suffering in our lives. The best we can do is 
help each other and take the world seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 He worries that he will be forgotten when he dies, and all the thousands of 
words he has written, the prose and the poetry, will die with him, like leaves 
scattered by a fearsome gale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my life to matter," Monette said. "I want my work to survive me." 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect it will. By his eloquence and by the compelling nature of a life 
ended too soon, Paul Monette's legacy will be a powerful one. He has ignited 
fires that will not be damped and rages that will not be silenced. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a part of his rage, a voice still heard, and it will blend with the 
voices of others who mourn the passing of poets. 
</P>
<P>
 Monette confronts time the way a garden confronts a changing season, by 
becoming a part of it. But there is power to the inexorable blending, best 
expressed by the Argentine writer Jorge Borges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is the substance from which I am made," he wrote. "Time is a river which 
carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am 
the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire."

4 FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERY SUSPECTS HELD IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Four suspects have been arrested in a string of follow-home robberies of San 
Fernando Valley Christmas shoppers, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people in custody that we think may be involved in (the crimes), but 
beyond that we're not going to divulge any information," Lt. John Dunkin said. 
The suspects, all male, ages 25, 21, 16 and 15, were in custody for auto theft 
after their arrests in a stolen vehicle, police said. Officials refused to 
release the names of the suspects, saying that doing so may interfere with 
their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the Metropolitan detail made the arrests Thursday night near 
Nordhoff Street and Tampa Avenue. The officers were assigned to the Valley this 
week to help catch the follow-home bandits, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police warned residents to be on guard against a group of robbers who follow 
their victims to their houses, draw handguns and demand money, jewelry and 
Christmas presents.  
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Vance Proctor said investigators are contacting victims of the recent 
robberies for possible identification of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Three follow-home robberies took place in the northwest Valley on Thursday 
night, but none were by the group identified by police. One robbery was 
committed by a pair who have been preying on Korean Americans in the northwest 
Valley, and two others were committed by possible "copycat" robbers, said Lt. 
Bob Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 One robber sprinted toward a 47-year-old Northridge man as he was unlocking 
his trunk at his home in the 11600 block of Baird Avenue about 11:05 p.m., 
Normandy said. When the victim made a break for his garage, a second robber 
stepped in front of him, put a gun to his head and ordered him to give up his 
money, Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man replied that he had no money, and the robbers pushed him to the 
ground, kicked him, found his wallet and then fled, Normandy said.

ANTONOVICH URGES NEW APPROACHES TO FIGHTING CRACK; COCAINE: SUPERVISOR ASKS 
COUNTY JUSTICE COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS TO STEM USE OF THE 
DRUG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich is calling on county law 
enforcement officials to find new ways to attack the problem of crack cocaine 
addiction, which he calls "an epidemic which is threatening our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a series in The Times this week detailing how crack undermines 
neighborhoods, damages the local economy and saps hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year from a wide variety of government programs, Antonovich asked the 
county's Criminal Justice Coordination Committee to develop enforcement 
programs to try to stem the use and effects of crack. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have learned from the excellent series of articles . . . the use of 
crack cocaine is responsible for much of the declining quality of life in Los 
Angeles County since 1984, from increased crime and homelessness to a 
skyrocketing demand for county services," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted one revelation in the series: that a single crack addict cost the 
county between $250,000 and $300,000, with additional unknown expenses in law 
enforcement, prosecution, public defense attorneys and courts not included. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal justice committee is made up of representatives from local 
justice agencies, including the courts and Southland officials of the federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. attorney's office and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Robert Mimura said his group will take a look at 
Antonovich's suggestion to see what initiatives might be developed on the law 
enforcement end. Citing a rebirth in the popularity of heroin among addicts, he 
also said any new programs must be aimed at more than just crack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take a look at the broader issue of drug abuse and how the 
criminal justice system can have a better response than just busting people and 
putting them away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted that the county lacks a drug policy that includes the kind of 
broad-based authority needed to tackle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is needed is an institution within the county, like a drug czar, that 
has policy-level authority to do something," Mimura said. "It's going to take a 
comprehensive approach that encompasses all of the elements that are involved 
-- health, education and jobs, as well as criminal justice."

HOLIDAY WRAPPING; SOME PARKING METERS ARE GETTING CHRISTMAS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHING-CHING NI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever get a ticket because you did not have enough change for the parking 
meter? If you live in West Hollywood or several South Bay beach towns, your 
parking headaches are over, at least during the holidays.  
</P>
<P>
 Parking officials in West Hollywood, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and 
Manhattan Beach have temporarily wrapped plastic bags over parking meters so 
last-minute shoppers won't have to worry about feeding quarters into them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was the first time West Hollywood dressed about 1,800 meters with 
bags that read: "Happy Holidays, Free Parking, 2-Hour Limit." Officials say 
that despite the estimated $50,000 in lost revenues over a four-day period, the 
gesture is needed to help boost local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city wants to ensure there's a steady flow of patrons for the holidays," 
said John Frawley of West Hollywood's parking enforcement agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach have provided free holiday 
parking for years. It is offered from two to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners say it is so helpful they wish parking was always free. "I'm sure 
it's helped (business) because the customers are not constantly thinking about 
'I have only so much time in the meter,' " said Veronica Maguire of the 
Alandrea clothing store in Redondo Beach. "They are more relaxed and can shop 
longer without worrying about their car," Maguire said. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, shop owners say parking meters in front of their stores hurt 
business in general, especially when they are not part of shopping malls with 
huge free parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "By creating the free Christmas parking, I feel the city is admitting (that 
having meters near the stores) is bad for business all year round," said Garry 
Frost, owner of Coast Drug in Hermosa Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frost has been in business for more than 20 years and says there were no 
parking meters on the street when he moved there. "We didn't realize the meters 
were going to end up driving people away," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers say that what they appreciate is the convenience, not the saving of a 
couple of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pain to have to carry change," said Redondo Beach shopper Terry 
Berger. "I raided my daughter's piggy bank before I came here because I didn't 
know it was free."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, however, is that free parking is only available for two hours. If 
shoppers stay longer, they have to move their cars or risk getting a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's free it should be free all the time," said Joe Woodard, who was upset 
that he had to move his car after dinner in a Hermosa Beach restaurant when he 
wanted to shoot pool a few steps away.  
</P>
<P>
 But some store owners say meter maids should strictly enforce the two-hour 
limit to prevent non-shoppers from using the premium spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "People read 'two hours' and they hear 'all day,' " said Jeffrey Scott, owner 
of Jeffrey Scott Clothing for Men in Redondo Beach. "It's a nice thing we're 
doing for our clients, if it's not abused. (The sign) should be very explicit 
in saying . . . 'Ho, ho, ho, after two hours you go, go, go.' "

SLUGS, NOT HUGS, FOR BARNEY; COMPUTERS: CALTECH STUDENTS, USING THE INTERNET, 
CREATE AN EVIL TWIN FOR THE BELOVED PURPLE DINOSAUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's Christmas, and the relentless good cheer of television's saccharine 
dinosaur, Barney, is wearing down parents everywhere. But now they have a place 
to turn: cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, Barney! Meet your evil twin, brought to you by two Caltech students via 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Evil Barney is purple and pudgy, the spittin' image of the original. But this 
one really spits. This one's more likely to murder nice suburban moms. ("I love 
you, you love me, let me have your family.") This one gives no hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Evil Barney is on Internet's World Wide Web, a twisted file created by 
students Mike Agney and Joe Cates at Caltech, home of 22 Nobel prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Web's Barney file -- which offers text, pictures and sound to millions of 
users -- includes stories about the Purple One turned serial killer and audio 
clips headlined: "And you will know the beast by his voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Agney, an undergraduate, did not return calls for comment. Cates, a graduate 
student, declined comment, saying he is already in enough trouble after 
Newsweek recently ran a small item on the Barney file. Cates works in the 
university's famous Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories, which would rather be 
known for its fluids research.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Newsweek item ran in October, so many people logged onto the Barney 
file -- up to 10,000 a week -- that the graduate lab's computers shut down 
twice. Some of those who checked out the file were true Barney lovers who 
assumed they were logging onto a fan club; Newsweek's item neglected to say 
that the Barney page is actually an anti -Barney page. And it's hard to tell 
from the Internet address, which is "galcit" at Caltech 
(http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/ta/barney/barney.html).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Barney file is not sanctioned by Caltech, which provides Internet access 
to any student through its university account, said university spokesman Max 
Benavidez. Caltech does not regulate what students put out on the Internet, 
which charges the university a flat rate for its accounts with no extra charge 
for users who create files like Evil Barney. "Not everybody wants to be part of 
Barney's happy family," Benavidez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not the letter-writers to an Agney-Cates feature, "Ask Dr. Barney 
Hate Mail." 
</P>
<P>
 "DIE DIE DIE!!!" writes one. "I hate you and all of your musty little rug-rat 
friends!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Evil Barney hallucinates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mister Rogers speaks to me sometimes when I'm telling the kids to love me," 
the anti-dinosaur laments. "He says, 'You've gone too far, I only asked them to 
be my neighbor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the only anti-Barney file on the Internet. There's also the Jihad 
to Destroy Barney; Barney on the Prowl, and a bulletin board devoted entirely 
to Barney hatred. The address: alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die.  
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas.

POWER OUTAGE HITS 2 LARGE SHOPPING MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last-minute Christmas shopping became a little more stressful Friday when a 
power outage struck Thousand Oaks' two largest shopping malls, trapping 
customers in elevators and leaving hundreds of shoppers to wander into dark 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage, apparently caused by an underground explosion, occurred about 6:20 
p.m., when malls were jammed with shoppers and restaurants full of diners, 
merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also darkened traffic signals and streets lights throughout the city's 
central business district, contributing to minor traffic accidents but no 
reports of injury or arrest, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of confused people and a lot of angry people," said a woman 
in The Oaks' shopping center information booth, who refused to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 to 25 people were trapped in the mall's main elevator, said Fred W. 
Baugher, a Ventura County Fire Department official at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Bullock's department store customers in The Oaks were stuck in a darkened 
elevator between floors for about 45 minutes, fire officials said. They were 
freed when power was restored at the mall about 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were OK; it looks like they had a good sense of humor about it," said 
Amy Lang, a security guard at the department store. Only half the 144-store 
mall went black, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With many stores shut down, customers wandered out to the parking lot, relying 
on the flashlight beams from security guards to find their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the 35 stores at the Janss Mall lost power, which was restored, 
along with the rest of the area, 10 minutes after The Oaks'. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our own generator," Toys 'R' Us Manager Randy Malag said. "We have to 
keep our customers happy."  
</P>
<P>
 In all, 720 Southern California Edison customers went black, said area manager 
Adrienne Tullis. Times staff photographer Frank Wiese contributed to this 
story.

TALE OF JESUS' BIRTH PROVIDES LOOK AT SOCIAL CLIMATE OF THE TIMES; HISTORY: 
SCHOLARS SAY MARY AND JOSEPH LIVED IN AN OPPRESSIVE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY WERE 
HEAVILY TAXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religion News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a cold Mediterranean night nearly 2,000 years ago. Joseph and a pregnant 
Mary are trudging through rough terrain on donkey and foot, making the 100-mile 
trip from Nazareth to Joseph's hometown, Bethlehem.  
</P>
<P>
 Had it been a voluntary trip, the couple might have chosen to travel in the 
dry season. But they had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for tax reasons that Mary and Joseph headed to Bethlehem, according to 
the story of Jesus' birth in the Gospel of Luke. Far away in Rome, the emperor 
Caesar Augustus had demanded a census be taken of all his conquered lands so he 
might know what he would collect in taxes. In those days, taxes were paid in 
crops and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Joseph, New Testament scholars say, lived in an oppressive society. 
They were heavily taxed by local and faraway rulers who, some scholars believe, 
demanded as much as 50% to 60% of what the common people grew and owned. Unlike 
the American system, which uses taxes to help the less fortunate, Mary and 
Joseph's taxes were used to boost the wealth of rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caesar decrees all the world to be taxed," said Richard Horsley, author of 
"Liberation of Christmas," a book about the social and political climate at the 
time of Jesus' birth. "So Joseph takes Mary back to Bethlehem. We could 
reasonably assume that Joseph had been farming there but couldn't make it. He 
probably left Bethlehem because of debt and went about 100 miles from his home 
to find work." 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar was so tax-hungry, Horsley says, that if someone couldn't pay, the 
Romans would force the peasants to go back home and farm the land again -- even 
though they left because they couldn't make it. He suspects that Joseph, cast 
in biblical literature as a carpenter or woodworker, was actually a "downwardly 
mobile" peasant who had lost his land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although some scholars disagree about whether an actual census took place -- 
believing it came years after the birth -- they don't dispute that the peasants 
at the time Jesus was born lived in an atmosphere of upheaval and social 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jesus was born, Herod the Great was king and ruled Judea, Samaria and 
Galilee as a police state. Herod was known as a "client king," appointed by 
Rome to run a huge kingdom of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Horsley suggests a tense and often confrontational relationship existed 
between the farmers, fishermen and townspeople of Galilee and Herod, Roman 
officials and the urban aristocracy, who held all the wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that Herod was brutal," adds Douglas Oakman, a religion professor 
at Pacific Lutheran University. "Jesus was born into essentially a third-world 
context under a military dictatorship. It was a society where everyone was 
coerced." 
</P>
<P>
 As in most agrarian societies, about 10% of the population was born into 
nobility and lived lavishly. The remaining 90% worked the fields around 
Nazareth, growing grapes, olives and grain, Horsley said. In Bethlehem, where 
it is drier, sheep and goats were raised. The people were subsistence farmers, 
raising one bag of food for themselves and one for Herod or Caesar, Oakman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some may have been better off than others -- and we're talking about 
approximately 90% of the Mediterranean population -- but most peasants lived a 
precarious existence," biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan said in an 
interview in Christian Century magazine. "I think it's safe to say that by our 
standards, injustice was built into this system -- 10% at the top controlled 
virtually everything." 
</P>
<P>
 While the rich prospered, the peasants suffered. And their hatred for Herod 
and the Romans grew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jews hated him because he had a reputation as a murderer and a thug," 
said the Rev. John P. Meier, a biblical scholar and professor of religion at 
the Catholic University of America. "Certainly there was tension. No one likes 
to have a murderer living over them or be heavily taxed." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole concept of civil rights did not exist," said Meier, author of "A 
Marginal Jew," a landmark study of the historical Jesus. "If Herod wanted to do 
away with you, he could slit the throat of anybody he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand society at that time, it is necessary to understand the 
Mediterranean culture, says scholar Bruce J. Malina, a theology professor at 
Creighton University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main feature of life then was gender separation," said Malina. "It was a 
male-female world where they never met each other unless it was in bed." 
</P>
<P>
 The women stayed near the tiny two-room houses, caring for the children, the 
garden and chickens. They fetched water, cooked in a semipublic courtyard and 
milked goats, which is what scholars imagine Mary did too. Men worked in the 
fields, or in the case of Joseph, with their hands, carving stone or building 
houses.

ARTIST VIC JOACHIM SMITH, AN O.C. PROFESSOR, DEAD AT 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Artist Vic Joachim Smith, who lived and taught in Orange County for years, has 
died of cancer at 65.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a professor emeritus of art at Cal State Fullerton, had been living in 
Mendocino in recent years. He died Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Grand Island, Neb., in 1929, Smith grew up near Portland, where he 
developed a lifelong love of the natural world. As a teen-ager in Long Beach, 
he worked as a free-lance commercial artist and as a free-lance cartoonist for 
Playboy, Esquire and Mickey Mouse comic books. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, Smith attended Long 
Beach City College, Orange Coast College and Long Beach State College (now Cal 
State Long Beach), where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in art. He 
began his long teaching career at Cal State Fullerton in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1960s were the heyday of Finish Fetish art in Southern 
California, Smith and his circle of devoted students "did not want things too 
slick or too easy, much less too L.A.," as he wrote in the catalogue 
accompanying "Toward Stillness," an exhibition at the Laguna Art Museum last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want our work too urban, street-smart and glib. Above (or below) 
all, we did not want to be 'tough-minded' so much as grounded," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Smith stressed the importance of gesture and the activity of "moving 
through the canvas in small, densely layered increments." 
</P>
<P>
 For Smith, whose early '60s trip to the Far East was a life-changing 
experience, inspiration for paintings came from the landscape and Eastern and 
Native American philosophies, as much as from the meditative work of such 
fellow artists as Agnes Martin, Mark Tobey and John McLaughlin, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the late 1950s, Smith was regularly included in group shows at 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, the Laguna Beach Art Assn. (now Laguna Art Museum), 
Long Beach Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Oakland Art 
Museum, San Francisco Museum of Art and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morphologie Autre", a 1962 group exhibition in Turin, Italy, placed Smith in 
the context of the metaphysical philosophies of Lao Tzu and others. Three other 
European shows of the '60s, which took place in Turin and Milan, placed Smith 
in the company of such American luminaries as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, 
Willem De Kooning, Sam Francis and Louise Nevelson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith mistrusted the art scene, ceasing to show in commercial galleries in 
1970 and subsequently doing nothing to encourage any exhibition of his work. 
Several years later, he stopped painting, though he did continue to make 
delicately evocative pen-and-ink drawings of the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, Smith moved from Laguna Hills to Carbon Canyon, where he became an 
environmental activist. As a founding member of LIFE (Linking Intercounties for 
Environment), he worked on legislation to preserve the Chino Hills area, 
including the designation of Carbon Canyon Road as a scenic corridor and the 
creation of Chino Hills State Park, a 13,500-acre wildlife and hiking preserve 
spanning Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties.

RASH OF CRIMES LEAVES 1 MAN DEAD; VIOLENCE: MARTIN HIDALGO IS FATALLY STABBED 
IN OXNARD. IN ANOTHER CASE, A LARGE GANG BRAWL ERUPTS OUTSIDE A CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A spate of late-night crimes in Oxnard and Ventura has left one man dead, 
another seriously wounded and several more bruised from a large gang brawl 
outside a notoriously rowdy nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities on Friday were also investigating a Ventura man arrested on 
suspicion of assaulting his 18-year-old wife and an incident in which three 
teen-agers were threatened at gunpoint in retaliation for an earlier assault. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most serious incident, 24-year-old Martin Jesus Hidalgo was fatally 
stabbed Thursday just before midnight at an apartment in the 1400 block of 
Fremont Way in north Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing was first reported as a shooting by a next-door neighbor. When 
officers arrived, Hidalgo already had been taken to the hospital, but there 
were signs that a violent struggle had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Occupants of the apartment told police that Hidalgo and another man were 
intruders in the apartment. Other details remain sketchy, and officers said 
they do not know the motive for the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a woman and man inside the apartment refused to comment. Drops of 
what appeared to be blood stained the dingy stairwell leading to the 
second-floor apartment, and a large upstairs window had been shattered. On a 
glass pane, someone had scrawled the name of an Oxnard gang. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor said she heard shouting coming from the apartment followed a 
short time later by police and fire sirens. Others said they heard the sirens, 
but were afraid to go outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to know what's going on over there because I've got kids," said a 
woman, who did not want to be identified. "You never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said Hidalgo died at 3:37 a.m. during surgery at 
St. John's Regional Medical Center. Doctors were unable to stop the bleeding 
from the stab wounds in Hidalgo's upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other incidents took place in Ventura and El Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred about 6:30 a.m. Thursday when 30-year-old John Williams was 
arrested on suspicion of trying to choke his 18-year-old wife, Carrie, at her 
home on East Warner Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was booked into Ventura County Jail and was being held Friday in lieu 
of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, at about 9:30, police arrested Jason Friedman, 20, Dustin 
Peck, 21, and a 17-year-old boy on suspicion of threatening a trio of juveniles 
with a handgun. The threats, made at a home in the 300 block of South 
Brookshire Avenue, were in retaliation for an earlier beating, Ventura police 
said. Both Friedman and Peck remained in County Jail late Friday. They were 
each being held on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later in El Rio, 23-year-old Steve Murillo was arrested on suspicion 
of stabbing an acquaintance, Albert Aparicio, 23, of El Rio. Before the 
assault, the two had been drinking together in a neighborhood bar. Murillo was 
booked into County Jail and was being held in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Aparicio was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he was listed 
in serious but stable condition late Thursday. A hospital spokeswoman refused 
to release any information about Aparicio's condition on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final incident, Ventura police were called at 1:40 a.m. to break up a 
large melee among three gangs outside the Metro Bay Club at 317 E. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that numerous people were waving guns or beating other 
patrons who had exited the bar. It took nine Ventura officers and a sheriff's 
deputy 20 minutes to break up the fights in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one person, 28-year-old Anthony Lozano, was arrested, on suspicion of 
fighting in public. Those who suffered injuries in the brawl left without 
seeking medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Velez said the fight started as a verbal confrontation inside the 
club, which has become known as a trouble spot in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the cause of the brawl, he said: "Too much testosterone and too 
much alcohol. That's as succinct as I can put it."

JONES HAS A BIG FINISH FOR LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: HE SCORES 14 OF HIS 27 
POINTS IN FOURTH QUARTER OF 100-89 VICTORY OVER SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos was human, Vlade Divac was doing his best work when the other 
team had the ball, and Nick Van Exel was getting an unscheduled rest, so the 
Lakers looked for someone else to carry them across the line Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Jones was an unlikely target only because of his scrawny frame. 
Undeterred, he shouldered the responsibility and delivered as the latest hero, 
making all five of his fourth-quarter shots, including a pair of three-point 
baskets, and scoring 14 of his game-high 27 points in the final period to lift 
the Lakers to a 100-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings before 12,637 at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of five of their last six and 12 of 15, the Lakers struggled all night 
to find breathing room against Sacramento, something they should have been used 
to after last season. But when Jones made consecutive three-pointers with 10:00 
and then 9:22 remaining, the lead was 80-71. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make sure, Jones answered every time the Kings closed again. At 94-87, 
he drove the lane, hung, and dropped in a short jumper. At 96-89, he bolted for 
a dunk, slamming the door shut for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just open shots I had to take," Jones said. "Nothing more. Open shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Laker Coach Del Harris of the key three-point shots: "Those were big 
shots, no question. And he had 'em all the way. He shot both with a lot of 
confidence. Those are the kind of things that kept them (the Kings) from having 
a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dunk was kind of the last nail in the coffin." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers played most of the way down the stretch without Van Exel, who left 
the game with 20 seconds to go in the third quarter after getting hit on the 
hand and stayed on the bench during most of the fourth quarter as Harris went 
with Jones, Sedale Threatt and Tony Smith in a three-guard alignment. Van Exel 
returned with 2:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team was going good," Van Exel said. "He asked me if I wanted to go back 
in. I said, 'No, we're going good.' Why mess that up?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are as big a success story as the Lakers, having come in with the 
second-biggest turnaround in the league, seven games, and winners of seven of 
their previous 10 outings.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers built a seven-point lead in the first quarter, had that erased 
within 62 seconds, fell behind by four in the second quarter and settled for a 
46-46 tie at intermission. Their introduction to the Kings' improved play 
inside was getting outrebounded in the first half, 33-22, including 15-8 on 
offense, with Olden Polynice collecting seven of his 13 boards there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Polynice had 18 rebounds -- eight on the offensive end -- and 16 
points, but no other Sacramento big man did any damage on the boards as the 
Kings finished with a 50-43 advantage. Mitch Richmond added 25 points and Walt 
Williams had 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, meanwhile, were solid, if unspectacular, inside. Divac made only 
five of 14 shots, but countered with 10 rebounds and a career-high eight 
blocks. Elden Campbell had nine boards and five blocks, and Ceballos, coming 
off his 50-point explosion, contributed 21 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big fellas really did an outstanding job," Harris said. "Particularly in 
the second half, when we were able to win the rebounding game after getting 
outrebounded in the first half. And I thought they played individual defense 
well. Fourteen blocked shots is really an impressive stat." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a season high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Little of the success of Cedric Ceballos has been unexpected -- not the 22.4 
points per game coming in, not the 8.9 rebounds and not the 50.5%. But the 15 
three-point shots? That's unexpected. He was only two of 23 from long distance 
in the first four seasons of his career as a Phoenix Sun, but has proven 
respectable as a Laker. In the eight games before Friday, he had three 
three-pointers on three occasions and two on two others. It was the third on 
Tuesday against Minnesota, with 5.7 seconds remaining, that made him the first 
Laker since Gail Goodrich in 1975 to score 50 points in a game. "I had the 
ability to make the threes, but I wasn't allowed to shoot them," Ceballos said 
of his time with the Suns. "We had a lot of three-point shooters, so there 
wasn't the need." And now? "It's helped me out a lot," he said.

RAIDER-CHIEF SEASON FINALE OFFERS A BIT OF EVERYTHING; PRO FOOTBALL: THERE'S A 
LOT AT STAKE WHEN KANSAS CITY VISITS THE SOLD-OUT COLISEUM TODAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Dramatic climax or disappointing anticlimax? 
</P>
<P>
 Historic farewell or playoff preview? 
</P>
<P>
 Last hurrah or renewed quest? 
</P>
<P>
 All things are possible, but nothing is definite on this final day of the 
regular season for the Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the day: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders learn if they are going to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL may say goodby to the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana may be playing his last game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (9-6) will play the Kansas City Chiefs (8-7) before the first 
sellout crowd of the year at the Coliseum. That much is known. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a day of high drama with the teams battling down to the final tick 
of the clock for the last remaining AFC wild-card playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the Raiders could be handed a postseason berth before the clock even starts 
ticking. If the New England Patriots lose to the Chicago Bears in a game that 
will probably be over before the Raiders and Chiefs kick off, then the Raiders 
are automatically in, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders probably will also know before kickoff if they have a shot at a 
home playoff game next weekend. That will occur only if they win and the 
Cleveland Browns lose to the Seattle Seahawks in another game that will 
probably be over before the Raiders and Chiefs get started. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kansas City, there are no such complications. If the Chiefs win, they're 
in. If they lose, they're out. 
</P>
<P>
 If Raider Coach Art Shell has his way, his players will be shielded from 
out-of-town scores until their own game is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to know and I don't want them to know," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation about this being the final NFL game in the Coliseum is valid, 
considering the Raiders' efforts to build a new stadium and to explore the 
possibility of finding a new temporary site until their ultimate home is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no playoff game here and the Raiders do indeed desert the 
71-year-old stadium, it will mark the end of an era that began nearly half a 
century ago with the arrival of the Cleveland Rams in 1946. They called the 
Coliseum home for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other pro teams, the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football 
Conference, the Los Angeles Chargers of the American Football League and the 
Los Angeles Express of the United States Football League, also played at the 
Coliseum. The Dons folded in the late 1940s, the Chargers moved to San Diego 
after one season in the early '60s, and the Express folded, along with the 
USFL, in 1985 after three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is truly the last Coliseum game, it is fitting that Kansas City 
running back Marcus Allen will be on the field. He is probably more identified 
with the stadium than any other active player, having played there for four 
years as a USC Trojan and for 11 seasons as a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana said before the start of the season that he would decide at the end of 
the season if this was his last. He would love to return to the Super Bowl one 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders would love to end his season today, but they know that won't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders hold a 35-31-2 edge over Kansas City in a great rivalry that goes 
back to the AFL days. But the teams have met 10 times in the '90s and Kansas 
City has won nine of those games, including a 1991 playoff game that eliminated 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous meeting this season, the Chiefs won, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That, though, was when the Raider offense consisted of quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler, tailback Harvey Williams, receiver Tim Brown and not much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The very next week, Hostetler started spreading the ball around more and the 
results have been impressive. The Raiders have won five of the ensuing six 
games and their last three in a row, their only loss having been to the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs, devastated by injuries, went in the other direction after beating 
the Raiders. They have lost four of six and are barely in the playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was sidelined the first two games of this month because of a sprained 
foot, but he came back last week to lead the Chiefs over the Houston Oilers.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Raider defense has been playing particularly well, having not 
given up more than 21 points in a game since late September, the key today may 
be Eddie Anderson. The Raider free safety sat out last week's game because of a 
groin pull. He resumed practice during the week and hopes to play today. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a nine-year veteran and his presence may be vital, considering that the 
two other safeties, Derrick Hoskins and Patrick Bates, have five years of NFL 
experience between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's eyes get wide when he spots inexperience in a defensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reads defenses quicker than anybody," Anderson said. "He knows the offense 
in his sleep. Hopefully, with Chester (McGlockton), Anthony (Smith) and Jerry 
Ball putting pressure on, he'll throw bad balls three or four times. We'll take 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have a chance to reach two statistical milestones, but only one 
worth bragging about. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams needs 65 yards rushing to reach 1,000 for the first time in his 
career and become the first Raider to reach that level since Allen did it in 
1985. Williams would love to hit 1,000 against his old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they commit three penalties today, the Raiders will break the league 
record of 149 set by Houston in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Records, milestones and the potential for historic farewells. It could be a 
memorable ending to the regular season. But the Raiders will be trying to make 
sure it's not the end of their season.

RAMS MAY END ON LOWEST NOTE; PRO FOOTBALL: SMALL CROWD EXPECTED FOR GAME 
AGAINST WASHINGTON REDSKINS THAT COULD BE ANAHEIM STADIUM FINALE. 
</P>

 This could be the Los Angeles Rams' final appearance as the Los Angeles Rams, 
and local malls will draw better. The game will not be shown on local 
television, and as if Ram President John Shaw needed one more reason to make 
his case, today's attendance is expected to be the team's lowest since moving 
to Anaheim in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Kansas City Chiefs and Raiders compete in the Coliseum for 
postseason glory in front of a sellout crowd, the contest between the Rams 
(4-11) and Washington Redskins (2-13) before maybe 32,000 in Anaheim Stadium is 
almost irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the end of a 49-season run in Southern California for the Rams, 
and if rumors become reality, it might be the last Ram game coached by Chuck 
Knox, the sixth-winningest coach in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of the unknown is one of the greatest things a man can face," said 
Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach. "It's sort of like walking on Jell-O 
right now. In a word, everything's kind of shaky right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams conducted practice as usual this week, and although they have 
insisted for months that talk of a move has had no impact, they are now being 
put to the final test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm focusing on the Redskins," said Joe Vitt, assistant head coach. "If I 
make a bad call defensively, (Washington quarterback) Heath Shuler is not going 
to take the excuse, 'I was thinking about moving.' I have a 13-year-old son, 
and one of the things I try to teach him is to be personally accountable for 
what he does and what he says. I'm personally accountable for getting this team 
ready to play the Redskins." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the possibility of a move, and there is also the possibility of 
unemployment. Vitt, a Knox loyalist and a man who has slept as many as four 
nights a week at Rams Park to prepare his team, said he will not concern 
himself with things he cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked as hard as I can work, and the players have worked as hard as 
they can work," Vitt said. "Our record is absolutely terrible and we have not 
gotten it done. But it doesn't mean there haven't been some good things that 
have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what the fans think or anyone else. We know what we've done and 
the things we have had to go through this year. Joe Kelly, Roman Phifer and 
Shane Conlan have had unbelievable years. You watch the way Toby Wright and 
Marquez Pope have come on. Todd Lyght is one of the premier corners in the 
league right now, and although Darryl Henley has been hurt the past three 
weeks, he hasn't missed a snap." 
</P>
<P>
 Solid individual performances aside, beyond today there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's up in the air, including my own career," guard Tom Newberry 
said. "I'm a free agent, plus the team might leave and everyone's talking about 
the coaching staff; there are just so many things hanging there." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox & Co. have a 15-32 record in three years here, and although the team has 
better players and appears more competitive than before their arrival, there is 
already talk around the league that the Rams will make a move on San Francisco 
assistant Mike Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one more year on my contract and one more game this season," Knox 
said. "We are a better football team, although the record might not show it. 
I'm going to coach this game to win, and then whatever happens, happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have compiled a 377-318-19 mark while competing as the Los Angeles 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about that (franchise moving)," linebacker Conlan said. "The 
only thing that would concern me is the coaching staff. Let me tell you 
something. I was in Buffalo, and Marv Levy is a great coach, but defensively 
I've learned more here in two years than I've learned since I was at Penn 
State. If they go, it's a raw deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Players appear more concerned about a change in leadership than a change in 
address. "A lot of these players live out of state, so to them it's going to 
be, well, I'll just go to another city," kicker Tony Zendejas said. "It's going 
to be like that for a majority of the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Faulkner, administrator of pro personnel, has been employed by the Rams 
for 30 years, but instead of nostalgia, Faulkner has concerned himself with 
finding an edge for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from the gas station attendant to whoever has said we're going, but 
Georgia Frontiere has not said one thing about moving to St. Louis," Faulkner 
said. "So my total focus is on doing whatever I can to help this team defeat 
the Redskins." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory will end the Rams' losing streak at six and extend the Redskins' 
mark to eight consecutive losses. Win or lose, though, there will still be no 
immediate answers on the future of the Rams or their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what is going to happen?" defensive end Fred Stokes said. "But you 
know what I'd like to see? I'd like the fans to be totally radical for this 
game. I'd like to see people having a great time instead of mourning and 
looking at this like death. I mean if I could drive around with a bullhorn, I'd 
be shouting to people to come out to the game and just have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go out with a bang, whether we're here next year or not."

CLIPPERS HAVE SHOT, RUN OUT OF BULLETS; PRO BASKETBALL: POTENTIAL GAME-TYING 
THREE-POINTERS BY WOODS AND MURRAY GO ASTRAY AS WASHINGTON HOLDS ON TO WIN, 
105-102. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling fled his courtside seat at halftime of Friday 
night's game against the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers might be the worst team in the NBA, but they never quit, as they 
demonstrated once again at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind the injury-depleted Bullets by 20 points two minutes into 
the fourth quarter, the Clippers rallied, only to lose their fourth consecutive 
game, 105-102, before an announced crowd of 7,600. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, Sterling was long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed, 105-96, with 54 seconds left, scored six 
consecutive points as forward Charles Outlaw made a dunk and a hook shot and 
guard Randy Woods made a layup with 30 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had two shots to tie the game after forward Lamond Murray stole 
the ball from guard Calbert Cheaney with 23.5 seconds left. But Murray missed a 
three-point shot with 7.8 seconds left and Woods missed a three-pointer with 
four seconds left. Murray also missed a shot after the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran the same play we ran the play before where Outlaw got the layup," 
Woods said. "We were going to try to get Lamond for the three, but they both 
went to Lamond, so we really didn't have a shot and everybody was just trying 
to create a shot. We got two good looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA star Mitchell Butler scored 22 points as the Bullets (7-16), who 
were without their three top scorers, Chris Webber, Don MacLean and Rex 
Chapman, ended an eight-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by only two points at halftime, collapsed in the 
third quarter, shooting only 29% (4-14) while being outscored, 31-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked tired in the first quarter," said Clipper forward Loy Vaught, who 
had 20 points and 13 rebounds. "I was anticipating a win and a fun game and a 
game to build on confidence-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and we were down two and I looked up again and we were down 13. 
To our credit, we had a nice run in the fourth quarter (but) we came up a 
little short." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, sprained his right ankle when he 
stumbled while going after a loose ball two minutes into the third quarter. He 
returned with 6.5 seconds left in the quarter after getting his ankle retaped 
and finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was so bad that Gheorghe Muresan, the Bullets' slow-footed, 
7-foot-7, 303-pound reserve center, looked like the best player on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Muresan got 10 points, one shy of his season-high, four rebounds and three 
blocks as Washington, which trailed by 11 points in the first quarter, took a 
54-52 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Lynam started Muresan in the third quarter in place of Kevin 
Duckworth, who has an Achilles' heel injury. He finished with 12 points and 10 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets announced before the game that forward Webber, expected to be out 
six weeks after dislocating his left shoulder in Thursday night's 107-87 loss 
at Golden State, has been placed on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said he won't be out that long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was X-rayed today and everything was negative," Webber said. "I'll be back 
in three to four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Webber was examined Friday by Dr. Tony Daly, the Clipper physician.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him today that's it's hard to estimate," Daly said. "I would guess 
(Webber will miss) three to six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Warriors for the first time since being traded to the Bullets last 
month, Webber was hurt in the third quarter while diving for a loose ball. The 
shoulder was put back in place by Warrior team doctors.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was disappointing, but you take a risk every game you play," Webber said 
while receiving treatment before the game. "It was a sad way to end it, but it 
could have been a lot worse. It could have been a knee or a broken shoulder, so 
I'm still blessed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets have been hit hard by injuries, losing MacLean, who has missed the 
last eight games with tendinitis in both knees, and Chapman, who has missed 
eight games with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets activated forward Kenny Walker, who had been on the injured list.

 If you are planning on attending the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, the 
organizing committee has issued a list of do's and don'ts when interacting with 
foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the no-nos: 
</P>
<P>
 "The crossing of legs, over the knee, exposing the sole of a shoe to a member 
of Arabic culture. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The usage of jargon, colloquialism and idiomatic expressions with guests who 
speak English as a second language. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Pointing with fingers at objects or people. Pointing to be done with an open 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't refer to guests from other countries as foreigners. They are 
"international visitors."

 Foul weather: Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre, born and raised in 
southern Mississippi, is fast becoming one of the best cold-weather 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In games in which the temperature is 32 degrees or less at kickoff or in 
which it is raining and less than 45 degrees, Favre is 10-1," says Bob Glauber 
of Newsday.

 Changing sports: Buffalo Bill quarterback Frank Reich is among 395 golfers 
granted reinstatement as amateurs by the U.S. Golf Assn. this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich, who has been on Super Bowl teams the last four seasons, doesn't have 
that concern this season. The Bills were eliminated last week, so he'll get a 
chance to concentrate on golf much earlier than usual. The Bills' last game is 
today against the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich made his professional golf debut in the CGA Isuzu Classic in 1991.

 Tough game: A teen-age soccer player in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., is suing the 
county school board, claiming he was kicked in a tournament during which the

<P>
 Gary Beharrie of Piper High suffered torn ligaments in his leg during a game 
against Deerfield Beach two years ago. In a civil lawsuit, Beharrie alleges the 
kick came on the orders of Deerfield Coach Phil Drosdick. He is seeking more

only one game under former Notre Dame coach Gerry Faust, who has retired, and 
that against winless Ohio University in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Zips, by the way, doesn't refer to zero but is short for Zipper, a brand of

O'MALLEY STILL ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN; BASEBALL: DODGER PRESIDENT'S ABSENCE 
FROM A PIVOTAL ROLE IN NEGOTIATIONS HAS LEFT SOME OBSERVERS BEFUDDLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not a new aspect of the baseball bargaining dispute, only one of the 
most mystifying. A headline on a baseball column in The Times on Sept. 4 read: 
"O'Malley on Outside Looking In, Thanks to Selig." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Christmas Eve, more than three months later, and the president of the 
Dodgers, one of baseball's most influential and respected franchises, has 
seemed to remain on the outside looking in as negotiations with the players 
collapsed, the owners implemented their salary cap and the industry headed for 
legal and financial chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get it," a union official said Friday, not for the first time. 
"Where's Peter O'Malley been? What's he saying? What's he doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just O'Malley. The union has found it strange from the start that 
none of the big-market owners except for Peter Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles 
has consistently questioned the owners' direction and strategy or put a 
coalition together to challenge the leadership of the acting commissioner, Bud 
Selig, and his silent partner, Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 Where has George Steinbrenner been? Ted Turner? Fred Wilpon and Nelson 
Doubleday? 
</P>
<P>
 It is O'Malley, however, with a name conjuring images of power and influence 
in baseball's highest circles, whose absence from a central and pivotal role 
during one of the most important six months in baseball history seems to have 
befuddled people the most. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley talked about it some in September and talked about it some Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I regret it?" he said, repeating a question pertaining to his lack of 
assignment. "Yes, I regret it, but it was not my choice. It was Bud Selig's 
choice and he hasn't seen a place for me, a role for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's surrounded himself with people he's comfortable with, as I've said 
before. That doesn't mean I haven't been on the phone or haven't been involved 
on a daily basis, but when people are named to a negotiating committee or a TV 
committee, I think you have to let those people do their jobs without giving 
the appearance of interfering or interfering, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he agree with Selig's leadership? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure a lot of us will have a lot to say about that in time, but I'm not 
going to get into it today," O'Malley said. "We still have to get a bargaining 
agreement and a partnership with the players, that should be the goal, and 
Buddy is still in charge. The only thing I'll say is that I would have liked to 
have seen Jerry McMorris (of the Colorado Rockies) active earlier and John 
Harrington (of the Boston Red Sox) active earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 There are certain hard truths. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter O'Malley was co-chairman of the committee that restructured the still 
vacant commissioner's office and chairman of the committee that selected 
Leonard Coleman as National League president, but the power he inherited from 
his father, Walter, and which was still in place under Bowie Kuhn, has eroded 
under Peter Ueberroth, Fay Vincent and now Selig, fading like the mystique of 
National League superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 -- O'Malley believes baseball should have hired a full-time, independent 
commissioner and that Selig, as a Brewer stockholder, chairman of the Player 
Relations Committee and acting commissioner, has attempted to wear too many 
hats, is too often caught in a conflicting position, and has been too closely 
tied -- this comes from others -- to Reinsdorf and a small-market clique of 
Carl Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Doug Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
Tom Werner, who bowed out on Tuesday as owner of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Both O'Malley and Selig describe their relationship as professional. They had 
a respectful meeting in October when O'Malley flew to Milwaukee to urge Selig 
to reach out to the players and involve them in ongoing industry business even 
amid the ongoing negotiations. Did it happen? The owners and players are no 
closer to a partnership than they are to a bargaining agreement, and if you 
want to know what O'Malley really thinks about Selig, consider this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the Three Tenors concert at Dodger Stadium this summer, O'Malley 
apologized to Vincent for joining Selig and Reinsdorf in the push that led to 
Vincent's resignation, saying, in effect, that if he knew then what he knows 
now he wouldn't have participated in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In discussing the new revenue-sharing format in an interview with The Times 
the other day, O'Malley cited Werner's Padres and Selig's Brewers and said that 
given the professionalism with which the Dodgers are operated he didn't like 
the idea of sharing money with clubs such as San Diego and Milwaukee, "where 
there has been no evidence of good management." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig certainly had to feel the bite of that, but then O'Malley voted for the 
revenue-sharing plan. He voted for implementation, although he considers it the 
opposite of the partnership he preaches and says it doesn't make sense that 
common sense hasn't prevailed in these negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully the negotiations will continue, but we had to implement," he said. 
"There was no alternative. We couldn't keep putting it off. We had to set the 
rules under which we're going to operate so we can prepare for next season." 
</P>
<P>
 A season with replacement players? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said he didn't want to discuss that. "My focus is on resolving the 
differences with the players," he said. "We still have time." 
</P>
<P>
 His focus? How strange. It still appears to be from a distance, on the outside 
looking in.

GETTING SALARY CAP TO FIT WON'T BE EASY; BASEBALL: TEAMS BEGIN PREPARING BY 
MAKING 36 PLAYERS -- INCLUDING JIM ABBOTT -- FREE AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teams began adjusting to baseball's new salary cap Friday by making 36 players 
free agents and preserving their bargaining rights with 38 others. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36 players who were not offered 1995 contracts -- among them pitchers Jim 
Abbott and Pete Harnisch, and third baseman Charlie Hayes -- are free to 
negotiate with any team. Among the group were 20 players who would have been 
restricted free agents if their teams had decided to make qualifying offers -- 
their 1994 salaries plus 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some good ones out there," General Manager Gene Michael of the New 
York Yankees said of the free agents. "We will look at anyone that we have good 
reports on." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston let go pitchers Tony Fossas and Chris Nabholz, and Detroit got rid of 
four players, pitchers Mike Gardiner and Gene Harris, outfielder Junior Felix 
and catcher Chad Kreuter. Atlanta released pitchers Derek Lilliquist, Gregg 
Olson and Mike Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, possibly interested in re-acquiring Abbott, declined to offer 
contracts to pitchers Mark Leiter and Bob Patterson. They tendered contracts 
for 1995 to 28 players, among them designated hitter Chili Davis, and said they 
have agreed to terms with left-hander Ken Patterson on a minor league contract. 
Ken Patterson, 30, pitched two-thirds of an inning last season before tearing a 
ligament in his left elbow, which required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter appeared in 40 games, including seven starts, with a 4-7 record and 
4.72 ERA. Bob Patterson made 47 appearances, with a 2-3 record and 4.07 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38 restricted free agents -- players with four to six years of major 
league service -- can sign offer sheets with any team but must give their 
former clubs 10 days to match offers. In that group are Atlanta's Steve Avery, 
the Yankees' Jack McDowell and Montreal's John Wetteland. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, however, won't be signing soon. The players' union advised players 
and agents not to make deals until it evaluates details of the 66 pages of 
contract language detailing the cap that owners implemented Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we know what they did," said Eugene Orza, the union's 
No. 2 official.

 Several players agreed to contracts minutes before owners imposed the salary 
cap. Teams announced the deals on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Bip Roberts, who was a free agent, got the biggest deal, a 
$4.8-million, two-year contract with San Diego. Harold Baines, another free 
agent, returned to Baltimore for $1.6 million in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Orlando Merced agreed to a $2-million, one-year deal with 
Pittsburgh. St. Louis signed two players to one-year deals, infielder Geronimo 
Pena for $770,000 and outfielder Brian Jordan for $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Scott Servais and Houston agreed to a one-year contract. Infielder 
Jeff Reboulet and Minnesota agreed to a two-year deal, and catcher Steve Decker 
and Florida agreed to a one-year contract.

 Thirty-eight players became restricted free agents Friday when owners imposed 
a new system that includes a salary cap. Unsigned players with four or more 
years of major league service but less than six may sign an offer sheet with 
any team through Feb. 15, and their current clubs have 10 days to match any

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; THE ROOKIES: SOME ARE THE BEST, SOME ARE A BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Add Willie McGinest to the long list of players who will support the theory of 
evolution as it applies to NFL rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he no longer wonders how somebody can be 23 and feel like an 
old man. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins when you arrive at training camp bearing a big contract and bigger 
fears. In the next six months, a familiar pattern develops: 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get yelled at. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get benched. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get yelled at. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get yelled at, now by people you don't know, in words you don't even 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get tired. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You get yelled at so much, you worry that the person yelling will suffer 
apoplexy.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Then . . . you get a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 McGinest, a first-round pick from USC, fourth overall, has arrived at the 
final phase just in time for the New England Patriots' most important game in 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Patriots visit Chicago today in hopes of clinching a playoff spot for 
the first time since 1986, McGinest will be playing the left outside linebacker 
position in the league's hottest young defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders hope he and fellow outside linebacker Chris Slade are stopped. A 
victory by the Bears would allow the Raiders entry into the playoffs without 
even showing up against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may be too late for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling a lot better about things," said McGinest, whose defense leads 
the league with 39 take-aways. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy for him to say. He couldn't feel much worse, not after enduring a season 
under Coach Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, well, Coach has been in my face a little bit," McGinest said. "If you do 
something wrong, he yells at you. . . . He has yelled at me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 It started when McGinest had trouble learning the Patriots' complicated pass 
coverage. It continued when he injured his knee in the second game of the 
season, a loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The stresses began piling up along with his bench time. Soon he was wondering 
if he would ever see January. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending his first winter away from Southern California, he already had 
resigned himself to never again seeing the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really tired," he said. "I've never played this much football. And so 
much to learn. At times I still feel lost. It has been a lot of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 But he listened to his coaches, picked up their dogma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not complaining about my situation because this is what they pay me for," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he constantly studied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tape in my hand right now," he said during a recent telephone 
interview. "It's like homework. You have to do it, or Coach is in your face 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing he knew, he was leading a defense that held the New York Jets to 
219 total yards and three second-half points in a 24-13 Patriot victory three 
weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The Patriot defense has held opponents to fewer than 300 yards in four of the 
last five games and McGinest has been one of the team's stoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say I'm playing better, but I still have a lot to learn," he said. "They 
are trying to bring me along slow. I am taught something every day." 
</P>
<P>
 In case you think he is no longer acting like a rookie, though, just listen to 
what he says about his coach. He still loves him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parcells is the type of coach everybody should want to play for," McGinest 
said. "He's a for-real coach. He doesn't hide anything from you. He treats you 
like a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least like a steady outside linebacker, which is what McGinest has 
become in being named to our all-rookie team. 
</P>
<P>
 The list, from bests to busts: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Heath Shuler, Washington Redskins. Not much to choose from here. Hey, he 
has completed more than half of his passes in the last three weeks. That's more 
than Trent What's-his-name. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Charlie Ward, New York Knicks. The best quarterback in New York still 
can't get any playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Marshall Faulk, Indianapolis Colts, and Errict Rhett, Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. The strongest in a strong field that also includes Mario Bates of 
the New Orleans Saints, William Floyd of the San Francisco 49ers, and Greg Hill 
of the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Calvin Jones, Raiders. An ordinary third-round pick. And the Raiders 
passed on Rhett, Bates and Hill for him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WIDE RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Darnay Scott, Cincinnati Bengals, and Derrick Alexander, Cleveland 
Browns. Will somebody please tell us again why San Diego State did not win more 
games with Faulk and Scott on the same team? 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Johnnie Morton, Detroit Lions. Great touchdown catch last weekend does 
not erase a season on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OFFENSIVE GUARD 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Larry Allen, Dallas Cowboys, and Isaac Davis, San Diego Chargers. Allen 
has done well as Erik Williams' replacement at right tackle. Davis emerged from 
a slow start and finished with a solid month, including a huge game last 
weekend while replacing injured starter Joe Cocozzo in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Eric Mahlum, Colts. A 32nd overall pick needs to do more than back up 
the likes of Randy Dixon and Joe Staysniak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OFFENSIVE TACKLE 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Bernard Williams, Philadelphia Eagles, and Todd Steussie, Minnesota 
Vikings. Large, smart, potential steals even at the 14th and 19th picks, 
respectively. Of course, maybe they just look good sandwiched around that 
tackle taken with the 15th pick by the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Wayne Gandy, Rams. We've made enough jokes about him for one year, don't 
you think? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CENTER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Kevin Mawae, Seattle Seahawks. Moved to guard because of injuries, but 
strong enough to open holes for the AFC's leading rusher, Chris Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Joe Burch, Patriots. Rare are the third-round picks who are nowhere to 
be found six months later. Just as rare are Parcells' mistakes, such as this 
guy, who showed up fat and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KICKER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Chris Boniol, Cowboys. One hundred and 10 points later, we suspect Barry 
Switzer can now pronounce his name. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Tony Meola, Buffalo Blizzards of the National Professional Soccer 
League. This indoor league is where the former World Cup goalkeeper is playing 
after flunking a tryout with the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENSIVE TACKLES 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Tim Bowens, Miami Dolphins, and Bryant Young, San Francisco 49ers. 
Bowens impressed scouts who visited him in tiny Okolona, Miss., by sprinting 
through uncut grass in blue denim cutoffs. Today, with the sort of size and 
strength that has made opposing guards wish he was back on the farm, he is 
everybody's defensive rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Sam Adams, Seahawks. The trendy selection here is No. 1 overall pick Dan 
(Big Daddy) Wilkinson of the Bengals. But Wilkinson only played poorly for a 
No. 1 pick. Adams, whose lack of progress helped ruin the Seahawks' chances, 
played poorly for any pick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENSIVE END 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Joe Johnson, New Orleans Saints, and Brentson Buckner, Pittsburgh 
Steelers. Playing in the forgotten Saints' defense, Johnson is the best rookie 
nobody knows. Buckner doesn't start, but look for his big hands on some 
quarterback during passing downs in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Henry Ford, Houston Oilers. Have we said yet that this 26th overall pick 
is an Edsel? Thought so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Lee Woodall, 49ers; Rob Fredrickson, Raiders, and McGinest. Woodall has 
been the best of this bunch, a sixth-round steal from West Chester, Pa., who at 
times has outplayed his surrounding Pro Bowl veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Jamir Miller, Arizona Cardinals. Repeat after us: You do not report late 
to a Buddy Ryan camp. You do not report late . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CORNERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: DeWayne Washington, Vikings, and Antonio Langham, Browns. The league's 
two most exciting defensive rookies. When Washington wasn't returning 
interceptions 54 and 81 yards for touchdowns, Langham was saving games by 
knocking down passes in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Anthony Phillips, Atlanta Falcons. We don't know much about this guy, 
other than that he is a third-stringer behind Darnell Walker and Eric Jack. And 
we don't know anything about those guys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SAFETY 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Toby Wright, Rams, and Brent Alexander, Cardinals. Wright will end the 
season having started only two games, but that is about the norm for rookie 
safeties. He and Alexander, a late-season starter and rookie free agent of the 
year, are here because of their hits. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Jason Sehorn, New York Giants. If USC fans are disappointed, think how 
Dan Reeves feels. Sehorn, taken in the second round, has turned out to be a man 
without a position. Tried at both safety and cornerback. Consistent only on 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PUNTER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Pat O'Neill, Patriots. One of only two punters selected in the draft. 
Tied for fifth in the AFC with 22 punts inside the 20-yard line, our favorite 
statistic for this position. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: Mitch Berger, Eagles. Yes, the other punter taken in the draft, in the 
sixth round. Long since replaced by Bryan Barker. He and second-round pick 
Bruce Walker were only two of the Eagles' draft goofs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KICK RETURNER 
</P>
<P>
 BEST: Andre Coleman, Chargers. Leave it to Bobby Beathard to use a 
second-round pick on a little-known receiver and turn him into the league's 
fourth-ranked returner. 
</P>
<P>
 BUST: David Palmer, Vikings. We're still wondering why Dennis Green used a 
second-round pick on him. Just what is this running back-receiver-returner 
supposed to do, anyway?

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; THE ROOKIES: SOME ARE THE BEST, SOME ARE A BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Plaschke 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * HELLO? ANYBODY HOME? When two members of the Rams' booster club recently met 
with owner Georgia Frontiere and team President John Shaw, they emphasized the 
financial guarantees and minority ownership that had been publicly discussed by 
the Save the Rams group. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere had never heard of either offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny," she reportedly said to Shaw, "are there guarantees in their deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she reportedly turned to Shaw and said, "You mean there are people here 
willing to invest?" 
</P>
<P>
 * NOBODY HOME IN MINNEAPOLIS, EITHER: The sudden decline of the Minnesota 
Vikings, who have needed comebacks in the final 10 minutes to record their only 
two victories in six weeks, was typified by a mental blunder last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Vikings scored to pull within eight points of the Detroit Lions late 
in the third quarter, kicker Fuad Reveiz once again avoided all-world returner 
Mel Gray with a short kickoff. Eric Lynch grabbed the ball at the 25-yard line 
and returned it 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. Gray had suffered a leg injury on the previous kickoff and wasn't 
in the game. The Vikings cost themselves as much as 20 yards in field position 
because they never noticed that rookie Johnnie Morton -- with no official 
returns -- had replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Barry Sanders ran 64 yards up the middle for a 
game-clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 * HAVE A SUPER NEW YEAR: Leigh Steinberg, the agent who represents Dallas 
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman and San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young, 
issued an NFC championship prediction with his annual holiday greeting card. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo on the card is of young son Matt sitting on the back of son Jon. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt is wearing a San Francisco 49er cap. Jon is wearing a Dallas Cowboy cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg would only say, "The card is sort of like playing a Beatles album 
backward. There is a message there, but you have to look for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * FINAL WORD: Those at NBC and Fox who spend much time and effort sniping at 
each other over who has the best pregame show would do well to check out which 
pregame show is shown in most of the stadium press boxes and officials' suites 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: It's neither one. 
</P>
<P>
 * BUT A HUNDRED LASHES TO ESPN: For endorsing the idiot who operated the 
motorized toy car that rolled around the field and caused the delay in the 
Raider game in Seattle last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, announcers Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann were critical of the 
intrusion, which cost the driving Seahawks momentum that might have cost them 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But when producers discovered that a note on the car promoted their network, 
my, how their morals changed. That note was proudly shown over the air within 
seconds with a then-meaningless disclaimer from Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm . . . surely ESPN would not have hired someone to sit in the stands with 
a remote-control box and create a potentially injury-causing distraction, all 
in the name of shameless self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Or would they? Their behavior makes you wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 * SAME PUNISHMENT TO THE BILLS: They violated the league's 12-minute 
cooling-off policy by bolting their locker room doors for nearly 30 minutes 
after Buffalo's playoff-eliminating loss to the New England Patriots last week. 
</P>
<P>
 We regard them and their four consecutive Super Bowl appearances as heroic. 
Even more amazing that they accomplished it while bearing this giant chip. 
</P>
<P>
 * HE ALSO DOES WINDOWS: Shortly after being announced as one of the 10 
original Carolina Panthers last week, guard Carlson Leomiti, a Cleveland Brown 
reject, left the news conference and entertained hotel guests on the lobby's 
grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the songs he played was "Easy." 
</P>
<P>
 * AMERICA'S ANIMAL HOUSE: Emmitt Smith, sore hamstring and all, climbed over a 
seat in an attempt to slug James Washington on the Cowboys' flight back from 
New Orleans on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was angry because he had been hit on the head during an apparent food 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown what Coach Barry Switzer was doing at the time, but we hear he 
wields a mean mashed potato. 
</P>
<P>
 * FINAL WORD II: The weeklong verbal battle between Arizona Cardinal Coach 
Buddy Ryan and former Cardinal Keith Rucker, now with the Cincinnati Bengals, 
spilled over into the Bengals' locker room Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Ryan authored a message that appeared on one of three boxes of 
doughnuts delivered to the locker room before their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck, Fatso," read the message. It was signed, "Buddy Ryan."

NEWSWIRE: FALCONS' HEYWARD SIGNS TWO-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons signed running back Craig Heyward, having the best year of 
his career, to a two-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward has 1,041 combined yards this season, the highest total of his 
seven-year career. He also has career highs with 746 rushing yards, eight 
touchdowns and 30 receptions for 295 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A former No. 1 draft pick from Pittsburgh, Heyward signed a one-year deal with 
the Falcons before this season after spending last year in Chicago and five 
years in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 His rushing average of 4.5 yards per carry is third in the NFL and his eight 
touchdowns are the most by a Falcon running back since Gerald Riggs in 1986. 
Hockey  
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to schedule talks on Monday between NHL and union representatives 
fizzled when Bob Goodenow, executive director of the players' association, said 
he had no reason to meet if the league remains intent on imposing a payroll tax 
or exacting more concessions from players on salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 A league source said negotiators expected to meet Monday but canceled the 
session after Goodenow told union attorney Bob Riley the union had nothing to 
discuss if the tax was still alive. They did not set another date. The lockout 
is in its 85th day and has wiped out more than 40% of the NHL season.  
</P>
<P>
 A union source said Riley talked briefly with Jeff Pash, the NHL's general 
counsel, and added that no talks will take place before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The last full-scale negotiations were held Dec. 6, although delegations from 
each side have met three times since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Aubut, president and part owner of the Quebec Nordiques, is quitting 
three corporate board positions to see his NHL team through the labor crisis, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubut resigned from the board of Hydro-Quebec and the Quebec 2002 Winter 
Olympic bid committee. He also announced he would step down as chairman of the 
board of a technology park once a new management team is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The three positions took about 25 hours a week of Aubut's time, said a 
spokesman for the Nordiques, who contend they will lose between $10 million and 
$14 million if no season takes place. Soccer  
</P>
<P>
 Yugoslavia, playing its first international match since the lifting of United 
Nations sanctions, was beaten, 2-0, by Brazil at the Olympic Stadium in Porto 
Alegre, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians, in their first game since winning the World Cup in July and 
their first game under new Coach Mario Zagalo, got a goal in each half. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola put them ahead in the 25th minute, scoring on a header inside the 
right-hand post off a cross from Branco. In the 66th minute, Branco made it 2-0 
when he scored on a direct free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Argentine star Diego Maradona, serving a 15-month playing suspension 
after failing a drug test during the World Cup, signed a one-year contract to 
help coach Racing Club in the Argentine first division. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, 34, signed the $500,000 contract at a Buenos Aires television 
studio. Because Maradona does not have a coaching license, he will serve as an 
assistant to Coach Carlos Fren. Racing has not won a championship in 28 years.

 Penn State offensive line coach Craig Cirbus was named head coach at the State 
University of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Penn State, Cirbus has coached in seven bowl games and two national 
championship games. Cirbus said he will remain with the Nittany Lions through 
the Jan. 2 Rose Bowl game against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirbus joined Penn State in 1984 as the team's assistant defensive line coach. 
He has been the offensive line coach there for the past two seasons, helping 
shape the nation's No. 1 offense. It averaged 47.8 points per game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of the Buffalo suburb of Kenmore, Cirbus played for the University at 
Buffalo as an offensive lineman from 1977-79.

doesn't have a name, but does have a television deal for football starting in 
1996. The contract signed in Memphis, Tenn., with Liberty Sports Inc. 
guarantees the league's football-playing schools $20 million in a five-year 
deal. Each of the football schools will receive nearly $167,000 a year starting 
in 1996, with more money based on the number of live TV appearances. The deal 
calls for 12 to 14 games a year.

NBA ROUNDUP; OLD PLAY WORKS TO WINNING PERFECTION FOR SPURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Bob Hill dug deep into the San Antonio Spurs' playbook and found the 
"surprise play," an isolation play that set up Sean Elliott's 15-foot 
game-winning jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good play and one that I really like," said Elliott, whose shot with 
2.9 seconds left gave the Spurs a 98-96 victory Friday night and extended their 
six-game winning streak before a NBA season-high crowd of 31,514 in San 
Antonio. "We used to run it a lot when (former coach) Larry (Brown) was here. 
It worked just like we drew it up. Avery (Johnson) was struggling with two 
guys, and then David (Robinson) made a big pick to get me open." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott's shot was set up after Vernon Maxwell was called for traveling. 
Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich was assessed a technical foul for disputing the 
call, but Vinny Del Negro missed the technical before Elliott's game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson, who started the game with a painful left ankle and sprained 
his right ankle in the first quarter, preserved San Antonio's victory by 
blocking Hakeem Olajuwon's shots on the final two plays of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Negro scored 17 of his team-high 26 points in the final quarter. Elliott 
scored 19 points and Robinson had 18 and 10 rebounds. Olajuwon had 19 points 
and 10 rebounds for Houston, which was led by Maxwell's season-high 27 points. 
</P>

<P>
 Cleveland 80, New Jersey 75 -- The Cavaliers, relying again on their furious 
double-teaming defense, won their eighth consecutive game, beating the Nets in 
Cleveland behind 18 points and 19 rebounds from Tyrone Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-game winning streak is their best since they won a team-record 11 in 
a row last February and March. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey played without injured Derrick Coleman for the third consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 97, Detroit 77 -- Mookie Blaylock had 18 points and eight assists to 
lead the Hawks to a rout of the Pistons in Auburn Hills, Mich., leaving Lenny 
Wilkens one victory shy of Red Auerbach's all-time coaching victories record. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the 937th of the Atlanta coach's career. He can tie the record 
Tuesday at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 123, Milwaukee 91 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 32 points and the Magic, 
playing without Anfernee Hardaway, held the Bucks to two field goals in the 
first seven minutes of the fourth quarter while scoring 17 points to break open 
a close game in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Anderson had 27 points for the Magic, who were without Hardaway for his 
first time as a pro because of a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson led the Bucks with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 126, Denver 110 -- Danny Manning scored seven of his 18 points in 52 
seconds of the fourth quarter, giving the Suns an insurmountable 21-point lead 
with 4:18 remaining in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson, starting his first game since coming off the injured list, had 
21 points and 11 assists. Wayman Tisdale, another surprise starter who replaced 
Joe Kleine at center, scored 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 22 points for the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 116, Indiana 92 -- Toni Kukoc scored 17 of his 27 points in the second 
quarter as the Bulls pulled away to snap a three-game losing streak with a 
victory over the Pacers in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls led by as many as 30 points early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 85, Boston 77 -- Dana Barros had a career-high 34 points as the 
76ers broke a five-game losing streak with a victory over the poor-shooting 
Celtics in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 118, Dallas 92 -- Clifford Robinson had a season-high 31 points in a 
rout in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas' Jimmy Jackson, the league's second-leading scorer at 28.8, was five 
for 14 from the field and finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 116, Charlotte 93 -- Glen Rice scored 37 points and Ledell Eackles 
sparked the Heat's injury-depleted backcourt with 15 in a victory over the 
Hornets in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Eackles was pressed into service because Harold Miner was out because of a 
sprained left ankle and starter Billy Owens sprained his left ankle in the 
second quarter and did not return. 
</P>

 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Doc Rivers, waived by the New York Knicks last week, turned down 
more lucrative offers to join the San Antonio Spurs for the NBA minimum of 
$150,000, The New York Post reported. Because Rivers cleared waivers, the 
Knicks must still pay him $1.4 million this season and are responsible for half 
of his $3.2 million contract in 1995-96.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; WILL CONCERN BE COMING WEST TO RACE? IT'S A SMALL CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there are any haberdashers who sell bow ties in Arcadia, their inventory 
might be around for a while. Dick Small, who trains Concern, the winner of the 
Breeders' Cup Classic, isn't necessarily coming to Santa Anita with his colt 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the largest collection of bow ties in racing is now in New Orleans, 
where Small has Concern in training at the Fair Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, another racetrack. Concern has run in 21 races, on 12 tracks, and 
he'll soon make the Fair Grounds No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 After a prep race in New Orleans sometime in January, Small isn't sure. There 
are many races bouncing around in his mind: the New Orleans Handicap, the Strub 
Stakes and the Santa Anita Handicap, the Oaklawn Handicap and the Pimlico 
Special. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the Breeders' Cup Classic, Small and Concern's owner, Robert 
Meyerhoff of Baltimore, were bullish about the three-race Strub series, which 
concludes with the San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita on Jan. 14 and the Strub 
on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Small and Meyerhoff have been this way before, with Broad Brush, Concern's 
sire, who was second in the San Fernando, third in the Strub and winner of the 
Big 'Cap in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, they sent Valley Crossing to Del Mar for a fifth-place finish 
in the Pacific Classic in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to say that we're coming (to California) and then turn around 
and not come," Small said from his barn at the Fair Grounds. "The truth is, we 
don't know what we're going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse is the fruition of a lifetime of trying (by the 70-year-old 
Meyerhoff), and we want to enjoy him as much as possible. We're being very 
careful about what we do with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyerhoff, who has been in racing for more than 30 years, bred Broad Brush and 
mated him with Fara's Team, a mare he bought for $300,000, to get Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern got a rest at a farm in Camden, S.C., before he was shipped to Small 
at the Fair Grounds. He has had two workouts since arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to put the screws to him too much to get him ready for the San 
Fernando," Small said, "and I'm not comfortable doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Strub would make more sense, and then the Big 'Cap would become a 
possibility. But there's another plan -- the New Orleans Handicap, the Oaklawn 
Handicap and then the Pimlico Special (in May). 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about going to Oaklawn is that they've got that spring 
festival, and there'd be races there for some of our other horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Oaklawn was the right place to be for Concern this year. He won the Arkansas 
Derby, and then Small, the consummate horseman, resisted running in the 
Kentucky Derby, which was only two weeks later. Concern didn't win another race 
until the Breeders' Cup, but he was always knocking at the door and came within 
a neck of Holy Bull in the Travers at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened to the ACRS?" Small said wistfully, referring to the 
multi-race, coast-to-coast American Championship Racing Series that brought the 
best horses together in 1991-93. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that racing dropped the series, a wrongheaded decision, and in 
its place has come the National Best Seven, a yawn of an idea that has been 
struggling to handle $100,000 in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Crossing earned $125,000 of the $1.5-million bonus that was offered in 
the last year of the series, and easy rider Concern would be the perfect horse 
for 1995 if the concept were still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern began his career (on grass) at Pimlico in August 1993, and since then 
he has run at Philadelphia Park, Laurel, Oaklawn, Remington Park, Thistledown, 
Arlington International, Monmouth Park, Saratoga, Woodbine, Louisiana Downs and 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Small has vanned the horse everywhere, including an arrival at Churchill less 
than 48 hours before the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horse looks terrific," Small said this week. "If there had been something 
for him, we could have run him one more time after the Breeders' Cup. If we 
came to California, it could be at the last minute. Moving to another track is 
one thing that's not going to bother him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Concern doesn't come West, and with Holy Bull's trainer, Jimmy Croll, 
uncertain about his plans, Santa Anita's meet is still going to be heavy with 
standout horses. The season opens at noon Monday, with the feature race the 
$100,000 Malibu Stakes, the opener of the Strub Series. The eight-horse field 
for the seven-furlong race includes Ferrara, who equaled the track record for 6 
1/2 furlongs at the current Hollywood Park meet. In post-position order, the 
San Fernando field consists of Powis Castle, Sharp Try, Ferrara, Numerous, 
Timbalier, I'ma Game Master, College Town and Uncaged Fury. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hollywood Park's meet ending today, substitute announcer Ed Burgart must 
have felt as if he were on vacation the last week. Burgart, who took over for 
the vacationing Trevor Denman toward the end of the thoroughbred season, 
continued his regular job at the night quarter horse meet at Los Alamitos and 
during one 14-day stretch he called 212 races at both tracks. But for the last 
week of Hollywood, he has been a one-breed caller, because the quarter horse 
season ended last Saturday. The 42-year-old Burgart, who has been announcing 
for 14 years, also has other duties, including a quarter horse handicap for The 
Times. During his double-duty days, Burgart was handicapping the highways 
between Hollywood Park and Los Alamitos. "If you guessed right," he said, "it 
could mean the difference between a quick trip or one that takes twice the 
time. I know one thing now -- Route 105 is no longer a secret."

FULLERTON LETS VICTORY SLIP AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton had a good shot at a third consecutive victory Friday 
night, but the Titans' recent good fortune in close games disappeared in an 
90-82 overtime loss to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (3-4) led, 74-71, when guard James French made two free throws with 
22 seconds left in regulation, but San Francisco guard Gerald Walker hit a 
three-point shot with 17 seconds to go that sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 French had one final chance to win it in the final seconds of regulation, but 
his jumper bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, with Walker leading the way, the Dons (5-6) dominated the overtime. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who went over 1,000 points for his career in his previous game, scored 
30 this time and dominated down the stretch. He scored San Francisco's first 
five points in overtime, and John Duggan's three-point shot put the Dons six 
points ahead. The Titans never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the luck just didn't go our way the way it has in the last two 
games," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking said. "We still didn't shoot well, and they 
certainly got hot at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 40.9% from the field compared to 46.5% for San Francisco, which 
shot 55% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had five players in double figures with center Winston Peterson 
getting 17 points. Chuck Overton and Chris Dade each had 15, David Frigout 14 
and Chris St. Clair added 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, weren't as solid defensively as they had been in earlier 
victories against Nevada Las Vegas and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons were up 71-67, but Peterson worked San Francisco center for his fifth 
foul and hit two free throws and St. Clair's three-pointer gave Fullerton a 
72-71 edge.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dons missed twice from outside before French controlled the rebound, took 
a foul and hit two free throws. But the Dons responded with Walker connecting 
on the three-pointer to tie it at 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton got off to its best start of the season, running up a 13-6 lead on a 
pair of free throws by Peterson followed by Frigout's layup. The Dons came back 
to tie the score at 17, but Fullerton got its inside game going with two 
straight baskets by Peterson to lead 29-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans led by up to 10 points late in the first half, but the Dons scored 
twice just before the end of the half to cut the deficit to 38-32 at halftime.

IRVINE'S BAKER GETS 100TH VICTORY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CHANNELL MAKES KEY PLAY 
AS ANTEATERS DEFEAT ST. MARY'S, 69-66. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Baker would be the first to tell you it was too long in coming and it was 
no work of art, but his 100th victory as a head coach will provide UC Irvine 
with a happy Christmas and its first winning record going into January in seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters improved to 4-3 with a 69-66 nonconference victory over St. 
Mary's in front of 1,846 in Irvine's Bren Center on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not very nice how we did it," point guard Raimonds Miglinieks mused, 
"but we played hard and, you know how they say a 'W' is a 'W.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it was an ugly game, one littered with missed layups, free throws and 
opportunities and bodies strewn on the floor. But it was the kind of game 
Anteater fans are used to seeing slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we would have given up," forward Mark Odsather said, "but this is 
a different team. We have confidence that we're going to find a way to win so 
we're finding ways to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine trailed by six after a little more than a minute and led by as much as 
five early in the second half, but a basket or two was all that separated the 
teams for the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's (4-4) had a 63-60 lead with two minutes remaining. Miglinieks made 
one of two free throws and then Gael forward Brent Farris was called for 
traveling on a fast break. Freshman forward Kevin Simmons was fouled while 
attempting a dunk and made both free throws to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With just more than a minute to play, Farris was called for traveling again, 
this time working for a shot underneath. Miglinieks then beat a double team and 
passed to Michael Tate at the top of the key. Tate fed Khalid Channell, who 
slammed it home, was fouled and sank the free throw to put the Anteaters ahead, 
66-63. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuri Williams made one of two free throws and then St. Mary's Chris Johnson 
hit a three-pointer with 15.8 seconds left. But Chris Brown made two free 
throws and Johnson's desperation three-point fling at the buzzer hit halfway up 
the backboard and bounded away. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Mary's did a good job defensively and we had to make some adjustments at 
halftime," Baker said. "We rebounded well and defended pretty well. They only 
scored six points in the last 4 1/2 minutes. And if we had done a better job 
against some of the easy baskets we gave them, it would have been over early."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; ARKANSAS' PRESSURE TOO MUCH FOR TULSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corliss Williamson scored seven of his 21 points, and Davor Rimac made two 
straight three-point shots as third-ranked Arkansas turned up the heat at the 
outset of the second half with an 18-0 run and went on to beat Tulsa, 82-63, 
Friday night in Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa (3-2) made three turnovers in the first half while building a 36-32 
lead, but committed seven in the first 4:14 of the second half. The Razorbacks 
(8-1) made six of nine shots during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole difference in the ballgame was our pressure defense in the second 
half," Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson said. "When we pressed, they didn't 
handle it real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa Coach Tubby Smith said, "They turned up the heat and we didn't respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa once closed to 59-52, but Clint McDaniel (18 points) countered with a 
three-point shot and Arkansas was never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea Seals led Tulsa with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Connecticut 85, Fairfield 68 -- Ray Allen had 21 points and Doron 
Sheffer 16, and both keyed runs that helped the No. 10 Huskies (5-0) to a 
victory over the Stags (5-3) in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies led, 43-30, at halftime and a nine-point run by UConn early in the 
second half made it 56-36. Fairfield got no closer than 14 points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stags were led by Greg Francis with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland 138, Morgan State 72 -- The No. 11 Terrapins (8-2) had their 
highest-scoring game ever, getting 25 points from Joe Smith as eight players 
scored in doubles figures in dominating the winless Bears (0-7) in College 
Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins scored the first 12 points and led by 29 at halftime in earning 
their 1,000th victory. The 138 points surpassed the record of 130 against East 
Carolina on Dec. 7, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins shot 64 percent and were 41 for 67 at the free-throw line. 
Morgan State did not shoot its first free throws until 12:03 remained in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-point margin also matched the biggest in Maryland's history, a 66-point 
victory over Maryland Eastern Shore in February 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Minnesota 115, San Jose State 68 -- Coming off its worst offensive 
showing of the season, the No. 16 Golden Gophers (7-3) put seven players in 
double figures -- including Townsend Orr with 17 points -- and beat the 
Spartans (0-6) in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Gophers snapped their three-game losing streak by shooting 52 
percent and reaching their highest point total in five years. They seemed 
certain to break the school scoring record of 120 points until going cold late. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota was humiliated at Williams Arena in a 71-50 loss Wednesday night to 
Texas Southern.

'HOW TO SUCCEED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having just seen "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" in La 
Jolla (" 'How to Succeed' in High-Tech," Nov. 26), I thought I'd respond to 
lighting designer Howell Binkley's assessment of the show's technology, that 
"audiences love it." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo by Ken Howard accompanying The Times' article is a fair one: That is 
what the whole show looks like.Once I realized that we were never going to get 
out from under that set, the increasing claustrophobia I felt began to drain 
any sense of fun the show had to give. 
</P>
<P>
 The video-screen display at the back of the stage -- separated as it is by the 
oppressive set design -- creates the weird sense of being archaic even when it 
has never been done before. At the very least, Des McAnuff's "Tommy" was never 
stuck in a single visual image. 
</P>
<P>
 It was amusing to read Linda Batwin's defense of the video images at the 
beginning of Megan Mullally's big number. By the time the 31 seconds of 
graphics are over and you can once again focus on the singer and the song, 
you've lost the thread of it (which is particularly distressful as Mullally is 
one of the show's few high points). 
</P>
<P>
 With all this emphasis on technology in an enterprise that is basically human, 
you inevitably begin to smell failure.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Hicks 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ADIEU, BLUE & GOLD? It isn't official yet, of course, but local fans wonder: 
Is today's game against Washington the Los Angeles Rams' last home game at 
Anaheim Stadium? . . . When the Rams debuted at the Big A against the Detroit 
Lions on Sept. 7, 1980, attendance was 64,892 -- and it stayed in that range 
the whole year. The last time the Rams drew 60,000 fans for three of eight home 
games in a year was in 1989 -- their last winning season (11-5). 
</P>
<P>
 FULL SLATE: How many current Rams were on the team that first year here? Only 
one: tackle Jackie Slater, who finishes his 19th season today. No other player 
was ever a Ram that long. . . . Only one other player has spent as many seasons 
with the same team in the National Football League: Jim Marshall, for 19 years 
a Minnesota Viking (1961-79). 
</P>
<P>
 LEGENDARY: The first Rams of Anaheim in 1980 were coming off a January, 1980, 
Super Bowl appearance, and again made the playoffs with an 11-5 record. Their 
quarterback? Vince Ferragamo, who is still active in many community causes 
here. If you wonder whether Ferragamo can still throw the ball, he's playing in 
the "Legends" non-tackle football game preceding next month's Super Bowl in 
Miami. . . . Other former NFL players from here playing in that event: Santa 
Ana's Efren Herrera and John Cappelletti of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 END OF A PROMISE? The Rams and the city of Anaheim have exchanged feuding 
words this year, convincing the Rams they may have a better future -- and be 
more welcome -- elsewhere, say, in St. Louis. . . . But their late owner, 
Carroll Rosenbloom, sang a different song when he moved the Rams in just before 
he died and wife Georgia took over. . . . Said he about Anaheim then: "They 
have so much to offer. . . . I know it's a great place (Anaheim Stadium) and 
the plan they have to improve it is fabulous."

UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS PUT UNUSUAL TROIKA IN CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their expertise is in crime and health care crises, but now they're crunching 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the largest municipal bankruptcy case in American history swirling around 
them, these three men -- a cop, a lawyer and a health care expert -- have been 
orchestrating massive cutbacks throughout Orange County's sprawling 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the Board of Supervisors instantly approved the $40.2 million in 
general fund reductions and shifts recommended by the makeshift "Operations 
Management Council" of Sheriff Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and 
Health Care Agency Director Tom Uram. 
</P>
<P>
 For nine days before that, the trio spent endless hours cloistered in a 
restricted-access "war room" on the fifth floor of the Sheriff's Department 
building in back-to-back briefings with dozens of department heads, financial 
advisers, bankruptcy experts, labor leaders, city officials and even business 
people eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems sure exactly how they were appointed. Nobody knows when they will 
finish their task. But nobody else really wants the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process was intense. We've spent nine days almost locked up, doing this 
on an hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute, day-by-day basis. . . . I didn't want to 
do this when I grew up," said a clearly exhausted Uram, 58, Friday afternoon. 
"I felt like I was in jail. I was eating jail food. There was a locked door, 
and there were deputies outside. And I didn't get any yard privileges either." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Uram, who has worked at the county since 1985, was the quietest 
of the three, often injecting wry humor into the marathon meetings run by 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime county employee, Gates, 55, invariably sat in the middle, with 
Capizzi on his right and Uram to the left. And Gates generally spoke for the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad is the power . . . Brad's a guy that gets things done," said County 
Clerk-Recorder Gary A. Granville. "If you wanted a guy to command an army, he's 
the guy you'd pick. . . . Brad is a pounder. If he was on a football team, he 
would be nose guard." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the council sprang from Gates' constant reminders to Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton in the days after the county filed bankruptcy Dec. 6 that 
department heads were desperate for information. Stanton appointed an 11-member 
group of agency chiefs, and asked fellow Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez to be the 
liaison between the board and the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the board's priorities on public health, safety and welfare, Vasquez 
asked Gates, Capizzi and Uram if they would be willing to lead the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you, I didn't lobby to be on it," Capizzi, 55, said with a chuckle 
Friday when asked how the team was formed. "If I can find out who got me on it, 
there's some pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, one of the 11 on Stanton's original council, recalled the troika 
emerging naturally from the larger group's first meeting Dec. 13: "Like they 
say in social psychology, if you put 10 people in a room, one of them is going 
to walk out as a leader. Those are the three best suited." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Dec. 14, the council began individual sessions with department 
leaders, scheduling them for times denoted in military fashion on a bulletin 
board outside the war room. They met both days last weekend and late into each 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Each department was to present its money-saving ideas on paper. Some 
representatives were summoned to the council for a scant 10 minutes; others 
returned time and again to hash out the numbers. The meetings were precise and 
all business, sources said. Those who strayed from the subject were quickly 
reminded of the agenda: cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asked to offer up what we could without damaging our ability to do 
our basic job," recalled Social Services Director Larry Leaman. 
</P>
<P>
 After his 15-minute meeting with the management council early Dec. 16, Leaman 
said his "entire management team" spent more than 12 hours hammering out a 
proposal for cuts, finally faxing it to the council about 9:30 that night. "At 
that time, we all concluded that we were brain dead," Leaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most department leaders were not told during the meetings whether their 
proposals would be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the department heads were all called to a 10 a.m. meeting Thursday in 
the second-floor room in the Hall of Administration where the county's labor 
contracts are hammered out. Department heads only, the invitation specified. No 
seconds-in-command. No support staff. No substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how they came up with the cuts. I have no idea," said County 
Marshal Michael Carona, expressing surprise that some department heads spent 
hours with the council in repeated meetings, although he had only one session. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, the management council members shuttled back and forth 
between the Sheriff's Department offices, where they met with department heads, 
and the Hall of Administration, where they had continuous briefings from the 
county's key financial advisers, former state Treasurer Thomas Hayes, newly 
appointed Treasurer-Tax Collector Thomas Daxon, bankruptcy attorney Bruce 
Bennett and county Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Wednesday -- only one day before the council made its final 
recommendations -- accountants from the Arthur Andersen firm were in emergency 
sessions at the sheriff's building, updating the council on the cash-flow 
situation. Even Vasquez said he did not learn of the magnitude of the proposed 
cuts until Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 That same evening, the management council met with representatives of the 
county's employee associations for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoned to the sheriff's office at 5:15 p.m., leaders of the county's more 
than 20 bargaining units sipped pineapple and grape juice as they waited their 
turn to be called before Gates, Capizzi and Uram. Bill Fogarty of the Orange 
County Labor Council said the council's support staff cleared out and closed 
the door behind them as soon as he entered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of them sat on one side (of the table), with Brad (Gates) in the 
middle. It was Brad's show," Fogarty said of the tense, 15-minute meeting. "We 
didn't have a discussion. We didn't have a dialogue. Gates said, 'When the time 
comes, we'll let you know what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Employees Assn. General Manager John H. Sawyer emerged worried, 
but confident that union leaders would be consulted before firm measures were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked in county government the longest said they have never 
seen anything like the management council, or heard of a sheriff overseeing 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the bankruptcy itself is unprecedented, the three leaders reasoned, it 
calls for an unprecedented response. And the three men said Friday their work 
is not done. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're looking at is people who are used to managing a crisis," Gates 
said of the council members. "It doesn't matter if it's a fire or a riot -- or 
a financial crisis."

LEBANON RAIDS MARK UPSURGE IN FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli warplanes rocketed guerrilla positions in South Lebanon on Friday 
after Muslim militants killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded seven in attacks 
on Israeli outposts, the army confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah said it shelled the Israeli army positions in 
revenge for a car bombing that killed four people -- including at least two 
Hezbollah members -- in Beirut on Wednesday. Hezbollah and the Lebanese 
government blamed Israel for the car bombing, but Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
denied that Israel was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The upsurge in fighting on Israel's only active front came as talks continued 
in Washington between senior Israeli and Syrian military officers, who were 
said to be exchanging views on the security needs each nation has on the Golan 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have bogged down over Syria's 
demand that the Israelis withdraw completely from the strategic plateau, which 
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria has 30,000 troops deployed in eastern Lebanon, and Israel regards it as 
the chief powerbroker in that troubled nation. Israel has repeatedly accused 
Syria of using Hezbollah to put pressure on Israel at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah recently stepped up both shelling and ground attacks on posts held 
by Israel and its allied militia, the South Lebanese Army, in Israel's 
self-proclaimed security zone -- a belt of land above Israel's border with 
Lebanon that the Israelis and the SLA jointly patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one Israeli soldiers have died this year in South Lebanon. This month 
alone, six Israeli soldiers have died in South Lebanon and 18 have been 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting casualties there have provoked a debate within the government and 
the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, over whether the army should break out of 
the security zone and unleash an all-out assault on Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin has warned that a large-scale attack could endanger the fragile 
negotiations with Syria under U.S. auspices or trigger Hezbollah attacks on 
Jews living outside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring the northern border to speak with soldiers and their officers Friday 
night, Rabin again indicated that Israel's response to Hezbollah would be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember that we've tried in the past to eliminate terrorism by 
means of a total war," Rabin said, referring to the June, 1982, invasion of 
Lebanon launched by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's right-wing 
government, an invasion that took the Israeli army all the way to Beirut in a 
war against the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We managed to eliminate the Palestinian terrorism in Lebanon, and instead we 
got a much more vicious, harsher terrorism and one that is for the most part 
authentically Lebanese, not foreign," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Israeli army's response to Hezbollah attacks in the security zone 
will, in general, be confined to that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any attempt to . . . expand the security zone will force us to commit more 
forces, to allow them greater geographic mobility, and the number of casualties 
will rise without changing anything for (the security of) residents of the 
north," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Israeli planes and helicopter gunships attacked Hezbollah targets 
north of the security zone Friday after Hezbollah's morning attack on the 
Israeli positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from Marjayoun, in Lebanon, said that a Lebanese police car was struck 
by one rocket outside the village of Jbaa, burning alive two Lebanese 
policemen. The army made no comment on that report. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah leaders had warned Thursday that the Shiite Muslim group would 
strike back at Israel for the Wednesday car bombing. Early Friday morning, 
Hezbollah started shelling Israeli positions in the eastern part of the 
security zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio reported that dozens of rockets, missiles and mortars fell on its 
posts at Suweida and Dabsheh. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Israeli casualties reportedly occurred during an attack on a post at 
Ali Taher heights, an army spokesman reported. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 Israeli soldiers and about 2,500 SLA troops patrol the 
440-square-mile zone, which Israel carved out in 1985 to protect its northern 
towns from rocket attacks and cross-border guerrilla raids.

ON WALL STREET, FIASCO IS ONLY A RADAR BLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE BAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street had important things to think about the week before Christmas. 
First and foremost were annual bonuses. A distant second was the plummeting 
Mexican peso and its squeeze on American investors. Then there was the subway 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the Orange County financial crisis? 
</P>
<P>
 "A blip on the screen," said Joe Mysak of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County? They're in bankruptcy out there. Hundreds might be laid 
off. Schoolchildren could lose an apple with their lunch. Doesn't anybody care? 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street there simply was no concern -- not to mention remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no!" Mysak roared when asked if Wall Street perhaps felt collective 
guilt over Orange County's financial pain. "The attitude here is: Those guys 
were morons. Sure, people like to blame Wall Street for cooking up schemes. But 
in this case, no, absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
 Mysak said this wasn't Wall Street being smug or happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time out a lot of public officials are going to go down; a lot of heads 
are rolling; credit ratings are being downgraded," he said. "But it's one of 
those unfortunate things that happen in general when the market turns. . . . 
And there's a point where the attitude is: Let the buyer beware." 
</P>
<P>
 In a place where the average day's trading on the stock market is about $10 
billion, the Orange County loss of $2.02 billion in the municipal bond market 
is taken in stride. It's referred to as "an adjustment" or "a little swivel." 
But mostly it's "a local problem." 
</P>
<P>
 With the municipal bond market divided up into about eight smaller regional 
markets, Orange County's woes are viewed by many in the heart of the world's 
financial center as a problem for California firms and California investors. 
Because the bond market nationally has been resilient in absorbing the shock of 
Orange County's problems, Wall Street can afford to be cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies are 
investigating former Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron's 
dealings with several Wall Street brokers. But even if authorities eventually 
implicate individual brokers or firms in the Orange County financial debacle, 
most here don't see Wall Street's image being seriously tarnished. Whatever 
emerges from the investigations will be limited to certain individuals and 
their brokerages, several money managers said. They don't worry about the 
crisis exposing a systemic problem with their industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through some tough days, actually a bad weekend, trying to decide 
whether to liquidate when the thing started out there," said an official with a 
New York firm that had ties to Orange County. "But that's history now. We've 
moved on." 
</P>
<P>
 This executive and others, who didn't want to be named for fear of hurting 
business, seemed inured to the possibility that Wall Street might get bashed 
for hawking derivatives and such exotic tonics as "inverse floaters" and 
"reverse repos" on Main Street. Many argue that municipalities were taking too 
big a risk in the first place when they decided to become sophisticated 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, this is not a case of Wall Street finding some new arcane way to 
screw the little guy," said another savvy investor. "High-yield products like 
derivatives were never for the little guy. Amateurs should stick to mutual 
funds, if you know what I mean." 
</P>
<P>
 If high-risk derivatives seem difficult to comprehend to the average investor, 
to players on Wall Street they are as basic as balancing a checkbook. They have 
been widely discussed in the media and debated even in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the real smart guys aren't working in Orange County," said another 
source, a longtime money manager for a major financial house. "If they were so 
smart they wouldn't be making $150,000 a year. They'd be on Wall Street. Making 
$1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The financial relationship between an Orange County official and a Wall Street 
broker was hardly one of equals, according to some Wall Streeters. And there 
was considerable curiosity about conversations that took place between Citron 
and brokers from Merrill Lynch, the leading underwriter of the county's bond 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole lot of guys got hammered this year with derivatives and so did Mr. 
Citron," a successful Wall Street investor said. "The difference is, he 
shouldn't have been playing such high-stakes poker. Not with public money." 
</P>
<P>
 One investor said he noticed people at several Christmas parties casting 
sideways glances about Merrill Lynch for agreeing to deal with Citron. Why 
didn't Merrill Lynch pull out? 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember," the investor said, "other firms wouldn't do business with this 
guy. Why did Merrill Lynch? Is there something in Merrill's corporate culture 
that it gets involved in these situations?" 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Silverman, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch, was disgusted by sniping at 
his company, the nation's largest investment firm and the biggest player in the 
bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone that's saying Merrill Lynch is to blame for the problems in Orange 
County ought to be examined for their self-interest," said Silverman, adding: 
"When all the facts are sorted out it will be clear that Merrill Lynch acted 
properly and professionally in all of its Orange County dealings." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Wall Street executive believes the Orange County fiasco might 
force the financial community to take stock. William Griggs of the investment 
firm Griggs & Santow said that if it turns out brokers did not actively keep 
local officials up to date on the risks, perhaps the financial community should 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any seller is obligated to indicate what the risks are," Griggs said. "We 
should all feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know who said what to whom. It seems any seller should have said, 
'If rates go up, Mr. Citron, you can't dismiss that you have a serious 
problem.' Perhaps that was said and ignored. Reading his quotes in the paper, 
Mr. Citron seems like a man with a more than adequate ego. So maybe he didn't 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Griggs said he believes that in light of Orange County's losses in the bond 
market, some top managers of New York firms will reassess for the new year 
their policies on dealing in derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they're saying, 'We don't need this kind of nonsense,' and trying to 
figure out a better way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that Wall Street is famous for discounting yesterday's 
news and looking ahead to the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the media continue to chronicle Orange County's woes, no amount of 
attention will force Wall Street to get philosophical about this latest episode 
affecting public funds. This is a place better known for its macabre humor than 
its civic-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not Alan Greenspan getting hit by a bus or Hillary Clinton getting 
indicted or the stock market tanking 800 points," said one Wall Street pundit 
who has written frequently of its intrigues. "It's one more replay of the old 
saying that tragedy is when it happens to you and comedy when it happens to 
someone else. Orange County, in this case, is the someone else."

STALLED HOPES AND DREAMS IN BETHLEHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hassan abu Khleileh gestured sadly at the boxes of Christmas tree ornaments 
and brightly packaged children's toys in his empty shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that two weeks before Christmas we started selling like crazy. 
We couldn't sit down, the store was so busy," Abu Khleileh said. "Now, you see 
-- nothing." He shrugged his shoulders in resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it is better just to go home and sleep through it," he said. "There's 
no happiness at all this Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the traditional midnight Mass is to be held at the Church of the 
Nativity, but the town where it all began 2,000 years ago is having a hard time 
finding its Christmas spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the Christmas when Israel's army had pulled out of 
Palestinian towns and villages and the Palestinian Authority had taken 
responsibility for running daily life in the West Bank. But negotiations have 
bogged down between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on 
redeployment and on holding Palestinian elections in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Redeployment and elections now seem likely to be delayed for several more 
months. The Israeli government says it cannot redeploy because the Palestinian 
Authority cannot ensure the security of about 120,000 Jewish settlers living in 
the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority accuses the Israelis of violating the 
Sept. 13, 1993, accord that the two sides signed on the South Lawn of the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The testy exchanges -- coupled with a winter that blew in early and with 
unusual ferocity, dumping freezing rain and sleet on Jerusalem and the 
surrounding areas -- have put both Israelis and Palestinians in a sour mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Palestinians are going through the motions. A few hundred yards 
from Abu Khleileh's lonely shop recently, there were unmistakable signs that 
Christmas was coming. Israeli soldiers were hammering together the bleachers 
where foreign choirs will stand when they perform tonight. The municipality had 
strung lights across the small square, and even the Israeli police, whose 
building sits behind a high fence on Manger Square, had decorated a large cedar 
tree outside their police station with lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority is also making its presence felt this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij had to defy the Israeli army to hoist a 
single Palestinian flag in front of City Hall, which fronts on the square. This 
year, the strings of lights are accompanied by strings of tiny Palestinian 
flags crisscrossing the air above the square. Shops that sell olive-wood 
Nativity scenes also sell Palestinian flags and portraits of PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 And a few blocks away from Manger Square, the local office of Fatah -- the 
Palestinian guerrilla group that for decades was outlawed in the territories -- 
has decorated the balcony of its second-floor office with a Christmas tree and 
a Santa clutching a Palestinian flag. It has also strung up rows of Palestinian 
flags and portraits of Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bethlehem's decorations are meager. They would look shameful juxtaposed 
beside the decorations of the smallest American or European town. 
</P>
<P>
 And except for the soldiers and a few loitering locals on a recent day, Manger 
Square was almost empty. Many shops in the ancient town -- which once attracted 
huge crowds of Israelis from neighboring Jerusalem who shopped and dined in 
local restaurants -- are now shuttered. Seven years of intifada, the violent 
Palestinian uprising against Israeli military rule in the occupied territories, 
drove the customers away and the owners out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The streets used to be crowded, not only with foreigners but with Jews," Abu 
Khleileh said. "Now, not only the Jews don't come, even the foreigners are 
afraid to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Khleileh remembers a time when Christmas was celebrated not only by 
Bethlehem's Christians -- who for years have been in a minority -- but also by 
many of its Muslims. Families and friends got together for big dinners, bought 
lots of presents, gathered in Manger Square on Christmas Eve to hear the choirs 
and decorated artificial Christmas trees, or trees chopped down surreptitiously 
from Israeli forests. 
</P>
<P>
 But the last such Christmas that Abu Khleileh can recall was the Christmas of 
1987 -- "before the intifada moved here from Gaza," he said. The intifada 
erupted in Gaza's refugee camps in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 For years before the signing of the Israeli-PLO peace accord, public 
celebrations of any kind were frowned upon by intifada activists. Arabic 
newspapers in Jerusalem took to printing Christmas stories headlined "Santa 
Claus Wept." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after the accord was signed, the mood lightened somewhat, although 
it was marred in Bethlehem by the scuffle over the flag. But in the last year, 
Palestinians have seen the Palestinian Authority get off to a rocky start in 
Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho and have watched with growing 
frustration as negotiations on expanding self-rule throughout the West Bank 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 And most importantly for many Palestinians, their economic situation has not 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis maintain roadblocks on the entrances to Jerusalem -- the 
commercial, social and political hub of West Bank life, and a corner of the 
triangle of Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jerusalem where most of the West Bank's 
50,000 Christians are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Only West Bank Palestinians with special permits are allowed to enter 
Jerusalem -- home to 390,000 Jews, 150,000 Muslims and 10,000 Christians. 
Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting Jerusalem off from the West Bank, the Israelis are preventing 
thousands of West Bank residents from working in Israel, the only source of 
livelihood for many families. And they are preventing Palestinians from 
shopping in Jerusalem, or visiting the city that holds sites holy to Muslims, 
Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters this week, Latin Patriarch Michel Sabah called on Israel 
to lift restrictions on Palestinian Christians visiting Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabah, the first Palestinian to head the Roman Catholic Church here, also 
called on the United Nations to guarantee free access to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace should encompass the opening of Jerusalem, which is still closed to 
Christians, Muslims, to all inhabitants of the occupied territories," Sabah 
told the Associated Press. "Jerusalem is the heart of civil and religious life 
. . . and therefore it should not be closed for any reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Elise Shazar, spokeswoman for the civilian government that the Israeli 
army runs in the West Bank, said that Israel has granted thousands of temporary 
permits for worshipers to visit Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 But obtaining a permit requires hours-long waits in endless lines outside the 
civil administration offices of the West Bank, an ordeal many Palestinians 
prefer to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 So Christmas this year will again be celebrated mainly indoors, in quiet 
gatherings of families of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It will be a 
low-key affair, constrained by economic hardship and political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is really no atmosphere of holiday this year. You really don't feel 
that there is peace," said Ahmed Hamal, a shop owner in Ramallah who sells 
high-quality clothes for babies and children. 
</P>
<P>
 For five days last week, the army ordered Hamal and 19 other shop owners in 
downtown Ramallah to close their stores after the shop owners failed to aid an 
Israeli soldier who had driven his car into Ramallah and was attacked and 
injured by youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure, Hamal said, ensured that he and the other punished merchants 
would salvage nothing from a Christmas season that already was looking grim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamal pointed to his shelves stuffed with gaily printed outfits for young 
children. There were no customers in sight. Sales this year, he said, were 
abysmal. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the army is still in the streets, people won't feel like 
celebrating," he said. "What will make the difference is when people will feel 
that they are free to move, that they are free to go places and to do things 
without being bothered."

$80 MILLION MORE IN CUTS NEEDED, O.C. OFFICIALS SAY; BANKRUPTCY: THE SLASHES -- 
FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- WILL BE ON TOP OF $40 MILLION IN REDUCTIONS AND BUDGET 
SHIFTS THIS YEAR. DEVASTATING FALLOUT IS FORESEEN.

<P>
 One day after announcing that hundreds of layoffs are likely from massive 
budget cutbacks, Orange County officials said Friday that they plan to slash an 
additional $80 million in costs next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 News of more cutbacks came just 24 hours after top managers stunned the 
county's 18,000 employees by revealing more than $40 million in budget 
reductions and shifts planned over the next six months. Of that, nearly $30 
million will be in cutbacks at dozens of county departments, such as courts and 
social services. The rest will come from early cash advances from federal, 
state and local programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's new management council said at an impromptu news conference 
Friday that the cuts will have to rise to $80 million over the next fiscal 
year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to double (the $40 million) next year," said Tom Uram, director of 
the county Health Care Agency, who with Sheriff Brad Gates and Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi make up the council charged with reshaping the county's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not give any specifics on how the second round of cuts would be 
implemented or how many additional jobs would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said that the downsizing of the county's 
programs and its work force is expected to become more severe and that the 
fallout will be nothing short of devastating to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to understand this is not some kind of impersonal bureaucracy," 
Steiner said. "People are reeling from this. These people are husbands and 
wives and brothers and sisters. For the thousand people or whatever it is that 
will be affected by this, it's extremely emotional and personal." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact number of layoffs was undetermined Friday. But the news has sparked 
fury, as labor leaders have scrambled to consult lawyers about possible legal 
action against the county for suspending numerous labor contracts and allowing 
department managers broad discretion to fire employees or cut their pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb threats were made to the offices of Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and 
Thomas F. Riley. Someone also called to threaten the life of former 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned this month as the county 
veered toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Felix Rocha Jr., an Orange County Department of Education board 
member, served Supervisor Roger R. Stanton with recall papers Friday. But Rocha 
had not completed the necessary paperwork to file a petition with the county, 
so he vowed to return next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county began distributing property tax money to cities, school districts 
and other special districts. Officials from many cities -- including Huntington 
Beach, Anaheim and Fullerton -- were so eager to get the cash that they arrived 
in person at the Hall of Administration to collect checks rather than wait for 
them in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Mayor George Brown said his city decided to pick up the payment so 
the money could immediately be deposited in a bank and earn interest over the 
long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials searched for new ways to raise money, including selling or 
leasing county-owned properties. The county also is weighing whether to rent 
space in its landfills to other counties or to sign long-term contracts with 
county vendors in exchange for lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Madera County's Department of Education, which put more than $5 million in 
Orange County's troubled investment fund, said in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
filing that it may default on several public debt obligations if it cannot 
immediately withdraw $2.48 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County department heads spent the day fielding questions from anxious 
employees -- reassuring most that their jobs were safe -- and trying to meet 
the cost-cutting demands imposed Thursday by the Board of Supervisors. Many 
managers said they were relieved that the initial reductions were not worse. 
The specifics of the blows to each department are expected to take at least a 
week to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hall of Administration and other offices across the county, workers 
fretted about their future two days before Christmas and wondered whether they 
would have jobs when they returned from holiday vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees said the public will feel the crunch almost immediately in longer 
lines for various services and delays in processing paperwork by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers huddled in hallways during breaks and whispered about the situation, 
then went back to their desks, anxiously waiting for any updates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real sadness and a stunned silence," said public health nurse 
Karen Graffman. "It's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they hoped that layoffs could be avoided by trying ideas such as 
shortened workweeks or reduced salaries. Resignations Urged 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers vented their anger toward the Board of Supervisors and called for 
immediate resignations. Many had bitter words for Citron, whose high-risk 
investment strategies have been blamed for the county's $2.02-billion loss this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders fumed over the county's decision to suspend their bargaining 
agreements. That decision will allow the cutbacks to begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think their actions are illegal," said Bill Fogarty, executive 
secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO. "We 
don't think they have the authority to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fogarty said the county's move is drawing attention from union leaders 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens in Orange County, I think it's going to set some precedent 
nationwide for employee rights," he said. "This is a classic case of union 
busting by Orange County and it's going to have national implications." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors decided to suspend collective bargaining contracts and other 
employee rights Thursday after the management council proposed a wide-ranging 
slash of services, targeting contracts that provide outside legal assistance 
for the poor, health care and welfare services, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 At their news conference Friday, Gates, Capizzi and Uram refused to speculate 
on the number of layoffs that might occur over the next six months. They said 
that the specific cutbacks will be left to individual department managers and 
that many agencies may be able to streamline programs without putting people 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some union leaders speculated that between 800 and 1,000 jobs could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to avoid laying off people," Capizzi said of his own 
department, which was one of the least-affected areas, with a 1.1% reduction 
planned. "The purpose of this was not to lay off employees, but rather to cut 
the county's costs. If we can do so and minimize the impact to employees, we 
will also minimize the impact to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said union officials told the management council that they preferred 
layoffs to an across-the-board reduction in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram clarified the council's recommendation of $40.2 million in cuts during 
the next six months, noting that the savings are expected to come from $29.7 
million in straightforward reductions in the county's general funds and $10.5 
million in accelerated revenue payments from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the aim of the cutbacks is a "leaner, meaner," restructured county 
government for the forseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government's probably going to be reinvented here," he said. "It's not like 
we're going to be just sitting down and doing a budget like we did last year 
and over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 All three emphasized the importance of having acted quickly. Gates said each 
week costs the county $7 million in salaries alone. 'Invisible Wall' Falls 
</P>
<P>
 Though some county workers have raised questions about why cuts in the 
departments headed by Gates, Capizzi and Uram were among the smallest, council 
members said they were given a clear mission by the Board of Supervisors to 
retain services dealing with "public safety, health and welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern I've heard from everyone is: Don't take away those police, 
don't take away those firemen," Gates said. "The cops are going to still be on 
the street. We're going to be prosecuting. Mike's going to be putting criminals 
in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, an Orange County native, said the past few weeks have been upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has always been this invisible wall around Orange County that has 
protected us from all kinds of things in my lifetime," he said. "That wall got 
punched a little bit with crime, it got punched a little bit with drugs, it got 
punched again with gangs. Things are happening here that we never in my mind 
thought could happen. It's like a major blow to the jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6, several groups have 
called for the recall of the supervisors. On Friday, Rocha, of the county 
Department of Education, was the first to attempt such an action when he served 
Stanton with recall papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Tanney, the county registrar of voters, said Rocha filed a notice of 
intent to recall Stanton and told a registrar's office employee that he had 
served Stanton the notice earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing a notice of intent is the first step in beginning the recall 
process. Rocha's notice appeared to include the required 20 signatures from 
residents as well as the statement of 200 words or less explaining why Rocha 
wanted to recall Stanton, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notice was missing a section of the California Election Code that 
advises the target of a recall that he or she has seven days to file a response 
to the notice with the registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, a board of education member since 1992, would have to add the missing 
section to the notice, collect 20 new signatures and again serve Stanton with 
the document, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha said he will return with a new notice Thursday, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of public inquiries about how to begin a recall movement have 
increased substantially since the county declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest resident Dianna Baumann said she circulated petitions door to door 
over the last two weeks and plans to launch a full-scale drive after the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann has named her campaign the Coalition for Accountability and is urging 
residents to send empty wallets to supervisors as a protest against the bond 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under county election codes, recalls can only be attempted against officials 
who have more than six months remaining on their terms or have been in office 
for more than 90 days, said Rosalyn Lever, assistant county registrar. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann said she is getting ready to kick her recall drive into full gear. 
</P>
<P>
 'As soon as Christmas is over, we are going to hit this and hit it hard," she 
said. "We entrusted them to look after our interests. . . . But they are not 
looking out for the taxpayers' interests."

 First there were the trading cards. Then last week the commemorative coins 
went on the market. And now there is the $3,395 statue. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts to make money from O.J. Simpson's notoriety -- some of them by 
Simpson himself -- are taking place in the vast moral and legal valley known as 
profiteering, a landscape where phrases like "pre-indictment price" are part of 
the lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of the remarkable money-raising activities is a 21-inch-high, 
30-pound bronze sculpture of "The Juice." Wearing his trademark No. 32 jersey, 
Simpson is depicted holding a football on his hip, his helmet at his feet, his 
autograph at the base. The statue, cast in Oregon, was advertised for sale this 
week in numerous media outlets. Simpson will receive an unspecified percentage 
of the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson -- facing massive legal bills and dwindling personal assets -- not 
only approved the project, but while in jail has viewed three renderings of the 
sculpture and made suggestions for changes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no legal impediment to Simpson engaging in such ventures while in 
jail. Still, some question the ethics of turning notoriety -- enhanced by 
accusations of murder -- into an entrepreneurial opportunity. There is also the 
prospect that if Simpson is convicted, relatives of his alleged victims might 
be able to recover some of his profits under a state law that attempts to limit 
the ability of criminals to make money from their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Author John Gregory Dunne, who wrote a long article on the Simpson case for 
the New York Review of Books, said he was appalled. "Shame seems not to have 
crossed the ken of anyone involved in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Brill, president of Court TV, which is televising the Simpson case, also 
expressed indignation and said his network has declined to advertise two other 
Simpson-related products as a matter of principle. "The question is, do you 
want to be involved in the general coarsening of our society?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the Simpson statues is hardly surprising in a society "obsessed 
by titillation," where celebrity has become more and more an end in itself, 
said David Halberstam, the author of highly acclaimed books on politics and 
sports. "O.J. is now a bigger celebrity. . . . In my lifetime, we've never had 
an accused murderer of this fame. There is inevitable . . . exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker Freeman Smith, editor of Collector's Sportslook, a Congers, N.Y., 
magazine that tracks the prices of sports memorabilia, acknowledged that "the 
way everyone has cashed in on O.J. is kind of gross, from the network news to 
the street vendors. But people have a right to make a dollar; we live in a 
capitalist society." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 of the sculptures, introduced earlier this week, have been 
ordered already by people from as far away as Tokyo, according to Lenward 
Holness, president of Collectibles, Rarities, Arts and Special Holdings 
(CRASH), the West Los Angeles company that is marketing the statues. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's jailhouse evaluation of the sculpture design included his suggestion 
that the jawline be firmed up, Holness said. Simpson's friends A.C. Cowlings, 
Robert Kardashian and Paula Barbieri also added suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Holness said he planned to give the former football star the 32nd statue as a 
Christmas present this week, although Simpson would not be allowed to keep it 
with him in his jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
 If Holness sells 25,000 of the statues, as he anticipates, that would mean 
gross revenues of $84.9 million. Holness declined to say what the accused 
double murderer's share of the take will be. Simpson's business lawyer Leroy B. 
Taft declined to return calls. Reached in Texas where he is vacationing, 
Simpson's agent, Mike Gilbert, said he did not recall the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Holness defended the ethics of the sculpture project, saying it had been 
planned eight months before Simpson was accused of the June 12 murder of his 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal feeling is that it is a business transaction and O.J. Simpson is 
the greatest running back of all time, and until he is proven guilty he is 
innocent," Holness said. 
</P>
<P>
 While not endorsing the venture, Los Angeles defense lawyer Harland W. Braun 
said it was important to remember that Simpson "is a man who has spent his life 
exploiting his public image. He is simply continuing to merchandise his public 
image." 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment law expert Lionel S. Sobel of Loyola Law School said that 
Simpson's share of such a venture normally would range from 5% to 10% of the 
gross retail sales. But he said the percentage could be higher for the statue 
because of the unusual circumstances in which it is being marketed. Also, 
because the sculpture is priced so high, "there is a larger margin of gross 
profit built in than there would be on sweat shirts or autographed footballs." 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson is ultimately convicted, his profits might be erased by by 
California's "Son of Sam" law, passed by the Legislature in response to outrage 
about criminals who made money by selling their stories. A New York law of this 
type was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991. However, California's 
statute, which has never been tested in court, is sufficiently different that 
it might withstand challenges, Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson has a legal right to a share of the proceeds of any 
merchandise marketed with his likeness, he has decided not to pursue claims 
against the bevy of free-lance entrepreneurs selling O.J. Simpson T-shirts, 
cups and Pogs (with "guilty" and "not guilty" sides) at Southland venues such 
as the Criminal Courts Building, according to informed sources. The sources 
said that Simpson's lawyers had concluded that the likelihood of any 
substantial return from lawsuits was likely to be outweighed by the expense of 
pursuing such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, Simpson, fulfilling a contract he signed before being 
arrested, autographed football cards in his jail cell that were sold to 
collectors around the country, according to memorabilia experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Simpson was arrested, prices on his cards rapidly escalated, but 
in recent months there has been "a steady decline to the pre-indictment price," 
said Smith of Sportslook. "His rookie card from the 1970 Topps football set is 
currently trading for $175. We saw it go up to $400-$500 in L.A. and Buffalo. 
Everything got out of whack in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a special coin commemorating Simpson's best year with the Buffalo 
Bills went on the market. Simpson has approved the design and marketing of the 
coin, which hails his 1973 performance, when he became the first runner in the 
history of the National Football League to gain more than 2,000 yards in one 
season. The Buffalo, N.Y., and Provo, Utah, businessmen who are jointly 
marketing the coins said nearly all of the 6,000 produced have already been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jakubczak, 61, who previously had coins minted to commemorate the 
Bills' four consecutive American Football Conference championships, said he and 
Simpson first discussed the project when they ran into one another at Buffalo 
Airport in August, 1993, but nothing came of it. The venture got started in 
earnest after the two men discussed it again last January at the inaugural ball 
of Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, problems started in June," Jakubczak said, referring to the 
murders. "We forget about the coin. Who wants to do a coin in relationship to 
all the problems O.J. is having?" 
</P>
<P>
 But last August, Jakubczak said, Simpson's agent Gilbert called him, flew to 
Buffalo and told him that Simpson still wanted to do the coin. "I was 
flabbergasted. I said wouldn't it hurt the situation, wouldn't it be 
sensationalizing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Jakubczak said, a deal was struck after he convinced Gilbert that 
it would be inadvisable to produce unlimited numbers of the coins: "If we do a 
limited issue, we'll have a coin that will be in demand from now to doomsday." 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-dollar-size coin was designed by Blair Buswell, who sculpted the 
bust of Simpson that is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, 
Ohio. One side of the coin has a drawing of Simpson and the words "O.J. Simpson 
and the Electric Company," the nickname of the Bills offensive linemen who 
paved the way for his record-breaking runs. His 1973 statistics appear on the 
other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The coins are selling for $69.95 each in gold and $34.95 in silver, Jardine 
said. Additionally, 100 editions of a special boxed set containing a one-ounce 
silver coin and a one-ounce silver coin layered in 24-karat gold were produced 
and are being sold for $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is receiving royalties from the sale of the coins, but Jardine 
declined to say how much. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 32 sets were delivered to Simpson so that he could give them to 
friends as Christmas gifts, Jardine said. The balance of the sets sold out 
immediately, Jakubczak said, as have almost all 6,000 of the individually 
numbered coins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have bought the coins no matter what," said Tom Hacker, 45, a 
customer in Jakubczak's Select Stamp and Coin shop in Buffalo. "He's a Hall of 
Famer; he played for the Bills. It has nothing to do with the murders." 
</P>
<P>
 "The coin is so hot it's unbelievable," Hacker said, referring to the fact 
that the coins already have a resale value of triple their original price in 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hacker, a Buffalo native, said he has no plans to turn a quick buck on his 
coin set: "This will stay in my family. This will be passed on to my son and 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Another purchaser, Democratic New York state Sen. William Stachowski, said he 
bought the coins "because I've always been a football fan, because of the 
football accomplishments, not because of the off-the-field stuff. Any time I've 
been in the company of O.J. Simpson, he's been a real gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 Statue marketer Holness said several well-known people have purchased the 
Simpson statue, but he declined to divulge their names or that of a San 
Francisco man who purchased a dozen, citing privacy concerns. However, he 
arranged a telephone interview with Betty J. Adams of Dayton, Ohio, who said 
she bought one of the sculptures for her 35-year-old son, whom she described as 
a longtime football fan and admirer of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure this will kind of make up to my son for not taking a picture of him 
shaking hands with O.J." when they met on the streets of Barcelona during the 
1992 Summer Olympic Games, the mother said. "O.J. was a very nice guy from what 
I could tell." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the morality of marketing the statue now, Adams said: "Hey, (Simpson) 
needs the money. His defense team is expensive. He's going to be dead broke if 
he doesn't do something."

CHECHEN WAR RAISES FEAR OF NEW INSTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia is now a country at war. 
</P>
<P>
 The combat theater is small, the location obscure and the casualties likely to 
remain a relative trickle compared to those in Rwanda or Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Kremlin decided to break Chechnya's bid for independence by 
military force, when it began dropping bombs on what it considers Russian towns 
and shelling Russian citizens, it crossed a line beyond which only one thing is 
sure: This Eurasian colossus has become a more volatile place. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the stability that was the rationale for the Russian offensive, 
many observers believe that greater instability is already the result. Instead 
of sewing the patchwork of the Russian Federation together once and for all, 
President Boris N. Yeltsin may have helped pull it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of cementing Russia's image as a country on its way to post-Soviet 
normalcy, the Chechnya intervention has cast greater doubts on the Kremlin's 
commitment to democracy and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Chechnya, Russia has found its own domestic Karabakh," lawmaker Konstantin 
Zatulin said in a recent newspaper article, referring to the intractable 
conflict in the disputed enclave of Azerbaijan that has brought down leaders 
and crippled economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that this Karabakh is in the northern, Russian section of the Caucasus 
Mountains instead of the southern end. A potpourri of clannish peoples sitting 
on rich troves of oil, the Caucasus is an explosive region with little love 
lost for Moscow at the best of times. 
</P>
<P>
 By killing scores of Chechen civilians in ill-aimed bombing and shelling, 
Moscow risks inflaming much of the region. Already, the people of neighboring 
Dagestan and Ingushetia have shown their solidarity with Chechnya by blocking 
Russian troops heading there and lining their roads in a mass protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer it takes to reach some kind of political solution, the bigger are 
the chances that the flames of guerrilla war will move over and engulf the 
nearest republics, if not the rest of the Caucasus," said historian Karen 
Brutents, an expert on ethnic conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Though in the past Ingushetia, Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria have not pushed 
as hard as Chechnya to secede, the Russian intervention is clearly giving them 
more incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the best of federations where issues are resolved by force," said 
Ruslan Aushev, president of Ingushetia. "Think about how it feels when you're 
sitting there waiting for tanks to invade." 
</P>
<P>
 Aushev said Ingushetia did not plan immediately to secede, but "if everybody 
starts leaving there will be little else for the Ingush to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the Russian Federation had actually seemed fairly solid, 
with the one exception of Chechnya. Yeltsin signed a broad agreement with 
virtually all of Russia's 88 regions and republics last winter, and even former 
holdouts such as the oil-rich republic of Tatarstan had stopped agitating for 
more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 But the offensive in Chechnya holds the potential to spark a reaction similar 
to the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union after the 1991 coup attempt, when 
Soviet republics horrified by the coup and seeing a moment of Kremlin weakness 
declared their independence one after the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, republics such as Tatarstan are openly criticizing the Chechnya 
intervention, calling for the renewal of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sure that combat operations should be suspended," Tatarstan President 
Mintimer Shaimiyev told Yeltsin in a special message Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the country does not begin to spin apart, Russia has already lost some 
of its unity by trying to isolate the unrest in the Caucasus. It cut off all 
flights from Azerbaijan and Georgia this week in an attempt to stop the flow of 
arms to Chechnya, and has limited other transport access to the Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian offensive also threatens to undermine the uneasy peace in other 
conflict areas of the former Soviet Union. Officials are already broaching the 
possibility that Russia, by killing the Muslim Chechens, has ruined its 
authority as a mediator and source of peacekeepers in the former empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic states "will consider it good style to reproach Russia for its conduct 
in Chechnya" and reject Moscow's role in settling conflicts, such as the one in 
Karabakh, in which Muslim states are involved, Zatulin predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you that if the situation continues this way it will soon 
produce a powerful seat of destabilization, not only in the northern Caucasus 
but in the whole Russian Federation," said former Russian Parliament Speaker 
Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, an ethnic Chechen. "The effect will snowball, pulling in 
international forces and the sympathies of other countries and other 
parliaments, especially in the Islamic world." 
</P>
<P>
 If worst-case scenarios come true, the northern Caucasus will become the 
setting of a drawn-out guerrilla war in which Chechen militants backed by other 
ethnic groups will harass Russian troops for years. Analysts here compare the 
Chechens to the Basque separatists in Spain and the Catholic republicans of 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chechens are sure that the war will not end until their people have been 
destroyed or the Russians defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we get clearly from the Russians is 'No people, no problem,' " 
alleged Abdullah Dadayev, an adviser to the Chechen president. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief danger in the Chechen crisis, however, is not of a prolonged local 
conflict but of its implications for the pinnacle of Russian power. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Kremlin made the decision to use force, it signaled that what Russian 
observers call the "Party of War" -- the defense and security Establishment -- 
had triumphed over Yeltsin's more dovish and intellectual advisers. If that 
happened once, it is likely to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the outcome of the military expedition to Chechnya, it is 
practically inevitable that other problems will also be resolved by force," 
Editor-in-Chief Vitaly Tretyakov wrote in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Russian offensive in Chechnya has the tacit approval of most 
foreign governments and many Russians, the face of the Kremlin has changed. It 
is fiercer, more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin showed in October, 1993, when he sent tanks to battle his recalcitrant 
Parliament, that he was willing to use force to obtain his political goals. Now 
he has gone a step further, turning the Russian army's firepower not only 
against a rebellious elite with virtually no popular support but also against 
an entire rebellious people. 
</P>
<P>
 For watchdogs such as Sergei Kovalyov, Yeltsin's top human rights inspector, 
the very fact of the offensive on Chechnya reveals a Kremlin willingness to 
violate the tenets of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chechen people, as any other, can make mistakes in choosing their leaders 
and ideals," said Kovalyov, who was visiting Chechnya to monitor the conflict. 
"But this gives no one the right to dispute them in the language of bombing and 
shelling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Helsinki Watch human rights group called on President Clinton, who says he 
considers Chechnya an internal Russian problem, to take a stand against the 
incursion. The group said he should "make it clear to President Yeltsin that 
the conflict in Chechnya tests Russia's commitment to democracy and that 
Russia's conduct so far shows a fundamental lack of respect for human rights 
and humanitarian law." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such behavior is never 'an internal matter,' " the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 What frightened Russian media and analysts most, however, was the possibility 
that, having gotten the country into a virtual state of war, hard-liners in the 
Kremlin would take advantage of the situation to infringe on other basic rights 
-- from closing down newspapers to harassing lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their argument, warned Sergei Parkhomenko in the newspaper Sevodnya, would be: 
"Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures." The Road to Chechnya

COUNSEL'S REACH IN ESPY INQUIRY RAISES OUTCRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haskell Blake, a pilot for Northwest Airlines, was stunned when two FBI agents 
showed up on his doorstep recently to question him about his activities when he 
was an employee of Tyson Foods more than 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents said they were assisting in an independent counsel's investigation 
of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who has been accused of improperly taking 
gratuities from Tyson Foods and other agriculture companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blake said the agent asked him a broad range of questions that seemed 
entirely unrelated to the Espy matter: 
</P>
<P>
 Was he aware of any drug use by Tyson family members? Did he ever offer bribes 
to officials in Mexico when he flew there on business for Tyson Foods? Did he 
ever take envelopes filled with cash to the Arkansas governor's office in 
Little Rock? 
</P>
<P>
 Blake is one of numerous Tyson employees, both past and present, who have been 
interviewed recently by investigators in connection with the Espy inquiry being 
conducted by independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz, a noted Los Angeles 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad scope of the questioning -- combined with a few provocative public 
statements by Smaltz regarding the investigation -- have precipitated an outcry 
from lawyers representing President Clinton, the Administration and Tyson 
Foods, all of whom question whether Smaltz has gone far beyond his original 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "These questions are simply outrageous, and they demonstrate that your 
investigation is totally out of control and unlawful," Tyson attorney Thomas C. 
Green said in a letter to Smaltz, referring to the Blake interview. ". . . 
Furthermore, inquiries such as these smack of a witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of his investigation, Smaltz has said that he intended to 
expand his probe, as necessary, to get to the bottom of all related 
allegations. But he declined to comment on the current criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is by no means unusual for a special prosecutor to be criticized 
for his conduct of an investigation. Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh 
was roundly condemned by critics of all political persuasions for the scope, 
length and cost of his inquiry into Ronald Reagan Administration misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is far from clear that Smaltz is ranging outside his legitimate bounds. 
The original court order on his appointment includes a catch-all provision 
authorizing him to look into any "other allegations or evidence of violation of 
any criminal law" developed during the Espy probe and "connected with or 
arising out of that investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smaltz, a Republican, has distinguished himself by drawing criticism much 
sooner than any prosecutor previously appointed to investigate a major 
political case. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was appointed by the U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 10, Smaltz 
predicted he would need only six months to investigate allegations that Espy 
illegally accepted sports tickets, transportation and entertainment from Tyson 
and other companies regulated by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, as he expanded his probe, Smaltz acknowledged that he might not 
be finished until sometime in 1996. He has hired 30 employees and now maintains 
two offices, one in Washington and the other near Tyson headquarters in 
Springdale, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, meanwhile, has resigned under pressure from the White House as 
agriculture secretary, effective Dec. 31. He is expected to be replaced shortly 
by former Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Smaltz has subpoenaed from the state of Arkansas the names 
of Tyson employees with workers' compensation cases pending against the company 
and has asked many of them about their knowledge of any illegal activities by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 One disgruntled ex-Tyson employee interviewed by Smaltz was Joe Henrickson, 
43. Dismissed last year as a pilot for the firm, he alleges that during the 
1980s he sometimes acted as a courier carrying envelopes filled with cash from 
Tyson to Gov. Clinton in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent effort to corroborate Henrickson's story, investigators called 
on two other former Tyson pilots: Blake, who now lives in Indianapolis, and 
Lonnie Grover of Little Rock. According to John A. Dowd, a Washington attorney 
who represents both Grover and Blake, they denied any knowledge of cash 
payments to Clinton, as alleged by Henrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz has also drawn criticism for several statements in support of the 
allegations made by Henrickson. "Based on the way the story unfolded," he told 
Time magazine, "it has a ring of truth to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In separate letters to Smaltz, both White House counsel Abner J. Mikva and 
David E. Kendall, the President's personal lawyer, noted that the rules of 
conduct for federal prosecutors forbid them from commenting publicly on 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "By commenting favorably and publicly on the credibility of a witness telling 
unsubstantiated tales, you smear individuals who, having no access to your 
information, cannot exonerate themselves," Kendall wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the Time story, Smaltz issued a statement Monday saying that he 
discussed the matter with the magazine only because it had obtained a 
confidential investigative document. He added: "It is far too early for any 
conclusions or inferences to be made as to our office's evaluation" of the 
evidence gathered so far.

HYPOALLERGENIC HOUSING PROJECT A DISAPPOINTMENT; HEALTH: ECOLOGY HOUSE WAS 
DESIGNED FOR THE CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE, BUT MANY TENANTS REPORT SYMPTOMS ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The idea was to build the nation's first apartment complex for the chemically 
sensitive. The Ecology House would be a showpiece, built with none of the 
glues, fibers and sealers of modern construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A special "sniff team" was employed to smell the raw building materials and 
detect chemicals that might be offensive. Tile floors, metal shelves, 
high-powered ventilators and water filtration systems were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after residents said to be suffering from "multiple chemical 
sensitivity" moved into the 11-unit complex this fall, the complaints started. 
At least half of them said their new homes made them sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one tenant sleeps on her bathroom floor to avoid odors in the rest of the 
apartment. Another sleeps on her patio despite temperatures in the 30s. A third 
breathes from an oxygen tank whenever she is home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a dream that turned into a nightmare," lamented resident Jan Heard, 
a onetime recreational therapist who says she is disabled by her chemical 
sensitivity. "I don't have any place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For the creators of Ecology House, the tenants' reactions are a great 
disappointment and point up an unusual conundrum: How can builders construct an 
urban living space for people who seem to be allergic to the modern world? 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the project are now re-examining construction materials -- 
especially unsealed plaster walls and baked enamel cabinets -- to see if there 
is a source of toxic odors that can be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment house was the product of years of effort by a nonprofit Marin 
County foundation seeking to help people diagnosed by their doctors as having 
multiple chemical sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the increasingly common complaint -- also known as "environmental 
illness" -- say their immune systems have been compromised, leaving them with 
debilitating headaches, dizziness, swollen joints, disorientation, memory loss 
and even temporary paralysis when exposed to certain chemicals, especially 
petroleum-based substances. Some estimate that upward of 40,000 Americans -- 
and perhaps many more -- suffer from the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the medical community is divided over whether the syndrome truly exists. 
Neither the American Medical Assn. nor the California Medical Assn. recognizes 
it as a disease. Some doctors say there is no scientific proof that exposure to 
small amounts of chemicals can cause such an illness and contend the condition 
is psychological, not physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, they (the symptoms) are either manifestations of a deep-seated 
depression or an inability to cope, or both," said Dr. Wallace Sampson, former 
chairman of a California Medical Assn. committee on health education. "I think 
it's sort of a contagious psychological thing. People read about it, and then 
they come down with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development 
recognizes the syndrome as an impairment under the Americans With Disabilities 
Act and contributed $1.2 million -- two-thirds of the total cost -- to 
construction of the Ecology House. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the money was raised by the nonprofit Ecology House Inc., a 
group of civic-minded volunteers, low-income housing activists and people with 
environmental illness who applied to HUD for the federal grant. The Ecology 
House board oversaw construction of the project and continues to manage the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Former San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, who now heads HUD's southwest regional 
office, said the development was approved as a pilot project by top HUD 
officials during the Bush Administration in 1991. Built under the Clinton 
Administration, construction cost taxpayers about $100,000 more than a typical 
low-income project of the same size, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is a federally funded apartment house for low-income disabled people, 
only those with a doctor's diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivity who earn 
less than $20,500 a year can qualify to live there. Even if the illness is 
psychological, Agnos noted, its victims still are disabled and are eligible for 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like other experiments, it may not work the first time, but that does not 
mean we shouldn't help these people," Agnos said. "If it does not work for 
them, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of people waiting in line to take 
their place." 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, Agnos said, the blue-and-white building near downtown San 
Rafael could easily be converted to serve people with more traditional 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that the first housing complex for people with environmental 
illness was built in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
 This wealthy, liberal bastion is the hub of a movement to curb the use of 
pesticides and aromatic chemicals such as perfumes, which are made largely with 
synthetic chemicals. In 1991, Marin became the first jurisdiction in the nation 
to create a fragrance-free zone when it banned perfume-wearers from taking 
certain seats at county park board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, environmental illness activists say they plan a new campaign using the 
Americans With Disabilities Act to challenge businesses that use chemical 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitors will inspect stores, theaters and other businesses to see if they 
have created "barriers" for chemically sensitive people, such as "fragrance 
emitting devices," pesticide residue, cloth containing fabric softener or 
employees wearing perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses believed to be in violation will be notified and then could face a 
civil lawsuit if they do not change their ways, said Julia Kendall, a San 
Rafael publicist who says perfume and other chemicals have made her ill since 
she was exposed to malathion in Los Angeles in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will change the way people use pesticides, cleaners and personal care 
products," she said. "As part of the Americans With Disabilities Act, it is my 
belief that the chemical barriers to our access can be removed without cost 
just by changing policies." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most visible effort to champion the cause of the chemically sensitive 
has been Ecology House, which initially was hailed as a model for other 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 people applied for the small one-bedroom apartments and tenants 
were selected by lottery. The winners thought they were the lucky ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Robertson, one of the first to move in, said she developed multiple 
chemical sensitivity when she was working on a construction project in 
Antarctica and drank water contaminated with jet fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she now suffers reactions to petrochemicals -- especially perfumes -- 
and must be careful where she goes in public. Like many who have been diagnosed 
with the syndrome, she has had difficulty working and has little money. 
Sometimes, she said, she has suffered from disorientation and a loss of brain 
function that she likens to Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after I was diagnosed with this I didn't accept it because it sounds so 
crazy," she said. "It is bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 She won the chance to move into Ecology House in November and said she soon 
began experiencing a resurgence of symptoms that had been in decline. She 
started sleeping outdoors and keeping her doors and windows open, and avoided 
being home as much as possible. Like other residents, she attributes the 
problem to the unsealed walls and paint on metal cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't spend much time here," she said. "Something is coming out of 
the walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenant Marta Sonnenblick, a registered nurse who said she became chemically 
sensitive after she was exposed to mercury in her dental fillings, is angry 
that the Ecology House board did not take greater care in building the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bungled it," said Sonnenblick, who spends her nights on a futon on the 
bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers who worked five years to make the Ecology House a reality are stung 
by the criticism. Board President Tom Wilson said they went to great lengths to 
build safe apartments, including creating a "sniff team" of volunteers with 
environmental illness who deliberately exposed themselves to various building 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major disappointment to us that we would put out all that effort and 
people would move in and get sick there," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But figuring out what to do may not be easy. Even if the builders pinpoint 
what is making tenants sick, any quick solution would mean introducing 
different chemicals that might cause even bigger problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Ecology House is offering to wash walls and remove painted metal hall 
closets that appear to be a source of aggravation. But the board is not 
promising it can make the building habitable for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Crecelius, the project's developer, said tenants were advised before 
moving in that the housing might not prove satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be people with multiple chemical sensitivity living here. It just 
may not be these people," she said.

RELIGION; GOSPEL ACCORDING TO GERMAN AUTHOR LINKS JESUS TO BUDDHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This weekend, Christians by the hundreds of millions the world over mark one 
of the most joyous events in the ecclesiastical year. But what became of the 
infant whose birth is celebrated at Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bible, of course, tells the story. But a German dissenter with a diploma 
in theology is offering his own in a controversial book now for sale in 
bookstores in India and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of Holger Kersten's work, amplified and republished this year after 
selling 1.5 million copies worldwide, says it all: "Jesus Lived in India." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, he proposes that the son of Joseph and Mary traveled to India 
when young, imbibed the Buddhist philosophy and world view at the feet of 
Buddhist monks, then returned to propagate his findings among his people in 
Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshaling his argument on such materials as the now-discredited shroud of 
Turin, etymology, the writings of a 19th-Century Russian adventurer and sermons 
preached by Jesus as he tramped through the Holy Land, Kersten asserts that 
Christ did not die on the cross but survived and returned to India. 
</P>
<P>
 In the remote Himalayan land of Kashmir, Jesus (known then as Issa) lived to a 
ripe old age as a Buddhist monk, according to Kersten. His tomb, he says, 
appears to be situated in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus was a Buddhist," Kersten, 43, said Wednesday in a telephone interview 
from his home in Freiburg, Germany. "I think it's wonderful to show how these 
great religions are connected and what they have in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his work offers a theory that many will find dubious at best, the book 
is a reminder of the extraordinary importance India has exerted through the 
centuries on the human spirit. Ritual baptism and monastic asceticism are among 
its exports. According to Kersten, even Jesus' parable of the widow's mite, 
cited in the Gospel according to St. Mark, seems to be a reworking of an older 
Buddhist story. 
</P>
<P>
 Another work of Kersten's, to be published in English next March, inventories 
the parallels between the teachings of Jesus and the man known as Buddha, 
Siddhartha Gautama, the Indian prince and ascetic who founded Buddhism. Kersten 
contends that Jesus' original message was appropriated by St. Paul the Apostle, 
who introduced new elements, including misogyny and the concept that Christ's 
death absolved others of their sins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a follower of Jesus but not a Christian in its original meaning," said 
Kersten, who used to teach the precepts of Christianity in state adult 
vocational school until his doubts sent him on a search that ended in India. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream Christians could rightly note that Kersten's ideas are heresy. In 
its 264 pages, the book, published in the United States by Element Inc. of 
Rockport, Mass., denies the central tenet of Christianity: that the Son of God 
died to atone for humanity's sins. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many kinds of books from this 'New Age' stream that the church 
doesn't take any notice of them anymore," Brother Jeffrey Gros, associate 
director of ecumenical and religious affairs at the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops in Washington, replied when asked his reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, when it takes notice, sometimes it gets embarrassed," Gros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a case for Christian-Buddhist syncretism, as Kersten does, is clearly 
out of favor in the Vatican. In his recent book "Crossing the Threshold of 
Hope," Pope John Paul II has criticized Buddhism sufficiently so that, in Sri 
Lanka, miffed Buddhist prelates have threatened to boycott a planned 
inter-religious meeting when the pontiff visits next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kersten, whose work has been reviewed in publications here, admits that some 
of his assertions "may seem audacious . . . even improbable." He lines up a 
range of materials -- including the Turin shroud, which the church says has 
been proved a forgery through carbon dating, but which Kersten claimed was 
authentic in a previous book he co-authored, "The Jesus Conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that some of his conclusions or conjectures seem far-fetched 
-- for instance, that the word Kashmir may be a deformation of kosher.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one of the hundreds of pieces of evidence, not a proof," he 
says. "It's all like a mosaic that fits together." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Christmas? Kersten insists that research shows it is the Christian 
reworking of the annual celebrations that used to mark the Dec. 25 birth of the 
ancient Persian sun deity, Mithras. He plans to celebrate it anyway: "I go to 
my parents' because they like it," he says.

ENVIRONMENT; GREENPEACE RETHINKS ITS MILITANT METHODS; THE ACTIVIST GROUP FACES 
FALLING MEMBERSHIP, DWINDLING DONATIONS AND THE ADOPTION OF ITS CAUSE BY 
GOVERNMENTS IT ONCE CHALLENGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The image of the environmental group Greenpeace once leaned to the romantic: 
idealistic campaigners who took to tiny rubber boats to challenge what they 
considered to be leviathan despoilers of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members demonstrated against the killing of whales and seals, nuclear 
testing, chemical waste and drift-net fishing to protect the planet and 
creatures against pollution and slaughter by governments, multinational 
corporations and private entrepreneurs, they said. Greenpeace's ship, Rainbow 
Warrior, was sunk by French agents while the vessel was protesting nuclear 
testing in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was David against Goliath," commented a former official. "It was all very 
daring, and it caught the public imagination. The media loved Greenpeace." 
</P>
<P>
 But no longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Greenpeace is a sprawling organization that is encountering rough seas 
itself -- a victim, as much as anything, of its own success. It is struggling 
to chart a new course now that many have accepted its premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Members and officials are debating Greenpeace's role at a time when 
environmental issues have been adopted -- and some say co-opted -- by major 
political parties in Western countries; even the United States boasts an 
"environment-friendly" vice president in Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Greenpeace itself, its membership and donations are down from a 
worldwide high of 4.8 million supporters in 1990 and $180 million in donations 
in 1991; last year, the group counted 3.5 million supporters, and it has a 
$145-million budget today. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace faces cuts of about 10% of its 1,100-member staff while it 
re-examines its strategy and waits for its board to select a new executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute the dip in contributions to the recession and to "compassion 
fatigue," as overwhelmed donors reconsider the effectiveness of all of their 
giving to activist and charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Greenpeace, ultimately, "the question is whether to remain a militant 
campaigning organization, which the media seem to like," says Blair Palese, an 
official based in the cluttered Central London office, "or to work more closely 
with government and industry to find solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 While it may seem elemental to some, Greenpeace historically had not been 
involved in seeking solutions to environmental problems. Instead, its members 
preferred to take direct, though nonviolent, action to prevent what members saw 
as the gravest green damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace, founded in Canada in 1971, staged some of its earliest campaigns 
against American nuclear testing on the Alaskan island of Amchitka; 12 original 
members sailed a small boat into the atomic testing area to draw attention to 
environmental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenpeace International was formed in 1979, uniting groups in the United 
States, Canada and Europe. The international organization coordinates 
activities of national groups and is funded by contributions from supporters in 
more than 150 countries. Greenpeace has offices in 30 nations with 
administrative headquarters in Amsterdam and media operations in London. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes partial credit for the push that led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio 
de Janeiro. The group now calls for an end to whaling and over-fishing. It 
seeks the phased elimination of ozone-depleting chemicals; a ban on the 
exploitation of Antarctica; a halt to use of nuclear power; responsible 
management of nuclear and toxic wastes, and the promotion of clean, renewable 
energy, such as solar power. 
</P>
<P>
 While stalwart activists say Greenpeace must continue its confrontational 
tactics, others in the group say it must engage in other activities too, such 
as lobbying and drafting legislation. It also must press solutions to 
environmental problems, such as the "green fridge" -- an environment-friendly 
refrigerator that does not use an ozone-depleting coolant; Greenpeace worked on 
a model of the appliance with German scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while the tactical debate continues, Greenpeace continues to engage in 
confrontational activities, officials say. Recently, some of its members 
battled whalers in Norway, resulting in the Greenpeacers' detention and 
deportation. Also Greenpeacers locked horns with drift-net fishermen in the Bay 
of Biscay and were fired on by French navy vessels.

CLINTON JOINS MALL CROWD FOR GIFT SHOPPING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton joined the ranks of last-minute Christmas shoppers Friday 
with a two-hour buying spree that included clothing and jewelry purchases made 
with a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by two young aides and a small army of Secret Service bodyguards, 
Clinton plunged into a lunchtime shopping crowd at a mall in Washington's 
fashionable Georgetown neighborhood and headed straight to a music store. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a credit card, he purchased some videos there. Then it was on to a 
historic memorabilia store, men's and women's clothing stores, a jewelry store, 
a toy store, a toiletries store and finally a curio shop. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton kept his gift list to himself, it looked as if his wife, 
Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, will find some nice presents under the 
Christmas tree Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his purchases was a woven woman's vest that he found in a store 
specializing in accessories with a Latin American flavor. Reporters trailing 
after him also saw him buy a book and some jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 During Clinton's whirlwind gift-buying excursion, fellow shoppers cheered and 
shouted: "Merry Christmas, Bill!" and got presidential smiles and waves in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President was shopping in Georgetown, Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Chelsea were hunting for gifts across the Potomac River in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokeswoman said they spent three hours canvassing stores in 
Alexandria's historic Old Town district, and completed their Christmas 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons plan to spend Christmas at the White House with family members.

COAST GUARD BARS QE2 CRUISE, CITES SAFETY PROBLEMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard has barred the luxury liner Queen Elizabeth 2 from 
leaving New York for a Caribbean cruise after inspectors found numerous fire 
and safety violations aboard the ship, a Coast Guard spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have to stay in port until all violations are corrected," said 
Petty Officer Charles Smith, a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry passengers who arrived Thursday evening in New York aboard the vessel, 
said they had a nightmarish transatlantic voyage from Britain. They said 
toilets flooded, running water turned brown and debris spilled into the 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard inspectors boarded the liner Thursday evening near Ambrose 
Lighthouse in New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have terminated their voyage until the corrections are made," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The QE2 was supposed to sail again at midnight Thursday on a 15-day Christmas 
Caribbean cruise with 1,000 passengers to St. Martin, St. Lucia, Barbados and 
Aruba but remains docked at New York's Pier 90 on the Hudson River.

3 ARRESTED IN SEPARATE WHITE HOUSE INCIDENTS; CRIME: LATEST OCCURRENCES WERE 
NONVIOLENT. OFFICIALS SAY RISK OF 'COPYCAT SYNDROME' MAY BE DEVELOPING.

<P>
 A bizarre series of attacks and incidents around the White House continued 
Friday when two men were arrested before dawn, one carrying a semiautomatic 
handgun and another claiming he had a plutonium bomb in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man was arrested Wednesday night after he slipped onto the White House 
grounds when a gate was opened briefly, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service and U.S. Park Police officers said the three incidents were 
unrelated and none posed a threat to President Clinton. But coming on the heels 
of a plane crash and three shootings around the White House in recent months, 
officials acknowledged the risk of a "copycat syndrome" developing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest series of incidents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shortly before 3 a.m. Friday, a man claiming to have a bomb in his car 
pulled over near the White House fence, jumped out of the car and was chased 
down by Park Police and Secret Service officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had a bomb made out of plutonium," said Park Police Maj. Robert 
Hines. Hines said the car contained no explosive device of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 He was identified as Joseph Maggio, 36, of Annapolis, Md., and was committed 
to a hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 * At about 2 a.m. Friday, a man carrying a gun was arrested on the Ellipse. 
</P>
<P>
 He was identified as 27-year-old Franklin Ruff, who said he was moving to 
Washington from Las Vegas. He said he had a Las Vegas permit for the loaded 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, said Park Police Lt. Phil Cholak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff was charged with carrying an unregistered firearm and unregistered 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Wednesday night, a man identified as Richard Green, 44, of Washington, 
was arrested for unlawful entry to the White House grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service spokesman Curtis Eldridge said Green entered the grounds when 
the southwest gate was opened briefly to let a vehicle leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he just kind of wandered in. He didn't really express any interest in 
anybody in particular," Eldridge said.

PILOT MAY BE FREED FOR CHRISTMAS; NORTH KOREA: RELEASE OF SURVIVING AIRMAN SAID 
TO BE PLANNED. U.S. WARNS REPORT IS UNCONFIRMED.

<P>
 As the tense impasse continued with North Korea over the return of captured 
helicopter pilot Bobby Hall, U.S. officials said Friday that they expect Hall 
to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang said Hall would be released on Christmas Day, Korea time, the Yonhap 
News Agency reported. Korea is 14 hours ahead of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior Pentagon official said, "We have no confirmation of that, and we 
believe it to be wrong at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations were to continue today in Panmunjom, which straddles the border 
between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton met with Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who returned Friday 
from North Korea, and top national security aides to review negotiations with 
Pyongyang and consider the next steps if Chief Warrant Officer Hall is not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Richardson said he hopes that Hall will be released "very soon" but 
cautioned that Pyongyang appears to be split on how to resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made no public comment after the meeting for fear of upsetting the 
delicate negotiations over Hall's release. 
</P>
<P>
 But one State Department official said that "signs" from North Korea indicate 
a Christmas release. The official declined to elaborate on his reasons for 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon strayed into North Korean 
territory last Saturday while flying an unarmed reconnaissance helicopter on a 
training mission. It is now believed that the North Koreans shot down the 
chopper after it crossed the demilitarized zone that separates the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilemon died in the incident; his body was released to Richardson on Thursday 
and returned to the United States on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson described his negotiations with North Korean officials as "very 
heated and very testy," adding that the North Koreans bridled at the pressure 
he put on them. At one point, he said, he stopped the talks for half a day and 
went into Pyongyang to sightsee. 
</P>
<P>
 At another juncture, the congressman said, North Korean officials ordered him 
to leave the country, but he refused until he was assured he could take 
Hilemon's remains with him and that Hall would be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
 After agreeing to release Hilemon's body, the North Koreans ejected Richardson 
without committing to returning Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 During their Oval Office meeting Friday afternoon, Richardson said Clinton 
"was very concerned about Bobby Hall. He said: 'Jesus, I just wish we could 
have him by Christmas. It's so important to the American people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said he told the President that he had been assured that Hall would 
be freed "very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John 
M. Shalikashvili, Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Deputy National 
Security Adviser Samuel Berger also attended the White House meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 No senior Administration official would comment on the matter on the record. 
One official, insisting he not be named, said: "It doesn't serve the primary 
interest of getting (Hall) out to say anything right now. We're just being very 
cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official suggested that a power struggle between the North Korean 
military and political leadership may be the cause of the delay and that U.S. 
pressure could exacerbate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at the North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York told 
the Associated Press on Friday that Hall was "still under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the helicopter 
"intentionally infiltrated the northern part of the Korean peninsula. Since the 
helicopter ignored warning signals . . . the People's Army took self-defense 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson went to the White House directly from the airport after returning 
from Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been drawn into the negotiations while he was in the country discussing 
an agreement under which North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear program in 
exchange for Western aid and increased diplomatic contacts with the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson was not allowed to see Hall, 28, who was being held at a military 
base near the crash site. But he was allowed to send a message to the airman 
telling him that the United States was working to obtain his release and a 
message from his wife, Donna Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North Koreans told me his health was good, that he had not been wounded 
in the crash," Richardson said. "I accept that at face value."

U.N. WILL PAY $94,000 TO SETTLE COMPLEX SEX HARASSMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations said Friday that it has settled one of its most protracted 
sexual harassment cases, awarding American Catherine Claxton $94,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she will be reimbursed $110,300 for legal fees and $6,500 for 
costs in the case she brought against Luis Maria Gomez, an Argentine official 
who was second in command in the U.N. Development Program before he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the deal worked out with Claxton means she receives the money for 
compensation resulting from the "prolonged and complex nature of the 
proceedings that led to the resolution of her case," a U.N. announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also provides that Claxton, an office worker, can appeal a 
decision concerning her job classification at the United Nations without 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. sources said the settlement does not cover her suit in New York state 
court against Gomez personally, where she and her lawyers seek $2 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Claxton, in still-secret papers, charged three years ago that, in 1988, Gomez 
shut the door to his office, grabbed and kissed her, and in another incident in 
a routine meeting, made sexual remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez denied the entire episode, and his lawyers at one point demanded that 
the case be reopened, contending that the U.N. standards for sexual harassment 
were made up after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Claxton case, because of the wide publicity it engendered, pointed up the 
lack of procedures and rules in dealing with sexual harassment in the vast U.N. 
structure with employees from all cultures in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's announcement, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he has 
assembled a task force to recommend improvements to current policies and 
procedures for handling future allegations of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys who participated in the Claxton case, including noted trial lawyer 
Alan Dershowitz, who defended Gomez, will be invited to present their views.

IRELAND FREES NINE IRA MEMBERS, CITING SUPPORT FOR PEACE PROCESS; EUROPE: 
PROTESTANT UNIONISTS ACCUSE DUBLIN OF BOWING TO TERRORISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irish government, declaring that it wishes to maintain the peace process 
in Northern Ireland, released nine Irish Republican Army members from its 
prisons Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Nora Owen, a member of the new coalition government, also 
announced a seven-day holiday parole for 30 more IRA members in Ireland's 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the government, which took office last week, is "anxious to 
consolidate the Northern Ireland peace process and move it forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The news provoked anger among Northern Ireland Protestants loyal to British 
rule. They criticized Dublin for knuckling under to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 David Trimble, a loyalist member of Parliament from Northern Ireland, 
declared: "This is political interference in the legal system to achieve 
short-term political gain. It is something that happens in a banana republic, 
not in a civilized society." 
</P>
<P>
 In London, a spokesman at the prime minister's office said of the release: 
"It's a matter for the Irish government." 
</P>
<P>
 But one Conservative MP, Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Northern Ireland 
committee, declared: "Dublin has been gravely mistaken in going ahead with 
these early releases. It is handing out the wrong signals, (which) could well 
threaten the process of the peace movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The move was welcomed by Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, whose vice 
president, Pat Doherty, commented: "We are very happy that these prisoners and 
others being granted parole will be spending Christmas with their families." 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoner releases were originally due to begin last month in response to 
the republican and unionist cease-fires. The move was delayed while Irish 
Justice Department officials decided that a post office robbery and a bombing 
last week were not the official work of the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those freed Friday were Aaron O'Connell, 35, and Eamon Nolan, 41, who 
have spent 14 years in jail for the murder of a civil servant during a bank 
robbery. One of the prisoners allowed parole was Thomas McMahon, serving a life 
sentence for the 1979 killing of Britain's Lord Mountbatten and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, maintained that there 
will be no early release for terrorist prisoners in Northern Ireland. "I can 
guarantee that those who have been sentenced by the courts will serve their 
sentences according to the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both IRA and unionist paramilitaries claim that there are political prisoners 
in jail in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayhew said Friday, "There are no political prisoners anywhere in this 
country. Anyone who is in prison here in Northern Ireland is in prison because 
they have been convicted of criminal offenses by the independent courts."

GROZNY BOMBS KILL AT LEAST 80, LEGISLATOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian forces pounded the capital of breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing at 
least 80 people by one unofficial count as Moscow's Parliament urged President 
Boris N. Yeltsin and his foes to halt the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators in Russia's lower house of Parliament, the Duma, appealed for an 
urgent cease-fire after jets bombed Grozny hourly through the night, damaging 
buildings and killing more civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma voted 228-38, with three abstentions, to back a call for a moratorium 
on military actions and to hold peace talks, but efforts to call a 
no-confidence motion against Yeltsin failed. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate response from any side, and hopes of ending the 
fighting seemed unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, which sent troops to Chechnya on Dec. 11 to halt the region's 
3-year-old drive for independence, has stiffened its military campaign in the 
last two days by intensifying air strikes on Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombardment killed at least 20 people Thursday, and witnesses said dozens 
more were believed to have died Friday. Many buildings were in ruins or on 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Valery Borshchev, a liberal legislator in Grozny, was quoted by the Russian 
news agency RIA as saying at least 80 people had been killed and 56 wounded 
Friday. He did not give a source for his information. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials in Moscow said 44 Russian soldiers had died. 
</P>
<P>
 International reaction has been generally muted. But the U.S. State Department 
on Friday expressed concern for the fate of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling attention to a complaint by Sergei Kovalev, head of the Russian 
president's Commission on Human Rights, State Department spokesman David 
Johnson said: "We will be following this up with the Russian government in 
order to evaluate the facts."

COLLEAGUES PAY TRIBUTE AT RUSK SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Rusk, the secretary of state who helped lead America deeper into the 
Vietnam War, was buried Friday to a chorus of praise from colleagues for his 
willingness to shoulder blame for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk died Tuesday of heart failure at age 85.He was buried in this college 
town, where he taught international law after serving under Presidents John F. 
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn and Gov. Zell Miller were among several Georgia politicians who 
packed the First Presbyterian Church to honor their friend and colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the service, Nunn said Rusk "wasn't looking for credit and he always 
shouldered the blame" in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusk's body was not at the service, at his request. 
</P>
<P>
 After the funeral, mourners went to Oconee Hill Cemetery for the burial on a 
muddy slope in a steady drizzle.

N.Y. FIREBOMB SUSPECT SAYS HE'S A VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Handcuffed to his hospital bed, the man accused as the subway "Mad Bomber" 
said Friday that he's a victim too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it," Edward Leary was quoted as saying." . . . I'm not a 'Mad 
Bomber.' How can they say that? They said I did that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leary said through his lawyer that he was a hapless passenger on the Manhattan 
subway train when a firebomb exploded Wednesday and injured 45 people. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Stephen Murphy, added: "He says he's a victim and is being made 
a victim again." 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, 49, is at New York Hospital-Cornell Burn Center, medicated with 
morphine because of pain caused by the burns he suffered in the explosion. 
Forty percent of his body is covered with third-degree burns, including his 
nose, chin, lips and both legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary is charged with 45 counts of first-degree assault. Investigators were 
still taking statements from witnesses and victims on Friday and poring over 
items seized from Leary's home. They are preparing to take the case before a 
Manhattan grand jury by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said the words "Mad Bomber" were scrawled on 
handwritten notes seized from Leary's home in Scotch Plains, N.J., and said 
police found sketches and rambling messages indicating that Leary planned to 
extort money from the Transit Authority by carrying out a series of subway 
bombings.

LIBERAL WITHDRAWS NAME FOR WHITE HOUSE BUDGET POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Greenstein, the director of a liberal Washington think tank, withdrew 
as a candidate for the deputy White House budget director's job on Friday, 
becoming the latest Democratic casualty of the Republicans' November landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein, the longtime director of the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities, was offered the post as chief deputy to Budget Director Alice 
Rivlin before the November election. On Friday he said he decided to back out 
of the job as a result of the Republican takeover of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in Washington as a strong, independent advocate for increased spending 
on anti-poverty programs, he said he believed he could work more effectively 
outside the Clinton Administration to protect those programs from Republican 
budget-cutters in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein, who administered the food stamp program in the Agriculture 
Department during the Jimmy Carter Administration, has built a reputation in 
Washington for good research on budget issues developed by his think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's research is often influential in helping to determine the outcome 
of legislative battles, and Greenstein said he was reluctant to give up his 
independent voice at a time when the GOP plans to reduce welfare and other 
poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Greenstein conceded that he would have faced a 
difficult and protracted battle to win confirmation from the Republican Senate 
because of his liberal views. He is clearly out of step with both the new 
Congress -- and the new direction of the Administration itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even moderate Democrats blanched when news of Greenstein's appointment first 
surfaced in the fall, complaining that it sent the wrong signal at a time when 
the Administration needed to move toward the political center. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein insisted that his decision to withdraw was not the result of any 
policy conflicts with the Administration. But he has long opposed tax cuts for 
the affluent and the middle class, arguing that they are inequitable and soak 
up resources that could be devoted to helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I would have been confirmed, but I think it could have taken several 
months, and those months will be the most critical time for determining the 
fate of the programs that I care most about in Congress," said Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Republican lawmakers are beginning to temper their earlier demands 
for the immediate removal of Robert Reischauer as director of the Congressional 
Budget Office, as they are still embarked on a search for an appropriate 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reischauer, characterized by Republicans as a partisan Democrat, opposes the 
GOP's supply-side budget theories. Incoming House Majority Leader Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.) had said he planned to replace Reischauer in January with a 
supply-side proponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, Armey began to back away from his vow to fire Reischauer 
immediately. Apparently, Armey's new statements reflect growing Republican 
concern that the party's economic policies will not be taken seriously if 
Republicans install an ideological conservative at CBO who lacks broad 
credibility. Several top Republican candidates have also turned down the post, 
leaving the new congressional leadership shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Reischauer is not likely to remain at the CBO for more than a brief 
transition period. He is said to be in contention for the post as president of 
the Brookings Institution in Washington.

 A sailor fighting President Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy for gays 
in the military won a federal court order blocking the Navy from discharging 
him. U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle granted Petty Officer 2nd 
Class Mark Philips a preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing Feb. 22. A 
Navy board of inquiry had recommended that Philips, a machinist's mate on a 
nuclear submarine, be discharged. Philips' lawyers had argued that the rule 
violates First Amendment guarantees of free speech, Fifth Amendment guarantees 
of equal protection and Philips' right to privacy.

HER CIA SEX BIAS SUIT SETTLED FOR $410,000, AGENT SAYS SHE HOPES AGENCY CAN 
CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reaching final agreement with the CIA over a $410,000 settlement in a sex 
discrimination suit, a veteran female agent expressed hope Friday that the 
agency would change its leadership and culture to remove the "fear of reprisal 
and retribution" that plagued her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer said she remains concerned that the CIA fails to investigate male 
employees accused of wife beating and to discipline those found to have done 
so. The woman had alleged she was punished for disciplining subordinates, 
including one she said had admitted beating his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the 25-year veteran, known in court papers only as "Jane 
Doe Thompson," but identified by sources as Janine M. Brookner, retired from 
the agency Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A CIA source estimated she would receive between $40,000 and $45,000 a year in 
retirement income in addition to the proceeds from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Harrington, the CIA's director of public affairs, said the settlement 
"does not concede any of the assertions Ms. Thompson has made against the 
agency or its individual officers." He dismissed the allegations of wife abuse 
and said "they are made without regard to the damage caused individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 An agency source said the financial settlement -- $410,000 plus attorney's 
fees -- amounted to only a fraction of the amount demanded and included a 
$25,000 incentive buyout available to all employees of similar tenure under a 
downsizing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the CIA declined to discuss Brookner's allegations, including her 
central charge that she was punished for disciplining subordinates at the CIA's 
Jamaica station, where she was assigned as station chief in 1989 to clean up a 
problem-racked outpost. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner, 53, alleged that the subordinates, including a deputy accused of 
beating his wife, retaliated with charges of their own against her. Those 
charges led to an investigation of her by the agency's inspector general and a 
letter of reprimand. As part of the settlement, the Jan. 28, 1993, letter of 
reprimand is to be removed from Brookner's personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
 The subordinates charged she was a drunk and a sexpot. They also accused her 
of cheating on her overtime slips and of misusing a CIA helicopter assigned to 
Jamaica for drug operations. Brookner eventually found herself discredited by 
the agency and assigned to make-work projects in a windowless cubicle at CIA 
headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 When the agency's Justice Department lawyers and Brookner's attorney, Victoria 
Toensing, agreed in principle to settle the case Dec. 7, CIA Director R. James 
Woolsey said he wanted to bring the matter to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Toensing, a Washington partner in the Los Angeles law firm of Manatt, Phelps & 
Phillips, noted that the settlement followed an October refusal by a federal 
judge in Virginia to dismiss individual CIA employees as defendants in the 
suit. The refusal meant the employees would be liable personally for any 
damages she won if the case had gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement has no direct effect on separate negotiations by the CIA to 
head off a class-action lawsuit by nearly one-third of the agency's female case 
officers in its directorate of operations, or clandestine division, who contend 
that the agency has discriminated against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on that matter are progressing, CIA spokesman Harrington said, 
adding that the agency hoped it would be resolved in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to discuss specifics of Brookner's allegations, Harrington 
cited improvements in the CIA's record for promoting women. 
</P>
<P>
 Representation of women in the senior intelligence ranks has risen from 7.5% 
in 1990 to 11.8%, he said. In the four main directorates -- operations, 
intelligence, administration and science and technology -- only one woman 
occupies the eight senior management positions. Women hold a third of the 
so-called building block positions in two of the directorates, a CIA official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Operations directorate, where Brookner ran into difficulties, a woman 
was recently named to head a regional division for the first time, Harrington 
said.

FDA APPROVES SALIVA TEST FOR DETECTING AIDS VIRUS; HEALTH: RULING ALLOWS OPTION 
BESIDES USING BLOOD. AGENCY ALSO ALLOWS MARKETING OF SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS FOR 
3 MORE YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration Friday approved the first AIDS test that uses 
saliva instead of blood to determine whether a person has been infected by the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency warned that the saliva test is not as accurate as the current 
tests that use blood, and recommended blood tests to confirm the presence of 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval was one of two major actions by the agency Friday, the other 
being an announcement that saline breast implants will be allowed to remain on 
the market for at least another three years while safety studies are being 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the saliva test is expected to be welcomed by much of the AIDS 
community because it provides an option that may encourage more individuals to 
be tested, particularly those who are reluctant or fearful of having blood 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that makes it easier to get tested and speeds diagnosis is a good 
thing," said Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American Foundation for 
AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The test, which will be sold under the brand name of OraSure, is manufactured 
by Epitope Inc., of Beaverton, Ore. Company officials said they expect the test 
to be available within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed to be the first such test approved by the FDA that uses oral 
specimens in disease detection. Like the blood test, it detects antibodies to 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The company predicted the technology would be applied in the future to test 
for additional diseases, such as measles and hepatitis, and to aid in the 
monitoring or detection of certain therapeutic drugs and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important day in the fight against AIDS," said Adolph J. Ferro, 
president and chief executive officer of Epitope. "The availability of OraSure 
will broaden access to testing for HIV infection. . . . We are determined to 
bring the product to the broadest possible market as rapidly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The test must be administered by physicians, and is not available for home 
use, said the FDA, which is still deliberating whether to approve a home 
collection blood AIDS test kit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ferro said the company eventually hopes to apply for FDA approval to 
market the test over-the-counter for home use collection of specimens, should 
the concept of home collection be sanctioned by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In this scenario, the test results are not actually obtained in the home. An 
individual would collect a sample at home, whether blood or saliva, but it 
would still be sent to a laboratory for analysis. Advocates of home collection 
say it would help those who wish to avoid having to visit a physician or a 
clinic in person. 
</P>
<P>
 The OraSure device consists of an absorbent pad mounted on a lollipop-style 
plastic stick. The pad, which is treated with a proprietary salt solution to 
enhance collection of antibodies in the oral cavity, is placed between the 
lower cheek and gum for two minutes. The fluid specimen is then placed in a 
sealed vial that contains a preservative solution and sent to a lab for 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a non-invasive form of testing," Ferro said. "There is no danger of a 
needle-stick accident. It is relatively easy to obtain a specimen. The services 
of a trained phlebotomist are not required. As a result, we believe OraSure 
will be less costly to use." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the device will be about $2 to $4 a unit, excluding the laboratory 
analysis, Ferro said. He estimated that lab costs will add an additional $3 to 
$15 a test. The standard blood tests that detect HIV antibodies cost about $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA cautioned that the saliva test may miss one or two infected 
individuals per 100 infected people tested, and may also result in false 
positives at the same rate in the uninfected. For this reason, the agency 
recommended that those who test positive by saliva undergo confirmatory blood 
tests to establish true infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that saline breast implants will remain on the market keeps 
an important option open for women seeking cosmetic augmentation or breast 
reconstruction. In 1992, after a bitter and emotional debate, the agency 
removed silicone gel breast implants from the general market after safety 
questions arose. 
</P>
<P>
 The silicone devices are available now only to women undergoing 
reconstruction, after mastectomy, for example, and to a small number of women 
for cosmetic purposes as part of ongoing clinical studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The saline devices, which are filled with saltwater, are believed to have a 
much lower degree of risk associated with their use. Like the silicone 
implants, they were on the market before 1976, when Congress gave the FDA 
regulatory authority over medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, manufacturers were not required to meet current safety 
standards. However, the law provided that manufacturers of devices already on 
the market could later be required to prove they are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the FDA told the manufacturers of saline implants -- McGhan Medical 
Inc. and Mentor Corp., both of Santa Barbara -- that they would be required to 
conduct safety studies of their products, and submit the data for review. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies are slated to be completed by 1998. In the meantime, the FDA said 
it would monitor the ongoing studies "and will make public any significant new 
health information" they provide, if necessary. More on AIDS

 Women are getting fewer abortions and mostly seeking them in the first 
trimester of their pregnancies, the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said.The number of legal abortions nationwide was 1,359,145 in 1992, 
a 2.1% drop from 1991 and the lowest level in 15 years, the CDC said. There 
were about three times as many live births as legal, induced abortions in 1992. 
"This indicates a larger proportion of pregnancies ending in a live birth," a 
CDC spokeswoman said.

 A majority of Americans believe Congress should not hold hearings on the 
Whitewater affair, according to a public opinion poll by CNN/USA Today Gallup. 
The poll found that 56% of respondents opposed hearings, while only 41% favored 
them. Despite this, a plurality of respondents believed that President Clinton 
probably behaved unethically, but not illegally, in the affair.

SCIENCE, MYTH COMBINE TO RAISE FEARS OF VOLCANO DISASTER; MEXICO: MILLIONS LIVE 
IN ASH PATH OF RUMBLING POPOCATEPETL. FIRST RECORDED ERUPTION, IN 1519, KILLED 
CONQUISTADORS WHO TRIED TO CHALLENGE AZTEC BELIEF. 
</P>

<P>
 To the ancient Aztecs, Popocatepetl was the dwelling place for the souls of 
evil rulers, a towering caldron of smoke and fire, the living symbol of hell on 
Earth whose fury seemed to presage the great disasters of their era. 
</P>
<P>
 To U.S. scientists, the snow-peaked mountain 39 miles southeast of Mexico City 
has been an extraordinary living laboratory, an active volcano within reach of 
their research centers and one that many believe could erupt at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Mexican civil defense authorities struggling Friday to evacuate 
tens of thousands of people from villages in its shadows, the 17,887-foot 
volcano has become a potential nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of watching "Popo," as the volcano is known, belch black ash 
and recording seismic rumblings that worry the best volcanologists of Mexico 
and the United States, authorities were feverishly trying to determine how to 
limit the disaster if it blows. 
</P>
<P>
 The dimensions of the dilemma are in the numbers: More than 20 million people 
live within a 62-mile radius of Popo's cone, many in flimsy houses in the ash 
path of the mountain that on a clear day dominates the horizon in one of the 
most populous cities on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 At greatest risk are the millions of Mexicans whose homes are not likely to 
withstand the weight of thousands of tons of ash that could rain on the region 
if Popo does have a major eruption. Expected mudflows from the ice lake in 
Popo's cone would wreak even more havoc in an area so densely populated. A 
smaller number of villagers live at greater risk, directly under the cone. They 
live in 18 villages and towns now being evacuated to 70 makeshift shelters and 
disaster relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil defense officials describe the evacuation as a precaution. But by midday 
Friday, as ash continued to spew from a cone no longer visible through Popo's 
grayish-black cloud, officials had managed to relocate more than half of the 
75,000 villagers in the highest-risk zone. About 30,000, officials said, 
refused to leave, not wanting to risk losing their few possessions to looters. 
But most left. And for many, the reasons were centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Popo speaks," said one Indian woman making her way to a shelter with a 
small bundle of clothes, "we must obey." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not science but powerful myths that have struck fear in many residents. 
With an Indian rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas resurfacing with a 
vengeance this week, followed by economic turmoil when the government allowed 
the peso to tumble in value, many see Popo's rumblings as a modern sign of the 
mountain's ability to augur disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about what it could mean for the future," said Luis Soriano 
Escobar, a 60-year-old repairman in the town of Amecameca near Popo. For most 
of his life he has been rescuing climbers and tourists near its peak -- feats 
that have earned him the local Indian nickname Tlaxquiche, or Mountain Animal. 
"There's the war in Chiapas. There's inflation. There could really be something 
behind all of this. It could be a very bad sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists think so too. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Mexican volcano experts -- from Mexico City to Buffalo to Arizona to 
Washington, D.C. -- have been studying Popo intensively since, as one put it, 
"Popo lit up a year ago" with heavy emissions of gases and a number of small 
earthquakes inside the volcano. And even though volcanologists are the first to 
admit that theirs is an inexact science, there is a near-unanimity now that the 
mountain has entered a dangerous phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain's full explosive power has yet to be seen by modern man. Despite 
16 eruptions recorded since the Spaniards first landed here in 1519, Popo is 
not believed to have delivered a really big blast for about 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Can it happen now? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that, despite the fact that it's been tame this century, 
(Mexican authorities) must respect the volcano's warning," said Stanley N. 
Williams, a volcanologist at Arizona State University who visited the mountain 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Buffalo experts declared Friday that Popo's current activity 
resembles that of Mt. St. Helens shortly before its devastating 1980 eruption 
in Washington state. "The chamber is loaded," said Michael Sheridan, who chairs 
the university's geology department. 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysicist Randy White was alarmed by a "harmonic tremor" inside Popo that 
lasted more than 22 hours this week. The tremor accompanied the explosion of 
ash; that usually signals the movement of magma, or molten rock, which White 
said can presage a serious eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremor is no longer increasing, said White, who works for the U.S. 
Geological Survey in Menlo Park. "But still, such a lengthy harmonic tremor is 
cause for fair concern that something else will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 White and several Mexican scientists also expressed a second, deeper concern. 
Mexican government inaction on a year-old request to install special seismic 
equipment at Popo, they said, has left them without key information that would 
more accurately predict when -- or if -- Popo may erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not getting good data," White said, stressing that there are just two 
seismic monitoring stations near the mountain. The request for a more 
sophisticated monitoring network by one of Mexico's top volcanologists, 
Servando de la Cruz Reyna, is still pending before the government. "As a result 
. . . we are seeing inconsistent amplitudes of ground shaking at various 
places. There is about 50 times the difference in readings we should be 
getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Volcanologists use those seismic readings to detect tremors that are believed 
to be an important warning sign of an eruption. In recent weeks, Mexican 
scientists said there have been up to 100 minor quakes inside Popo every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on available data, the U.S. volcano experts agreed that no big eruption 
is likely for four to eight weeks. They also stressed that, given Popo's 
20th-Century performance, its eruption is unlikely to break world records. But 
they all cautioned that Popo's history could repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The first eruption recorded at Popo was in 1519. It served as the basis for 
Aztec beliefs about the mountain. That was the year Spanish explorer Hernando 
Cortes landed and began to conquer the Aztec empire. According to Aztec 
historians, Cortes ordered his men to climb Popo to prove to the Aztecs that it 
was not, as they believed, a sacred land of evil souls where no man could 
tread. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes' men never reached the summit. The volcano erupted, showering the 
conquistadors with what historians called a torrent of stones and ice that 
forced them to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
 Another series of eruptions from 1590 to 1592 coincided with epidemics of 
smallpox, measles and flu that reduced the Aztec population to its smallest 
numbers ever. Popo blew again in 1720 -- the year of a great drought in central 
Mexico. Two years of additional eruptions beginning in 1802 were seen as omens 
of the 1810 war of independence against the European colonizers. And the last 
major period of eruptions, from 1919 until 1927, began about the time Mexico's 
legendary freedom fighter Emiliano Zapata died. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are quick to point out that all 16 of the recorded eruptions in the 
last four centuries registered between 1 and 3 on an official volcano index 
that ranges up to 8, with each number representing 10 times more power than the 
previous number. By comparison, the Mt. Pinatubo eruption that devastated the 
Philippine island of Luzon in 1991 was classified as a 6. The great 1815 
Tambora eruption in the Indonesian archipelago was a 7. And the eruption of Mt. 
St. Helens was a 5, 10 times greater than Popo's worst in 1720. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Cruz Reyna has been quoted in recent days as saying Popo's most recent 
behavior resembled what presaged a relatively mild eruption in 1921. He 
suggested the statistics give little cause for great alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Servando is right about that, based on the 20th-Century eruptions," said 
Williams at Arizona State. "But we have to be extremely careful not to assume 
this will follow that pattern. Popo has been dangerous before the 20th Century, 
and it could be again." 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. Geological Survey scientist Michael Sorey had a chilling bottom line 
on Popo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dangerous volcano," he said. "It's been several hundred years since 
it's been dangerous, but that's just yesterday geologically. It's a volcano 
that has frequently erupted violently in the past, and it's to be considered 
very dangerous now." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Popocatepetl, which means "Smoking Mountain" in the Indian language Nahuatl, 
was spewing smoke and ash on its southwest side Friday. The volcano is 39 miles 
southeast of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DANGER SIGNALS 
</P>
<P>
 Deformation: Signs of bulging caused by molten rock deep in the Earth working 
its way up into the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Degassing: A rise of sulfur and carbon dioxide emissions from the crater. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismicity: Ground movement or long harmonic tremors, which indicate movement 
of lava within the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 FACT FILE 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 17,887 feet 
</P>
<P>
 Last eruption: 1947 (16 eruptions since the year 1519) 
</P>
<P>
 Population in area: 20 million within 62-mile radius 
</P>
<P>
 HOW THIS TYPE OF VOLCANO FORMS 
</P>
<P>
 Popocatepetl is related to the subduction zone where the Pacific and North 
American tectonic plates meet. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Over millions of years, a slab of one tectonic plate dives under another, 
carrying with it sediments filled with water and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Water and minerals released from the subductive plate rise into hot rocks 
in the mantle, melting them. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Rising magma -- lava, gases, ash -- is extruded on to the surface through 
the volcano.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FOR COUNTY EMPLOYEES, NO HOLIDAY FROM UNCERTAINTY 
ABOUT LAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 A wave of uncertainty, fear and anger swept through many county offices two 
days before Christmas as anxious employees wondered if they would have jobs to 
come back to after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Friday, most of the 18,000 county employees did not know what to 
expect or how the dramatic budget cuts announced by the county the day before 
would affect them personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the not knowing what is going to happen that is so upsetting," said 
51-year-old Jim Dukette, who has worked for the county Community Services 
Agency for 24 years. "If people could find out specifics, then they could deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the county's employees worked in stunned silence Friday, still reeling 
from news of nearly $30 million in cuts from the county budget. The action was 
taken Thursday, 2 1/2 weeks after the County Board of Supervisors was forced to 
declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers were preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant in the auditor-controller's office said her children have 
offered to give up their Christmas presents. A seven-month employee still on 
the customary one-year probation, she has no illusions about holding on to the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked point-blank and I was told it would be a good idea to look out for 
No. 1 and start sending out resumes," said the woman, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The blow just before Christmas hit hard at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said, 'Mom, I know you're thinking about taking the Christmas 
presents back, but let me look at them first,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news brought reminders of two years she spent searching for a job after 
being laid off from the slumping construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine I'll probably declare bankruptcy so I don't lose equity on my 
home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk in the registrar of voters office said she had not even done any 
Christmas shopping because she is so worried about the financial crisis and 
about possibly losing her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got 14 years here. It's not fair, my grandchildren keep me going," said the 
woman, who began to cry. "I just worry about my house payments. It's not a 
happy time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Snell, 51, a Community Services Agency employee, has also experienced 
the pain and hardship of losing a job, something she feels almost certain is 
about to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be so sad to wake up New Year's Day and not have a job," she said. 
"All my life I've been laid off and laid off. I feel like I may be out on the 
streets again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Social Services Agency, workers flocked Friday morning to read an 
e-mail message sent by agency head Larry M. Leaman. The message told employees 
that the agency might be able to get by without making any layoffs, said Nikki 
Niznik, an eligibility worker and union leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress level in the workplace is so high," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If cuts have to be made, Dukette said, employees in the Community Services 
Agency said they want to have input "instead of just having them handed down 
from above." 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to participate in ideas such as job sharing and work furloughs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grim situation, a twisted humor prevailed in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they took all the money they spent on outside consultants and put it 
together, they could build a replica of Graceland -- Graceland of the West 
Coast," said Greg White, an accountant and auditor who has worked for the 
county for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggested that the county take over Disneyland and use its proceeds to 
get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 But underneath the jokes was a sense of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is the Board of Supervisors should take a walk, and the 
(chief administrative officer) too," said an employee in the tax collector's 
office. "I think (former Treasurer Robert L.) Citron should take his $90,000 
pension and give that back, to make up for what he lost." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime General Services Agency employee said bitterly: "I've paid my dues 
into this system for 18 years and now they are going to say that it's worth 
nothing? I came to work today afraid that I might not have a job. I don't think 
that will be the case, but the day is not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees steered their wrath toward the county supervisors, whom they 
hold responsible for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board should resign immediately," said an employee. "I have no 
faith in them whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees said they felt no bitterness about the drastic cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel sorry for the department heads. They're caring people, too. 
They're doing something that they have to do," said Joyce Harrell, a Human 
Resources office technician. "I've been here four years and I've acquired a lot 
of skills. I'm marketable. If I stay, it's a blessing. If I go, it's a 
blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Silverman, a 17-year Community Services Agency employee, described her 
co-workers as "numb," but extremely professional under trying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a lot of clients who are having hardships and who have been laid off 
and need help finding a job," Silverman said. "So we need to stay positive, and 
this is a staff that is up to it. We don't know what's going to happen but we 
have a job to do."

BUDGET: LAWYERS AND JUDGES POINT OUT THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS RECOMMENDED BIG 
TRIMS IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE SERVICES FOR THE POOR BUT SPARED THEIR OWN 
DEPARTMENTS.

 As the dust from the first round of Orange County budget cuts began to settle 
Friday, local lawyers and judges questioned the fairness of letting 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi recommend 
enormous cuts in criminal defense services for the poor while sparing their own 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi, Gates and Thomas E. Uram, head of the county Health Care Agency, 
serve on the Management Operations Council, which advised the County Board of 
Supervisors on what cuts to make in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, supervisors announced $30 million in reductions to help bail the 
county out of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. About 35 
programs and departments were affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The deepest cut -- 29% -- occurred in the $12.7-million budget of the 
Alternate Defense Fund, which provides lawyers for impoverished defendants when 
the public defender's office cannot take their cases, often because of 
conflicts that routinely occur in multiple-defendant cases where members of the 
same "law firm" cannot represent joint defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we have a representative from the courts, or from the public 
defender's office, or other departments on the council?" asked Harbor Municipal 
Court Judge Margaret R. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a coincidence that the people on the team have some of the lowest 
cuts in their services? I think there is a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi defended his actions and those of his colleagues who discussed 
potential cuts with department heads and then recommended them to the Board of 
Supervisors for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not ever been shy about offering my advice and recommendations, even 
unsolicited," Capizzi said. "When someone asks me to serve on the council to 
make recommendations, I can't ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unanimous recommendation was presented to the board," Capizzi said. "I 
did not make the decision. The board had the authority. I was simply making a 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying for defense attorneys when the public defender has a 
conflict of interest, the Alternate Defense Fund also pays for court-appointed 
attorneys, defense investigators, expert witnesses and lawyers who successfully 
bid for major felony cases, including homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the adversary system of U.S. jurisprudence, many of those law firms and 
private attorneys are the regular court opponents of the district attorney, who 
has publicly stated that defense attorneys are responsible for some of the 
troublesome roadblocks in the court system today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like the Rams and the Raiders going down the roster of the teams 
they're going to play and knocking out key players," said defense attorney 
Julian W. Bailey, who handles a small percentage of indigent defense cases. 
"It's a horrible conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the large cut in the Alternative Defense Fund -- which is 
virtually double the 29% figure because the entire cutback must be accomplished 
in the six months left in the fiscal year -- the sheriff's budget was cut less 
than 1%; funding for the district attorney was reduced 1.1%. Both agencies had 
healthy, double-digit budget increases this year that more than offset the 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts will force the public defender's office to shoulder about 3,000 more 
cases on top of its enormous workload, and split the office into two separate 
defense agencies to avoid conflicts of interests. All of this must be done 
without an increase in staff or resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inherent problem of having prosecutors involved in cuts related 
to the funding of defense attorneys," said attorney Gary Proctor, who has a 
county contract to defend juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler declined to comment on the recommendations of 
the management council, but said he was able to fend off a reduction in his 
current staff and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner defended the decision to make small cuts in the 
Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office because the Board of 
Supervisors has always given public safety a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern I've heard from everybody is don't take those policemen away 
from me, don't take those firemen away from me," Gates said Friday. "The 
direction from the Board of Supervisors was to make sure that the proper level 
of health, safety and welfare is maintained in this community and I think the 
first two categories are probably the top priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said he thinks the public 
defender's office may already be the "leanest and meanest" agency in Orange 
County as a result of budget cuts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most problematic areas of the proposed cuts," Smith 
said. "How can the (public defenders) handle the additional cases? By working 
harder? I'm not sure they can."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MORE CUTS SEEN: The county must cut $80 million more beginning July 1, Orange 
County officials said. News of the additional cuts came just a day after top 
managers stunned the county by announcing cutbacks in dozens of departments, 
from courts to social services.The exact number of layoffs was still 
undetermined Friday. Supervisor William G. Steiner said the downsizing is 
expected to become more severe. 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY DISTRIBUTED: Distribution of property tax money to cities, schools and 
special districts began. Many city officials were so eager to receive the money 
that they showed up in person to collect rather than wait for the checks to 
arrive by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 FROZEN AID: Money used by four agencies to help people meet the rent is frozen 
in the county fund. And an agreement collapsed between some shelters and the 
Sheriff's Department to send extra jail food to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 REASSURING EMPLOYEES: County department heads spent the day reassuring 
employees that most of their jobs were safe. Many managers said they were 
relieved the cuts weren't worse and said specifics of the department reductions 
would take at least a week to work out. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW REVENUE SOUGHT: County officials sought new ways to raise money, including 
selling or leasing county-owned properties. Other possibilities include renting 
landfill space to other counties and signing long-term leases with vendors in 
exchange for lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 BLUE CHRISTMAS: With layoffs looming, workers worried about their future and 
wondered whether they will have jobs when the holidays are over. Workers 
huddled in hallways and whispered about their situation before returning to 
desks to await further updates. "There is a real sadness and a stunned 
silence," one said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EDITORIAL COMMENTARY ACROSS THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's newspapers have had plenty to say about Orange County's plight.  
</P>
<P>
 With his Navajo jewelry and down-home ways, he was the people's tax collector, 
Robert L. "Bob" Citron. Image mattered: Over 24 years in Orange County, 
California, he rarely let a criticism of his operation go without a blustery 
answer. Now Mr. Citron, who in 1973 became treasurer as well as taxman, is the 
silenced symbol of a colossal overreach in municipal finance. 
</P>
<P>
 WALL STREET JOURNAL, DEC. 9 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the John Birch Society sound bites, no one among locally elected 
officials (in Orange County) seems to have kept an eye on the former county 
treasurer, Robert Citron . . . His free and easy ways with other people's money 
came to light as a bitter pre-Christmas surprise for 180 of Orange County's 
local government entities whose funds had been entrusted to a single investment 
portfolio managed -- or, rather, mismanaged -- by Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE, DEC. 13 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Orange County needed was oversight. Mr. Citron was seemingly left to run 
amok. Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, calls 
on state and local governments to monitor investment managers of taxpayer money 
. . . If fund managers were forced to assess and report risks, and government 
supervisors were responsible for overseeing the managers, then Orange County -- 
one of the wealthiest in America -- would not now be threatening to lay off 
teachers and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK TIMES, DEC. 15 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There will be plenty of time later to lay blame for the investment speculation 
that has now forced Orange County to file for bankruptcy protection. But what's 
critical now is swift leadership from the state to contain the crisis. The 
immediate problem is to shore up Orange County's investment fund and provide 
liquidity for the agencies that have invested, to keep them from tumbling like 
dominoes into bankruptcy themselves.

 Daniel Israel Arnon, 84, a leading plant biologist and professor at UC 
Berkeley. Arnon changed the basic understanding of photosynthesis, the process 
that sustains plant life through the conversion of sunlight, water and carbon 
dioxide into organic compounds and oxygen.He was best known for his discovery 
of photosynthetic phosphorylation, demonstrating that plants convert the energy 
of sunlight into biological forms and in doing so liberate oxygen. A native of 
Warsaw who witnessed the occupation of Poland by the Germans, Arnon came to 
California to attend college, vowing to devote his life to improving 
agriculture. He received a doctorate from UC Berkeley and joined the faculty in 
1946. He later founded the university's departments of plant nutrition and cell 
physiology. Arnon was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and 
academies in Sweden, France and Germany. He also was a Guggenheim fellow and

SANTA BARBARA MAYOR QUITS AFTER LOSING TERM LIMITS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Hal Conklin says he plans to resign Jan. 3 after losing a court battle 
to keep his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor announced his plans Thursday after the state Supreme Court refused 
to review a lower court's ruling that Conklin's election last year violated the 
city's term limits law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I've gotten tremendous support in the past, this kind of waiting 
around week in and week out for what the court is going to do is sort of 
debilitating because you really can't get anything done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Harriet Miller is expected to take over for the remaining three 
years of Conklin's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin, who was first elected to the City Council in 1977, was sworn in as 
mayor last year under the threat of a lawsuit from election reform leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In its legal challenge, the city's Electoral Reform Coalition cited a 1990 
voter-approved law that prohibits a four-term City Council member from serving 
a fifth consecutive term. Coalition members said Conklin's first term as mayor 
counted as a fifth term under the law.

BRULTE SAYS HE URGED BROWN TO END BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assembly Republican leader Jim Brulte, tied with Democrat Willie Brown for the 
speakership of the lower house, said Friday that he urged Brown to give up his 
tenacious fight to recapture the post. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly confident of victory, Brulte said he warned Brown that Democratic 
insistence on ousting veteran Republican Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia in order 
to break the stalemate and restore the speakership to Brown was a "corrupt 
abuse of power." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, Brulte said, the threatened expulsion of Mountjoy is 
"impeding our ability to reach some kind of agreement." In the longer term, he 
said, it "poisons the well" for establishing harmonious bipartisan relations 
when the fight finally ends. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, the Rancho Cucamonga lawmaker declined to 
characterize Brown's response during the unpublicized 90-minute, face-to-face 
meeting between the two Thursday in Los Angeles. Brulte said he asked for the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said Brown did indicate that he believed none of the 40 Republicans in 
the Assembly would break ranks to vote for the Democrat. Until Dec. 5, Brown 
had held the Legislature's most powerful position for an unprecedented 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nov. 8 election, Republicans reversed their minority status in the 
Assembly and returned to Sacramento with a bare majority of 41 votes. But 
Brulte's expected promotion to Speaker was torpedoed when Republican Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar left the party to become an independent and joined the 
39 Democrats in voting for Brown, creating the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Democratic attention has focused on Mountjoy, an outspoken 
conservative foe of Brown. Mountjoy was reelected to the Assembly in the 
November general election and also to a vacancy in the Senate in a special 
election. He has said that he intends to remain in the Assembly as long as it 
takes to replace Brown and that he will abandon his Senate seat if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Infuriated by Horcher's vote for Brown and supported by Gov. Pete Wilson, 
Republicans have started a campaign to recall Horcher. The recall election 
likely would be held in March, at least two months after the start of the 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he told Brown that "it's clear there will be 41 Republican votes 
to elect a Speaker following the Horcher recall. Given that reality, it is 
probably better that we (choose a Speaker) in January and get on with the 
people's business."

STATE'S POPULATION AT PEAK BUT GROWTH RATE IS SLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime between mid-1993 and mid-1994, California's population surpassed 32 
million for the first time, but the rate of growth continued to slow down, as 
it has throughout the recent recession years, state officials reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last July 1, the state was home to 32,140,000 people, according to 
official estimates by the Department of Finance, an increase of 394,000 over 12 
months.Since 1990, when the current recession began, population growth has 
continued but at a progressively slower pace, the state demographers reported. 
By 1993-94, the rate of growth had slowed to 1.2%, lower than at any time since 
1971-72, also a recession period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest population estimates, coastal urban counties tended to be in the 
low-growth categories. Los Angeles County grew 0.47%, Orange County 1.43% and 
Ventura County 1.39%. Relatively high growth occurred in Imperial County -- 
6.37% -- and the central inland mountain counties. The figures include 
estimates of illegal immigration, officials said.

LAW FIRM APPEALS $3.8-MILLION SEX-HARASSMENT AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An internationally known law firm slapped with a record $3.8-million judgment 
in a sexual harassment lawsuit has appealed the decision, calling the award 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker & McKenzie, the world's largest law firm, appealed the already reduced 
amount granted Rena Weeks after this summer's trial. She had claimed that she 
was harassed by attorney Martin Greenstein and that the firm knew about his 
actions but failed to stop him from making advances toward her and other female 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco Superior Court jury awarded Weeks $6.9 million in punitive 
damages Sept. 1. Judge John Munter reduced the amount on Dec. 12. Even at the 
lower figure, it is the largest award ever in a sexual harassment complaint, 
according to Weeks' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker & McKenzie said Thursday that the firm considers the award excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Judge Munter reduced the damages in his ruling, we feel strongly 
that the punitive damages award remains grossly disproportionate to the 
situation and the compensatory damages," the firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, 40, worked for the 1,700-lawyer firm in Palo Alto for three months in 
1991, including about a month as Greenstein's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that after one luncheon in a local restaurant, Greenstein dumped 
candies in a breast pocket of her blouse, touched her breast through the shirt, 
pulled her arms back from behind and said, "Let's see which one (breast) is 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Greenstein later lunged at her in the office, grabbed her hips on 
another occasion and made sexually suggestive comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven other women said Greenstein had grabbed them, propositioned them or made 
lewd remarks in incidents dating back to 1987. None sued, but all testified in 
support of Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein, 49, resigned under pressure in October, 1993, after 22 years with 
the firm. He denied Weeks' accusations and described her as an incompetent 
secretary.

TOBACCO TAX IMPROPERLY USED TO BALANCE BUDGET, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators 
improperly tapped voter-approved tobacco taxes to help balance the state's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Roger Warren said the diversion of funds, about $160 million over two 
years, violated the provisions of Proposition 99, the 1988 ballot initiative 
that sharply boosted taxes on tobacco products, including a 25-cents-per-pack 
increase on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the initiative, 5% of the tax money was to go to 
smoking-related research, 20% to anti-smoking health education programs and the 
remainder to a variety of health programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed jointly by the American Lung Assn. and the American Cancer 
Society contended that the state improperly used the funds for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the state took $35 million from the health education account and 
diverted it to a children's health disability program, the suit noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren scheduled a Jan. 19 hearing to determine how the diversion of funds 
should be corrected.

NEXT O.C. CUT: $80 MILLION MORE; BANKRUPTCY: THE SLASHES -- FOR NEXT FISCAL 
YEAR -- WILL BE ON TOP OF $40 MILLION IN REDUCTIONS AND BUDGET SHIFTS THIS 
YEAR. DEVASTATING FALLOUT IS FORESEEN.

<P>
 One day after announcing that hundreds of layoffs are likely from massive 
budget cutbacks, Orange County officials said Friday that they plan to slash an 
additional $80 million in costs next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 News of more cutbacks came just 24 hours after top managers stunned the 
county's 18,000 employees by revealing more than $40 million in budget 
reductions and shifts planned over the next six months. Of that, nearly $30 
million will be in cutbacks at dozens of county departments, such as courts and 
social services. The rest will come from early cash advances from federal, 
state and local programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's new management council said at an impromptu news conference 
Friday that the cuts will have to rise to $80 million over the next fiscal 
year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to double (the $40 million) next year," said Tom Uram, director of 
the county Health Care Agency, who with Sheriff Brad Gates and Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi make up the council charged with reshaping the county's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 They would not give any specifics on how the second round of cuts would be 
implemented or how many additional jobs would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said that the downsizing of the county's 
programs and its work force is expected to become more severe and that the 
fallout will be nothing short of devastating to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to understand this is not some kind of impersonal bureaucracy," 
Steiner said. "People are reeling from this. These people are husbands and 
wives and brothers and sisters. For the thousand people or whatever it is that 
will be affected by this, it's extremely emotional and personal." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact number of layoffs was undetermined Friday. But the news has sparked 
fury, as labor leaders have scrambled to consult lawyers about possible legal 
action against the county for suspending numerous labor contracts and allowing 
department managers broad discretion to fire employees or cut their pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomb threats were made to the offices of Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and 
Thomas F. Riley. Someone also called to threaten the life of former 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, who resigned this month as the county 
veered toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Felix Rocha Jr., an Orange County Department of Education board 
member, served Supervisor Roger R. Stanton with recall papers Friday. But Rocha 
had not completed the necessary paperwork to file a petition with the county, 
so he vowed to return next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha's attorney, Marvin L. Rudnick, said Stanton tried to dissuade Rocha from 
filing the papers and suggested they all meet next week, but Rocha turned him 
down. Rocha told Rudnick that he received several calls Friday from community 
leaders pressuring him not to file the recall petition. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The county began distributing property tax money to cities, school districts 
and other special districts. Officials from many cities -- including Huntington 
Beach, Anaheim and Fullerton -- were so eager to get the cash that they arrived 
in person at the Hall of Administration to collect checks rather than wait for 
them in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Mayor George Brown said his city decided to pick up the payment so 
the money could immediately be deposited in a bank and earn interest over the 
long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials searched for new ways to raise money, including selling or 
leasing county-owned properties. The county also is weighing whether to rent 
space in its landfills to other counties or to sign long-term contracts with 
county vendors in exchange for lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Madera County's Department of Education, which put more than $5 million in 
Orange County's troubled investment fund, said in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court 
filing that it may default on several public debt obligations if it cannot 
immediately withdraw $2.48 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County department heads spent the day fielding questions from anxious 
employees -- reassuring most that their jobs were safe -- and trying to meet 
the cost-cutting demands imposed Thursday by the Board of Supervisors. Many 
managers said they were relieved that the initial reductions were not worse. 
The specifics of the blows to each department are expected to take at least a 
week to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hall of Administration and other offices across the county, workers 
fretted about their future two days before Christmas and wondered whether they 
would have jobs when they returned from holiday vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees said the public will feel the crunch almost immediately in longer 
lines for various services and delays in processing paperwork by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers huddled in hallways during breaks and whispered about the situation, 
then went back to their desks, anxiously waiting for any updates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real sadness and a stunned silence," said public health nurse 
Karen Graffman. "It's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they hoped that layoffs could be avoided by trying ideas such as 
shortened workweeks or reduced salaries. Resignations Urged 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers vented their anger toward the Board of Supervisors and called for 
immediate resignations. Many had bitter words for Citron, whose high-risk 
investment strategies have been blamed for the county's $2.02-billion loss this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders fumed over the county's decision to suspend their bargaining 
agreements. That decision will allow the cutbacks to begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think their actions are illegal," said Bill Fogarty, executive 
secretary-treasurer of the Orange County Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO. "We 
don't think they have the authority to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fogarty said the county's move is drawing attention from union leaders 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens in Orange County, I think it's going to set some precedent 
nationwide for employee rights," he said. "This is a classic case of union 
busting by Orange County and it's going to have national implications." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors decided to suspend collective bargaining contracts and other 
employee rights Thursday after the management council proposed a wide-ranging 
slash of services, targeting contracts that provide outside legal assistance 
for the poor, health care and welfare services, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 At their news conference Friday, Gates, Capizzi and Uram refused to speculate 
on the number of layoffs that might occur over the next six months. They said 
that the specific cutbacks will be left to individual department managers and 
that many agencies may be able to streamline programs without putting people 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some union leaders speculated that between 800 and 1,000 jobs could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to avoid laying off people," Capizzi said of his own 
department, which was one of the least-affected areas, with a 1.1% reduction 
planned. "The purpose of this was not to lay off employees, but rather to cut 
the county's costs. If we can do so and minimize the impact to employees, we 
will also minimize the impact to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said union officials told the management council that they preferred 
layoffs to an across-the-board reduction in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram clarified the council's recommendation of $40.2 million in cuts during 
the next six months, noting that the savings are expected to come from $29.7 
million in straightforward reductions in the county's general funds and $10.5 
million in accelerated revenue payments from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the aim of the cutbacks is a "leaner, meaner," restructured county 
government for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government's probably going to be reinvented here," he said. "It's not like 
we're going to be just sitting down and doing a budget like we did last year 
and over the last 20 years. It's a whole different process." 
</P>
<P>
 All three emphasized the importance of having acted quickly. Gates said each 
week costs the county $7 million in salaries alone. 'Invisible Wall' Falls 
</P>
<P>
 Though some county workers have raised questions about why cuts in the 
departments headed by Gates, Capizzi and Uram were among the smallest, council 
members said they were given a clear mission by the Board of Supervisors to 
retain services dealing with "public safety, health and welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern I've heard from everyone is: Don't take away those police, 
don't take away those firemen," Gates said. "The cops are going to still be on 
the street. We're going to be prosecuting. Mike's going to be putting criminals 
in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, an Orange County native, said the past few weeks have been upsetting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has always been this invisible wall around Orange County that has 
protected us from all kinds of things in my lifetime," he said. "That wall got 
punched a little bit with crime, it got punched a little bit with drugs, it got 
punched again with gangs. Things are happening here that we never in my mind 
thought could happen. It's like a major blow to the jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 6, several groups have 
called for the recall of the supervisors. On Friday, Rocha, of the county 
Department of Education, was the first to attempt such an action when he served 
Stanton with recall papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Tanney, the county registrar of voters, said Rocha filed a notice of 
intent to recall Stanton and told a registrar's office employee that he had 
served Stanton the notice earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing a notice of intent is the first step in beginning the recall 
process. Rocha's notice appeared to include the required 20 signatures from 
residents as well as the statement of 200 words or less explaining why Rocha 
wanted to recall Stanton, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the notice was missing a section of the California Election Code that 
advises the target of a recall that he or she has seven days to file a response 
to the notice with the registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a defective notice. It was not complete," Tanney said. "We advised him 
that it didn't meet the code." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, a Board of Education member since 1992, would have to add the missing 
section to the notice, collect 20 new signatures and again serve Stanton with 
the document, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Registrar employee Bev Warner said Rocha appeared unhappy that the notice was 
rejected. "He was upset that we weren't going to accept it the way it was," 
Warner said. "He was a little upset, but he was upset before he got here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha said he will return with a new notice Thursday, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha, 49, is a special agent for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, according to voter registration information. He has been involved in 
local politics for years. In 1990, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for a seat 
on the Fountain Valley School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha declined to comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rocha's notice was the first one presented to the board against a 
supervisor since the financial crisis began, the number of public inquiries 
about how to begin a recall movement have increased substantially since the 
county declared bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest resident Dianna Baumann said she circulated petitions door to door 
over the last two weeks and plans to launch a full-scale drive after the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann and her young daughter attended Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting 
carrying red banners calling for supervisors to resign. Baumann has named her 
campaign the Coalition for Accountability and is urging residents to send empty 
wallets to supervisors as a protest against the bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under county election codes, recalls can only be attempted against officials 
who have more than six months remaining on their terms or have been in office 
for more than 90 days, said Rosalyn Lever, assistant county registrar. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are about to retire, Supervisors Riley and Harriett M. Wieder 
"could not be subjects of a recall," Lever said. Because Steiner's term is 
about to end, Lever said he cannot be the subject of a recall until 90 days 
into his new term. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stanton's district, about 15,000 signatures would be required to hold an 
election on whether to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann said she is getting ready to kick her recall drive into full gear. 
</P>
<P>
 'As soon as Christmas is over, we are going to hit this and hit it hard," she 
said. "We entrusted them to look after our interests. . . . But they are not 
looking out for the taxpayers' interests."

O.C. WORKERS LEFT DISPIRITED OVER HOLIDAYS

<P>
 A wave of uncertainty, fear and anger swept through many county offices two 
days before Christmas as anxious employees wondered if they would have jobs to 
come back to after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Friday, most of the 18,000 county employees didn't know what to 
expect or how the dramatic budget cuts announced by the county the day before 
would affect them personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the not knowing what is going to happen that is so upsetting," said 
51-year-old Jim Dukette, who has worked for the county Community Services 
Agency for 24 years. "If people could find out specifics, then they could deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the county's employees worked in stunned silence Friday, still reeling 
from news that $40.2 million has been slashed from the county budget. The 
action was taken Thursday, 2 1/2 weeks after the County Board of Supervisors 
was forced to declare bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety hit an even higher level when employees heard that the county was in 
for another round of cuts in June -- possibly $80 million worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers were already preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant in the auditor-controller's office said her children have 
offered to give up their Christmas presents. A seven-month employee still on 
her customary one-year probation, she has no illusions about holding on to the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked point-blank and I was told it would be a good idea to look out for 
No. 1 and start sending out resumes," said the woman, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The blow just before Christmas hit hard at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter said, 'Mom, I know you're thinking about taking the Christmas 
presents back, but let me look at them first,' " said the accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Himalayan cat she bought will have to stay, but plans to buy her 
16-year-old daughter car insurance are out of the question now, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news brought reminders of two years she spent searching for a job after 
being laid off from the slumping construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine I'll probably declare bankruptcy so I don't lose equity on my 
home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk in the registrar of voters office said she hadn't even done any 
Christmas shopping because she is so worried about the financial crisis and 
about possibly losing her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got 14 years here, it's not fair -- my grandchildren keep me going," 
said the woman, who began to cry. "I just worry about my house payments. It's 
not a happy time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Snell, a 51-year-old Community Services Agency employee, has also 
experienced the pain and hardship of losing a job, something she feels almost 
certain is about to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be so sad to wake up New Year's Day and not have a job," she said. 
"All my life I've been laid off and laid off. I feel like I may be out on the 
streets again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Social Services Agency, workers flocked Friday morning to read an 
e-mail message sent by agency head Larry Leaman. The message told employees 
that the agency might be able to get by without making any layoffs, said Nikki 
Niznik, an eligibility worker and union leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress level in the workplace is so high," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees in the registrar of voters office were told Friday that their 
department would be among the hardest hit and to expect many layoffs. They were 
given few details but were at least assured that they would not lose their jobs 
during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervisor in the registrar's office said employees "are all very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we get some definite word, we don't know who will be laid off or how 
hard we'll be hit. Everybody has been very quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 If cuts have to be made, Dukette said, employees in the Community Services 
Agency said they want to have input "instead of just having them handed down 
from above." 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to participate in ideas such as job sharing and work furloughs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The furlough concept is one supported by 28-year-old John Tran, who came to 
work for the agency only five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they could have a two-week work furlough and keep everyone's job," he 
said. "I understand that they have to do what they have to do. But it would be 
so extreme to have layoffs during the holidays. I'm trying to keep a positive 
attitude because it is the holidays. I'm hoping for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grim situation, a twisted humor prevailed in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they took all the money they spent on outside consultants and put it 
together, they could build a replica of Graceland -- Graceland of the West 
Coast," said Greg White, an accountant and auditor who has worked for the 
county for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggested that the county take over Disneyland and use those proceeds 
to get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 But underneath the jokes was a sense of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general feeling is the Board of Supervisors should take a walk, and the 
CAO (county administrative officer) too," said an employee in the tax 
collector's office. "I think (former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L.) Citron 
should take his $90,000 pension and give that back, to make up for what he 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime General Services Agency employee said bitterly: "I've paid my dues 
into this system for 18 years and now they are going to say that it's worth 
nothing? I came to work today afraid that I might not have a job. I don't think 
that will be the case but the day is not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees vented their wrath toward the Board of Supervisors, who they 
hold responsible for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board should resign immediately," one employee said. "I have no 
faith in them whatsoever. I am extremely angry with the board. They are the 
ultimate authority in this county and were warned numerous times about Citron. 
His risky investments came up during the election in June and other times 
before that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are paying for their mistake," said Snell of the Community Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty upset that the (bankruptcy) was allowed to happen," said Jane 
Tripp, a supervisor in the county's Municipal Court criminal division. "The 
Board of Supervisors, who are making these decisions, are also to blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Tripp said that department heads were told that the jobs in the Municipal 
Court's criminal division are secure. But only through June. Then an assessment 
will be made based on employees' merit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees said they felt no bitterness about the drastic cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel sorry for the department heads. They're caring people too. 
They're doing something that they have to do," said Joyce Harrell, a Human 
Resources office technician. "I've been here four years and I've acquired a lot 
of skills. I'm marketable. If I stay it's a blessing. If I go it's a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Adams, a secretary to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, said the anger has 
given way to a sense of determination to pull together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to pass and we're all going to get back strong again," she said. 
"It's what has to be done countywide. We have to do our share too." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Silverman, a 17-year Community Services Agency employee, described her 
co-workers as "numb" but extremely professional under trying conditions. 
</P>

 "We see a lot of clients who are having hardships and who have been laid off 
and need help finding a job," Silverman said. "So we need to stay positive, and 
this is a staff that is up to it. We don't know what's going to happen but we 
have a job to do."

 SCROOGED: A Northridge tour company will give refunds to 167 couples whose 
Christmas vacations to Mexico were canceled. Paul Mostman, hired to do the 
refunds for Fabulous Vacations Tour Co., said the plane was impounded in 
Switzerland and gun-toting men took over the hotel. . . . "I can't imagine 
wanting to stay in that hotel unless Santa brings me a bullet-proof vest," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 SPECIAL DELIVERY: St. Nick may be able to deliver that late Christmas card. 
Any Express Mail purchased today at a Valley post office (most are open until 
noon) will get to California cities tomorrow. Some carriers will wear Santa 
suits, but not in the Valley. "We've been having so many robberies that having 
carriers in a Santa suit probably wouldn't be a good idea," said one 
postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 PRESIDENTIAL: Robert George, above, has played Santa for six Presidents, but 
has always served a higher power. . . . The Sun Valley resident, 71, believes 
the Santa role and his faith go together. He "wants to serve humanity by 
fulfilling the symbolic expression of the love of God," says one friend. Even 
the Santa suit is sacred. He once turned down an invitation from President 
Reagan because the staff would not let him wear his red-and-white outfit. See 
Religion (B1).

<P>
 SHOOTING: They shoot for sport, don't they? They sure do. They belong to the 
Southwest Pistol League in Ventura County, but one of the best shooters comes 
from the Valley. . . . David Gentzvein, 31, of Woodland Hills, has won the 
league's open division title three years in a row. . . . "Shooting is much like 
golf," he says, "very stylistic" (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 AT RISK: Many of the 48,060 Salvadorans who live in the San Fernando and 
neighboring valleys are war refugees who, come September, will lose their 
protected status and must go back or become illegal. . . . Said counselor 
Mercedes Ramirez, with the Central American Resource Center: "I think this will 
be the saddest Christmas for them." Jeff Schnaufer

FULLERTON MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF 7-MONTH-OLD SON

 A Fullerton man was arrested Friday on suspicion that he beat his 7-month-old 
son to death, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Louis Garcia, 31, was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of 
murder after giving police inconsistent statements about fatal head injuries 
suffered by his son, Johnny, on Tuesday, said Sgt. Hal Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 The child died Thursday at Children's Hospital of Orange County, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Garcia called his wife at work Tuesday to tell her the child was 
hurt. When she returned to their home on East Valencia Drive, the child was in 
serious condition and she took him to St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, 
Stevens said. The boy was later moved to Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said Garcia told police he had shaken the child hard, but denied 
striking the child or doing anything to cause severe injuries. Investigators 
charged Garcia because his accounts did not match autopsy findings of head 
trauma, Stevens said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SHERIFF AND D.A.'S ROLE IN CUTS IS QUESTIONED; 
BUDGET: LAWYERS AND JUDGES POINT OUT THAT THE TWO OFFICIALS RECOMMENDED BIG 
TRIMS IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE SERVICES FOR THE POOR BUT SPARED THEIR OWN 
DEPARTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the dust from the first round of Orange County budget cuts began to settle 
Friday, local lawyers and judges questioned the fairness of letting 
Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates and Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi recommend 
enormous cuts in criminal defense services for the poor while sparing their own 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi, Gates and Thomas E. Uram, head of the county Health Care Agency, 
serve on the Management Operations Council, which advised the County Board of 
Supervisors on what cuts to make in county government. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, supervisors announced $30 million in reductions to help bail the 
county out of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. About 35 
programs and departments were affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The deepest cut -- 29% -- occurred in the $12.7-million budget of the 
Alternate Defense Fund, which provides lawyers for impoverished defendants when 
the public defender's office cannot take their cases, often because of 
conflicts that routinely occur in multiple-defendant cases where members of the 
same "law firm" cannot represent joint defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we have a representative from the courts, or from the public 
defender's office, or other departments on the council?" asked Harbor Municipal 
Court Judge Margaret R. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a coincidence that the people on the team have some of the lowest 
cuts in their services? I think there is a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi defended his actions and those of his colleagues who discussed 
potential cuts with department heads and then recommended them to the Board of 
Supervisors for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not ever been shy about offering my advice and recommendations, even 
unsolicited," Capizzi said. "When someone asks me to serve on the council to 
make recommendations, I can't ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unanimous recommendation was presented to the board," Capizzi said. "I 
did not make the decision. The board had the authority. It was simply making a 
recommendation. I am certainly entitled to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying for defense attorneys when the public defender has a 
conflict of interest, the Alternate Defense Fund also pays for court-appointed 
attorneys, defense investigators, expert witnesses and lawyers who successfully 
bid for major felony cases, including homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the adversary system of U.S. jurisprudence, many of those law firms and 
private attorneys are the regular court opponents of the district attorney, who 
has publicly stated that defense attorneys are responsible for some of the 
troublesome roadblocks in the court system today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like the Rams and the Raiders going down the roster of the teams 
they're going to play and knocking out key players," said defense attorney 
Julian W. Bailey, who handles a small percentage of indigent defense cases. 
"It's a horrible conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the large cut in the Alternative Defense Fund -- which is 
virtually double the 29% figure because the entire cutback must be accomplished 
in the six months left in the fiscal year -- the sheriff's budget was cut less 
than 1%; funding for the district attorney was reduced 1.1%. Both agencies had 
healthy, double-digit budget increases this year that more than offset the 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts will force the public defender's office to shoulder about 3,000 more 
cases on top of its huge workload, and split the office into two separate 
defense agencies to avoid conflicts of interests. All of this must be done 
without an increase in staff or resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inherent problem of having prosecutors involved in cuts related 
to the funding of defense attorneys," said attorney Gary Proctor, who has a 
county contract to defend juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler declined to comment on the recommendations of 
the management council, but said he was able to fend off a reduction in his 
current staff and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner defended the decision to make small cuts in the 
Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's office because the Board of 
Supervisors has always given public safety a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern I've heard from everybody is don't take those policemen away 
from me, don't take those firemen away from me," Gates said Friday. "The 
direction from the Board of Supervisors was to make sure that the proper level 
of health, safety and welfare is maintained in this community and I think the 
first two categories are probably the top priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said he thinks the public 
defender's office may already be the "leanest and meanest" agency in Orange 
County as a result of budget cuts over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most problematic areas of the proposed cuts," Smith 
said. "How can the (public defenders) handle the additional cases? By working 
harder? I'm not sure they can. By providing less services? Is that what we 
want? 
</P>
<P>
 "Their budget is not full of fat, especially because it's under a finer 
magnifying glass than any other agency in the county," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith sympathized with those on the management council, saying it was a 
"lose-lose situation" for Gates, Capizzi and Uram because of the intense public 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana defense attorney George A. Peters Jr., who handles some contract 
cases for the county, put it this way: "They are advocates of the system, they 
arrest and prosecute people, and now they are in a situation where they are 
slaying their opponents' budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters questioned whether the cuts were equitable. "It seems like the defense 
is taking the biggest hit, but I guess it's because we're not politically 
popular. It's the constitutional flip side of prosecutions, but no one thinks 
of that until their son or daughter or someone they know gets charged with a 
crime."

 "In the banking industry, the government has taken down hundreds of 
institutions in which common investors, both small and large, have lost their 
life savings, pensions and livelihood. No problem, we say, they were taking too 
much risk. And in many cases we put the chief executive officer and the board 
of directors in jail for risking the investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what! Robert Citron is the CEO and Supervisors Riley, Wieder and 
company are the board of directors who were told repeatedly that rising 
interest rates cause a decrease in bond value. (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan 
not only increased the interest rate, but said he would again and again and 
kept his word. . . . Now they, Citron, Riley and Wieder, retire at no cost or 
loss to them and start collecting their pensions. I'm incensed that government 
employees are not held accountable for these losses as in private industry."

 "Perhaps we've been too hard on Mr. Citron. After all, he was applauded for 
years for getting Orange County higher rates of return than other counties. 
Let's see, if he's averaged a hundred million dollars extra for us for each of 
the last 20 years, then a $2-billion loss is break even (without interest, of 
course). If he didn't do that well, then I suggest the first dollar of his 
pension be paid to him only when the last dollar owed to our county teachers 
has been paid. Fair is fair."

<P>
 Robert Fairbanks, Dana Point

 "The supervisors are still making a mess of things, not to mention the 
embarrassment that has been caused. Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez better get a grip 
in life. We, the people of this county, will not stand for any more. 
Supervisors Riley and Wieder getting their retirement and medical benefits 
after they were a part of victimizing all of us? What a joke! We have layoffs 
that were not supposed to happen. Incoming supervisors who want to give up free 
cars and don't know how they're going to get around? Well, they can use their 
own car and pay for their gas, like we do. Recall! Recall!"

 Mary Melanson, Orange

 "I have totaled up the supervisors' perks and salary and it comes to $101,868 
annually, plus their vacation unlimited. This is unheard of in any private 
enterprise or in any job that I've ever had or ever heard of. The supervisors 
have not supervised. A recall is definitely in order. Their cutback ought to be 
at least 25-30% of their salaries and their perks. They have squandered our 
money, tax money, and in Orange County, with the economy what it is, it is 
unthinkable. It borders on criminal, in my opinion. There are people hungry. . 
. . As far as I'm concerned, they should all resign."

 "I'm not squawking about Bob Citron, I'm squawking about the supervisors. All 
the proposed things they're supposedly willing to give up is just child's play. 
. . . Get rid of them! They're no good, they're going to hang on and still 
bleed us dry. Get 'em out of there, have an election and ride 'em out of the 
county! Get somebody in there that can run this county clean and decent. . . . 
I've been here over 20 years, I'm fed up with it. And all my neighbors are 
too."

 "Let's see the supervisors cut their salaries, benefits and retirement at 
least 50%. Unlimited vacation days? Must be nice. My daughter teaches in an 
Orange County public middle school and is in danger of losing her job. The way 
I see it, that's a 100% pay cut. Let's get real! Five percent cuts by our 
supervisors? That's barely a trip to the grocery store."

 "I'm a city employee with the city of San Juan Capistrano, which did not 
invest in the Orange County pool, and I'm very proud of that. At the same time, 
though, I am extremely saddened to see that my colleagues in city government 
will be affected by the irresponsibility of Mr. Bob Citron, as well as the 
supervisors. . . . Unfortunately this event comes right at the time of 
Christmas, which couldn't happen at a worse time for those possible hundreds of 
county employees and their families. It is just at a time when the county was 
starting to turn around and jobs in government were starting to get better. . . 
. There'd been four years of recession and this is just another blow to 
California. I hope that things do get better, but at the same time, this may be 
the nail on the coffin for California."

 "The profound loss of funds belonging to the citizens of Orange County is the 
result of irresponsible acts by officials who are in a position of trust. . . . 
These acts are inexcusable and should result in removal of all persons 
responsible. Such careless irresponsibility cannot be tolerated by the citizens 
of this community. In my opinion, the nation is watching Orange County in 
disbelief. From now on, we've got to watch the store a lot more carefully."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BEHIND-THE-SCENES PLAYER LEWIS NOW ON CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve E. Lewis has worked his entire adult life in the same office. 
</P>
<P>
 He started in 1965 as a bottom-rung accountant in the Orange County 
auditor-controller's office, earning $545 a month. For the past decade, he has 
been the auditor-controller himself, now commanding $104,582 a year -- 16 times 
his original salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Respected throughout county government for his honesty, integrity and 
willingness to challenge peers in management and budgetary audits, Lewis, 52, 
has long been a low-profile bureaucrat with few enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the weeks since the county became the largest municipality in American 
history to file for bankruptcy, Lewis' name has emerged from the shadows, both 
as the hero who first raised concerns about apparent irregularities in the 
county treasurer's operations and as a defendant in several class-action 
lawsuits by angry bondholders. In addition, his office was included in the 
district attorney's recent seizure of boxloads of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to you when you're putting in 14- and 15-hour days. He puts in those 
hours, and on top of that he's got his name there. There's that added stress," 
said Chuck Hulse, who has worked with Lewis for two decades and served since 
1984 as his chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have given no indication that Lewis is a target of their 
inquiry; speculation is that they were pursuing audit documents in their 
investigation of other county officials. In fact, in audits dating back a dozen 
years, Lewis was a lonely voice raising questions about the county's aggressive 
investment strategy, asking for tighter controls on then-Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron's office and suggesting in his most recent audit, 
released in 1993, that Citron might be bending the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just tired and saddened by it all," Hulse said of his boss. "But in 
terms of 'Did he do his job?' he feels like he did. We're satisfied that we did 
our best. We're only scared about what's going to happen to the county because 
of all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 As auditor-controller, Lewis oversees about 450 employees and a budget of 
nearly $22 million. His office prepares the county's financial statements, does 
accounting and disburses funds for every department, and conducts periodic 
audits -- both budgetary and managerial -- for every county program. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Corona, Lewis is a lifelong Californian who received a bachelor's 
degree in accounting from San Diego State University in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to be interviewed for this story. But those who have worked 
closely with or for him describe Lewis as a casual manager who answers his own 
phone whenever he's not on it, and insists that employees call him by his first 
name. His reputation around the Civic Center is as shiny as the row of 14 
plaques from the Government Finance Officers Assn. that line the entryway to 
his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's straight arrow. Maybe the original straight arrow," said County 
Clerk-Recorder Gary A. Granville. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis emerged at the top of a cadre of administrators -- including John Wayne 
Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier, budget director Fred Branca, General Services 
Agency chief Bert Scott and public administrator Bill Baker -- who grew up in 
county government under the tutelage of longtime Auditor-Controller Vic Heim. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lewis who lasted longest in the auditor-controller's office, Lewis who 
became Heim's right hand when his chief deputy retired, and Lewis who was 
tapped to replace him in 1984. In the three elections since, Lewis, a 
Republican, has never had an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trusted him, and I really still do," Heim said. "In county government, 
there are a number of offices that have to have absolute integrity, and the 
auditor-controller's one of them. We had that reputation, and I think Steve's 
continued that." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bankruptcy filing, Lewis was best known for his conservatism in 
approving expenses -- for himself as well as others. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he reported accepting only $570 in gifts -- $300 of which was the 
estimated value of two nights he spent at a Palm Springs time-share owned by 
his chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous year, he tangled publicly with the pension board after refusing 
to approve $5,000 in receipts -- for opera tickets, dry cleaning, alcoholic 
beverages and extra hotel nights -- from a 26-day European tour by half a dozen 
board members and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Director Patton recalled his own run-in with the tight-fisted 
auditor after he once ordered pizza for dozens of employees who worked through 
the dinner hour enrolling county employees in a new benefits program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I submitted the bill for $75 worth of pizza for 20 people working late, and 
he rejected the bill saying I did not have the authority to order the pizza," 
Patton said with a chuckle. "Myself and the benefits manager had to chip in and 
split the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the job invites controversy. Back in 1987, Lewis and Citron -- also 
a lifelong county employee -- made headlines together when they suggested that 
Sheriff Brad Gates give up his beloved police helicopters to save the county 
$1.5 million. In the county's bankruptcy, Lewis is named as a defendant in 
several lawsuits that accuse a broad sweep of county officials of misleading 
investors about the risks of the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has often been the bearer of bad budgetary news to the Board of 
Supervisors, a job few envy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's stood up to the board. It's kind of hard to do that," Granville said. "I 
wouldn't do it. He tells them things the board doesn't necessarily want to 
hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Branca, the budget director, echoed Granville's admiration for his longtime 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people around the county say we really need him. While we don't 
always agree with him, we really need the standards he represents," Branca said 
of Lewis. "Regardless of the kind of pressure he may feel will be brought to 
bear on him . . . he stood up for his principle. He did what had to be 
done."ORANGE COUNTY

 Low profile: A planned groundbreaking ceremony for a new county fire station 
in Newport Beach was canceled this week by county and Irvine Co. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of Fire Station No. 52 on Newport Coast Drive, next to an Irvine 
Co. development, will proceed on schedule. But in light of the financial 
crisis, officials decided it was best to move forward without the pomp and 
circumstance of a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just decided it wasn't a good use of time or energy to celebrate the 
groundbreaking, given the county's situation right now," Irvine Co. spokeswoman 
Dawn McCormick said.

 The one day of Christmas: The holiday weekend will bring a welcome respite for 
county officials who have been working practically nonstop since the bond 
crisis exploded three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No emergency Board of Supervisors meetings are scheduled this weekend. Workers 
who put their holiday plans on hold because of the crisis said they'll use the 
time off to do last-minute Christmas shopping and spend time with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty excited," said Nancy Swanson, a staffer in the clerk of the 
board's office, who hasn't had a day off since Dec. 6. Instead of shopping for 
gifts, Swanson spent the last two weekends at the Hall of Administration, 
scheduling special board meetings.

 Not in the job description: For local elected officials, the crisis has turned 
part-time jobs into day-and-night obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last three weeks, I have probably had less than four hours of 
sleep each night as we're trying to understand the depth of the problem," said 
Tom Burnham, president of the Irvine Unified School District Board of 
Education. "When you have a full-time job, this is the equivalent of another 
full-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed that crisis has come to dominate their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is taking our full attention," said Orange Mayor Joanne Coontz. "I don't 
have any Christmas decorations, no Christmas tree, no nothing. I've pared it 
down to the essentials. I've not been able to do any of the normal things you 
do during Christmas at home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's the spirit: The threat of massive layoffs so close to Christmas has 
spawned some gallows humor on the part of county workers. On Thursday, one 
county employee smoking a cigarette outside the assessor's office broke into 
song. The tune was from "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas." But the 
lyrics had a twist: "It's beginning to look a lot like cutbacks," he crooned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helping hand: In response to announcements of layoffs, the Orange County 
Federal Credit Union wants to soften the blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit union officials said Friday that they will work on a one-on-one basis 
with members to help restructure their debts, consolidate loans and lower 
payments on existing loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we're doing our part . . . to sort of ease whatever news may come 
out," said Errol Griffin, the credit union's executive vice president. "We 
don't know what that news will be."

DEBATE OVER INS CHECKPOINTS INTENSIFIES; IMMIGRATION: FEWER ARRESTS AT SAN 
CLEMENTE, TEMECULA SITES RAISE DOUBTS ON EFFECTIVENESS. OFFICIALS SAY THEY 
REMAIN VITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of illegal immigrant arrests at two inland checkpoints north of San 
Diego has dropped under Operation Gatekeeper, providing fuel for those who 
contend that the checkpoints should be scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in Congress have argued that the checkpoints in San Clemente and Temecula 
serve no purpose and are an imposition on commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the U.S. Border Patrol insists that they are essential to a 
multilayered enforcement strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service has been conducting experiments to 
determine if the checkpoints do in fact have any effect on the level of illegal 
immigration. These involve closing one of the stations for a period of time and 
then reopening it. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente station was closed for the first five weeks of Operation 
Gatekeeper, which began Oct. 1. Since reopening, arrests there were down 62% 
from the same period last year, the Border Patrol says. The station has 95 
agents who make an average of 29 arrests a day. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temecula, which was open for the entire 11 weeks of Gatekeeper, 
apprehensions were down 52%, according to the agency. Its 75 agents averaged 23 
arrests per day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what the figures mean long term for the checkpoints. An INS 
report on the issue is due this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoints are controversial. Gustavo De La Vina, former chief of the San 
Diego Border Patrol, concedes that smugglers can easily avoid the checkpoints 
and that they are impractical during bad weather and on weekend evenings when 
traffic flows become heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, weekend evenings are also prime time for illegal immigrants to 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, De La Vina and others still believe the checkpoints are valuable for 
making drug seizures and as a last line of defense against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) has pushed for closure of the checkpoints 
unless they are kept open 24 hours a day. Under normal conditions, they are 
open only at certain times. 
</P>
<P>
 With Operation Gatekeeper, which added new agents and equipment along the most 
porous section of the border separating San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, arrests 
dropped 19% in the first month and 40% in the second month.

ANAHEIM MAN DIES IN JAIL HOSPITAL WARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inmate suffering heroin withdrawal died Friday in custody at Orange County 
Jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Anaheim man, who was not identified pending notification of 
family, collapsed after sitting up in bed in a jail hospital ward, said Lt. Dan 
Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, housed at the ward because of his withdrawal symptoms, had been 
charged with petty theft in Fullerton, Martini said. It was not clear how long 
he was jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office was investigating the death, as it does all 
jail deaths.

FEDCO, REMINGTON TO PAY FINE, STOP SELLING PEN KNIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fedco Inc. and Remington Products Co. agreed to pay $50,000 in penalties and 
to stop selling writing pens that contain a small, hidden knife blade, the 
Orange County district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that the device, Remington's Classic Writing Pen Knife, 
is a concealed weapon.The pens were sold in Fedco's Shaver Shops, which are 
operated by Remington. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the district attorney's office, the devices appear to be 
conventional ballpoint pens, but the upper portion conceals a 2 1/2-inch knife 
blade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal for anyone in California to possess or sell a device "that is 
designed to be a stabbing instrument which is exposed by mechanical action," 
the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the district attorney's major fraud and consumer protection unit 
filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Fedco and Remington. Fedco 
immediately removed the pen from the 10 Southern California stores where it was 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Matthew A. Ross, director of stores for Fedco, said the product, 
which sells for $6.87, was removed because Fedco "didn't want to sell something 
that's not legal." The consumer protection unit later won a temporary 
restraining order and then a preliminary injunction against the pen's sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Fedco could not be reached for comment Friday.

BREA OLINDA'S STREAK STOPPED BY WOODBRIDGE; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: WARRIORS WIN, 
51-33, TO TAKE TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS TITLE AND END LADYCATS' STRING AT 65. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County girls' basketball has long been colored by the green uniforms of 
Brea Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, in the appropriately named Tournament of Champions, Woodbridge 
administered a dye job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, ranked No. 1 in the county this season but long the bridesmaid 
to Brea in recognition and reputation, scored a 51-33 victory over the Ladycats 
at Santa Barbara High. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the play of Angela Burgess, Woodbridge's 6-foot-4 senior, the Warriors 
were able make a bit of history by stopping Brea's winning streak at 65 games. 
Burgess finished with 23 points, but had 17 at halftime -- which was the exact 
margin of Woodbridge's lead, 29-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (9-0) whipped passes to Burgess from every angle, and she 
responded -- making eight of 14 against defenders Dawn Metz (6-1) and Stephanie 
Wettlin (5-11). 
</P>
<P>
 "They were well-coached and obviously the better ball team tonight," Brea 
Coach Jeff Sink said. "We were overmatched inside -- we played hard to the 
buzzer -- but their inside game was truly devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea (11-1) outrebounded Woodbridge, 11-8, in the first quarter, but was 
unable to keep it up; offensive rebounds were rare, and the Warriors finished 
with a 35-30 rebounding edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best thing that's happened to me all year," said Burgess, whose 
previous high game this season was 18 points. "I wanted to play Brea ever since 
my (sophomore) year when we played them and lost (61-28). 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping they would beat (Atherton) Sacred Heart and (Fresno) Clovis 
West. They're a great team and we wanted to see how we matched up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea, ranked No. 2 in the county after losing three starters who helped the 
Ladycats to four consecutive State titles, made their case for No. 1 earlier 
this week, beating teams on consecutive nights ranked sixth and seventh in a 
national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The end didn't come against a national power or in a State title game, but 
against another county team that was too tall, too deep and too talented. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea had a 7-4 lead early, but Burgess' basket underneath tied the score, 9-9. 
Melanie Pearson's 15-footer gave Woodbridge the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea committed seven second-quarter turnovers to dig its hole. The Ladycats 
cut the lead to seven, 38-31, with 4:20 left in the game. Then Burgess scored 
inside -- and Brea scored only one more basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson had nine points and eight rebounds and Erin Stovall had eight points 
for Woodbridge. Brea got eight points from Kiyoko Miller and seven from 
Jennifer Saari. The Ladycats made only 12 of 44 (27%) from the floor; 
Woodbridge made 22 of 48 (46%). 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to pick one game to win, this is not the game you bet the ranch 
on," Sink said. "Don't get me wrong -- we wanted to win in the worst way -- but 
the one to win is in March." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea and Woodbridge could meet again in the Southern California Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Brea's first loss to an Orange County team since March 3, 1987 -- when 
Katella beat the Ladycats, 59-56, in overtime, the Southern Section Division 
3-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge's victory also snapped the Southern Section's second-longest 
winning streak. It began Jan. 9, 1993, with an 81-72 victory over Fair Oaks Del 
Campo in the Orange County Challenge; believe it or not, Brea had lost its two 
previous games, first to Thousand Oaks, 59-51, in the championship of the 
Tournament of Champions, and then to Orem (Utah) Mountain View, 59-46, in the 
first round of the OC Challenge.

YANKEES FAIL TO OFFER ABBOTT A CONTRACT; BASEBALL: FORMER ANGEL PITCHER BECOMES 
A FREE AGENT, BUT A MOVE BACK TO ANAHEIM IS IN DOUBT BECAUSE OF THE TEAM'S 
TIGHT BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Jim Abbott, a former Angel who never lived up to expectations in New 
York despite throwing a no-hitter in 1993, became a free agent Friday when the 
Yankees didn't offer him a contract for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation is that he'll find his way back to California. But the Angels, 
already operating on a self-imposed tight budget, would probably have to do 
some creative financing in order to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a trade of several high-salaried players, it would seem impossible to 
pay Abbott what he would want. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees declined to give Abbott a qualifying offer of at least $3,052,500, 
10% more than his 1994 salary, the amount required to keep him a restricted 
free agent under the rules owners imposed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee General Manager Gene Michael also failed to offer a contract to 
infielder Randy Velarde, making him a free agent, and made a qualifying offer 
of $5.83 million to 1993 American League Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell, 
obtained Dec. 14 from the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just thought the money that we would have to spend for them was over their 
market value, and we couldn't attend to that," Michael said. "We just didn't 
think the value was there for that kind of money. Both of them are free to 
negotiate now with anyone, and that includes us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels traded Abbott to the Yankees on Dec. 6, 1992, for J.T. Snow, Russ 
Springer and Jerry Nielsen. The previous two years he had earned-run averages 
of 2.77 and 2.89, and he went 18-11 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he was 11-14 with a 4.37 ERA for New York in 1993, and pitched a 
no-hitter Sept. 4, one of his few moments of Yankee glory. He was 9-8 with a 
4.55 ERA in the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott would have been a free agent, anyway, if the union hadn't struck Aug. 
12. His filing was rejected in October when owners claimed he lacked the 
necessary six years of service time, and the players' association filed a 
grievance on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the Angels declined to offer contracts to pitchers Mark Leiter 
and Bob Patterson, making them free agents. They tendered contracts for 1995 to 
28 players, including designated hitter Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter appeared in 40 games, including seven starts, with a 4-7 record and 
4.72 ERA. Patterson made 47 appearances, with a 2-3 record and 4.07 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also said they have agreed to terms with left-hander Ken Patterson 
on a minor-league contract. Patterson, 30, pitched two-thirds of an inning last 
season before tearing a ligament in his left elbow, which required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Several players agreed to contracts minutes before owners imposed the salary 
cap. Teams announced the deals on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Infielder Bip Roberts, who was a free agent, got the biggest deal, a 
$4.8-million, two-year contract with San Diego. Harold Baines, another free 
agent, returned to Baltimore for $1.6 million in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Orlando Merced agreed to a $2-million, one-year deal with 
Pittsburgh. St. Louis signed two players to one-year deals, infielder Geronimo 
Pena for $770,000 and outfielder Brian Jordan for $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Scott Servais and Houston agreed to a one-year contract. Infielder 
Jeff Reboulet and Minnesota agreed to a two-year deal, and catcher Steve Decker 
and Florida agreed to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston let go pitchers Tony Fossas and Chris Nabholz, and Detroit got rid of 
four players, pitchers Mike Gardiner and Gene Harris, outfielder Junior Felix 
and catcher Chad Kreuter. Atlanta released pitchers Derek Lilliquist, Gregg 
Olson and Mike Stanton.

REBUILT SCHOLL CANYON COURSE HAS THE SMELL OF A WINNER; GOLF: LANDFILL UNDER 
ORIGINAL LAYOUT WAS A HEALTH HAZARD. NEW COURSE DRAWS PRAISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scholl Canyon Golf Course was dying. The body was decaying and it was hardly a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, golfers could smell Scholl Canyon before they reached the 
facility's parking lot. The stench from the course, built on a landfill site in 
the foothills overlooking Los Angeles, was almost indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyes watered. Nasal passages burned.  
</P>
<P>
 "The air was so rank, so foul, so thick, that you had to use an extra club to 
reach the green," said Kelly Magee of Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years in mothballs and a $4-million face lift, Scholl Canyon 
re-opened in November. Replete with state-of-the-art technology to handle the 
decomposition problem, Scholl's makeover is startling to golfers like Magee, 
who played the old course way back when. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Old Scholl) was flat and boring," said Magee, who has played the new layout 
a half-dozen times. "It didn't have any trees. It was uninteresting." 
</P>
<P>
 The new version definitely has its entertainment value, particularly on the 
back nine, which includes a 20-acre mountain-top parcel that was annexed when 
the layout was expanded to 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Any way you slice it, any course is good news around Glendale, if not 
elsewhere. In fact, Scholl is the first course to open in the Valley region 
since Camarillo's private Spanish Hills Country Club was unveiled in June 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there's an asterisk attached to the former. Scholl, the sequel, 
technically isn't new -- the old course is down there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholl I was a 40-acre, nine-hole course built on a city dump. Like a field of 
fruit gone rotten, it was plowed under. Now this, from fallow to fertile, in 
all of a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months ago, the City of Glendale signed a developmental agreement with 
the American Golf Corp., which agreed to rebuild the site in exchange for a 
40-year operational lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a great deal? There was considerable work to be done. After all, it 
isn't every day that a course is condemned.  
</P>
<P>
 The place has always had potential. The views from Scholl are spectacular and 
on a clear day golfers can see Santa Catalina Island, the Griffith Park 
Observatory and the L.A. skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 But at old Scholl, clear days -- not to mention every other day -- were 
hazardous to your health. In 1990, four years after the facility first opened 
its doors, the Air Quality Management District shut down Scholl because of 
methane gas leakage. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane, caused by the decomposition of the landfill matter, is a nearly 
odorless, colorless gas of high flammability.  
</P>
<P>
 The end result was that John Q. Public Links was left high and dry in Glendale 
for years. The community's other courses, Chevy Chase and Oakmont country 
clubs, are private and pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, interest in the resuscitation project was high, said Brian 
Bode, the head pro at Scholl Canyon. Despite four years in limbo, the Scholl 
Canyon men's and women's clubs never folded. On Nov. 13, reopening day, 300 
golfers showed up to play, Bode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Players found that the course had been completely overhauled. Scholl II is an 
18-hole, 60-acre executive course with a par of 60. It also features a 
34-stall, lighted driving range. While it has its quirks, Scholl has an 
understated charm that should attract plenty of beginners and intermediate 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholl didn't exactly break new ground, if you will. The phenomenon of 
erecting golf courses on landfills is fast becoming commonplace. In California, 
where urban land is increasingly rare and expensive, cities can save a fortune 
by recycling acreage they already own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a definite trend," Bode said. "Places don't always have a 
lot of better options." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southland courses built on landfill sites include Industry Hills 
Sheraton Resort in the City of Industry, MountainGate Country Club at the crest 
of the Sepulveda Pass and River Ridge Golf Course in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry Hills, which is 15 years old, is the Southland's biggest landfill 
success story. The public facility has two top-flight 18-hole courses, plus 
tennis and equestrian facilities spread over 750 acres. Methane is used to heat 
and cool its buildings. Effluent irrigates the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The stench and methane leakage weren't the only dilemma at Scholl I. Numerous 
structural defects developed. Subsidence was a problem on the greens. Fissures 
and sinkholes appeared in many places, not to mention the occasional flash 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have fissures open and somebody would flip a lighted cigarette in it and 
a little fire would break out," said Bob Mezak, who supervised the project for 
the Glendale Parks, Recreation and Community Services Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no such problems at Scholl II, Mezak said. And they've 
actively sought them out. The AQMD requires the course to take daily methane 
readings with a portable probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeover wasn't limited to above-ground features. The city installed a 
pipeline system to collect the methane, which is channeled to the Grayson Power 
Plant and used to generate electricity for Glendale. Water used at Scholl is 
recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in methane collection should all but eliminate the possibility of 
future shutdowns, Mezak said. As insurance, layers of plastic have been placed 
beneath Scholl's greens to ensure that nobody spontaneously combusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction began last November. More than 300,000 cubic yards of dirt were 
redistributed. After the methane pipelines were installed, the old course was 
covered with another six to 10 feet of topsoil. In several areas, a layer of 
clay was added below the topsoil to help seal the landfill. Some of the dirt 
came from Metrolink tunneling projects. 
</P>
<P>
 By next summer, the place should be bustling and in full bloom, Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bent grass greens and Bermuda fairways will have matured. By then, an 
elevator will be available to help golfers with the daunting hike to the 12th 
tee, situated atop a crest. The snack bar will have its beer license. New 
electric carts, with centrifugal clutches, will have arrived "to prevent 
freewheeling down the hills," Mezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't have players careening off the cliffs. Yet if feedback can be measured 
in terms of turnout, Scholl is a runaway winner. Bode said play has steadily 
increased, despite the onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been surprising," Bode said. "They never forgot (we were here)."

AILING HERNANDEZ STILL LEADS SONORA'S BALANCED OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This may be the best Sonora boys' basketball team Mike Murphy has put 
together. But the Raiders also have learned that reputation means nothing 
unless you back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Murphy was ecstatic about Friday's 66-56 victory over Los Alamitos. 
It was more than the county's fifth-ranked team beating No. 7; to Murphy's 
thinking, it was beating the kind of quality opponent Sonora will see in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to beat teams like this," Murphy said. "They have a great program. I 
told the kids before the game 'I'm not going to outcoach (the Griffins') Steve 
Brooks, who's forgotten more basketball than I'll ever know, so you're going to 
have to outplay them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It took Sonora (9-2) more than a half to gain control of Los Alamitos (8-3). 
Trailing, 37-32, with five minutes to go in the third quarter, the Raiders went 
on a 28-14 run to go up by nine with less than three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it by spreading around the offense. Sergio Hernandez, who was 
doubtful before the game because of stomach sickness and who felt lightheaded 
at halftime, still managed 18 points; Chad Fister had 17 points; Josh Lein 
scored 13 in the second half, and Craig Clark contributed 16 points and 10 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling people about Sergie and how good he is," Murphy said. "And 
Lein is only a sophomore, but he is really coming on." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora also was tough on defense, forcing seven of the Griffins' 12 turnovers 
in the second half. The seven-foot Clark had three blocked shots but affected 
several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Cory Johnson led all scorers with 19 points. Forward Jeremy Vandervoet 
had 17, 14 in the first half; Vandervoet made only one of four shots in the 
second half, and that came with about 10 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had about seven possessions where we didn't score," Brooks said. 
"Partially it was their defense and partially because we didn't execute our 
offense. Jeremy is a big part of our offense and we have to get the ball to 
him. They also changed their defense on him in the second half, but we didn't 
get the job done."

TITANS' LUCK RUNS OUT IN LOSS TO SAN FRANCISCO; BASKETBALL: FULLERTON FALLS, 
90-82, IN OVERTIME DESPITE FIVE PLAYERS SCORING IN DOUBLE FIGURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's recent good fortune in close games disappeared in a 
90-82 overtime loss to San Francisco Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans led, 74-71, when guard James French made two free throws with 22 
seconds left in regulation, but with 17 seconds to go, San Francisco guard 
Gerald Walker buried a three-point shot that sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 French had a chance to win the game with a jump shot from outside in the final 
seconds, but it bounced off, and the Titans faltered badly in overtime. The 
Titans fell to 3-4. San Francisco is 5-6. Walker, who went over 1,000 points 
for his career in his previous game, scored a career-high 30 to go with six 
assists and five steals. He was clearly the game's dominating force down the 
stretch, scoring his team's first five points in the overtime. John Duggan's 
three-point jump shot put the Dons six points ahead, 82-76, and the Titans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the luck just didn't go our way the way it has in the last two 
games," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking said. "We still didn't shoot well, and they 
certainly got hot at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 40.9% from the field, compared to 46.5% for the Dons, who hit 
55% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to beat a good team when you shoot 40%," Hawking said. "I thought 
they were a good team. They're certainly ranked ahead of us in the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 Five Titans scored in double figures, but the balance didn't help. Center 
Winston Peterson, the Big West scoring leader, led the Titans with 17 points. 
Chuck Overton and Chris Dade each had 15, David Frigout a career-high 14 and 
Chris St. Clair 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, weren't as solid defensively as they had been in their 
two earlier victories against Nevada Las Vegas and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need to shore up defensively," Hawking said. "We gave up some 
penetration all the way to the rim in this game. We gave them too many easy 
layups. Actually, though, I thought Dade and French did a decent job on Walker 
until he really broke loose there at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons were up, 71-67, with just under three minutes left in regulation, but 
Peterson worked San Francisco center Art Wallace for his fifth foul and his two 
free throws along with St. Clair's three-pointer gave Fullerton a 72-71 edge 
with just under two minutes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons missed twice from outside before French controlled the rebound, took 
a foul and hit two free throws. But then Walker connected on the big 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really good win for us, coming on the road," San Francisco Coach 
Jim Brovelli said. "It was similar to a league game for us on the road. It was 
that kind of atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton got off to a good start, running up a 13-6 lead on two free throws 
by Peterson and Frigout's layup. The Dons came back to tie the score at 17-17, 
but Fullerton got its inside game in gear with two straight baskets by Peterson 
to lead, 29-20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans led by 10 points late in the first half, but the Dons scored twice 
just before the end of the first half, once on a steal and layup by Walker that 
cut the deficit to 38-32 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 41.9% in the first half, helped by Frigout's four baskets in 
four attempts.

BAKER FINALLY REACHES MILESTONE; BASKETBALL: UC IRVINE COACH GETS 100TH VICTORY 
WHEN ANTEATERS EDGE ST. MARY'S, 69-66, AT BREN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Baker would be the first to tell you it was too long coming and it was no 
work of art, but his 100th victory as a head coach will provide UC Irvine with 
a merry Christmas break and its first winning record going into January in 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters reached the 4-3 mark Friday night with a down-and-dirty 69-66 
nonconference victory over St. Mary's in front of 1,846 at Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not very nice how we did it," point guard Raimonds Miglinieks mused, 
"but we played hard and, you know how they say, a 'W' is a 'W.' It will help 
make Christmas good." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it was more a battle of wills than athleticism, a game heavily 
littered with missed layups, free throws and opportunities, not to mention all 
the bodies strewn on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the kind of game Anteater fans are used to seeing slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we would have given up," forward Mark Odsather said, "but this is 
a different team. We have confidence that we're going to find a way to win, so 
we're finding ways to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine trailed by six after a little more than a minute and led by as much as 
five early in the second half, but a basket or two was all that separated the 
teams for the rest of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's (4-4) had a 63-60 lead with two minutes remaining. Miglinieks made 
one of two free throws and then Gael forward Brent Farris was called for 
traveling on a fast break. Freshman forward Kevin Simmons, who finished with 14 
points and 10 rebounds, was fouled while attempting a dunk and made both free 
throws to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 With slightly more than a minute to play, Farris was called for traveling 
again, this time working for a shot underneath. Miglinieks then beat a 
double-team and passed to Michael Tate at the top of the key. Tate fed Khalid 
Channell, who slammed it home, was fouled and sank the free throw to put the 
Anteaters ahead, 66-63. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuri Williams made one of two free throws and then St. Mary's Chris Johnson 
hit a three-pointer with 15.8 seconds left. But Chris Brown made two free 
throws and Johnson's desperation three-point fling at the buzzer hit halfway up 
the backboard and bounced away. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Mary's did a good job defensively and we had to make some adjustments at 
halftime," Baker said. "We rebounded well and defended pretty well. They only 
scored six points in the last 4 1/2 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's perimeter shooters continue to struggle. Odsather, Brown and freshman 
Brian Keefe were a combined six of 20 from the field. And the Anteaters' poor 
free-throw shooting -- they were 10 of 22 from the line before making six of 
their last seven in the game's final 1:33 -- almost cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the addition of Tate and Simmons has given Irvine a new dimension and a 
new level of confidence. Tate had 11 points in the first half and finished with 
a team-high 15 points and 13 rebounds. Last year, the Anteaters usually only 
won when Brown made eight or 10 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half, we didn't get the (outside) shots," Baker said. "In the 
second half, we got them but didn't make them. If we could just make a couple 
of outside shots, we would make life a lot easier for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, for one, doesn't especially mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows we can play bad on offense and still win," he said. "We still 
haven't got it all together yet."

MAINTAINING A HEALTHY PRACTICE; COSTA MESA DOCTOR TREATS POOR ON VISITS TO 
MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several times a year, Dr. Ron Rothman steels himself for one of those really 
tough working days. One of those days when hundreds of patients are lined up at 
a tiny clinic, when they have to be rushed through without a break because so 
many more are waiting outside. Another day when the equipment is outmoded, the 
pay nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman, a 58-year-old specialist in rehabilitative medicine, is one of a 
small team of American medics who fly to the Mexican state of Sinaloa the first 
Friday of each month from October to June, bearing medication, vitamins and an 
urge to help. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always the same group, and Rothman, who has been suffering heart 
problems recently, is not always able to make the trip. But at least a few 
times a year -- most recently, on Dec. 2 -- the Costa Mesa resident, a doctor 
at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Harbor City, musters the energy for a sixth 
day of work. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returns, he said, "even though I'm physically tired, I always feel up. 
It's a feeling of helping people who can't get this kind of care." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the people drawn to the Red Cross clinic in the small town of 
Ahome, where the team goes each month, are happy to see a physician. They begin 
lining up at 4 a.m., dressed in their Sunday best, and wait patiently for hours 
to get their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman particularly remembers one patient from his most recent trip, a 
9-year-old boy, nearly blind, accompanied by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an agricultural worker who brought her son in to have his eyes 
examined," Rothman said. The two had to wait until nearly the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the boy's blindness was caused by a parasite eating away at 
the retina of his eyes. There is no treatment; all Rothman could do was advise 
the mother to keep the boy in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, Rothman said, the visits go like that, with patients whose ailments 
require treatment beyond what he can accomplish in the clinic. Sometimes they 
need surgery, and not everyone can be brought to the United States to receive 
it. Sometimes they have cancer and his only weapon is pain relievers. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does have antibiotics for the infections, he said, and insulin for the 
diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the December trip, Rothman traveled with group leader Dr. Jule Lamm, a 
71-year-old Brentwood optometrist, and Dr. Donald Ham, an ophthalmologist from 
Las Cruces, N.M., who flew to California to join the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typically grueling trip. The three piled into Lamm's single-engine 
Cessna 182 at Santa Monica Airport and flew four hours to Guaymas. After a 
night's stay at a hotel, they flew to Los Mochis, where an area resident 
transported them by an old ambulance 20 miles north to Ahome. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9 a.m., when the trio arrived, more than 300 people, drawn by announcements 
made over the radio, were sitting on stone benches or under trees and leaning 
against pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lamm concentrates on eye examinations, bringing glasses with him on each 
trip, the accompanying doctors act as general practitioners for the day, 
treating whatever comes their way. 
</P>
<P>
 They work at breakneck speed. That Saturday afternoon, Rothman saw more than 
100 people with ailments that included diabetes, arthritis, infections and 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was well past sunset when Rothman, Ham and Lamm got back to the hotel in 
Guaymas; the next morning, they flew back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamm and Rothman met more than a decade ago through a mutual friend. Since 
then, Rothman has made more than 40 trips to Ahome with Lamm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan on continuing," Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who know Rothman describe him as friendly and caring. Those who have 
seen him work say he has an excellent bedside manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that he really enjoys taking care of the people," Lamm said. 
"He's a doctor's doctor. In this age, everyone is so specialized. Dr. Rothman 
is from the old school -- he wants to do as much as he can. I'd love to have a 
half-dozen Dr. Rothmans every time I go." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rothman, a graduate of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York 
City, was born in 1936 in New York to immigrants from Transylvania, Romania. He 
was 4 years old when World War II broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jews, Rothman's family suffered catastrophe under Nazi occupation. His 
father's entire extended family, 67 relatives, died in concentration camps, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the stronger memories I have is my father going into mourning every 
time he heard a relative was killed," Rothman said, rubbing his forehead at the 
recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from medical school in 1961, Rothman came to California for a 
residency at the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Hospital in Westwood. 
In Los Angeles, he met his wife of 29 years, Lilyana. 
</P>
<P>
 The two married in 1965, then went to South America, where he served four 
years as a Peace Corps doctor. In Uruguay he organized a public health program 
in that country that was successful in curbing a disease spread by 
tapeworm-infested dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple have four grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilan, 27, is currently in Chile studying medicine. Sarita, 25, lives in 
Jerusalem. She went to Israel to study art and a number of her works hang in 
the hallway of Rothman's home. Yehudit Miriam, 22, is a student at USC majoring 
in psychology and communications, and Avi, 17, is a senior at Estancia High 
School in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman says that despite the exhaustion, the work he does in Mexico is what 
it means to be a doctor. His next trip to Ahome will be in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The memories of the atrocities suffered by his family under the Nazis fuels 
his desire to help others, Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had a sense you had to make the world a better place to live in."

WOMAN SEEKS MARROW FROM RETARDED SISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County judge asked to decide if a severely retarded woman may donate 
bone marrow to save her sister's life said Friday that this might be the first 
such case in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley on Friday continued a hearing into the 
matter for a week to hear from the donor's physician. But observing that "there 
is no California law on the issue," Woolley said he will not wait for the state 
Legislature to act, because a woman's life is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolley said he recognizes a need for haste, since a City of Hope physician 
has determined that 53-year-old Kathleen Spence of Huntington Park suffers from 
a rare and particularly aggressive form of leukemia and can survive only two 
more years at most without the transplant if she receives chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court declaration, Dr. Ashwani K. Agarwal said that in his opinion a bone 
marrow transplant from her sister, whose marrow is a perfect match, would give 
Spence a 40% chance of an "absolute cure." 
</P>
<P>
 Agarwal also said bone marrow donation is "an extremely low-risk procedure" 
that can be done while the donor is under general anesthesia by injecting a 
needle into the hipbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence's sister, Patricia Bourke, 39, who was found to be retarded when she 
was about 3, is unable to care for herself and has "the mental capacity of a 
toddler," according to court records. She lives in a residential nursing 
facility in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea to the court to allow the transplant has been made by the sisters' 
mother, Frances Bourke, 80, of Huntington Park, who has been her younger 
daughter's legal guardian and conservator since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Bourke said in court records that her three sons would be willing to 
donate bone marrow to their dying sister, but theirs is incompatible with hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother said she believes that it is in Patricia Bourke's best interest to 
help, both because she has a close attachment to her older sister and because 
if Spence survives, she can help watch over her sister when her mother dies. 
She noted that two of Bourke's three brothers live outside Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the mother said in court records, "There is also no doubt in my 
mind, based upon my understanding of the nature of all my children, that this 
procedure is something that Patty would absolutely consent to if she had the 
mental and legal ability to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted Friday at her Huntington Park home, Frances Bourke said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not hurt Patty in the least. Her bone marrow will grow back, and it 
is the only possible way of a cure. We can only hope and pray things will turn 
out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Spence said in the documents that she and her younger sister "have 
always had a very special relationship." She said as a teen-ager she took 
almost motherly care of Bourke, 14 years her junior. Later, she said, she 
visited the retarded girl when she was sent to a residential school in San 
Bernardino, intervening to have her transferred to another institution when she 
felt her sister was being mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought to court because while Frances Bourke has the authority 
to make decisions for her daughter, Patricia is a ward of the court. Because 
this decision was so unusual, her mother had to seek its guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara J. Mandell, the lawyer representing the mother, said that although the 
question of bone marrow donations by the mentally retarded is new in 
California, courts in other states, including Kentucky, Texas, New York, 
Connecticut and Massachusetts, have authorized transplants of bone marrow and 
kidneys between siblings when the donor was mentally incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolley said his decision will not be binding in the future on any other 
California court determining the legality of bone marrow donations by the 
mentally disabled. But he said if his decision is appealed, it could lead to a 
precedent-setting decision by a higher state court. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Friday representing Patricia Bourke was Jim Simanek, an attorney with 
Protection & Advocacy Inc., a nonprofit organization serving the interests of 
the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Simanek told the judge that one California statute permits courts to stand in 
for the mentally ill in deciding what they would want to do with their money 
and other material possessions, but not their bone marrow or kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolley held over the hearing on court jurisdiction until Friday. It is 
important, he told the conservator, that he first receive evaluations from 
Patricia Bourke's personal physician and a court investigator that will satisfy 
him that she is not capable of choosing whether she wants to help her sister.

TOLLWAY CONSTRUCTION HALTED; TRANSPORTATION: AN INJUNCTION STOPS GRADING IN 
LAGUNA CANYON ON THE FINAL LEG OF THE ROAD UNTIL A JAN. 5 HEARING. FIVE MORE 
PROTESTERS ARE ARRESTED AT THE WORK SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic turn of events, a federal judge Friday ordered a halt to the 
bulldozers that have been clearing a swath through Laguna Canyon for a tollway, 
work begun just this week after more than a year of legal delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency injunction issued by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
accomplished what three days of protests against the San Joaquin Tollway failed 
to do: stop the bulldozers in the environmentally sensitive canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very significant because it's the only thing that stands between 
continued devastation of the canyon and the possibility the canyon can be 
preserved," said Joel R. Reynolds, attorney for two environmental groups that 
won Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction halts grading on the final leg of the 17-mile tollway until 
Jan. 5, when project opponents go to court to fight a ruling issued Tuesday 
that allowed the bulldozers to roll. That ruling, by the 9th Circuit Court, 
dissolved a prior injunction that had banned construction for all but one day 
over 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Work immediately resumed Tuesday on a 4.6-mile section between El Toro Road 
and Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading prompted four days of protests during which opponents picketed and 
chained themselves to bulldozers. Five protesters were arrested Friday 
afternoon and booked on suspicion of trespassing and resisting arrest, bringing 
the week's total to 21 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four days after winning the right to restart the long-stalled project, 
officials in charge of the road-building job found themselves whipsawed by an 
abrupt new stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," said William C. Woollett Jr., executive officer for the 
Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies. "The San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor will create jobs and relieve traffic congestion, two 
things that are positive for Orange County's economy. This project is needed 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, bulldozers already managed to clear oak trees and shrubs from most 
of the 175 acres of the disputed stretch. The court action put on hold more 
grading and planned construction next week of abutments for bridges planned 
over El Toro Road, said Lisa Telles, spokeswoman for the tollway agency. 
Construction of the entire tollway is to be completed in March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The new round of court battles and related delays also is certain to raise the 
cost of the project. Delays already have added an additional $8.9 million to 
the original $793-million cost. The tollway agency has paid an additional $2.9 
million in court-related legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the unexpected injunction met with celebratory whoops on Laguna Canyon 
Road during a candlelight vigil that some said originally felt more like a 
funeral for their beloved canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a Santa Claus," said Irvine resident Angelo Vassos, 62, who was 
arrested with his wife on Wednesday after they tied themselves to a bulldozer. 
"I certainly wasn't expecting something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Beth Leeds, whose own separate attempt to stop the grading was rejected 
in Orange County Superior Court this week: "I knew it would happen. It's 
justice . . . The canyon's going to be saved." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sense of triumph was tempered by anger that bulldozers already had 
cleared trees and shrubs from more than three-fourths of the 175 acres in just 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The devastation that has been wrought by the bulldozers these last two or 
three days -- it's just incredible," said Lida Lenney, a former Laguna Beach 
mayor who founded the Laguna Canyon Conservancy, a leading group opposing the 
tollway. "It's not the same place." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds moved to allay fears among allies that irreversible damage already 
has been done to an area that is a habitat for the threatened California 
gnatcatcher. He said plant life in the cleared areas can be regenerated. 
</P>
<P>
 As 60 people gathered for the dusk vigil, towering spotlights in a field 
nearby shone on rows of silent earth movers and freshly graded hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene cast a shadow on the group's newfound hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at this and it's pretty grim" Vassos said. "We have a reprieve, 
(but) when you look at what they've done, it's nothing to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired and we're numb," added Cris Scaglione, 39, of Dana Point. "I 
think I can enjoy Christmas finally."

DONATIONS POUR IN FOR FAMILY ROBBED IN HOME INVASION; CRIME: GUNMEN TERRORIZE 
COUPLE, DAUGHTER, THEN STEAL CAR, VALUABLES AND GIFTS. COMMUNITY TRIES TO 'GIVE 
CHRISTMAS BACK' TO THEM. 
</P>

 Several gunmen tied up and beat a Westminster couple early Friday, ransacked 
their house of Christmas gifts and other valuables, then loaded up the loot and 
fled in the family's BMW, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery prompted an outpouring of support from community members, who 
donated cash and presents in an effort to "give Christmas back to the family," 
Police Lt. Andrew Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a silver lining to every dark cloud, this is it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Officer Gary Hooper said the robbery began about 2 a.m. when as many as 
four men in their 20s entered the family's house in the 14400 block of Strait 
Place through the garage and burst into the bedrooms where the couple and their 
11-year-old daughter were asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants woke up the victims, tied up the parents with duct tape and 
electrical cords and pistol-whipped them, but did not injure the girl, Hooper 
said. They also repeatedly kicked the husband, Thang Nguyen, 38, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept the family at gunpoint while they ransacked the house and opened up 
all the Christmas presents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts, money, jewelry and stereo equipment were then loaded into the 
family's white convertible BMW, license plate number 2WSS617. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a random thing, and anybody could have been a victim," Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men spent about two hours in the house. Police Officer Ron Velez said the 
daughter, who was not tied up, ran to a neighbor for help after the men left 
the house. When the officers arrived, the family was "shaken and in pain," 
Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents were taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center, where they were treated for their injuries and released. Nguyen 
suffered a fracture and internal injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. His 
wife, Chi Vu, 32, suffered lacerations to the top of her head, Velez said. The 
daughter, whose name was withheld, stayed at the hospital with her parents, but 
required no medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no suspects, and no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's brother, Tien Nguyen, said: "The family is very upset right now, and 
they don't want to talk to the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and family members said it is possible that the robbers followed Vu 
home from work at a local restaurant and staked out the house before entering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they had been watching the family for a while," Tien Nguyen said. 
"And when they knew the family had gone to bed, they broke in." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said television reports of the robbery prompted people from as far as 
Santa Monica to contact the Westminster Police Department to donate money and 
gifts to the family. By about 2 p.m., Hall said he had received several hundred 
dollars in cash and dozens of wrapped Christmas gifts, including a brand-new 
mountain bike for the girl, which were later presented to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas is a time for children, and this little girl is in trauma," said 
David Menahem, manager of a bicycle shop who decided to donate the bike after 
seeing the news report. "I was very upset by it, so I wanted to do my part in 
making her happy." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Tony Lam, who helped deliver three large stuffed animals and 
supermarket gift certificates, said Vu told him through an intermediary that 
the family was grateful for the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very appreciative," Lam said. "But they say they are in a state of 
shock. To take away toys from an 11-year-old girl like that -- it's inhuman."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MR. CLAUS SAYS SANTA ISN'T JUST FOR CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus, the secular icon of Christmas, has got religion. St. Nick is 
saying, "God bless you" as well as "Ho, ho, ho," and he's reminding kids not 
only to be nice but also to "say your prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, most of Santa's costumed helpers don't do that -- the mixture in 
today's society might be considered jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 But a religious side is more evident now in a fellow who has been playing 
Santa Claus full time since 1949, has helped six White House occupants greet 
Christmas and antagonized more than one Los Angeles-area neighborhood with his 
lights-ablazing, year-round home decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 White-whiskered Robert George, 71, early this month was accepted as a member 
of Van Nuys' large Church on the Way, a Pentecostal congregation he and Mrs. 
Claus have attended weekly since they moved to Sun Valley 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to go to the Lord if anything happens to me," George said this week 
in his living room, where the television is continually tuned to a religious 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 George probably couldn't have picked a church with a pastor friendlier to 
Santa than the Rev. Jack Hayford. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a religious publication, the minister criticized Christian 
grinches who knock Santa as a character detracting from the religious core of 
Christmas. Hayford said that Santa is a symbol of the Christmas sentiments of 
love and giving. Few children confuse the fun-filled Santa story and the 
Christian story of the birth of Jesus, Hayford wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Hayford cast Robert George's often eccentric, sometimes 
ill-articulated mission into a religious framework during an appearance late 
last month with a red-suited George on the Trinity Broadcasting Network's 
"Praise the Lord" program, hosted by Paul and Jan Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't think that he's Santa Claus, but he knows he was called to play 
that role," Hayford said. "(He) wants to serve humanity by fulfilling the 
symbolic expression of the love of God," said Hayford, a widely admired pastor 
in U. S. evangelical / Pentecostal circles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George has told his story over and over through the years: He had a vision at 
2 a.m. one night in 1949 back in Cozad, Neb., that he was to portray Santa 
Claus. He bought a $7.50 Santa costume and began assuming that identity 
year-round, giving up his barbershop business. In 1956, then-Sen. Carl Curtis 
of Nebraska arranged for George to join White House Christmas ceremonies with 
President Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 The man from the barber pole later was invited to the White House by 
Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Bush -- once during each of their 
terms. He missed Lyndon Johnson. He turned down an invitation from the Reagan 
White House, though not for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "His staff wanted me to wear a blue suit -- a coat and tie!" George said with 
dismay. "They said it would be commercializing Christmas if I wore my red Santa 
suit," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had been commercializing Christmas all these years, I'd be a millionaire 
now," said George, whose twinkling eyes belie a sometimes-precarious livelihood 
based on donations and earnings from appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, times are not easy for Santa, who has been slowed by the effects of 
multiple-bypass heart surgery in 1986 and recurring hospital visits in 1991. 
Mrs. Claus, Stella, his wife of nearly 20 years, worked as a bank auditor in 
Glendale a few years ago but now is retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly in retirement himself, George delights kids at burn centers, residents 
of Skid Row missions and others needing cheerful "ho-ho-hos." He bears donated 
gifts from various sources, including rag dolls made by inmates at the Sybil 
Brand Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 But life has become quieter for George, who has lived in California since 
1960, since he moved to Northridge. His first wife, Fern, died of cancer in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
 While residing in Sierra Madre in 1976, George drew neighborhood complaints 
about his two large, motorized sleighs in the driveway. The city cited him for 
running a business out of his home without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the Georges were living in Anaheim when they opened a Christmas 
museum featuring the sleighs and many of Santa's costumes. "We closed it 
because the rent was too high," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 While living in Glendale in 1986, George was cited for building-code 
violations at his home because of 52,000 lights, 10,000 ornaments, 95 Christmas 
trees, a snow-making machine and other holiday accouterments that were on 
display all year long. Neighbors' protests prompted city action. George sued 
the city, then settled by agreeing to restrict the display to a few weeks a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, his 42-foot-long sleighs and wheeled reindeer have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a modicum of Christmas decorations adorn the front of his rented home in 
Sun Valley, although toys, stuffed animals and memorabilia still fill the 
two-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 George wants it understood that he's always included expressions of faith in 
his message, reminding adults and children alike that Christmas celebrates the 
birth of Jesus. A crucifix on the bedroom door of Mr. and Mrs. Claus bears 
witness to the couple's Greek Orthodox Church heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George said he got serious about religion after surviving heart surgery and a 
"near-death experience" in which he said he saw Jesus on a heavenly throne. But 
after joining Church on the Way, he said, "I got more saved." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of attending the Van Nuys church was first suggested to George by one 
of its members, entertainer Pat Boone. Boone said he heard on local television 
about "Santa" hospitalized at St. Joseph's in Burbank, and asked to visit him. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone and his wife, Shirley, anointed George with a vial of oil in a prayerful 
rite at his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had fallen on hard times, so we did what we could materially," Boone said 
this week. "I recommended that he try Church on the Way if he didn't have a 
church home." 
</P>
<P>
 Another couple from the congregation kept in contact with the Georges, but it 
wasn't until Mr. and Mrs. Claus moved from Glendale to Sun Valley that they 
started going to Hayford's church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found Robert George to be a very sensitive and good-hearted man," said 
Boone, who also interviewed him on a Trinity Broadcasting program a couple of 
years ago.

4 ARRESTED IN SERIES OF VALLEY FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERIES; CRIME: TWO MEN AND TWO

 Four suspects have been arrested in the string of follow-home robberies that 
have victimized San Fernando Valley Christmas shoppers, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people in custody that we think may be involved in this, but beyond 
that we're not going to divulge any information," Lt. John Dunkin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The male suspects, ages 25, 21, 16 and 15, were booked on suspicion of auto 
theft after their arrest in what police said was a stolen vehicle. Officials 
refused to release the names of the suspects, saying that doing so may 
interfere with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the elite Metropolitan Detail made the arrests Thursday night 
near the intersection of Nordhoff Street and Tampa Avenue. They were assigned 
to the Valley this week to help catch the follow-home bandits, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had warned residents to be on guard against a group of robbers who 
follow victims to their houses, brandish handguns and demand money, jewelry and 
Christmas presents. Police bolstered patrols and plainclothes details. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Vance Proctor said investigators are contacting victims of the recent 
follow-home robberies for possible identification of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more follow-home robberies were reported in the northwest Valley on 
Thursday night, but were apparently not connected with the four people 
arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the incidents involved a pair of robbers who have been preying on 
Korean Americans in the northwest Valley, and two others were committed by 
possible "copycat" robbers, said Lt. Bob Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the former incident, one robber sprinted toward a 47-year-old Northridge 
man as he was unlocking his trunk at his home in the 11600 block of Baird 
Avenue at 11:05 p.m., Normandy said. When the victim made a break for his 
garage, a second robber stepped in front of him, put a gun to his head and 
ordered him to give up his money, Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man replied that he had no money, and the robbers pushed him to the 
ground, kicked at him, rifled through his pockets, found his wallet and then 
fled, Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier incident, Peggy Janian, 41, was returning to her home in the 
10400 block of Baird Avenue about 8:10 p.m. from the North Hollywood insurance 
firm where she works. As she parked her car in the driveway, a man approached 
the driver's window and told her to hand over her purse and briefcase, said her 
husband, Eddie Janian, 42. When she refused and said she was going to call her 
husband, the thief threatened her with a switchblade, then grabbed the purse 
and briefcase, Eddie Janian said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third incident, a 51-year-old woman who owns a Hollywood clothing 
business returned to her home in the 17000 block of Jeanine Drive after a night 
of socializing, Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As she removed her bag with the week's receipts from her trunk, a man punched 
her in the shoulder, Normandy said. She fell to the ground and curled around 
the bag, Normandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves tore it from her grasp and fled with about $1,000 in cash.

COUNCIL PRAISES OVROM'S ADVICE ON DEAL WITH HAAGEN; BURBANK: THE CITY 
EVENTUALLY MADE MORE MONEY IN MALL AGREEMENT BY REJECTING HIS SUGGESTION. 
STILL, CITY MANAGER IS TOLD, 'YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB.' 
</P>

<P>
 Burbank City Council members gave a public vote of confidence this week to 
City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom, saying he gave them sound advice during 
negotiations with mall developer Alexander Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovrom recommended in July that the council accept an offer the city valued at 
$7.4 million from Haagen to end the city's interest in the financially ailing 
Media City Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer was made up of $2 million in cash from Haagen and other anticipated 
revenues to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Bill Wiggins and Vice Mayor Dave Golonski eventually rejected Ovrom's 
advice and held out for what became a $10-million buyout deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Wiggins, Golonski and Councilmen Bob Bowne and George Battey 
applauded Ovrom for his negotiating work during a council meeting Tuesday. 
Councilwoman Susan Spanos was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portraying the city staff's recommendation -- the city manager's 
recommendation -- as a bad one clearly was not the case," said Golonski, who 
served as liaison between the council and the city's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, staff worked very, very closely with . . . the entire council, 
and there was hardly any disagreement throughout the entire process," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say you obviously have the support of all of us here," 
Wiggins told Ovrom. "You're doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the package recommended by Ovrom, the city would have received $2 
million in cash, $2.1 million in projected property taxes from a proposed 
office building developed by Haagen near the mall, and an estimated $150,000 
annually for 10 years or more in city sales taxes generated by 34 of the 149 
mall stores and by a nearby Circuit City, Office Depot and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had earlier given those sales taxes to Haagen. 
</P>
<P>
 The final buyout deal approved this month calls for Haagen to pay the Burbank 
Redevelopment Agency $10 million over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Haagen gets the right to develop two remaining parcels near the 
mall in any way he wants and to continue leasing the mall land for just $1,000 
a year for 95 years.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; FEDERAL DRAINAGE GUIDELINES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, to comply with federal requirements, has approved a sweeping 
ordinance that governs water-runoff drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires all local governments to adopt controls over drainage if 
runoff endangers federally controlled bodies of water, such as the Pacific 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park officials have publicly and privately muttered in recent months 
that their small city, with a population of 6,400, hardly has any pollutants 
for the federal government to be worried about. Villa Park is almost entirely 
residential and has no industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the City Council on Tuesday scrutinized a 23-page model ordinance 
on drainage control and then, without debate, unanimously approved it. No one 
showed up for a public hearing scheduled prior to the vote. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; WATER RELEASE PLAN WILL BE STUDIED MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Ranch Water District Board has voted to do more environmental study 
on possible effects of a plan to release partially treated waste water into 
duck ponds near the city's border with Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the water would move from the ponds into the San Diego Creek, 
where it would ultimately flow into Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in October wrote a letter requesting additional study before 
the water district seeks approval for the plan from the California Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally planned, water drained into the bay could increase the nitrates 
there by 1,000 pounds a day -- an estimated 27% increase, according to district 
consultants working on the proposed Wetlands Demonstration Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The district asked for permission to run a projected 15 million gallons of 
water a day through three duck ponds abandoned by two shooting clubs in 1988 to 
filter out some of the nitrates, then pump the water into San Diego Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 While the plan would not pose a threat to people, Newport Beach 
environmentalists said they fear the increased nitrates would worsen the Back 
Bay algae blooms they have worked to reduce over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, algae blooms were so thick that the water was depleted of oxygen, 
causing massive fish deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Schneider, environmental program manager for the water quality board, 
earlier told Newport Beach officials her agency was unlikely to approve the 
plan without a detailed environmental study about the plan's effects on the 
bay. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; 2 FAMILIES DREAM UP CHRISTMAS LIGHT SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost until midnight, the cars cruise slowly along normally quiet Cervantes 
Lane, the riders gasping at the side-by-side Christmas light shows proudly 
displayed by two neighboring families. 
</P>
<P>
 For about three weeks during the Christmas holiday, life changes for the 
Walkers, the Liesers and their neighbors, but nobody's complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have time to do anything else," said Scott Walker, standing outside 
his home greeting strangers who came to gawk appreciatively. "But it's good for 
the community to have a place to go. It helps build community spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The homes at 25172 and 25162 Cervantes Lane won top awards in the city Home 
Holiday Lighting Contest. For Walker, it was the third time his family has won 
the honor in the five years they've put up the light show. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's theme is Santa's Fitness Center. His entire front lawn and roof 
covered in cotton snow, the display features animated cartoon reindeer that 
haul up barbells and dutifully drop into sets of deep knee bends. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Santa gets into the act, pumping huge bags of presents attached to an 
iron bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, Michele and Garry Lieser strung together thousands of multicolored 
lights into a religious display featuring wire-framed angels.  
</P>
<P>
 Walker said there is no competition between the two families. The neighbors 
started their displays about five years ago after jointly stringing lights on a 
tree between the two homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes Walker, wife Debbie and two helpers about 120 hours to build the 
display, although Walker said the job "gets easier every year because you add 
things to it like building blocks." 
</P>
<P>
 People who gathered in front of the two homes on a pre-Christmas evening this 
week said they appreciated the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's got to be about a trillion lights here," said Lake Forest resident 
Steve Hawkins, who brought his wife and two children. "My kids love this and 
I'm glad these people take the trouble. This is the kind of stuff that puts you 
in the holiday spirit."FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN NOT CHARGED IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tustin man who fatally shot another man fighting with a woman outside a bar 
this month was acting in self-defense and will not be charged in the death, 
prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Allen Steeps, 34, fired when Russell Alan Graham of Whittier charged 
him while Steeps was calling police on a cellular phone to report the fight 
outside the Pump Room Bar in Orange on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, 39, was shot in the head with a large-caliber handgun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors decided not to file charges after listening to the tape of a 911 
call Steeps made on his car phone as Graham fought with a girlfriend in the 
parking lot, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said. Steeps told a police 
dispatcher he had a gun and would use it to stop the beating but was cautioned 
not to get involved, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Graham saw Steeps talking on his cellular phone, he charged at him and 
ignored Steeps' warnings to stop, which were heard on the tape, Rosenblum said. 
Steeps fired when Graham was within five feet, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Steeps was acting in an honest . . . self-defense," Rosenblum said. "He's 
obviously concerned about the guy's stability and the guy's violent nature." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenblum said Steeps was charged Friday with illegally carrying a 
concealed weapon in his car. The charge carries a maximum jail sentence of six 
months and $1,000 fine. Arraignment is scheduled for Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum said initial accounts of the incident portrayed Steeps as a 
vigilante. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no vigilante," he said. "This was a young man placed in a 
frightening situation. He panicked and shot." KEN ELLINGWOOD

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CAROLING TRUCK TO CONTINUE TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody walks in L. A. Not even carolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The caroling truck that has become an institution in North Hollywood and 
Toluca Lake will roll through its merry rounds tonight, as it has for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started from having nothing to do on Christmas Eve," said Rick Day, 
one of the event organizers.  
</P>
<P>
 Day and a group of workers at a now-defunct sound studio decided to pack some 
public-address equipment into the back of a dump truck and hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because of how much fun it was, it's grown to 200 (carolers)," said Day, 
who works at a publishing company in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck, likewise, has grown. Carolers now elaborately decorate a 45-foot 
flatbed truck with a sleigh, chimneys, and about 4,500 watts worth of sound and 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 people will crowd onto the flatbed and the rest will swarm around 
it, passing out candy canes and cookies for seven hours on a 10-mile meandering 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's practically a parade," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck stays on side streets, where it doesn't interfere with traffic. 
Merry-makers never have released an itinerary, though residents seldom have 
trouble finding the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to listen," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck will roll out at about 5 p.m. from the vicinity of Bellflower Avenue 
and Blix Street, and stay on side streets centered around Camarillo Street 
between Tujunga and Clybourne avenues. Festivities wrap up by about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous residents plan their evening festivities around the truck, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people in their pajamas outside, people on roofs, you see people 
holding phones out so relatives can hear." GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; CITY PLANS TO WIDEN TUJUNGA AVE. BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City engineers will unveil plans next month to widen the Tujunga Avenue 
Bridge, a proposal that has already drawn widespread concern about increased 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But safety is the reason cited by the city Bureau of Engineering, which wants 
to extend the bridge over the Los Angeles River from two to four lanes to match 
the width of Tujunga Avenue on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bridge is a bottleneck," engineer Luis Ganaja said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganaja said the proposed $1.4-million project would also include widening the 
bridge's sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City Residents Assn., said the work 
is unnecessary. He urged residents to attend a public meeting Jan. 19 to hear 
more about the plan and voice concern that the neighborhood's 
pedestrian-friendly atmosphere will be altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will mean more traffic. It will create a less safe environment . . . due 
to the increased traffic and speed," Lucente said, adding that he hopes 
residents will suggest alternatives. For example, he said, the city could 
narrow the street where it approaches the bridge from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at Vitello's restaurant, 4349 Tujunga Ave., 
Studio City. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JEWISH 'SANTA' PLAYS ROLE FOR FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Arnie Cohen was stationed in the South Pacific during the Korean War, his 
Air Rescue unit commander tossed him a red suit, padding and a beard one 
Christmas and ordered him to distribute a load of C-rations to local children 
as a gift from Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Cohen? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only one in my outfit who had nothing else to do," he explains. 
"I'm Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years later, in 1983, Cohen was planning to attend his Northridge 
real estate brokerage firm's annual Christmas dance when he experienced a flash 
of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of simply showing up with the unwrapped toy for underprivileged 
children that served as an admission fee to the dance, Cohen decided he would 
dress as Santa and arrive via helicopter to impress his fellow employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to then gather the donated toys and whisk them off in the 
helicopter to be distributed to a local charity. Only one problem. He didn't 
have a helicopter at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles City Fire Department was willing to make a deal. The 
department was in search of a volunteer St. Nick to help distribute toys 
collected through its service club, SERTOMA. If Cohen was willing to serve as 
the club's Santa, department members said, they would give him a ride to the 
company party. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years later, Cohen is still the Fire Department's Santa. With his staff 
of SERTOMA helpers, he travels all over Los Angeles this time of year, 
distributing items such as basketballs, stuffed animals and Power Ranger 
figures to excited crowds of underprivileged kids and victims of holiday fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year alone, Cohen placed toys in the hands of more than 26,300 Los 
Angeles children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy doing this because I get to see the reaction of the kids' faces when 
they are given something they would not otherwise receive," said Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I put on that suit, nobody knows who I am. When kids come up to hug 
(Santa) and smile just because they believe, that's what this holiday is all 
about, if people would just remember it." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing visits to a cancer ward one year and the distribution of new headset 
equipment to spina bifida patients during another Christmas as his most 
significant Santa moments, Cohen said that "the high" he experiences when 
making a positive difference in children's lives is what has kept him going all 
these years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very lucky," he said, "I just want to give some of that back." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Steve Hofbauer, staff assistant to the toy distribution program, 
that "high" is what motivates everyone as the staff scrambles to meet the 
increasing demand for toys caused by more organizations finding out about 
SERTOMA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some firefighters don't realize how intense the experience is until they take 
part in the program," Hofbauer said. ANTONIO OLIVO

 Three pushcart food vendors will be allowed by the city to operate at the 
Mission Viejo Freeway Center for the next four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, recognizing that the hundreds of employees at the new 
center need a convenient place to eat, approved the temporary arrangement, on 
condition that the vendors get permission from the shopping mall operator. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of four months, the city will review the arrangement and decide 
whether to continue allowing the vendors to operate at the center. Commissioner 
Norman Murray said he'd like to give future center tenants, Jack-in-the-Box and 
Dairy Queen, a chance to comment on the vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Green, Ryan Corona and Cindy Atkinson, who run separate sidewalk 
pushcart food operations, had complained to the City Council on Dec. 12 about 
being shut down by city code-enforcement officers. The council referred them to 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 All three food vendors said they provided plenty of room on the sidewalk in 
front of the stores for customers. They added that the food service was 
appreciated by store employees, who must otherwise drive about two miles to the 
nearest fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The pushcart vendors said that individual corporations have given permission 
for them to operate in front of their stores.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY'S MOVE TO INVEST IN O.C. FUND CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Mayor Wayne Silzel this week criticized the City Council for its 
decision earlier this year to invest city reserves into the now-troubled county 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Silzel said previous councils, including the one he served on during the 
mid-1980s, were more cautious and conservative with city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last February to take about $1 million in city reserves 
that had been invested in a state fund and put it into the county's investment 
pool, which paid higher interest at the time. Mayor Bob Patchin said the move 
was made only after a council subcommittee investigated the prospects of the 
county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patchin, in a prepared statement Tuesday night, added that the council 
subcommittee was given incomplete and misleading information about the county 
pool assets and risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now know we did not not get a full report" from the county, Patchin said. 
"We were given many printout pages of gold-plated bonds. . . . We were not 
given any listing of the derivatives, or any inkling that they existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Silzel, however, said he does not think the City Council sought adequate 
information before investing in the county fund. Silzel said several 
knowledgeable residents could have warned the City Council about the risks in 
transferring so much of the city's reserves into the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out in the community and ask people, and then you won't be embarrassed," 
Silzel said, during the public comments section of the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, before Silzel's speech, had voted to allow City Manager Fred 
Maley to put future city reserves back into the state-administered fund. But 
Silzel said that move also may be risky because of the state government's 
precarious finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may be going from the frying pan into the fire," he warned.BILL BILLITER

<P>
 Acting on its motto of "children first," the Fountain Valley Kiwanis Club 
brightened the holiday season this week for 27 youngsters from the Orangewood 
Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-member community service group treated the children, ages 4 to 6, to 
lunch and a visit with Santa Claus.Each child also received a gift: a Barbie 
doll or Power Ranger figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a special day for them," said Chris Fowler, Kiwanis president. 
Fowler added that the event also proved rewarding for club members -- 
especially when they saw the shine in the children's eyes as they clutched 
their gifts.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange facility is for children who are in protective custody. Fowler said 
club members wanted to spread Christmas cheer to the children because they 
"aren't going to have a special Christmas. They're away from their families. 
For us, we felt that for a few hours at least, we can make it more special." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said the outpouring of gifts was so great that there were 60 extra 
toys, which will be donated to the Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa.

 The city's Bicycle Trails and Harbor Quality committees narrowly survived City 
Council efforts this week to consolidate several citizen committees, although 
others will be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bicycle Trails Committee, which works on trail development and safety 
issues, was to be disbanded, in part because of expected vacancies, City 
Manager Kevin J. Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Councilman John C. Cox Jr. objected to disbanding the group and said 
other residents could be appointed to fill the vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, the Bicycle Trails committee has been one of this city's most 
effective committees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials had considered merging the Harbor Quality Committee into 
the Legislative Committee. But the council voted to keep the Harbor committee 
together at the request of residents and committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members, including Mayor John W. Hedges, said several people 
had pointed out that the Harbor Quality Committee looks at ways to reduce 
pollution and trash in Newport Harbor, one of the city's major recreational 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislative Committee monitors and helps determine how to apply air 
quality and other standards imposed by regional and state authorities, but pays 
no special attention to harbor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Other committees will be changed under council action. 
</P>
<P>
 Six committees, some newly created, will handle the duties previously 
delegated to a dozen.HOLLY J. WAGNER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR BURBANK FLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank Tournament of Roses Assn. officials are searching for volunteers to 
put the finishing touches on the city's 1995 Tournament of Roses Parade float. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction and painting on the frame of the float, "Reach for the Wind," is 
complete. The structure awaits myriad flower designs that are the trademark of 
Rose Parade floats, said Jennifer Edwards, float designer. 
</P>
<P>
 The float, measuring 35 feet tall and 18 feet wide, depicts a family sailing 
trip that includes a boat skimming through ocean waves accompanied by dolphins, 
a turtle, sea gulls and a pelican.  
</P>
<P>
 The structure is designed to fit in with the sports theme of the 1995 Rose 
Parade, "Quest for Excellence." Burbank is one of only six organizations or 
cities that continue to build their Rose Parade floats without outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's float is designed to illustrate that people of all ages can get 
involved in sporting events, and that these outings do not depend on 
competition to be fun, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers -- who must come with an adult if they are under 14 -- will begin 
work Monday, gluing dry straw flowers, parsley and bougainvillea to the 
sailboat's sails. 
</P>
<P>
 They will continue to attach blue and white irises, purple and white mums and 
white roses and orchids to the ocean and the animals through Jan. 1, officials 
said. The parade is scheduled Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials encourage volunteers to come early in the week to work on the float 
-- situated at the Public Service Department barn under the Olive Avenue 
overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers traditionally work around the clock from the morning before the 
parade to the parade kickoff. Decorating hours earlier in the week are from 9 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Officials encourage volunteers to wear grubby clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 While it involves detailed, hands-on work, float decorating is simple, does 
not require experience and is "a lot like kindergarten, where you get to play 
with white glue and dry materials," Edwards said. 
</P>

848-0472. JENNIFER OLDHAM

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; COUNCIL LOOKS FOR BETTER YEAR IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year 1994 is not going to be remembered as a banner one for the City 
Council of Agoura Hills. The city has been beset by fiscal woes, and a recall 
movement targeting all members of the council is currently under way. 
</P>
<P>
 But Louise Rishoff, who this week assumed the title of mayor, said Friday she 
prefers to leave the past behind and look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a year of getting the city back on its feet economically. I 
think that economic development is going to be my focus," said Rishoff, a 
private attorney elected to the council in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales tax revenues look like they are inching back up again," she said. 
"Between that and the utility tax, it looks like we can get the city moving 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ed Corridori, who is now mayor pro tem, added that the city's 
Economic Development Committee, which he chairs, will continue working next 
year to stimulate economic growth. He said that one proposed project -- the 
Creekside Terrace movie theater complex -- will, if built, attract more retail 
businesses to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole number of business that have expressed an interest in the 
project," Corridori said. 
</P>
<P>
 But outgoing mayor Joan Yacovone, a former planning commissioner who will 
remain on the council, maintained that 1994 was not so bad for the city. Its 
disaster response team -- a volunteer organization which has become a model to 
similar organizations in the area -- logged 3,776 hours of volunteer time, 
taught disaster preparedness to more than 500 people and trained 134 new team 
members, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also broke ground for a new 10-acre city park, extended library hours 
and completed the long-sought acquisition of a 4.5-acre parcel for a community 
center to be shared with Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills residents launched the recall effort after the council voted to 
levy a 4% utility tax on residents. Critics say the tax is not needed and that 
the city has been wasteful in spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 The council terms of Yacovone and Rishoff, who critics say are part of a 
political machine catering to the older part of the city, end next year. 
Yacovone said she has not decided whether she will run again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for my husband, Tom, and I to decide," she said. "City Council 
politics is local, and I think that's a family decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Rishoff said she is also undecided. "I'm waiting to see if I'm still going to 
be in office next November," she said. FRANK MANNING

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HER BEST GIFT -- FREEDOM TO VISIT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the presents Halina Douglas will find under her tree Christmas morning, 
none will top the plastic leg brace that is already lying there. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-length flexible brace was a gift from Anaheim prosthetist-orthotist 
Kevin M. Carey, the man Douglas credits with giving her life back. 
</P>
<P>
 The device would normally have cost about $3,000 -- a luxury not covered by 
Douglas' insurance -- but Carey decided years ago that his patients were more 
important than insurance reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
 To Douglas, 52, the brace means she can walk and sit on the beach and continue 
her career as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 "On his own, this man designed this brace for me," said Douglas, a Laguna 
Beach resident. "We're not talking about a $50 gift, we're talking about a 
$3,000 gift. And this was straight out of his heart. I don't know how to thank 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas had gone to several other brace makers and suffered through four 
ill-fitting braces before she found Carey. A 1988 car accident left her with a 
damaged knee and head injuries that affect her sense of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey built her an earlier brace that worked perfectly, except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I couldn't go to the beach because I would get sand in the hinges," 
she said. "He must have seen my long face." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Carey called and said he had designed a new plastic brace 
that could be used on the beach. "He asked for nothing ," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said his goodwill came from his own conscientiousness as a prosthetist 
and inspiration from a doctor who saved his leg back in 1973 and personally 
nursed him through two years of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw in her face that (painting) is something that is her livelihood and 
that's my job -- to provide her with a product so she can pick up where she 
left off. I'm working on the future of my patients," he said. "Also, maybe I'm 
just a perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas is not the only beneficiary of Carey's generosity. She said she has 
talked to two other patients -- one of whom needed a limb -- who have received 
work for free when insurance wouldn't cover their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Carey put it: "I have an expression for how I do this -- I say I'm funding 
health care." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; MAYOR MADE NEW FINANCE PANEL CHAIR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown was named finance committee chairman of the Orange County 
Sanitation District on Wednesday night, replacing Peer Swan, who resigned after 
some board members expressed concerns over possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan, vice chairman of the sanitation district and board chairman of the 
Irvine Ranch Water District, will remain on the finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was drawing $50 million a week out of the county investment pool for" the 
Irvine Ranch Water District, said Brown, a retired accountant and Leisure World 
resident. "People here were feeling that there was a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Swan, who also serves as chairman of District 14 within the sanitation 
district, said he stepped down "to keep some peace in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of people thought I should have told them about the condition of the 
county treasury," Swan said. "I didn't see how that was possible without 
starting a run on the fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, the city's representative on the 
sanitation district board, said Swan should remove himself from his two other 
leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a dual fiduciary but he only honored one," Hammond said. "That's why I 
think he should at least resign from his leadership roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said he withdrew $100 million in water district funds from the county 
investment pool in November to try to force county officials to review the 
portfolio. He stopped withdrawing water district funds after county officials 
agreed to his request. RUSS LOAR

 The corner of Talbert Avenue and Bushard Street looks like any other suburban 
intersection today, with its sprinkling of strip malls and concrete walls that 
separate the busy roads from quiet neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crossroads is considered the birthplace of Fountain Valley.The area 
was once home to a general store, a church and other buildings. For the first 
half of the century, it served as a central trading post for farmers who lived 
in the area. For decades, the area was known as Talbert Village -- named after 
early developer James Talbert. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the crossroads was slowly transformed. Today, only the 
church and a boarded-up building stand as reminders of Talbert Village. Today 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about an Orange County holiday tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Glory of Christmas" Nativity program will be performed at 4:30, 6:30 and

 Two 21-year-old men were arrested on suspicion of armed robbery early Friday 
after they were seen fleeing from the crime scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cypress police officer on duty saw Jerry Karl Sims and Anthony Eugene 
Cooley, both 21, running into an apartment complex at the same time he heard a 
radio report that a convenience store in the 5000 block of Lincoln Avenue had 
been robbed, according to police Sgt. Larry Jordan.The apartment complex was 
about a quarter of a block north of the convenience store, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Palma and Cypress police surrounded the apartment complex and arrested both 
men about 2:30 a.m. with the assistance of police dogs, Peterson said. Nobody 
was injured during the arrest, and police say the stolen money was recovered.

 The simple Christmas wish of a 4-year-old girl with leukemia -- a toy Barbie 
car -- is about to be granted in an unexpected way. 
</P>
<P>
 Mireya Garcia is this year's winner of a $1,000 shopping spree at Toys R Us, 
thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:15 a.m. today, Mireya will be surprised by a limousine at her front door 
that will take her to the Huntington Beach toy store. "Her original wish was 
for a Barbie car, so one of the other wish coordinators and myself decided we 
were going to embellish the wish," said Lyn Shermet, the foundation's wish 
granter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mireya was discharged Thursday from Children's Hospital of Orange County where 
she was undergoing chemotherapy, Shermet said. NANCY HSU

OUTSPOKEN ACTIVIST BECOMES A BUREAUCRAT; GOVERNMENT: TOPANGA CANYON WOMAN WHO 
FOUGHT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SAYS SHE'S READY FOR LOW-KEY ROLE AS AN AIDE TO 
SUPERVISOR ZEV YAROSLAVSKY. 
</P>

<P>
 Susan Nissman recalls a few, fleeting moments of doubt when she wondered 
whether she was doing the right thing by taking a job as a field deputy to 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 After years as an outspoken community activist working to prevent development 
in Topanga Canyon, would she be able to adapt to life as a behind-the-scenes 
aide to the newly elected Yaroslavsky? 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to this point where I asked myself, 'Why am I going into politics in 
1994, of all times?' " said Nissman, 45. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the answer, she said, she followed her heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like exactly the right thing to do," said Nissman. "I can't think 
there is any other place I could be right now to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Nissman gained notoriety during a long campaign to block Canyon Oaks Estates, 
a large-scale housing development that was fiercely opposed by residents of 
Topanga Canyon, a close-knit, semirural community nestled in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed this spring to buy the property, 
ending the nearly 16-year controversy, although it remains to be seen whether 
the fiscally strapped public agency will be able to complete the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Nissman, whose salary has not yet been determined, says she and 
Yaroslavsky are working toward a common goal: preserving the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissman, who applied for the job, said she was used to dealing one-on-one with 
county government figures because unincorporated Topanga is largely governed by 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 And her experience showed, says her new boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by her knowledge, her commitment to the area and her 
temperament. She's very judicious," said Yaroslavsky. "I wanted somebody who 
could work well with people, and who wasn't just a bureaucrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Her district includes the Santa Monica Mountains, the west San Fernando 
Valley, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Malibu.  
</P>
<P>
 Nissman, a native Californian, is the mother of a son, 11, and daughter, 14. 
She is a writer specializing in advertising and public relations. Her husband, 
Arthur, owns a marketing and communications business. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she continue to fight development in her new job? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am no longer a community activist," she said. "I am now a public servant 
employed by Supervisor Yaroslavsky." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she work to promote the interests of Topanga? 
</P>
<P>
 "This job serves a much bigger area than Topanga," she said. "Whether you live 
in Calabasas, or Agoura Hills, or Los Angeles city, or Woodland Hills or 
Topanga, you're representing Supervisor Yaroslavsky. The boundaries no longer 
exist. These are 3rd District issues."

</P>
<P>
 Key issues: She said the prime issue is how the city's finances will be 
affected by the county's bankruptcy. Other major issues, she said, include 
proposals for building new warehouses in business park areas and "the city's 
general fund, balancing our budget and investing money wisely."

 Key issues: Scrutiny of city finances is a major concern. "We've got to look 
at the revenue side, rather than at the expense side. We can't continue 
covering expenses by raising fees or taxes. We're the policy-makers, and we 
have to decide the size and shape of government." Other issues of interest 
include public safety and allocation of resources and manpower.

</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: "Keeping the complexion of the community the same, and raising the 
money to be able to do that. We are a family-oriented community. We want to 
keep that small-town feel." She said good financial management is the key to 
keeping the city a good place to live. "I think even with the county 
(investment) problems, we'll make it through."

</P>
<P>
 Term expires: 1998 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: "Certainly, finance is the big issue, even more so because of the 
(county) bond issue situation. Also, crime is a principal issue in the mind of 
the public. I'm for a long-term, strategic plan for preventing crime." He also 
is a vehement opponent of card clubs.

 Key issues: "A key issue in the city will be the build-out of our business 
park." She said she is also concerned about "the financial ramifications of the 
county's investment situation." Police protection and public safety are also 
major issues. Like Carroll, she opposes any attempt to bring card clubs to the 
city.

3 HOMES MAY GET STILTS EXEMPTION; SIMI VALLEY: FEMA PROMISES TO WAIVE ELEVATION 
REQUIREMENT. QUAKE-DAMAGED RESIDENCES ARE IN FLOOD PLAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA and STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Simi Valley residents who poured huge sums into fixing their 
quake-damaged homes may be exempted from a federal law requiring them to scrap 
all repairs and rebuild their houses on stilts, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials have secured a promise from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to waive the law, which is designed to prevent housing from 
being built in flood plains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we have reached a tentative agreement that will let these 
homeowners continue to move forward with building their homes," Assistant City 
Manager Mike Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials cautioned that the deal still must be approved by top federal 
managers before the agency can grant waivers and allow repairs to proceed. The 
approval process could take several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the city being optimistic. But I've been through this a few 
times and it's unwise to speculate on something that's not yet a settled 
solution," said Jack Eldridge, chief of the national flood insurance program 
for FEMA's western district. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy stems from a federal law requiring landowners to elevate any 
structure built in a flood plain. The law applies to both new construction and 
existing structures that undergo massive refurbishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the three Simi Valley residents who undertook extensive repairs -- in 
each case costing more than half their homes' value -- should have propped 
their houses up on stilts or earthen mounds five feet high, Eldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley officials did not realize that the residents' quake repairs 
were considered substantial enough to trigger the elevation requirement. So 
they did not warn residents in the flood plain to lift their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Simi Valley officials realized their mistake, the homeowners had 
already invested more than $50,000 apiece on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Infuriated at the prospect of ripping up that work, the residents protested. 
Simi Valley leaders lobbied FEMA to exempt the three homeowners from the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys (at FEMA) were all nice and warm and fuzzy after the earthquake," 
Mayor Greg Stratton said. "They said, 'We're here to help.' And so we said, 
'OK, help!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton and Sedell said they believe their pleas will pay off, adding that 
they received assurances from top officials in Washington. But they warned that 
the deal must still be sealed in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tenuous nature of the agreement made homeowner Louise Kisting 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it sounds like good news, but I've been told many conflicting things," 
said Kisting, who had spent $90,000 to repair her two-story wood-frame house in 
east Simi Valley before she was caught in bureaucratic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to believe it until I see it in black and white, signed by 
FEMA," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kisting's home, like the other two, is included in a flood zone primarily 
because it is close to the Arroyo Simi, a flood-control channel that runs the 
length of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to FEMA engineers, there is a 1% or greater chance that these 
residences will flood in any given year. 
</P>
<P>
 By building without elevating, the three homeowners may be forced to pay 
several thousand dollars a year in flood insurance. The city is considering 
sharing that cost, Stratton said, because officials should have known that the 
extensive reconstruction would force elevation of the residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we probably owe them," Stratton said. "I'm not sure whose fault it 
is. But if they shouldn't pay and FEMA won't pay, then we have a moral 
obligation of some type."

FIREFIGHTERS, OFFICERS AID NEEDY; DONATIONS: FAMILY WHOSE HOME WAS DESTROYED IN 
A FIRE RECEIVES ITEMS FROM A STATION TOY DRIVE. AND POLICE COLLECT FUNDS FOR 
CHILDREN OF A SLAIN SAFETY OFFICER.

<P>
 While last-minute shoppers hurried to buy the final gifts on their Christmas 
lists Saturday, firefighters and police throughout the area scrambled to take 
care of children who might have gone without because of family tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles County Fire Department station in Val Verde, firefighters 
spent the day trying to track down a family whose $38,000 home burned to the 
ground in early December. The station had more than 20 items left over from its 
toy drive and the firefighters decided the bundle couldn't go to a needier 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hilario family, the firefighters remembered, had six children and had lost 
all of their possessions in the blaze that began because an iron had not been 
unplugged. The family listed its total property losses at $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With only the family's previous address to go on, Engineer Randy Osborne 
called sheriff's deputies in Santa Clarita, the Red Cross and anyone else he 
could think of to locate the family's new address. He had heard that the family 
had been staying in a local motel, but had moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, Osborne called directory assistance, which supplied him with 
the family's phone number in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne laughed at his attempts to play detective, but not at the good will 
that inspired the hunt.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were just overwhelmed when we brought the stuff," he said. "They had 
some stuff, but they have three teen-agers and they didn't have much for them." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar good-will effort, officers at the West Valley Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department chipped in for two young children whose father was 
fatally shot Wednesday night while trying to stop a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The station collected $450 for the children of Thomas Worley, a Los Angeles 
County Safety Police officer. With other donations from area merchants and 
elected officials, the officers hope to collect about $1,000 for Worley's 
6-year-old daughter, Christina, and 2-year-old son, Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened in our division and we were at the scene and personally we all 
saw that the officer didn't have a lot of money," Lt. Anthony Alba said. "We 
felt the need in our hearts."

O.C. WOMAN SUES AFTER ATTACK AT VEGAS RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Habra woman has filed a lawsuit against the Excalibur and a former hotel 
security officer, seeking unspecified damages two years after being attacked at 
the resort by the security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel Sheldon filed the complaint Wednesday in District Court against the 
medieval-style resort and Francis Price, 44. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant took plaintiff Hazel Sheldon to the roof under false pretenses 
and gained access to the roof by virtue of his employment by Excalibur," 
according to the lawsuit filed. "On the roof of the Excalibur Hotel and Casino 
is where the defendant Price assaulted and attempted to rape Hazel Sheldon." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged Price in 1993 with battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault, a felony. He later pleaded guilty to one felony count of coercion. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge Stephen Huffaker sentenced Price on Oct. 20 to probation for up 
to four years. Huffaker also ordered the defendant to complete impulse control 
counseling and to stay away from the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon contends Price beat her head against a hard surface. The attack caused 
Sheldon to suffer "physical and mental injury, shock and trauma," according to 
the complaint.

JURY CONVICTS MAN IN SLAYING DURING ROBBERY AT ATM; VERDICT: CHRISTOPHER ARTHUR 
MANN, 21, FACES THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE SHOOTING DEATH OF HANS CHRISTIAN 
HERZOG, WHO HAD JUST DEPOSITED MONEY AT A LANCASTER BANK.

<P>
 A Superior Court jury has found a convicted auto thief guilty of murdering a 
bank customer during a Lancaster robbery that was videotaped by an automated 
teller machine's security camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in both sides of the case said the video footage of the crime and 
self-incriminating statements set the stage for the verdict against 21-year-old 
Christopher Arthur Mann, who escaped from a Van Nuys halfway house a week 
before the robbery and fatal shooting of Hans Christian Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors concluded four hours of deliberations Thursday and found Mann guilty of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances, making him eligible for the 
death penalty. At the end of the trial's penalty phase, which begins Jan. 3, 
jurors will recommend one of two sentences: death or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators charged that on March 5, 1993, Mann used a sawed-off 
rifle to kill ATM customer Herzog, then stole the 44-year-old Lancaster 
resident's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terribly straightforward case of murder that occurred in the course 
of a robbery," Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela R. Rogers said Friday. "We had 
overwhelming evidence from a variety of sources." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying of Herzog, a telephone company worker and father of two, received 
wide attention because such random murders are rare in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators alleged that Mann and an accomplice, Wesley Dean Harper, 24, 
drove around Lancaster in a pickup truck, looking for someone to rob outside a 
bank. At about 6 a.m., they stopped at a Bank of America branch on Lancaster 
Boulevard, where Herzog had just used an ATM, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann jumped out of the pickup, asked Herzog to light his cigarette, then 
followed him back to his car, they said. Mann then shot Herzog in the head, 
dragged him out of the vehicle and drove away in Herzog's car, while Harper 
fled in the pickup, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog had made a deposit at the bank just before he was killed, but did not 
withdraw any cash, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate trial last May ended when Harper pleaded guilty to first-degree 
murder under an agreement in which he was sentenced to 26 years in prison, with 
the possibility of parole. He also was required to testify against Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, the prosecutor, said Harper placed Mann at the murder scene, and the 
ATM tape allowed jurors to see part of his confrontation with Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw him stalking the victim," she said. "You can see him holding a rifle 
in the direction of the victim's head." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the camera did not record the shooting itself, it did show Mann 
dragging Herzog's body out of his car. "That's pretty damning," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses at the trial included Mann's acquaintances, who said they 
heard him discuss the crime, and sheriff's deputies, who said Mann, a former 
Palmdale resident, led them to Herzog's car and keys after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Mann's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Earl Siddall, asked 
the jury to return a second-degree murder verdict, which would have spared Mann 
the possibility of a death sentence. He argued that Mann did not intend to kill 
Herzog but pulled the trigger accidentally when he was startled by Herzog's car 
horn when it went off during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddall said he was disappointed by the verdict, which came at the end of a 
trial viewed by Mann's relatives. "It's sad for the victim's family; it's sad 
for the defendant's family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the penalty phase, Siddall said, he plans to introduce evidence that 
Mann suffers from drug-related mental health problems, and he will argue 
against a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who will be sworn in as a Municipal Court judge on Jan. 2, said 
another prosecutor will outline Mann's criminal history during the penalty 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks before the slaying, Mann was transferred from state prison, where 
he was serving time for auto theft, to a halfway house in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog's widow is expected to make a statement during the penalty phase, in 
which the prosecutor will urge that Mann be put to death, Rogers said.

TALKING HAS STOPPED SO LITIGATION LOOMS; BASEBALL: PLAYERS' UNION WILL TAKE 
CASE TO NLRB. MORE QUESTIONS SURFACE AFTER OWNERS IMPLEMENT SALARY CAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the baseball players' union, found the 
message light blinking when he returned to his hotel room in Washington late 
Thursday night after the final breakdown of bargaining talks with the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel operator told Fehr there was a package for him at the front desk. A 
Christmas gift? Fehr suspected otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The package contained 66 detailed pages on the owners' new economic system and 
a five-page letter from management lawyer Chuck O'Connor, saying he was sorry 
it had come to this and was hopeful they could still negotiate a settlement. No 
handshake. No call. No invitation to a seminar explaining how the system works. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way people do things when they're not very proud of it," Fehr 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos is soon to become the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation will soon replace negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months into a bargaining dispute that the owners have said is all about 
cost controls and revenue disparity and re-establishing competitive balance, 
owner Jerry McMorris of the Colorado Rockies seemed to finally say Friday what 
the players have always suspected.  
</P>
<P>
 In a Denver news conference, McMorris conceded that the owners needed help 
controlling their spending habits and that it was the players' responsibility 
to provide that because the owners are too "fiercely competitive" to do it on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asked, 'Why should players help with this behavior when the owners 
don't seem to behave themselves?' " McMorris said. "I just took that straight 
on. There's no point in trying to kid anybody. You have to get some kind of 
restraint on clubs because everybody thinks that if they get close, they're 
only a player or two away, and that helps drive the prices to where they are. 
The system we have doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Self-control, in other words, is as much an issue as cost control. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's saying is that, left to their own devices, the owners can't stop 
themselves," Fehr said. "So they are going to make sure the industry is shut 
down until the players agree to do what the owners can't or are unwilling to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The union is certain to cite McMorris' quotes when it seeks injunctive relief 
through the New York office of the National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday, 
charging the owners with creating an illegal impasse and failing to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the next step in a dispute that has only begun. Here are some immediate 
questions and answers: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What authority does the NLRB have and how long will that process 
take? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The NLRB, recognizing baseball's seasonal aspect, has promised to 
expedite the situation. Nevertheless, it will take two to four weeks for the 
NLRB to determine if the union's charge has merit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board determines that it does, it will issue a complaint against the 
owners and may also pursue an injunction on behalf of the union. If an 
injunction is granted, the salary cap system will be put on hold while the 
issue of good-faith bargaining is debated before an administrative law judge, 
whose decision can be appealed by either side to an NLRB panel in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's decision can then be appealed by either side to a federal circuit 
court, putting it on the road to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The process could take months, possibly years, during which time the owners 
might be forced to operate under the old economic system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, if they are found guilty of having negotiated in bad faith, the 
salary cap probably will be overturned and the owners could face a fine that 
would make their $280-million collusion payment seem paltry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hasn't the NLRB already cited the owners for negotiating in bad faith? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The NLRB issued two complaints -- a complaint is comparable to an 
indictment -- against the owners for withholding a $7.8-million pension payment 
due the union in August. The case will go to an administrative law judge on 
March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints -- failing to negotiate in good faith and discriminating 
against union members -- will be used by the union to support the charges it 
will file next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said Friday that he will definitely 
seek removal of baseball's antitrust exemption. How would removal of that 
exemption facilitate a settlement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If a bill removing the exemption also included an injunction against the 
salary cap while that issue played out in court, the players might be tempted 
to return to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the exemption allows the owners to implement restraints of trade, 
such as the salary cap, that would be illegal in any industry regulated by 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption also makes it more difficult for the union to pursue relief 
directly through the courts, although it is expected to do so in this instance, 
filing in Philadelphia, where a federal court recently ruled that the exemption 
applied only to the reserve system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where does all this leave the 1995 season? Are the owners definitely 
planning to open the spring camps with replacement players? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They appear headed in that direction. Several clubs have initiated ticket 
plans that will allow customers to get refunds if they are dissatisfied with 
the product on the field, and the general managers have formed a committee to 
study the replacement concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the 28 teams will need more than 600 replacement players, it 
will not be easy to pull off, however.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where would the replacement players come from? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is thought that the owners would focus on the lower minor leagues, 
veteran minor leaguers who might feel they have nothing to lose by crossing the 
line, college players willing to jump at a chance they might otherwise never 
get and retired players eager for one more shot at the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 The union privately believes that a small number of its members will cross the 
line, but whether the clubs can find 600 players willing to face possible 
retribution from the striking players is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Canadian province of Ontario prohibits the use of replacement 
workers during strikes, and the Toronto Blue Jays have said they will honor 
that restriction unless forced to challenge it as a reluctant litigant by Major 
League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a similar law in the province of Quebec, but the Montreal Expos 
believe they can circumvent it because the union is not certified in that 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do managers and coaches fit into the replacement picture? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No one is caught in a more awkward situation. Managers and coaches are paid 
by their respective clubs. However, they are also members of the union's health 
and pension plans and receive a yearly licensing check from the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players aren't stupid," Rockies Manager Don Baylor said. "They have to 
understand that all managers and coaches are in this position. We have to go 
out and do our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it's a difficult issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have relationships with veteran players and at some point you think 
they'll be back and at some point you have to explain why you did what you 
did," Manager Tony La Russa of the Oakland A's told the Oakland Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you tell me the game is better served by my sitting out, then I'll sit 
out. I can pass up some paychecks. It's something I'll try to figure out for 
myself when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are any players currently getting paid? How come there have been so many 
signings in the last few weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's this simple: Both players and clubs were trying to position themselves 
before the new system was implemented and a possible signing freeze was ordered 
by the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, to this point, has said only that it will ask players and agents 
not to sign until it has had a chance to fully review the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 No players are getting paid and none will be until there is a settlement or 
they cross the line. The union will start doling out payments from its 
$175-million strike fund again in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has there been any indication of major breaks in either the owners' or 
players' solidarity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is thought to be some unrest among the owners regarding the financial 
and legal risks of implementation, but only the Blue Jays, Baltimore Orioles 
and New York Mets voted against it, and only Baltimore owner Peter Angelos has 
been a consistent and outspoken critic of the owners' bargaining strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Commissioner Bud Selig and his strangely silent partner, Chicago White 
Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, have remarkably and mystifyingly held the normally 
divisive owners together through cancellation of the World Series and the 
growing threat to the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The union figures to lose a small percentage of players if the camps open, but 
it is impossible to predict how many or who they will be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were there any 11th-hour changes in the system the owners implemented? Are 
any negotiations scheduled? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The owners elected not to implement a provision that would have credited 
players on the disabled list with only 50% service time and players called up 
in September with no service time. 
</P>
<P>
 They also chose not to implement a provision that would have required all 
players to make 20 free promotional appearances a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the loss of $600 million in revenue because of the strike, they 
had previously removed a provision guaranteeing $1 billion in compensation to 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, players received about 58% of industry revenue in salaries and 
benefits. The owners hope to lower that to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no negotiations scheduled and no indication that Jimmy Carter will 
replace William J. Usery as the mediator when and if negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the labor dispute with the umpires affect the dispute with the 
players? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The issues are different, but the owners seem to have taken the same 
uncompromising stance with the umpires that they did with the players, and the 
umpires' union has already filed a complaint with the NLRB, charging the owners 
with having failed to negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone considered the possibility that the 1995 season could have 
replacement umpires working games involving replacement players? 
</P>

ST. LOUIS RAMS? OFFER LOOKS HARD TO REFUSE; PRO FOOTBALL: PROPOSED DEAL 
INSTANTLY WOULD MAKE THEM ONE OF THE RICHEST FRANCHISES IN SPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the ultimate get-rich-quick scheme, and the Rams don't have to invest in 
junk bonds, put together a pyramid scheme, go on a Las Vegas junket or blow a 
month's payroll on Super Lotto tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 All they have to do is strike a deal to play in St. Louis. An analysis of the 
package currently being discussed -- using figures from the NFL, the group 
trying to lure the team to that city and Financial World magazine -- indicates 
that such a move would take the Rams from the NFL's poorhouse to its financial 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who are projecting a loss of about $6 million in Orange County this 
year, would make an estimated $20.7 million in pretax profit during their first 
full season in St. Louis' new 70,000-seat domed stadium, based on expected 
sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, a move to St. Louis would make the Rams one of the most profitable 
teams in the league," said Paul Much, sports finance consultant for the 
specialty investment banking firm of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin in Chicago.

<P>
 The Rams, who close what could be their last season in Southern California 
with today's game against the Washington Redskins, would make about $38.2 
million in gate receipts and stadium revenues alone in St. Louis, where a new 
stadium, scheduled to be completed in October, includes 101 luxury suites and 
6,550 "club seats," an upgraded category of seating with access to exclusive 
food service and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those profits, coupled with $42 million the team would receive from NFL 
television contracts and local media deals, and $2.5 million from licensing and 
merchandising deals, would boost the team's total annual revenues to about 
$82.7 million, which would put the Rams second in the NFL in total revenues 
behind the Dallas Cowboys and eighth among all U.S. professional sports 
franchises, according to Financial World's most recent data. 
</P>
<P>
 But with projected expenses of $62 million in St. Louis, a figure based on 
Financial World's NFL averages for 1993, Ram profits of $20.7 million would be 
the highest in the league. By comparison, the Rams, according to Financial 
World, had revenues of only $59.4 million in 1993, with expenses of $53.9 
million for a profit of $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at this deal and wonder why a team would leave the nation's No. 2 
media market," said Alan Friedman, editor of Chicago-based Team Marketing 
Report. "That doesn't matter much -- what matters is what you can make in 
game-day operations. They can't do in Anaheim what they can do in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are simple. In St. Louis, the Rams would receive all revenue from 
luxury boxes, club seats and concessions and a share of revenues from in-house 
advertising and potential stadium naming rights in a luxurious, 
state-of-the-art facility. There is no parking associated with the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would pay $25,000 a game in rent, but $75,000 in game-day expenses 
would be paid for by the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would probably get a new, more lucrative lease if they remain in 
Anaheim, but current terms call for the team to give the city 20% of 
luxury-suite revenue, 7.5% of ticket revenue and 50% of concession and parking 
revenue. In addition, the Rams pay rent of 60 cents per admission, not to 
exceed $400,000 per year. The Rams made only $15 million in gate receipts and 
stadium revenue in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stadium lease is only part of the attraction in St. Louis. The Rams 
would not have to pay stadium debt service there, because the $258-million 
facility, an expansion of the city's convention center, was financed by a 
combination of state and local government-backed bonds and revenue from a 
county hotel/motel tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' Anaheim Stadium debt-service bill is about $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, St. Louis has plans to launch a permanent-seat licensing program, 
in which fans pay a one-time fee for the right to purchase season tickets, in 
an effort to generate at least $60 million -- $30 million to cover the 
remainder of the Rams' bill for Anaheim Stadium improvements completed in 1980, 
about $15 million for a new practice facility and an estimated $15 million in 
NFL relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in it for St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis government officials acknowledge that while there will be some 
economic benefit to having an NFL team -- more jobs, more sales tax generated 
on game days -- the city would actually make more on the convention 
center/stadium project without a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main goal of a convention center is to fill hotel rooms, and with a 
football team, most people will drive to the game and only stay for the day," 
St. Louis County Executive Buzz Westfall said. "With 10 games a year, we'd 
probably lose some attractive convention dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the town wants a football team and knows our image was hurt when we lost 
the Cardinals (to Phoenix in 1988). We'd like that image restored." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what having an NFL team really boils down to for St. Louis -- prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pride thing, knowing that you have a big sport in town," said Chad 
Everett, a 32-year-old member of the St. Louis Rams Fan Club from Chesterfield, 
Mo. "One of the hallmarks of cities is their sports teams, and people identify 
with them from one part of the country to another. From that point of view, a 
team would draw people in from surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that the city probably wouldn't make any money on the Rams, but 
I don't think that's a reflection of St. Louis as much as it is on pro sports 
around the nation. We put them on such a high pedestal that teams are in a 
position to get whatever they want. If the Broncos proposed to leave Denver, 
that city would bend over backward to give them a similar deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, St. Louis is not the only city willing to roll out the red carpet and 
throw immense amounts of money at NFL teams, and it most certainly won't be the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos, who spent a year trying to woo the Rams, 
assured team President John Shaw that he would match any St. Louis offer, and 
he's currently negotiating a deal to purchase the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore package included a $160-million, 72,000-seat stadium with 108 
luxury suites and 7,500 club seats, paid for with bonds backed by lotteries and 
stadium revenues. The team would receive all revenues from tickets, luxury 
suites, club seats, parking and concessions, and the deal also included a 
renovated practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, like St. Louis, said he would pay for all relocation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the Ram derby, Hartford, Conn., made an offer that would have given 
the Rams all revenue from concessions, parking, luxury suites, club seats and 
in-house advertising in a new, $252-million stadium. Memphis, Tenn., and San 
Antonio also offered lucrative deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clear demonstration that the driving force, at least in the NFL, is 
now stadium revenue," Team Marketing Report's Friedman said. "This is a 
scenario that will be played out continually in the league until every team is 
in a facility that is maximizing their revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a case where the traditional sources of revenue have been tapped out or 
are close to being maximized. The national media deal is certainly generous, 
but they're locked into that for a couple of years. Ticket prices can only go 
so high, though they still haven't reached ceiling. And as long as there are 
cities looking to attract teams, NFL teams will have all the leverage." 
</P>

GIRLS' BASKETBALL SIMI VALLEY TOURNAMENT; NEWBURY PARK KEEPS ALEMANY AT BAY, 
56-48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new girls' basketball season begins next week at Alemany High. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have three days off for Christmas and the winning starts after that," said 
Samantha Rigley after her nationally ranked Indians fell to Newbury Park, 
56-48, in the championship game of the Simi Valley tournament Friday night at 
Rancho Santa Susana Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (7-1) is ranked second in the state and 13th in the nation, and had 
won 30 consecutive regular-season games over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park was no David to Alemany's Goliath, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers entered ranked 10th in the state and their only loss came in a 
Buena tournament semifinal three weeks ago -- to the Indians, 44-33. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park center Kara McKeown scored 10 of her 12 points in the first half 
as the Panthers built leads of as many as 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That was familiar territory for Alemany, the two-time defending tournament 
champion. The Indians came from behind to beat Newbury Park on Dec. 9, and it 
looked like Rigley (17 points) would lead them to another thrilling finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany rebounded to win that one, 44-33, on its way to the Buena 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the Panthers had all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Amy Berman scored 12 points, including a crucial three-point shot late 
in the third quarter after Alemany had closed the margin to 41-39. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament most valuable player Julie Wastell scored 10 points and pulled down 
eight rebounds, while teammate Jann Thorpe added 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any superstars," McKeown said of the Panthers' balanced attack. 
"It's hard to stop a team with eight great players." 
</P>
<P>
 But Newbury Park (12-1) accomplished just that in defeating a team that won 
the Southern Section Division 2-AA title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carly Funicello, Alemany's standout junior center, scored 13 points but sat 
out nine minutes in the second half with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly McKay, an All-Southern Section choice last season along with Rigley and 
Funicello, scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy was philosophical afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy we lost," Hearlihy said. "But it may have been what we needed 
at this point, just to let us know we have to work harder and can't just walk 
onto the court and win." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeown scored 10 of her points in the first half as the Panthers ran out to a 
35-28 lead at intermission.

PISTOL SHOOTERS PROMOTE SPORT AS AN ENDEAVOR FOR THE MASSES; RECREATION: A 
VENTURA COUNTY LEAGUE IS PRODUCING SOME OF THE NATION'S BEST SHOOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is any word in our society more loaded than "handgun"? Certainly, few are less 
associated with legitimate sport. 
</P>
<P>
 That might all change if Yank Price and his pistol-packing legion of 
competitors have their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is turning itself into a sport for a broad range of people," says Price, 
director of the Southwest Pistol League, an organization that stages monthly 
competition on a remote ranch in northeast Ventura County and boasts some of 
the nation's best shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I'm trying to promote." 
</P>
<P>
 Holster for now the debate on whether guns kill people or people kill people, 
Price says, and examine pistol shooting from the standpoint of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting has been an Olympic sport since the advent of the modern Games in 
1896. There are seven Olympic shooting events for men, four for women and two 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pistol shooting contains a magazine load of elements that make any sport 
appealing: Proper technique and fundamentals are necessary, practice improves 
performance, results are easily quantifiable, and participants compete both 
against themselves and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting is done at a variety of stationary paper and steel targets. A 
sequence of shots on a given course is called a stage. Some stages require the 
shooter to move from position to position, taking various stances and aiming 
around obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each stage is timed, and scores reflect a combination of accuracy and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this sport is that an individual can set personal goals and, 
depending on the time and energy devoted to it, can become as good as they 
want," says David Gentzvein of Woodland Hills, who among Southwest Pistol 
League shooters is No. 1 with a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentzvein, 31, recently won the SPL open division championship for an 
unprecedented third year in a row. He is the league's only Grand Master, 
meaning he can enter any national competition at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Gentzvein won the SPL equivalent of a triple crown, finishing first 
in all three pistol classes: open, limited and revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 In the revolver class, shooters use a standard double-action six-shooter. 
Limited shooters use a stock semiautomatic pistol. Open shooters can modify 
their guns with scopes that increase accuracy and compensators that increase 
speed by reducing recoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Within each division, shooters are ranked in class from A through D. Grand 
Master is a class above A. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings serve as handicaps, and shooters can enter United States Pistol 
Assn. matches anywhere in the country within their class and be assured they 
will be competitive. The USPA has about 12,000 members and 150 belong to the 
SPL. 
</P>
<P>
 Price believes those numbers could skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've found over the years that there is a huge group of people who want to do 
this," he says, "but they don't know how, or where. The market is huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing pistol shooting into the mainstream begins with making safety the 
sport's No. 1 priority. Although the league boasts of having no accidents in 
its 31 years, the ever-present threat of injury or death is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 During competition, no one goes off half-cocked. Shooters are disqualified for 
violating any of several safety rules, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * A shooter must keep the muzzle of his pistol pointed down-range. 
</P>
<P>
 * A shooter's fingers must remain off the trigger while he is moving from 
station to station. 
</P>
<P>
 * A shooter may not leave the firing area until his gun is empty. He must 
display his empty chamber to the range official before holstering the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Should a gun drop to the ground, the shooter leaves it to be retrieved by a 
range officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety rules are so strict you don't see bad gun-handling," Gentzvein 
said. "All the things that would make a gun discharge or put the safety of 
others at risk disqualifies you from the match." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the safety and competitive aspects of pistol shooting were on display 
during a recent Sunday on the five-acre range, which also includes areas for 
rifle shooting, law enforcement target practice and a group called the Burbank 
Muzzle Loaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest Pistol League uses a large-enough area to accommodate three to 
five stages at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 One stage required shooters to begin by standing in a small boxed-off area 
with their guns in their holsters. Frank Wood prepared to shoot, taking his 
stance with knees flexed and feet spread shoulder width. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Herbert, a volunteer range official, stood alongside Wood with a timer 
and a score card. "Shooter ready!" Herbert shouted. The timer buzzer went off 
and Wood drew his gun and began pulling the trigger rapid-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shots were fired at each of four paper targets and one at a metal target 
called a pepper popper. Wood then ran to a second station and shot at a metal 
target that, when hit, caused a wheel full of paper targets to turn into view. 
Those were shot at before Wood moved to a third station where he took eight 
shots at paper targets through a narrow porthole. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood was excited about his score, saying, "I'm all fired up. I love this 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Another stage required shooting through and around a cardboard tree, and a 
third stage required shooting at paper targets from various distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Score sheets are handled only by Price to ensure they are not tampered with. 
"We've gotten pretty competitive out here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The SPL served as host to the Colt Pro Shootout in October, an event that drew 
shooters nationwide. Portions of the match will be shown on ESPN today at 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The SPL also is one of eight leagues nationwide that are host to area 
championships serving as qualifiers for national events. Another high-profile 
event is Speed Week, held in May, which consists of eight different types of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 These events bring out the best shooters. Their grip is firm, their stance 
relaxed. They reload, aim and fire almost quicker than the eye can follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting is much like golf, very stylistic," Gentzvein says. "The proper 
grip, stance and follow-through are essential, and hand-eye coordination is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic discipline is to achieve fast, accurate shots, to draw from the 
holster consistently. You have to work on developing your skills so there is no 
wasted motion. That's shooting in a nutshell." 
</P>
<P>
 Practice includes dry firing -- drawing and pulling the trigger of an unloaded 
gun -- and shooting at indoor or outdoor ranges. Gentzvein manages an indoor 
range in Van Nuys, enjoying a situation similar to a golf pro who has the run 
of his course: He can shoot every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Rhonda Van Tassel of Oxnard, who three years after taking 
up the sport has become one of the SPL's top women shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 After one year of competition, Van Tassel won first place in the 1991 
International revolver championships and has finished third in each of the past 
two years. She gives lessons at Shooter's Paradise in Oxnard and is membership 
director of a shooting club. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can measure your improvement, which I like," she says. "At first all I 
had to do was go to the bottom of the score sheet and find my name. Now, I 
enjoy it so much I wish I could do it for a living. It's addictive." 
</P>
<P>
 Something else Van Tassel enjoys is the camaraderie among SPL members. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet great people," she says. "It's not how people portray guns and gun 
owners. This is not about being violent. It's a sport."

STRIKE UP A CHORD OF UNCERTAINTY; BASEBALL: LOCAL MAJOR LEAGUE ROOKIES AND 
MINOR LEAGUERS WEIGH DECISION OVER CROSSING PICKET LINE.

 The venerable Sparky Anderson pleaded for sanity when major league baseball 
players went on strike Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is not the time for wild accusations," he said. "Do it as business people 
and not from anger. It's up to all of us now to handle this thing with dignity. 
This is a chance to show how much class we have, how we handle this." 
</P>
<P>
 The words of the Detroit Tigers' manager went unheeded. The owners voted to 
implement the salary cap Thursday, and the strike threatens to disrupt the 1995 
season as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For established major league millionaires from the area such as Bret 
Saberhagen, Jack McDowell and Todd Zeile, paychecks have been missed during the 
protracted strike. Yet, it's tough to drum up much sympathy for their financial 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike has been an equal-opportunity intruder into the lives of 
less-experienced professional baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 There are rookies such as Phillie catcher Mike Lieberthal whose careers were 
just gaining steam. 
</P>
<P>
 There are standout triple-A players such as Pirate first baseman Rich Aude 
poised to make the big jump. 
</P>
<P>
 There are players such as Cub minor league pitcher Derek Wallace who are union 
members simply because they were added to a team's 40-man roster to protect 
them from being selected in the Rule 5 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 There are double-A players such as Athletic outfielder Joel Wolfe anxious 
about the logjam created by the major-league work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 There are Class-A players such as Phillie infielder David Waco who will be the 
most tempted by the prospect of playing on replacement teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike in a sense was like a bomb. It doesn't discriminate, it affects 
everyone in professional baseball," said Wolfe, a former Chatsworth High player 
who had a strong season in double A last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout had a particularly jarring impact on three rookies who attended 
area high schools: Lieberthal, Brewer third baseman Jeff Cirillo and Angel 
pitcher Andrew Lorraine. All three were sent back to the minors by general 
managers who wanted them to continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the strike became inevitable, Lieberthal viewed the demotion as positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to get more at-bats, to play another three weeks, which was 
fine," said Lieberthal, a Westlake High graduate. "I agreed with them. And I 
got paid for an extra month-and-a-half." 
</P>
<P>
 Other players were expecting to be promoted to the major leagues when rosters 
would have expanded Sept 1. Their hopes were dashed by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Aude, the Pittsburgh Pirates' first baseman of the future after batting .281 
with 15 homers and 79 runs batted in for triple-A Buffalo, N.Y., last summer, 
had a brief stint with the Pirates when rosters expanded in 1993. He fully 
expected to make a strong impression last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It put a big-time wrench into those plans," said Aude, a Chatsworth High 
graduate. "In '93 I was kind of nervous when I was called up. The second time 
around I would have been more aggressive and been able to handle the pressure. 
It would have been fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty continues for Aude and Lieberthal, both of whom are on their 
team's 40-man roster. Should the strike extend into spring training, it is 
unclear whether they would be crossing the picket line by reporting to camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, the union won't allow anyone on the 40-man to go to spring 
training," Lieberthal said. "That could change. But if it's a matter of 
crossing the lines, I won't be doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither will Aude. Both said they recognize that veteran players are 
sacrificing income to ensure that future major leaguers retain maximum earning 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players in the last one or two years of their career are really sacrificing, 
and they are doing this for younger players," Lieberthal said. "I have to 
respect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Aude and Lieberthal, Wallace has yet to taste a day of major league 
play. He is a member of the players' union nonetheless because the Cubs placed 
him on the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, I'm on strike," said Wallace, a product of Chatsworth High and 
Pepperdine who split last season between double A and triple A. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Aude and Lieberthal, Wallace is not part of the 25-man roster, putting 
them in a sort of limbo. The union says that as members, they should not report 
to camp. The owners say that because they are not part of the 25-man roster, 
they will be assigned to triple-A teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing players like these to return to the minors creates a logjam for 
double-A and Class-A players such as Wolfe and Waco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike has made everything stagnate," Wolfe said. "It is one big, bad 
thing, a minor leaguer's worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to cross picket lines is more difficult for players in the low 
minors. "I thought it through and decided I wouldn't play unless they told me 
I'd lose my job," said Waco, a former Chatsworth High infielder who batted .339 
last summer. "The last thing I want is to be blacklisted." 
</P>
<P>
 But the clock is ticking for the 24-year-old Wolfe and 25-year-old Waco. They 
have reached an age where they will be considered major-league prospects for 
only a few more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is make-or-break time," Wolfe said. "When a guy is doing well and there is 
no place to go, it's a real bad thing. It limits everyone's opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why he would consider playing on a replacement team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say, 'I won't cross a picket line,' but if you are talking about 
$100,000 to $150,000 to play in the big leagues it will be very difficult to 
say no," Wolfe said. "But I don't want to be called a scab. I want to make it 
because I'm good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike punctured a season that was offering tremendous promise for minor 
leaguers. With some teams looking to dump overpriced, aging players, the future 
was bright. "The front office was telling us over and over, they are getting 
rid of big salaries and going with young guys," Wolfe said. "Everyone said that 
this is the best time for minor leaguers."

READY TO TAKE HER SHOT; VENTURA COLLEGE'S HARDY CAN SCORE FROM ALL POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Hardy plays basketball in oversized shorts that practically touch her 
knees. Sometimes it looks like they're going to drop because she jumps up and 
down so intensely during games. 
</P>
<P>
 She raises her arms and shakes her long, curly hair wildly as she yells to 
Ventura College teammates. It's a constant effort to alert them that she's open 
and wants the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here! Here! Over here! Me," she calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, a sophomore, wants the ball because she feels confident that on most 
occasions she will make a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 She asks for it while standing under the rim, inside the key, from the 
perimeter and from three-point range. And usually, when the 5-foot-11 
forward/guard gets it, she scores with seemingly little effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can put points up in bunches and she can score from anywhere on the 
floor," Ventura Coach Ned Mircetic said. "When you have a kid like that who can 
score from under the basket and also out on the floor it's worth a million 
dollars. Kids with that kind of ability are rare at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 And even at the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring ability is the main reason Hardy, a Buena High graduate, was recruited 
by Division I schools such as Arizona and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 She committed to San Luis Obispo, which moved from Division II to Division I 
this season, during the early period in October because she wanted to stay 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how excited we are to get her," said Laurie Decker, the San 
Luis Obispo assistant coach in charge of recruiting. "Julie Hardy is the type 
of player that can take this program to another level. I was impressed with her 
flat-out pure scoring ability. She could score from wherever she wants to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent tournament at Valley College, Hardy had a game-high 20 points in a 
victory over Citrus. Two days later in the championship game, she scored 20 
points in a victory over Valley. For the second year in a row, Hardy led her 
team to the championship and was selected the tournament's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a really good player who cannot only shoot but handles the ball 
very well, too," Valley Coach John Taylor said. "It's really nice to watch her 
play. There are few things she can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, 19, was the only area woman picked to the All-State team. She averaged 
21.6 points and 9.6 rebounds a game and led the Pirates to the playoffs and a 
26-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Hardy is averaging a team-best 17 points and 6.6 rebounds for 
Ventura (10-1), which is ranked No. 3 in the state. The Pirates' only loss was 
against top-ranked and defending state champion Harbor College in an early 
season tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has defeated highly regarded teams such as Golden West and College of 
the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has four or five players that can score 20 points a night," Hardy 
said. "Last season we didn't have any scorers so this is nice because it takes 
pressure off me. Other teams can't afford to double- and triple-team me like 
they did when I was a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, Hardy never imagined she'd end up playing basketball. She says 
soccer is her first love. She grew up playing the game and planned to compete 
in it through college.  
</P>
<P>
 But when she made the varsity soccer team and the junior varsity basketball 
team as a freshman at Buena, she was forced to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother said to go for basketball," Hardy said. "She said the crowds are 
better and I wouldn't have to deal with the weather. So I took her advice and 
here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Any regrets? 
</P>
<P>
 "None. I absolutely love basketball now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy also played varsity softball as a sophomore at Buena. She was the 
school's starting first baseman and clean-up hitter, but quit midway through 
the season, citing personality differences with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 That left her with energy and attention to focus on basketball. As a senior, 
Hardy averaged 13 points and was All-Channel League and All-Southern Section. 
She helped lead the Bulldogs to a 25-3 record and the Division I-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great team that year, but Julie was definitely one of our top three 
players," Buena Coach Joe Vaughan said. "She ran the floor very well and she 
was extremely quick for her size." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan said Hardy was not heavily recruited by four-year colleges because she 
needed to develop physically. She graduated at 17 and didn't turn 18 until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "She shouldn't have graduated that year," he said. "She was a year younger 
than most players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you could see that she's stronger from a physical standpoint because 
she's had a chance to mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy feels the difference and the power. She's more confident as a result, 
but points out that even as a young, undeveloped player she was intense. 
</P>
<P>
 And she always wanted the ball.

WOODLIEF SEEKS MEMPHIS' TOP FOOTBALL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell-Jeff High football Coach Doug Woodlief said Friday he has applied for the 
vacant coaching job at his alma mater, the University of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlief said he received a letter back from the school and does not know 
which candidates will be interviewed or when a new coach will be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis fired Chuck Stobart on Dec. 14. Stobart had led the Tigers to three 
consecutive 6-5 seasons, marking the first time in 17 years that Memphis had 
three winning records in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stobart's tenure was marred this season when, after an 0-3 start, 80 
players boycotted a practice in protest of Stobart's methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodlief played linebacker for the Tigers when they went 9-0-1 in 1963. He 
played for the Rams from 1965-69. He was inducted to the school's athletic hall 
of fame last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 seasons at Bell-Jeff, Woodlief's teams have posted a 36-63-2 record, 
including 6-5 in 1994. JEFF FLETCHER

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EMPLOYEES FACE GRIM PROSPECTS AMID CUTS; REACTION: 
EVEN FOR THOSE WHOSE JOBS ARE SAFE FOR NOW, LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASED WORKLOADS, 
LONGER HOURS AND UNCERTAIN PAY IS DISTRESSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER and JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two weeks of using e-mail to squelch wild rumors of imminent disaster, 
Larry Leaman, the harried director of Orange County's Social Services agency, 
finally had some real news Friday: No one would be out on the street two days 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 County Marshal Michael Carona told his staff the same day that they may be 
jostling for the remaining pens and Post-It notes, and the bottled water had to 
go -- but none of them would have to. 
</P>
<P>
 In other county offices, though, employees openly wept Friday, stunned that 
the county's troubles had become their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after county officials announced nearly $30 million in budget cuts -- 
with still more to come -- the traditional Yuletide spirit was eclipsed by 
sadness and an odd sort of relief. Sure, most employees still have their jobs, 
but after the county had tightened its belt to the last notch, what sorts of 
jobs would those be? 
</P>
<P>
 And many questioned whether the cuts were justly distributed. The Orange 
County Sheriff's Department, with a budget of $179 million, suffered a 
$1.2-million cut, while Carona's marshal's agency took an almost identical hit 
to its $31-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alternate Defense Fund, a part of the Superior Court that pays for private 
counsel for the poor, was cut by 29%. The cut will add about 3,000 cases to the 
workload of the already overburdened public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know how the public defender's office is possibly going to absorb 
all these cases," said Judge James L. Smith, the presiding judge of Orange 
County Superior Court, whose department will have to cut $1.3 million from its 
overall budget. "I don't know what some of these people have been smoking, but 
I'd like to get ahold of some of it." 
</P>
<P>
 With positions frozen around the county, employees and department heads Friday 
envisioned mountains of paperwork, offices crowded with impatient clients and 
longer work hours for which they would not be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing a lot of what we do -- just trying to catch up around here 
-- with overtime," said Carona, the county marshal. "Now, there's no overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, county workers learned, the rules suddenly have changed: Seniority 
no longer means job security. 
</P>
<P>
 County Clerk Gary A. Granville said he wasn't sure who will be laid off when 
he eliminates four to six jobs next year in a planned merger of the clerk and 
recorder's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Granville was clear on one point: The decisions would not be based on 
years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be cutting on a merit basis. We will keep the best people, whether or 
not they're those who have been there the longest," Granville said. "Longevity 
doesn't necessarily have anything to do with who's (doing the best work)." 
</P>
<P>
 Most department heads said Friday that they would not have any concrete 
information on how they will make cuts until at least next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kuhel, the executive officer of the Central Municipal Court, summoned 
more than 180 edgy staff members into a courtroom Thursday to give them a 
welcome verdict: Their jobs were safe. Beyond that, Kuhel and his counterparts 
at the four other municipal courts could not say what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start realizing that this a very, very dire strait we're in. . . . It's 
not their fault. It's not our fault. It's a fact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most indicated that the cuts could be made by leaving current job openings 
unfilled and cutting the "nice-to-haves," like bottled water. Kuhel said the 
judges already have requested that he combine the libraries that each courtroom 
keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be promoting and we will forestall any merit increases," said 
Kuhel, who anticipates a dip in morale when the reality of a pay ceiling kicks 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Services Director Leaman said his agency -- which took a $5.9-million 
cut -- will save most of its money by leaving positions -- including management 
jobs -- vacant. The first priority, he said, are front-line caseworkers who 
handle everything from welfare benefits to child abuse complaints. What might 
have to go, he said, are janitorial services, clerical positions and plans for 
a new welfare office.

 Moorlach comment -- In Friday's editions, a quotation by John M.W. Moorlach 
was mistakenly included in an informational graphic summarizing reactions to 
Orange County budget cuts. Moorlach was commenting on the appointment of Thomas 
E. Daxon as interim county treasurer, not on the budget cuts.
