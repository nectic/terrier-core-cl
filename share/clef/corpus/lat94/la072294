 Neighbors out of town this weekend? Maybe they're on vacation . . . and maybe 
they're off in search of immortality. As many as 200 Californians make up one 
of the biggest contingents of People Forever International, which is convening 
in Scottsdale, Ariz., this weekend for the International Physical Immortality 
Convergence. Formerly the Eternal Flame Foundation, the group "doesn't accept 
the inevitability of death," says a spokesman, holding rather that a fully 
conscious brain-state can stimulate in each individually intelligent cell a 
perpetual "cellular regeneration." 
</P>
<P>
 What can these people be thinking of? Living forever? Do they know how many 
presidential campaigns they'd have to sit through? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, think of the equity they could build. Watermelon Time

 California was second only to Florida in watermelon production last year, 
growing 735 million pounds of the sweet summertime fruit. Texas watermelons, 
however, fetched more pennies per pound at the shipping point than did 
California's. Here are the top five watermelon-producing states ranked by 
millions of pounds grown last year, along with the price per pound. 03,15,11,11

 Coin age: Campus police netted more scofflaws than they had expected from 
video cameras set up to catch the thief who had been plundering the vending 
machines at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The video did help them to arrest a man who later rescued his truck from 
impound by paying most of the fine with 924 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bonanza was the unmistakable images of 16 Cal Poly students who found 
the door of one soft drink vending machine left ajar. Within 2 1/2 minutes, 
they had stripped the machine dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one young woman "kept trying to shut the door and lock it . . . putting 
her dollar bill in" before she "gave up and left without taking anything," said 
investigator Ray Berrett. "We haven't been able to ID the one good Samaritan 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Soft Drink 16, however, have all been identified, by themselves or others. 
</P>
<P>
 The vending machine is in the business administration building. The class was 
a final exam. The students were business students. 
</P>

 Maybe they didn't know the snack tax has been repealed.

 Water works: If you think some of those sleek new CHP cars are sneaky, watch 
your speedometer on Bullards Bar Reservoir in Yuba County, where the fuzz have 
taken to the foam on Wave Runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of so-called "personal watercraft" have begun lending machines 
to the deputies. A small white-and-purple Water Runner marked simply 
"Sheriff"--no lights or sirens--still has an element of surprise: Deputy Ray 
Kodani says the usual scofflaw response is: "When did you get those?"

 Word perfect: The Bear Valley Voice has taken the role of the 
press-as-watchdog one step further, chastising local officials for polluting 
public meetings with inept-speak. The paper rolled its eyes editorially at a 
politician who employed the word "fortuitous"--meaning by chance--instead of 
"fortunate," and it faulted the same man for being enamored of using the phrase 
"enamored to" instead of "enamored of." 
</P>
<P>
 The local tourist trade has generated official references to "visitation," the 
paper says, which means an infestation, as of rats, or, religiously speaking, a 
miraculous apparition. What "visitation" does not refer to is out-of-towners in 
thongs and T-shirts, however much they may seem to overrun the restaurants.

 Don't shoot, we're Democrats: Wilson campaign cameramen who showed up to 
videotape Kathleen Brown newsconferences about Pete Wilson's parole policies 
ended up dancing a little sidewalk minuet with the Brown campaign folk. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameramen found themselves outflanked by Brown people blocking the shots, 
using their signs and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooters were "totally up front" about who hired them, says Wilson 
spokesman Dan Schnur. And each time the cameramen moved to a new position, 
Brownfolk moved in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hold a press conference on a public sidewalk with a candidate for public 
office, and you'd think that means it's public," says Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 Public or no, counters Brown spokesman John Whitehurst, "we refuse to be a 
stage for their negative commercials," characterizing the videotaping as 
"Nixonian." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's within their purview for them to tape press conferences for the 
purposes of making negative commercials, certainly we're within our rights to 
stand there (in front of them) with signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in Clovis, the treasurer herself interrupted the Alphonse-Gaston 
struggle and said, "Go ahead, let them shoot."

 Not until we can see the whites of their eyes.

PAUL DELVAUX; SURREALIST ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Delvaux, whose surreal nudes and dreamlike depictions of skeletons and 
trains sell for $1 million and more, died Wednesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not formally a member of the surrealist movement, he was 
considered one of the last if not the last of that pioneering group that 
shocked and offended much of the art world in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian-born artist died in Veurne near the North Sea resort of St. 
Idesbald. Incapacitated by failing eyesight and poor health, the solitary 
artist had not painted in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux's career spanned almost 70 years, during which he gained fame for 
depicting the richness of the subconscious in figurative but irrational images. 
His work often reflected alienation and featured empty train stations, deserted 
vehicles or barren deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings hang alongside those of Salvador Dali and fellow Belgian Rene 
Magritte in many private collections and museums.

PATRICK HILLINGS; CONGRESSMAN

<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Rep. Patrick J. Hillings, who replaced Richard Nixon in Congress and 
later became one of his advisers, died Wednesday in Rancho Mirage. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillings, who suffered from cancer, served four terms in the House of 
Representatives in the seat Nixon vacated when he was elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 1950. Hillings gave up the seat in 1958 to run for state attorney 
general, a race he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as an adviser to Nixon, and directed Ronald Reagan's Florida 
presidential campaign in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in Congress as an ardent anti-Communist, he also played a role in a 1951 
subcommittee investigation of major league baseball. He called the organized 
sport a monopoly because it had not then expanded west of the Mississippi. By 
1957, the year the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves 
to California, he said the National League had proven itself not to be 
monopoly-minded.

JURY URGES EXECUTION OF SAMUELS; COURTS: WOMAN WHO ARRANGED SLAYINGS OF HER 
HUSBAND AND HIS KILLER WILL BE SENTENCED IN SEPTEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury recommended the death penalty Thursday for a woman who arranged her 
husband's murder to collect a $500,000 estate and then arranged the slaying of 
his killer. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking the jury for the death penalty last week, prosecutor Jan Maurizi 
called Mary Ellen Samuels a greedy, manipulative "mastermind of two evil plots" 
in the slaying of "Lethal Weapon" cameraman Robert Samuels and the man paid to 
kill him, James Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, was convicted July 1 on two counts of murder, two counts of 
conspiracy and two counts of solicitation for murder. She is scheduled to be 
sentenced Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was convicted of hiring Bernstein to kill her husband, and then hiring 
two men to strangle Bernstein, a drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 40-year-old husband, a camera assistant for the motion pictures "Lethal 
Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was killed Dec. 8, 1988, in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein died in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels inherited $500,000, but prosecutors said she spent it in less than a 
year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CALABASAS; TOWN'S FIRST 
SYNAGOGUE TO OPEN IN SCHOOL BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the growth of the Calabasas Jewish community, residents have 
organized the town's first synagogue at a local elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The synagogue will offer orthodox Shabbat services at Bay Laurel Elementary 
School every Saturday starting Sept. 3, giving many local Jews a place of 
worship within walking distance.A service is also scheduled this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Sabbath, it's preferred that we not use mechanical means of 
transportation," said Nigel Hamer, one of the founders. "A lot of us will be 
able to walk, instead of having to drive to Woodland Hills or Encino." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1979 and 1993, the Jewish population in Calabasas grew by 631% to 
5,509 people -- faster than in any other part of Los Angeles County, according 
to figures compiled by the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles.

$250 IN EARTHQUAKE AID GOES A LONG WAY FOR STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering the multimillion-dollar recovery estimates that circulated in the 
aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, $250 might not sound like very much 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Richard-Edward de Vere, who lost his home, his possessions and two of 
three part-time jobs to the temblor, it's practically a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have breathing room," said the 36-year-old Cal State Northridge theater 
major, one of six recipients of a student-sponsored scholarship. "It's such a 
pressure off me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Earthquake Relief Scholarship was created by CSUN public relations 
students in May to assist fellow students whose education was put in jeopardy 
after the quake. To raise money, the students distributed about 1,000 
collection canisters to retail stores and restaurants near campus. They 
collected enough to give six students $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant means de Vere will be able to complete his degree program. 
</P>
<P>
 A television set crashed into de Vere's forehead during the quake, leaving a 
wide gash that required stitches. But his injury was only a precursor to the 
turmoil that followed. He lost nearly all his possessions when his apartment 
was red-tagged, including his theater books and notes from his classes. He 
temporarily lost two of his three part-time jobs, which were on the CSUN 
campus. His other workplace, in a Woodland Hills office building, was also shut 
down for several weeks while repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 De Vere said he will use the $250 to defray the cost of tuition, about $625 
for the fall semester. He was supposed to graduate in the spring, but the 
financial strain made it impossible for him to pay for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have one pair of shoes," he said. "That tells you how I've been 
cutting corners."  
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the relief effort say the canisters are no longer in stores, but 
they plan to keep the fund open to assist as many of the students who applied 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyndy Perry-Rodgers, who helped organize the effort, read the grant 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel my heart just wrenching," she said. "CSUN is made up of a lot of 
people who are putting themselves through college, and this sort of set them 
over the edge." SUSAN BYRNES

WHEN AN ETHICAL COMPASS GOES AWRY; THE GROWING SENSE THAT CLINTON MAY BE HIS 
OWN WORST ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last New Year's Day, President Clinton asked an old college friend for legal 
advice on how he should deal with the evolving controversy over the connections 
that Bill and Hillary Clinton had with the failed Madison Guaranty Saving & 
Loan in Arkansas. There would have been nothing wrong with that request if the 
friend, Eugene A. Ludwig, was not comptroller of the currency, which makes him 
the official in charge of regulating federally chartered commercial banks. 
Ludwig is also one of three members of the board of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which is involved with claims arising out of Madison's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a very short time, Ludwig, as he noted in a subsequent memo, concluded 
what Clinton himself should have recognized, that it would be "impermissible" 
for someone in his position to discuss anything having to do with Madison with 
the President or the First Lady. Ludwig says that conclusion was reinforced 
after conversations with lawyers at the Treasury Department and the White 
House. It goes without saying that Clinton could have availed himself of the 
same legal advice before he approached the man he had appointed as comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig has already talked to Robert E. Fiske Jr., the special counsel looking 
into the tangled business involving Madison and the Whitewater Development Co., 
a real-estate investment the Clintons took part in while he was still Arkansas' 
governor. Next week Ludwig may also talk to the House and Senate Banking 
committees which, after long partisan hassling, will finally hold hearings on 
the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig told Fiske that Clinton stressed he felt he had done nothing wrong in 
the Whitewater matter, but was sounding out Ludwig because of his expertise in 
banking laws. White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler says Clinton was seeking only 
the names of experts in real-estate transactions who might help explain to the 
public what the controversy is about. 
</P>
<P>
 And, who knows, maybe the approach to Ludwig was as innocent as all that. The 
fact remains that the President, a lawyer and once his state's attorney 
general, has no excuse for not knowing what a conflict of interest is. 
Forearmed with that knowledge, he has no excuse for inviting even the 
appearance of one. The fact remains that the President, who promised that his 
Administration would adhere to the highest ethical standards, is now again seen 
as having behaved in a way that prompts questions about the reliability of his 
own ethical compass. Once more, by this needless lapse, Clinton has given an 
impression of being his own worst political enemy.

BUT IS THE WORLD EQUAL TO THIS CATASTROPHE?; RWANDA: HOW WASHINGTON CAN BEST 
HELP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwanda is perhaps only the latest African apocalypse, but if the pattern of 
horror seems familiar, the scale of the suffering is extreme even by Third 
World standards. War and ethnic slaughter have killed as many as 700,000 and 
forced more than double that number to flee. Now, a deadly cholera epidemic 
sweeps the overflowing refugee camps in neighboring Zaire, threatening to bring 
the death toll to more than 1 million. Misery, on this unfathomable scale, begs 
for international intervention immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered Washington on Thursday to respond "quickly" with "a 
practical plan of action," while pledging an additional $35 million in aid 
beyond $41.4 million approved earlier. That humanitarian plan should provide 
the planes, portable hospitals, medical supplies, food, trucks and people -- 
but not combat troops or police -- needed to save lives on a scale heretofore 
unknown even in Ethiopia and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Rwanda politically looks to be no Somalia. The brutal attacks on 
Americans in Mogadishu and the lack of a quick-fix solution in Somalia soured 
much of the West on helping in similar crises. 
</P>
<P>
 THE FRENCH CONNECTION: There has been no rush to intervene in Rwanda's civil 
war between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority in spite of the genocide. 
Only France, which has had a checkered history at best in Africa, responded to 
Rwanda's screams, with help from troops from Senegal and Ghana. Give Paris some 
credit, however. The 2,500 French troops have slowed the exodus in their area, 
though they cannot staunch the human hemorrhaging. They need reinforcements to 
help stop the crisis that began after a suspicious April 6 plane crash killed 
Juvenal Habyarimana, the first Hutu president of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to that plane crash, Hutus slaughtered as many as 500,000 Tutsis 
-- the tall, educated minority so favored by the Belgian Colonial rulers. 
Before independence, the Tutsis, though barely 15% of the population, dominated 
the short Hutus, who tended to be farmers and peasants. That blood rivalry has 
been exacerbated by the most recent massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 In this conflict, the Tutsi rebels have prevailed, and their Rwandan Patriotic 
Front leaders were sworn in on Tuesday. In victory, the new government includes 
two Hutu leaders, a figurehead president and a prime minister. But the symbolic 
inclusion of a few Hutus and the Tutsi promise of no reprisals has not 
reassured those many Hutus who fear revenge. Their fears have been stirred up 
by some ousted Hutu officials, who are forcing their ethnic brethren to flee. 
But some of these naysayers are the same evil Hutus who ordered the slaughter 
of Tutsis. Given the deadly conditions of the refugee camps, their latest 
campaign of rejectionism -- nearsighted and self-serving -- could have the 
effect of sending more innocent Hutus to their slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 THE U.S. CONNECTION: Cholera stalks the refugee camps in Goma, Zaire. The 
disease is relatively easy to treat if clean water, fluids and basic supplies 
are available. Sadly, that is not the case in the refugee camps: Relief workers 
cannot handle the overwhelming demand for emergency provisions unless the small 
airport is expanded. Additional air-traffic controllers and cargo handlers are 
also desperately needed to allow more cargo planes to land. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any hope for Rwanda, and Africa, Good Samaritans from around the 
world must send help to stop the exodus and dying and allow rebuilding. 
Americans, understandably snakebitten by Somalia, do not want to get bogged 
down in a conflict that has nothing to do with this country, but our prosperity 
and heritage require the United States to respond humanely, and immediately. 
That doesn't mean combat troops, or even military police; but it does mean just 
about everything else.

THE UNPREDICTABLE MURAYAMA; NEW JAPANESE LEADER WAVES GOODBY TO SOCIALIST 
IDEOLOGICAL ICONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's new Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a socialist, looks to be full of 
surprises. Would he disown longstanding national policies that clash with his 
Socialist Party's ideology? Or would he put aside that ideology and accept such 
mainstream policies as the need for "self-defense forces," the Japanese flag 
and the national anthem? On Wednesday he told a tense and expectant Parliament 
in Tokyo that he accepted them all. 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite an about-face for the pacifist, left-leaning Socialist Party that 
for more than 40 years has maintained that the military, rising-sun flag and 
"Kimigayo" anthem were unconstitutional. With the policy shift, the unpopular 
-- and now leftist critics are saying unprincipled -- Murayama further aligns 
his politics with the Liberal Democratic Party. The LDP and Socialists, 
traditionally at odds with each other, joined forces last month to become the 
odd couple of Japan's new coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of solidarity may be yet another cynical political move in Tokyo's 
ever-changing political scene. Murayama's startling pronouncements could 
possibly be fatal to the Socialists if the party now splinters into two groups. 
That will continue the seemingly endless cycle of realignments of parties and 
politicians that began last year when the LDP lost power for the first time in 
38 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the responsibility of being prime minister conferred on Murayama a 
broader view of a modern Japan. Or maybe he just wanted to keep his new job. At 
any rate, his historic jettisoning of the symbolic underpinnings of the 
Socialist critique of decades of Japanese policy may help the coalition, even 
if it undoes his own party. In the last year, Japan has had as many prime 
ministers as there are seasons. But the newest Japanese leader may just 
possibly prove the least predictable, and most interesting, of all.

 *Re "Judge Awards $700,000 in Hiker's Death," July 14: 
</P>
<P>
 Stupidity pays. This came to mind when I learned of the damages awarded to the 
victims of the July 14, 1990, lightning storm on Mt. Whitney.Rather than 
receive government compensation, they should instead assume the full cost of 
their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 I was on the summit that day; the impending storm was evident at least two 
hours prior to the lightning. As I quickly descended from the mountain, I 
passed these individuals and others blithely hiking up to the summit area and 
into the building storm. Is it sensible to be on the high point of the 
continental U.S. during a violent thunderstorm? These hikers should not profit 
from poor judgment that placed themselves and their rescuers at risk.

SIMPSON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Simpson Lawyers Attack Key Detective's Credibility," July 19: 
</P>
<P>
 Even though circumstantial evidence points toward his guilt, because O.J. 
Simpson has been a charming individual, most people, I think, have been 
inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. It would therefore be a horrible 
mistake for Simpson's lawyers to introduce the ugly word "racism" into the case 
by accusing a "racist" LAPD officer of planting the bloody glove. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Yorker magazine dug into Mark Fuhrman's past and cited psychiatrist 
Ronald R. Koegler's report that he left the Marines for racist reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Be that as it may, when a person we admire is charged with premeditated 
murder, he will need all the friendly support he can get, without the community 
being divided along racial lines.

 * In "The Case for the Defense -- If You're Poor and Charged With Murder" 
(Opinion, July 17) Charles L. Lindner described the Simpson defense team as a 
"Rolls Royce" and dismissed the rest of us who do capital cases at public 
expense for people of no means as the "legal equivalent of a broken-down Yugo 
from which they (Los Angeles County judges) had siphoned the gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is far from the truth. The myth that only limitless spending can produce 
justice demeans the hard, thankless, misunderstood, creative work being done on 
a daily basis throughout the county by judges and lawyers who are in the law 
because they love it. The pursuit of justice is ennobling to the soul and 
enriching to the spirit and damn hard work.

 * I read with great interest and considerable concern the article by Franklin 
Strier regarding his opinion that juries are not reliable vehicles for the 
resolution of disputes (Commentary, July 18). As a judge of the Los Angeles 
Superior Court and a former trial lawyer, I could not disagree more. 
</P>
<P>
 I am constantly in trial primarily with juries and I never cease to be amazed 
and pleased by the collective intelligence, wisdom and perceptiveness of the 
citizens who donate their time for this valuable purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the position of the author, I often see "David" prevail over 
"Goliath." 
</P>
<P>
 The pejorative reference to "crafty" attorneys and "forensic" tricks does not 
coincide with my experience. Our judiciary will not accept unethical or shabby 
behavior on the part of counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that most courts forbid jurors to take notes or prevent the 
jurors from hearing the testimony is at odds with my experience. On the 
contrary, we encourage jurors to take notes if it is helpful to them, and 
during their deliberations they may and often do ask for a reading of testimony 
about which there is some concern. This is common practice not limited to my 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After over 30 years of working with juries, my respect for their decisions and 
their willingness to serve increases weekly.

 * Inmate Charles (E.Z.) Williams (Commentary, July 15) is right when he 
equates the criminal justice system to a sport, defense versus prosecution. But 
he seems to think the way to stay out of "the regimented drudgery and forced 
labor that is prison" is to be able to hire the best and the brightest counsel. 
I wonder if it has ever occurred to him and most of his fellow inmates that the 
vast majority of Americans stay out of prison through an absurdly simple 
technique -- they don't commit crimes!

<P>
 * In "Death Penalty Unlikely for Simpson, Experts Say" (July 10), The Times 
quotes experts who claim that the prosecution is unlikely to press for the 
death penalty in the Simpson case because of his clean criminal record and 
celebrity status. Also important, according to the article, is the fact that 
the death penalty is rarely used in the case of spousal murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference between defendants like Simpson and the untalented, 
unlucky, and universally hated men who go to the gas chamber every year is one 
of fortune. The fact that Simpson was lucky enough to have his talents noticed 
and thereby gain universal adoration and great wealth should add to our sense 
of outrage if he is convicted. Instead it generates public sympathy because it 
keeps us from demonizing him and disconnecting ourselves from his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that reflection on the Simpson case will help people to see the death 
penalty for what it really is; a cruel and arbitrary punishment that can only 
be applied with one eye closed -- in order to avoid seeing the humanity of the 
victim.

WPA WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Firefighter Deaths in the West" (July 8) lists "29 workers on 
public relief" who were engulfed in flames at Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Since few of your readers were alive when the event occurred in 1933, I would 
like to clarify that the Works Progress Administration, a part of President 
Roosevelt's New Deal, employed more than 8.5 million people on 1.4 million 
projects.The average salary was $41.57 a month. It was not the dole. It was a 
program that helped many get through the Depression with self-respect, whether 
they were working as laborers or as musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately my dad, who was a contractor and builder, started with the WPA 
for the first time on Oct. 3, 1933, and died with the others in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion the phrase for which there is little understanding 51 years 
later, "on public relief," demeans the sacrifice of these men who were trapped 
not only by a backfire but by a dark period in the history of our country.

COUNTY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gilbert Cedillo's suggestions ("An Alternative to Massive Budget Cuts," 
Commentary, July 13) deserve a high place on the discussion agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us expand on Cedillo's suggestions with the concept of "time 
sharing."First, closed and underutilized libraries can time share with Head 
Start providers, thereby bringing funds for facilities and equipment rental 
into the Los Angeles County library system. This money should be used to 
maintain or restore services to library patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, county managers should look to time sharing generally for the 10 to 16 
hours per day that facilities are not used. Imagine providing start-up 
businesses with access to computers and laser printers, for a fee per hour, 
during quiet time at county facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 There might have to be changes in ordinances and statutes, and workplace rules 
would have to be created for the new relationships, but these should be seen as 
a welcome challenge in the quest for new revenue, not as an insuperable 
obstacle. Where there is a will, there will be a way.

LA PALMA COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER DIES OF HEART FAILURE AT 46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Services will be held today for Christine O'Neal, a longtime community 
volunteer and housewife, who died of congestive heart failure. She was 46. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach native devoted more than 12 years to volunteering at her 
children's schools and participating in other community groups in La Palma, 
where she lived since 1977 with her sons and husband, Brian O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 She received a number of awards for her community service, including the 1992 
Woman of the Year by the state's 71st Assembly District, a certificate for 
community service from the U.S. Congress in 1993 and the Americana Citizen of 
the Year from La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born in Long Beach and attended schools there and in Santa Monica and 
graduated from UC Santa Barbara with honors in 1971. She earned her teaching 
credential one year later. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, she married Brian O'Neal and moved to the San Fernando Valley. She 
began working as a police dispatcher in 1981 and often worked graveyard shifts 
to spend more time volunteering during the day, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been battling cancer since 1993 and died July 13 at UCLA Medical 
Center of heart complications stemming from the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her husband, Brian; sons Scott and Eric; mother Joann Baird 
of Morgan Hill, and sister Diane Kimes, also of Morgan Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services will be held at 7 p.m. at the Lakewood First Presbyterian 
Church, 3955 Studebaker Road, Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family is asking that donations be made to the 
American Cancer Society or the American Heart Assn.

COLUMN LEFT/ MURRAY KEMPTON: BLIND FAITH IN A JURY HAS ITS REWARDS; IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE MINDS OF 12 ORDINARY PEOPLE; IT'S ELITIST TO PRESUME THE 
WORST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY KEMPTON, Murray Kempton writes a syndicated column in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Discussions of the O.J. Simpson affair among the better-educated classes 
appear to have settled into taking it for granted that he is more than probably 
guilty and that he can't be convicted because one or two jurors will be too 
dumb to comprehend a truth that the better-educated classes are close to having 
already arrived at. 
</P>
<P>
 When we lift our assumptions to the arrogance of our assurances, we then speak 
of such propositions as "givens." O.J. Simpson's guilt has come close to a 
given and so is the prospect that his jury will collapse from its 
disagreements. Neither of these givens is, however, any better than an 
assumption. It is, or ought to be, nearly impossible to read guilt short of a 
trial, and it is impossible to anticipate a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the intractable mysteries about juries is that their behavior cannot be 
explained in terms of their vices and virtues. They are, like the rest of us, a 
muddling-up of good and bad, smart and dumb; but, unlike the rest of us, their 
sense of a special duty commits them to be utterly inscrutable. The more years 
a lawyer looks at these faces, the more enduring the despair of ever safely 
guessing the thoughts behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been times when I have sat through trials and been baffled enough 
by their verdicts for the notion to occur that Manhattan is an island where you 
cannot gather 12 persons together without including four who will believe just 
about anything. And yet the matter is far from that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Fairstein, a bureau chief for the Manhattan district attorney, recalls 
an acquaintance-rape case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had seated a juror who appeared the day after the opening wearing a "Free 
Mike Tyson" T-shirt. If the trial assistant hadn't been a strong young woman, 
she would have fallen over right there; and, as it was, she went ahead without 
much hope. It took that jury three hours to bring in 'guilty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The point may be that jurors don't know what they think either. Since they are 
full of opinions on subjects far from their direct observation, they come to 
the box loaded with prejudices; and what is truly remarkable is how often they 
can put all preconceptions aside. 
</P>
<P>
 What is almost as remarkable is that this redeeming riddance seems to come 
harder for the educated classes than for their presumed inferiors. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember once talking to a New York juror whose panel had just treated 
paroled killer Jack Abbott with a kindness beyond any plausible deserts. 
Shortly after his release, Abbott had stabbed a waiter to death in an alley. 
His act was murder most foul, and yet the jury found it no worse than 
negligible homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott testified that he had seen five other stabbing murders in one month 
near his doorstep on Fifth Street and that these horrors had unhinged the 
serenely evil norm of his nature. 
</P>
<P>
 How else, the juror asked, could you expect a man to act when he's seen things 
like that? He was certifying the truth of a statement that just had to be a 
lie. Appalling as the urban homicide rate is, how many white people in New York 
have seen one stabbing murder, let alone five in one month on one block? 
</P>
<P>
 The juror heard my demurrers politely and went away in the intact armor of his 
faith in the impossible. He was a college graduate, had lived in New York for 
six years and could still swallow whole a lie violating all experience and 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 It is becoming a given that black jurors cannot be trusted to believe the 
worst about O.J. Simpson. And yet I remember going to church the Sunday before 
Wayne Williams' trial for the Atlanta child murders and standing outside 
afterward while the ladies in the congregation unitedly affirmed his innocence. 
Then the jurors heard the case in their black majority, and Williams was 
convicted in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I must trust black jurors. That, of course, is my civic duty; but 
experience has also taught me to wait people out, and in the interim keep my 
mouth shut.

PERSPECTIVE ON BASEBALL; WITH TRUST, THE SOLUTION IS EASY; THE OWNERS AND 
PLAYERS EYE ONE ANOTHER ACROSS A VAST DIVIDE; IF NEITHER TAKES THE FIRST STEP, 
A STRIKE IS CERTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KOPPETT, Leonard Koppett is a columnist for the Alameda Newspaper 
Group, in Oakland and surrounding towns, and a member of the Baseball Writers 
Hall of Fame. He has covered major league baseball in New York and California 
for 46 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can a baseball strike be averted, even at the last moment? 
</P>
<P>
 Easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know this story? Eleanor Roosevelt heard her husband, Franklin, 
President of the United States, complaining that his opponent was driving up 
the price of buying votes. "Why don't you both just agree not to buy any?" she 
asked. "But Eleanor," he replied, smiling and explaining as if to a child, "We 
don't trust one another." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why. The players and club owners don't trust one another. 
</P>
<P>
 If they did, even a little bit, the basis for settlement would be simple and 
obvious. Since they don't, they seem determined to reject what any rational 
person can recognize as overwhelming self-interest in cooperation for mutual 
prosperity. The players are not, in any traditional sense, "employees" of the 
club owners, but the very product the owners are trying to sell. Without 
exceptionally skilled major leaguers, irreplaceable by any other commodity, the 
owners have no product. And without owners creating the context for presenting 
the product, the players' skill is worthless. Let them perform in unmarked 
sweatshirts on a corner vacant lot and see how much money they make. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they remain at each other's throats in labor confrontations after 25 
years. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The players distrust the owners for at least five reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Within months of signing a 1985 labor agreement, management violated it by 
engaging in collusion against free agents, as determined by impartial 
arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baseball's vast publicity machinery has been used by management to bad-mouth 
players constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Predictions of impending financial disaster, year after year for a 
quarter-century, have proved totally false. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial data, when offered, have been doctored or misleading in the past 
and are ambiguous now. 
</P>
<P>
 * In devising the plan now being offered, the owners pointedly avoided seeking 
any input from players. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, players don't believe that the owners have any intention of 
bargaining anything in good faith. They see only maneuvering to force upon 
them, under cover of baseball's unique antitrust exemption, rollbacks of what 
they've gained in previous negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners distrust the players because: 
</P>
<P>
 * They feel that union officials, agents and other greedy manipulators with 
their own agendas hoodwink naive and innocent athletes into trying to bleed 
management for every available penny. 
</P>
<P>
 * They believe that only they, as owners, have the right and qualifications to 
decide what's good for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 * They've seen all previous compromises lead to players asking for and getting 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 * They know, from their own painful and avowed experience, that they've been 
unable to trust each other, so how can they trust someone else? 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the owners also don't believe the players are willing to 
"negotiate" anything, and see bargaining as an all-out win-lose proposition 
with egos on the line for union negotiators as uncompromisingly as for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan on the table transparently shifts hundreds of millions of dollars 
from players to the richest clubs. This amount would recompense the richer 
clubs for money they would be passing on to the so-called poorer clubs as 
additional "revenue-sharing" dollars. The owners say more revenue-sharing is 
necessary for the health of baseball. But they won't do it unless the players 
pay for all of it. It's not surprising that clubs voted for it 28-0, and that 
players find it abhorrent. 
</P>
<P>
 So the clubs believe that, whether or not the players actually strike, they 
can impose their plan unilaterally for next year, under labor law that permits 
this when there's an "impasse" in bargaining. And players know that a strike, 
or the threat of one, is meaningless between seasons; only now, while the big 
bucks from post-season revenue can be threatened, can they deter the owners. 
Meanwhile, by insisting publicly that "we're willing to take a strike," the 
owners confirm to players how high they think the stakes are -- how much they 
have to gain, and the players to lose. And yet, with an honest desire to solve 
a problem instead of win a fight, anyone can see a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The players can say: "Our only concern is that you not impose your plan 
unilaterally. You say you want us to join you in a partnership. You took 18 
months among yourselves to produce this proposal. We don't like it, but give us 
a year to work out suggestions to deal with the problems you say you have. Then 
we can put our ideas together with yours and develop something acceptable to 
both. But drop the threat of imposing it yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners can say: "We are convinced we face a crisis and that the present 
system cannot continue. If you agree in principle to make substantial changes 
that address our concerns, whether in the form of a salary cap or some other 
way you can think of, we'll live with the status quo for one more year to see 
what you come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 If that fails, the war can be resumed without either side having given up key 
weapons. If it succeeds, a true era of partnership might actually begin to 
evolve. But that would require trusting the good faith of both sides, and 
that's exactly what's missing. 
</P>
<P>
 If the goal is victory, however, not resolution, the ghostly voice of King 
Pyrrhus, who defeated the Romans in 279 BC with such great losses that he gave 
his name to our well-known phrase "Pyrrhic victory," will echo again: "One more 
such victory and we are undone."

UNIVERSAL MEANS 95%? SHEER DOUBLESPEAK; HEALTH COVERAGE: TRUE REFORM IS 
JEOPARDIZED BY CYNICAL MANIPULATION AND PHONY CLAIMS ABOUT INCREMENTAL REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GOLDBERG and TED MARMOR , Mark Goldberg is the editor of Domestic 
Affairs magazine, based in Washington. Ted Marmor is a professor of politics 
and public policy at the Yale School of Management. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The health care debate got another jolt this week when President Clinton, who 
has consistently called for universal health coverage, told the nation's 
governors that "something in the ballpark of 95%" coverage would be acceptable 
to him. The opponents of comprehensive reform seized upon his remarks with 
glee, despite Clinton's swift clarification that he still backs universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress hurtles, or stumbles, toward the last phase of this extraordinary 
debate, misrepresentations by these opponents are jeopardizing a historic 
chance to achieve in the United States what already has been secured in all 
other advanced industrialized nations: a universal assurance of health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The first canard has to do with the very definition of "universal coverage." 
Most people not actually in Congress would naturally assume that the phrase 
means what it says: Everybody would have health insurance guaranteed. But now 
"universal" is being redefined to mean 95% or even less. Try explaining that to 
the 15 million Americans who would go without insurance, or to the businesses 
and workers whose insurance premiums would continue to reflect the cost of 
providing costly emergency care to the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 For both humane and practical reasons, "universal" ought to mean all of us. 
But our argument is not that legislation aimed at the goal of universal 
coverage will fully achieve it -- that every last American will in fact obtain 
health insurance. As with all laws that define a universal obligation, 
compliance will not be universal (and this may be the point that the President 
intended to make). That is why we enforce laws -- because not everyone abides 
by them. But when we collectively decide what all Americans ought to do or not 
do, we seek to get as close as possible to universal compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The second canard comes from lawmakers and others who claim that through 
incremental reform -- including reform of insurance practices, changes in 
malpractice rules, paperwork reduction and other relatively less controversial 
and ambitious measures -- we could assure health coverage for 91% of Americans, 
up from the 85% who have some coverage now. Citing the Congressional Budget 
Office as authority, they argue that if we can achieve (ostensibly) only 95% 
coverage with difficult, politically controversial steps, but can hit 91% with 
easy legislation, we should not anguish over the differential. 
</P>
<P>
 What these advocates of incrementalism conveniently manage to overlook is that 
the CBO report they refer to did not actually say that incremental reform would 
cover 91% of the population. It said that the bill introduced by Sen. John 
Breaux (D-La.) and Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) would produce that level of 
coverage only if it was fortified with another $300 billion in revenues. (And 
the Cooper-Breaux bill was more ambitious than some of the other incremental 
proposals for which proponents now claim the 91% figure.) The budget office did 
not specify how far short of 91% the Cooper-Breaux bill would fall without a 
huge infusion of funding, but it certainly never declared that any of the 
incremental bills under consideration by Congress would yield 91% coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still time, as bills head from congressional committees to the floors 
of the House and Senate, to have a serious and constructive debate about 
whether and how to achieve universal health coverage. For that to happen, 
however, the parties to the debate will have to be candid with each other and 
with the public. The proponents of universal coverage ought to concede that it 
comes with a price tag -- that just as there is no free lunch, so there is no 
free medical care. But they should also emphasize that if universal insurance 
is coupled with real restraints on the escalation of health care costs, savings 
will soon far exceed the upfront costs of expanding insurance. Those who 
advocate more modest reforms ought to concede that they are not aiming at 
universal coverage by any reasonable definition and that even their less 
inclusive proposals require substantial funding to achieve what they promise. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate focuses on options to increase the number of Americans with 
coverage, cost control has fallen victim to political amnesia. Insisting that 
lawmakers and media commentators avoid doublespeak is important. But equally 
important is the understanding that wise policy requires realistic debate about 
cost. That in turn requires that we understand the essential link between 
universal coverage and effective cost control. 
</P>
<P>
 Candor about costs is especially crucial. If medical costs continue to 
increase more rapidly than our incomes, the funds required to subsidize the 
uninsured will rise, not fall, and any effort to expand coverage will become 
harder over time, not easier. The stakes in health reform -- for people and the 
economy -- are difficult to overstate. But if we continue to tolerate false 
characterizations and phony claims, we will get either inadequate health reform 
or none at all.

 Boxing promoter Don King pleaded not guilty to wire fraud charges and signed a 
$250,000 personal recognizance bond set by New York Magistrate Nina Gershon in 
U.S. District Court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the American system of justice and I will be cleared," King said 
outside the courtroom. "I've done nothing to warrant this action." 
</P>
<P>
 King was indicted July 14 on nine counts of wire fraud. He is accused of 
filing false documents with Lloyd's of London to collect $350,000 worth of 
training expenses after a fight between Julio Cesar Chavez, the World Boxing 
Council super-lightweight champion, and Harold Brazier was canceled in June of 
1991. Chavez was cut on the nose eight days before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, King faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
 Gershon said King cannot travel outside the United States without permission.

 Former high school coach Paul Williams, linked to the gifts and cash given to 
Florida State football players, was sentenced to 30 days in jail in 
Tallahassee, Fla., after pleading no contest to felony charges of failing to 
register as an athletic agent.

 Florida State officials said they planned to announce next week the suspension 
of players who violated NCAA rules by accepting the gifts.

 An accounting company is suing the Miami Heat's John Salley, claiming he 
failed to pay $338,000 for services, loans and debts.

 Papers filed in the suit also indicate Salley has a history of legal disputes 
over money, including a $400,000 claim by a Detroit bank. Basketball

 Officials of the new Vancouver NBA franchise are expected to name Wisconsin

 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman summoned all parties in the Mike Keenan dispute 
to a hearing at his office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known when Bettman will rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan left his job as coach of the Rangers last Friday and signed as coach 
and general manager of the Blues two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute centers on whether the Stanley Cup champion Rangers breached 
Keenan's contract -- as Keenan claims -- and whether other teams were in 
contact with Keenan while he was still under contract to New York. 
</P>

 Any American hockey team that signs Canadian Bob Probert, cut by the Detroit

 TOWN-SIZE CHANGE: For years, officials at UC Irvine thought it would be nice 
if its telephone prefix could be 824 (which would be U-C-I.) Problem was, the 
whole town of Colton already had it. Colton, however, recently completed its 
switch from the 714 area code to the new 909. So, starting Nov. 5, all those 
856 and 725 phone prefixes at UCI will be changed -- everything will be 824. . 
. . Says spokeswoman Susan Menning: "This gives us about 10,000 new numbers, 
and we've already filled 6,500 of them from our previous two prefixes and our 
expansion."

 WHOSE DAY? One interested observer of this week's moon landing 25th 
anniversary was Dana Point's Fifi Booth. She's a former Life magazine writer 
who worked closely with the astronauts for seven years. Booth has many 
anecdotes from those days. A favorite from 1971 is about Tracy Scott, 9 at the 
time and daughter of astronaut David Scott: "Tracy came into the living room 
and said, 'Gee, today's a great day. Daddy gets to go to the moon and I get to

 SEX AND DEATH: Some courthouse watchers bet against it because, as one lawyer 
argued, people are reluctant to kill mother figures. But the Van Nuys jury 
surprised them, recommending the death penalty for a woman.That puts Mary Ellen 
Samuels in line to join a very small club. To date, only four of 503 people 
executed by California were women (A20). Although there are 377 men on Death 
Row in San Quentin now, there are only four women. . . . One of the others was

 FIGHTING BACK: Since Nicole Brown Simpson was slain last month, the number of 
domestic abuse complaints received by the Ventura County district attorney's 
office has risen dramatically (B1). . . . Between June 12 and July 17, the 
office received 275 complaints from county law enforcement agencies to review. 
Authorities say, though, that the increase began even before massive publicity 
about alleged spousal abuse in O.J. Simpson's marriage. They say county police 
departments decided earlier this year to take a harder look at such cases.

official. "We have the widest variety of flowers anywhere in the world.". . . 
This is the first time the convention has been held in Ventura County, where 
growers reported nearly $22 million in flower sales in 1992.

<P>
 Former Rep. Patrick J. Hillings, who replaced Richard Nixon in Congress and 
later became one of his advisers, died Wednesday in Rancho Mirage. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillings, who suffered from cancer, served four terms in the House of 
Representatives in the seat Nixon vacated when he was elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 1950. Hillings gave up the seat in 1958 to run for state attorney 
general, a race he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as an adviser to Nixon, and directed Ronald Reagan's Florida 
presidential campaign in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in Congress as an ardent anti-Communist, he also played a role in a 1951 
subcommittee investigation of major league baseball. He called the organized 
sport a monopoly because it had not then expanded west of the Mississippi. By 
1957, the year the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves 
to California, he said the National League had proven itself not to be 
monopoly-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillings also served as a lobbyist for Ford Motor Co. and as a director of Air 
West.

DANA PARSONS: FAIR MURDER TRIAL CAN PROVE CATHARTIC FOR THE BEREAVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denise Huber's parents had already presumed that their missing daughter was 
dead. They must have reserved a special place in their hearts and minds for a 
miracle, but when it didn't come and when authorities in Arizona found her body 
nine days ago, the Hubers finally got relief from three years of cruel 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because they had already come to grips with Denise's death, Ione and 
Dennis Huber have focused their comments on the future. And after the family 
business of the funeral and burial, that means the trial of whoever is charged 
with their daughter's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, the Hubers touched a nerve. They wondered aloud whether it 
might be better to have the trial in Arizona, making the point that California 
juries seem to be too lenient toward the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't mention specific cases, but their concern echoes that of a growing 
chorus not just in California but around the country -- that the guilty too 
often go free. Or that even if they're convicted, they don't serve enough time 
or aren't properly supervised while on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that concern is fiction -- prosecutors continually point out that 
conviction rates remain high -- but other parts of it ring true. The Menendez 
brothers, Lyle and Erik, admitted to killing their parents in the most brutal 
fashion, yet a jury couldn't reach a verdict. And the confessed kidnaper and 
killer of young Polly Klaas had been in and out of prison much of his adult 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to "Sally," a middle-aged Orange County woman whose husband was 
abducted and shot to death six years ago. She feared foul play immediately but 
didn't learn for four or five days that her husband's body had been found. She 
didn't want her real name used but recalled her feelings leading up to and 
through the trial, which didn't occur until two years after her husband's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two years -- and I had recovered somewhat, not much but somewhat -- you 
build up walls to protect yourself from more hurt," she said. "You build up a 
protective wall, isolate yourself a bit. You're careful who you talk to. You 
protect yourself to a great degree. You work so hard at that. People say 
thoughtless things, and it hurts. Then you know you're going to hit the trial 
and the walls you worked so hard to build up so carefully are going to come 
tumbling down, because you're going to relive the crime and your feelings will 
be up at the surface again." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was watching TV the other night and saw former Los Angeles Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner refer to murder trials as being cathartic for surviving family 
members. "It is cathartic," she said. "Indeed, I didn't want to go to the 
trial. I maintained all the time that I wouldn't go, but I went every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial lasted about three months, she said. I asked if she could relate to 
the Hubers' concern about a jury verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally said she was convinced the prosecutors had the right man, "but my fear 
was that the jury would not see what was in front of them. But as the trial 
progressed, I became more and more convinced the jury saw right through it, and 
the whole thing was a reaffirmation of the jury system for me." 
</P>
<P>
 As was Denise Huber, Sally's husband was abducted from Orange County and taken 
elsewhere. His body was found in Riverside County, and that's where the trial 
was held -- for which Sally was grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply because of the media," she said. "I didn't want to sit down at night 
and watch it on TV. For me, it was protective, and I wonder if that isn't what 
(the Hubers) are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 And when it was all over? "A trial is such an emotional event," she replied. 
"You're reliving everything that happened and knowing things you wish you 
didn't know, and it's painful, and you start building up this wall again after 
it's over. But it's the beginning of a closure. The beginning of a closure." 
</P>
<P>
 For her, that came when the jury convicted the man and he was sent to Death 
Row, where he remains. 
</P>
<P>
 We citizen observers to these trials of murder are left to lament the victims 
and their families. We can only hope that the trials become true and honest 
tests of guilt or innocence and not simply events in which one attorney strives 
to outfox another and worries later about whether the guilty went free or the 
innocent was convicted.

 And you didn't think the IRS had a sense of humor! Certified public accountant 
David Lewis of Century City sent us a whimsical apology he received from the 
wits at the Internal Revenue Service.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oops!! We goofed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which moved Lewis to ask: "Do you think the IRS would accept, 'Oops, I 
goofed,' from a taxpayer?" 
</P>
<P>
 And while we're at it, shouldn't the IRS be forced to pay a penalty for the 
mistake? 
</P>

<P>
 Now if he could make the Brown Derby reappear. . . . We don't know if you 
noticed, but the Hollywood Walk of Fame is bringing in a new shipment of 
entertainers for sidewalk plaques, including magician David Copperfield. 
</P>
<P>
 We're sure he's very deserving. But we've always been a bit mystified by the 
popularity of his TV specials. A magician on TV? How can he beat William 
Shatner beaming himself aboard a spaceship in "Star Trek," Barbara Eden 
shrinking to a few inches tall in "I Dream of Jeannie" or a horse talking on 
"Mr. Ed"? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speak up, Harry!Copperfield isn't the only magician having a good year. Harry 
Houdini was just profiled on A & E's "Biography" and a movie about his life is 
in the works. Maybe he'll even speak up this Oct. 31 (the 68th anniversary of 
his death) to fulfill his pledge to communicate a message from the Other World. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Bess, attended a seance for 10 straight Halloween nights after his 
death -- the final time on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel in Hollywood. 
But Houdini kept his silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess, meanwhile, died a few years later aboard a train that had stopped in 
Needles, Ariz., en route from L.A. to the East. "In a way the spiritualists 
could say that was significant," Houdini biographer Milbourne Christopher 
observed. "The 'East Indian Needle Feat' had always been 'Needles' when they 
(Bess and Harry) spoke of it during his show." 
</P>
<P>
 Now we know why we feel that sense of mystery when we drive through Needles. 
</P>

<P>
 And now, the Loch Angeles monster: Larry Kaplan of Silver Lake noticed a flyer 
headlined: "Don't Believe the Government Cover Up!!" plastered on poles around 
his area. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymous writer claims that the Ivanhoe Reservoir was not drained so that 
it could be upgraded (as reported), but because of "sightings of a strange 
prehistoric creature." It contains a murky photo of a Loch Ness Monster 
look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer surmises that the presence of Nessie is the reason that several 
"residents (have been) forced to sell homes below market value." (Declining 
real estate values in L.A.? What a shock!) 
</P>
<P>
 We contacted City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg's office and the Department of 
Water and Power, and both said they knew nothing about the creature. 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't that what you would expect them to say? miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Just when we finished with angels predicting quakes in Southern California, an 
Oakland prophet named Harold Camping has predicted that the world will come to 
an end on an unspecified day in September. In that case, then, we could truly 
say of Oakland that there is no there there.

ON THE ISSUE / INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS: IS IT TIME TO ESCHEW THE

 First, movie theater popcorn. Then, kung pao chicken. And now, beef burritos.  
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Science in the Public Interest this week released its findings 
that the fat, saturated fat and sodium content of some Mexican and Tex-Mex 
cuisine exceeds the daily limits recommended by the federal government. In 
recent years, many restaurants have stopped using fat-laden ingredients like 
lard, and supermarkets stock baked, not fried, tortilla chips and fat-free 
frijoles. Meanwhile, the taste for a guacamole and sour cream smeared burrito 
or enchilada is still alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 Should people change their eating habits because of the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest findings about Mexican food? 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Butler, spokeswoman for the American Heart Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat is a known contributor to heart disease, whether it comes from Mexican 
food or French food, and a very modifiable one. The heart association has 
information about how to make Mexican food heart-healthy in a brochure, 'How to 
Modify Cooking Styles and Ingredients.' The goal is not to deprive people of 
their favorite foods, but rather to help them make healthy choices, and maybe 
(help them become) informed consumers so they can ask questions at restaurants 
like: 'Do you have fat-free beans?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The AHA supports a diet of your total fat intake to be less than 30% of the 
calories you take in. Heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death. It has so much 
to do with prevention. You can call the heart association for a brochure called 
'Making Mexican Food Heart-Healthy' at 1-800-AHA-USA1." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Neal, manager of The Elegant Tortilla, a Mexican restaurant in Studio 
City: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's kind of stupid. There's a lot of other foods that aren't good 
for you. Chinese food has a lot of sodium. I don't know why they're attacking 
this issue. Everything here is very healthy. A lot of healthy vegetarian people 
eat here. (Some people) are looking for the Mexican food that they're used to, 
but we don't serve it because we haven't found a way to cook them without 
frying them. We only fry our chips and tortilla shells. . . . You pay a little 
more here, but it's the best quality of food. A lot people complain about (the 
lack of fried foods here) but this is not (a fast-food restaurant). 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Escobar, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate General in Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 "Every clinical study should be given some time in order to prove its 
worthiness. I think one of the healthiest of cuisines is Mexican food. They 
have a lot healthy foods prepared in so many ways. . . . Things should be taken 
with a pinch of salt, to use an Anglo expression. This research should be given 
time to check its truth. . . . Burritos or chimichangas have Mexican origin, 
but it's done a bit differently in the States than they are done in Mexico. 
Burritos used to be done with shredded meat, which, in my recollection, did not 
have much grease. Just a tortilla and meat and it's very tasty. But I might be 
partial, because I do like burritos." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hallon, manager of Mexican Food, a Granada Hills fast-food restaurant: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't think so. First of all, (at my restaurant) we don't use lard. 
Most of the places are not using lard any more. The beans have a lot of 
protein, but we put a little oil in there. And all the meat we use is lean. 
Mexican food is very nutritious. Chiles have a lot of Vitamin C in them. 
Basically, the food is very, very healthy. . . . We specialize in tacos and 
burritos, not in refried things like chimichangas. That dish is from Texas. 
It's not really Mexican. . . . Our tacos are as healthy as Chinese bean cakes."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SCHIFF, ROGAN CAMPAIGNS PASS UP SUMMER VACATION THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 EARLY START: You've heard about abstaining from drink before the sun sets over 
the yardarm? No Christmas shopping ads until after Thanksgiving? And no heavy 
politicking before Labor Day? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, forget the niceties, says Democratic Assembly hopeful Adam Schiff, who 
has launched a tough July offensive against his GOP foe, state Assemblyman 
James Rogan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to about 20,000 Republican households, Schiff is trying to shake 
GOP moderates out of the Rogan camp by lambasting the incumbent for supporting 
school vouchers and opposing abortion rights and bans on the sale of assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, also attacked Rogan, a former Municipal 
Court judge, for accepting financial support from "a group of wealthy Orange 
County fundamentalists . . . (that has) spent millions over the past two years 
to elect state legislative candidates who share their extremist social agenda." 
Unfortunately, Schiff adds, "Mr. Rogan has adopted far too many of their 
misguided policies." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Parke Skelton, Schiff's top political strategist, the Schiff 
campaign has also begun a phone survey of Republicans to get their views on 
choice, gun control and Christian fundamentalism. The response, Skelton said, 
has been "very good" after Republicans are told about both candidates' views. 
"We're seeing about 45% of the Republicans saying they'd support Adam," Skelton 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a better result than Skelton said he found when he launched a similar, 
early attack aimed at persuading GOP voters to turn against Republican Brad 
Parton in a 1992 South Bay race between Parton and Debra Bowen. Bowen, the 
Democrat, won that year in what was seen as a big blow to Christian 
fundamentalists' efforts to become a major political force. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, feeling the heat, has struck back with a mailing of his own to GOP 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the Democrats have targeted our district as one of their top five 
seats to take away from Republicans," Rogan wrote in a letter to voters last 
week. This has meant, among other things, that the state Democratic Party has 
begun a voter registration drive in the 43rd District to bring "new liberals to 
the Democrat Party," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, Rogan noted, the Democrats are signing up new voters "in welfare 
offices," the letter gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan urged his readers to help "get the 43rd Assembly District off the 
Democrat target list" by volunteering to help with a voter registration drive 
aimed at rounding up Republican voters and by contributing financially to his 
campaign. "Help ensure that the liberals will never find a safe haven in the 
43rd Assembly District," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this passion stirring about, 43rd District voters can forget about 
those politics-free dog days of summer. 
</P>
<P>

 OLIVE BRANCH POLITICS: Republican congressional candidate Richard Sybert is 
still having a tough time with Bob Hammer -- even after beating the runner-up 
by nearly a 3-to-1 margin in June's GOP primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said earlier this month that he would not back Sybert's bid to unseat 
U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) because of the way the former 
senior aide to Gov. Pete Wilson roughed him up during the GOP primary. The 
campaign included attacks that questioned Hammer's credentials as a businessman 
and accusations that he was an indifferent citizen for failing to vote in 
several elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert refused to take no for an answer, and in a letter this week he 
mounted a fresh offensive to win Hammer over. In a personal missive, Sybert 
said it was his intention to appoint Hammer to the Ventura County Republican 
Central Committee. Under party rules, Sybert is an ex-officio member of the 
committee and, beyond that, may name an alternate to serve in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Sybert politely warned Hammer that his refusal to endorse him -- and 
his willingness to talk about same to the media -- was only helping Beilenson. 
"You have to know that Mr. Beilenson will use your comments to help himself, 
and I can't believe you really want that after everything you said during the 
primary," Sybert wrote. "Let's meet over breakfast or lunch," the nominee 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hammer was unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the Central Committee offer, Hammer replied later in the week in a 
letter of his own. But, he added, his plans don't include getting deeply 
involved in party affairs, at least for the time being. "I'm trying to earn a 
living again," Hammer told The Times, repeating his unwillingness to back 
Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer is not alone as a holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Emery Shane, another GOP primary candidate in the 24th Congressional 
District, also has resisted Sybert. And again Sybert persists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Shane this week, Sybert urged reconciliation. "We all nurse 
grievances from the primary, but I don't think that justifies aiding and 
abetting the opposition, and I assure you Beilenson will take what you said and 
use it in the campaign." As for the nastiness of the campaign, "that's the 
nature of the beast," Sybert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 No word from Shane on how he's taking this latest peace overture. 
</P>
<P>

 QUOTAS: GOP candidate Gary Forsch is hoping east San Fernando Valley voters 
will be surprised -- and angered -- to learn that U.S. Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City) backed a little-known amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 
1991. That remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 No question that it's a tough sell for a virtually invisible congressional 
candidate to wow voters with tales about the twisted complexities of a 
legislative brouhaha from three years ago. But in this case the 1991 debate 
turned on the hot-button issues of quotas and the use of race norming to score 
hiring and admission tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about quotas recently, Berman said they were "obnoxious" to him and 
would not support them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Forsch, manager of a family-owned hardware store in Sun Valley, claims if 
that's really Berman's view, the congressman should have voted against the 
so-called Towns Amendment in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have pointed out that this measure, sponsored by the Congressional 
Black Caucus and named after its author, U.S. Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-New York), 
did NOT ban the use of quotas nor racial preferences in hiring tests, unlike 
compromise civil rights language that was being simultaneously backed by 
moderate House Democrats in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "That which is not banned is permissible," Forsch has argued in his effort to 
place the quota-system yoke around Berman's neck. "Since Mr. Berman did not 
insist upon the prohibition of quotas and race-norming, he has left the door 
open for their use." 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman claims his opponent is way off base. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the Towns Amendment did not speak to the issue of banning quotas -- 
but neither did it explicitly support them, Berman said. "Nor did it increase 
the penalties for using a gun during commission of a crime. It didn't do a lot 
of things," the congressman noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in a subsequent vote, Berman observed that he supported an amendment 
to the civil rights bill that did contain explicit language banning the use of 
quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect to hear more about quotas from Forsch, who has also advertised his 
position as well as Berman's in the Jewish newspaper the Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotas are particularly objectionable to Jews because they are often the ones 
most adversely affected by them, said Forsch, who is Jewish. The GOP candidate 
added that if elected, he would support federal legislation patterned after a 
state initiative sponsored by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Bill 
Leonard (R-San Bernardino) to prohibit the use of racial preferences in 
government hiring, school admissions policies and contracting.

PATRICK HILLINGS; CONGRESSMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Rep. Patrick J. Hillings, who replaced Richard Nixon in Congress and 
later became one of his advisers, died Wednesday in Rancho Mirage. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillings, who suffered from cancer, served four terms in the House of 
Representatives in the seat Nixon vacated when he was elected to the U.S. 
Senate in 1950. Hillings gave up the seat in 1958 to run for state attorney 
general, a race he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as an adviser to Nixon, and directed Ronald Reagan's Florida 
presidential campaign in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in Congress as an ardent anti-Communist, he also played a role in a 1951 
subcommittee investigation of major league baseball. He called the organized 
sport a monopoly because it had not then expanded west of the Mississippi. By 
1957, the year the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves 
to California, he said the National League had proven itself not to be 
monopoly-minded.

PAUL DELVAUX; SURREALIST ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Delvaux, whose surreal nudes and dreamlike depictions of skeletons and 
trains sell for $1 million and more, died Wednesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not formally a member of the surrealist movement, he was 
considered one of the last if not the last of that pioneering group that 
shocked and offended much of the art world in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian-born artist died in Veurne near the North Sea resort of St. 
Idesbald. Incapacitated by failing eyesight and poor health, the solitary 
artist had not painted in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux's career spanned almost 70 years, during which he gained fame for 
depicting the richness of the subconscious in figurative but irrational images. 
His work often reflected alienation and featured empty train stations, deserted 
vehicles or barren deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings hang alongside those of Salvador Dali and fellow Belgian Rene 
Magritte in many private collections and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young Girl in Front of a Temple," which was painted in 1949, sold for $1 
million 40 years later. Other major works included "Sleeping Venus" (1933) and 
"Evening Trains" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux began as a painter of portraits, land and seascapes in Belgium, but 
was influenced by surrealism in the 1930s after traveling in Italy and France. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1960s onward, his work had increased in value so that major museums 
in Europe and America were often the only places that could afford him.

YANKEES ROUGH UP FINLEY; BASEBALL: THEIR SIX-RUN FIFTH INNING HELPS THEM TO AN 
11-7 VICTORY OVER THE ANGELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels keep trying to tell themselves they're in a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 They keep trying to tell themselves they're due to go on a tear and scare the 
daylights out of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 They keep trying to tell themselves they can play with anybody, anytime, 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along come the New York Yankees, leaving the Angels to wonder whether 
they should shut up and forget all these silly thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees, showing the Angels that they're now playing with the big boys, 
stopped the Angels' three-game winning streak with an 11-7 victory Thursday 
night in front of 20,479 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The most painful aspect of the defeat is that it hits the Angels (42-55) when 
their confidence has never been higher, coming after a three-game sweep of the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on a night that Jimmy Key (15-2) appeared vulnerable, giving up four runs 
(three earned) and 10 hits in six innings, he still became the major league's 
first 15-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of picking up a game on the division-leading Rangers, the Angels fell 
back into third place, remaining five games behind Texas, with perhaps only a 
few weeks to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get on a roll real quick because of the (pending) strike," Angel 
third baseman Spike Owen said. "I'm not just talking about winning a few games 
in a row, but a real roll, like winning 12 of 13, 12 of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense a difference on our club, not only on the field, but in the dugout. 
It's a different feeling from what I saw before. It just never felt like a 
pennant race before. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not too many times you can make up ground in the standings, and we've 
got too take advantage of those nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, considering that the Angels are in the American League West, there 
still figure to be plenty of those nights left, but the point was well made. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be one of those classic Yankee-Red Sox races, or even a San 
Francisco-Atlanta race, but this still remains the closest the Angels have been 
to first place this late in a season since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're starting to realize they can win," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said. "They're realizing they really are in a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feeling you can't take for granted. You ought to relish it, and take 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, their self-esteem took a battering when the Yankees pummeled starter 
Chuck Finley in the fifth inning. The Yankees sent 11 batters to the plate, 
scoring six runs and producing five hits en route to Finley's worst inning of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley (7-9) gave up 10 hits and eight earned runs in 4 2/3 innings and kept 
alive the Angels' streak of allowing a home run in 14 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who produced 15 hits, trimmed the lead to 10-6 in the eighth 
inning and loaded the bases with two out for Bo Jackson, who had homered in the 
third. But reliever Bob Wickman struck him out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who scored in all but the first inning, simply could not overcome 
the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on it, I'm very disappointed because that offense is wasted," 
Finley said. "I'm not going to blame the offense, the defense or the overall 
team. I know I can win games, and I'm not doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just haven't thrown the ball consistently like I can, and it shows." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth began innocently enough when Mike Stanley led off by grounding out. 
Danny Tartabull walked. Jim Leyritz then doubled to left, driving in Tartabull 
and tying the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley walked Paul O'Neill, then struck out Randy Velarde for the second out. 
The rest, Finley figured, would be easy with the bottom of the order due up. 
</P>
<P>
 But No. 8 hitter Mike Gallego hit a run-scoring, ground-rule double. Pat Kelly 
hit a two-run single and stole second base. Bernie Williams hit a run-scoring 
single and also stole second. Then Don Mattingly singled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann yanked Finley before it got completely out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Scott Lewis stepped in and gave up a run-scoring double to Mike 
Stanley, making it 8-3. The inning finally came to an end when Tartabull flied 
to right.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE NOT ONLY AGED WELL, BUT OFTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jimmie Reese, the Angels' beloved conditioning coach, died last week it 
was generally thought that he was 92, but if you believe the Angel media 
guides, he aged 10 years in the last six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur Athletic Foundation's SportsLetter notes that the team's 1988 
media guide lists Reese's birth year as 1905, the 1992 book shows 1904 and the 
1994 edition says 1901. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Reese's death, an Angel spokesman commented on the discrepancies: "I 
think Jimmie was just protecting his age, or he just couldn't remember. But 
we've confirmed that we now have it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: The U.S. Women's Open golf tournament is being played this week 
in Lake Orion, Mich. Has it ever been held in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 Baddest deal: When one-sided trades are discussed, how about the Padres 
getting reliever Donnie Elliott and outfielders Melvin Nieves and Vince Moore 
from the Atlanta Braves for Fred McGriff? 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott (0-1) is still with the club, but Nieves is back with triple-A Las 
Vegas and Moore is sitting out the Class-A season with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff is batting .308 with 25 home runs and 68 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 How times change: Three years ago, Phil Simms and Jeff Hostetler battled for 
the New York Giants' starting quarterback job. This year, it's Kent Graham and 
Dave Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Blowing smoke: Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott, a smokers' rights advocate 
who defied an ordinance by smoking in her seat at Riverfront Stadium, will be 
grand marshal of the Ohio Tobacco Festival's annual parade Aug. 26. Whether she 
will light up in the procession is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf payoffs: The California State Open golf tournament will have a $75,000 
purse when it is played Aug. 16-19 at Indian Wells. That ranks sixth among 
states that hold championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado pays the best, $150,000, followed by Michigan at $103,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a happy camper: Dan Marino has been limping around the Miami Dolphins' 
practice field at Davie, Fla., and he doesn't care who knows that he is 
impatient over his slow recovery from surgery on a ruptured Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem is, I expect to be perfect all the time," the quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
 You had to see it: The Kansas City Royals pulled off an unlikely double steal 
Monday when 220-pound Dave Henderson swiped his second base of the year and 
235-pound Bob Hamelin stole his third. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1930, Pittsburgh Pirate third baseman Pie Traynor 
won both ends of a doubleheader with home runs -- in the ninth inning of the 
opener and the 13th inning of the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead: Lee Smith, the Baltimore Oriole relief pitcher, surprised his 
teammates when he brought a batch of bats to the All-Star game, especially 
since he never bats himself. His explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to get autographs, so I can sell them during the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough talk: Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson apparently hasn't been too 
pleased with second baseman Bret Boone, who compounded being in a three-for-24 
slump recently by missing signs. Asked if there was anything wrong with the 
player, Johnson said, "Nothing, unless it's another brain cramp." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Yes, in 1964 at the San Diego Country Club in Chula Vista, 
where Mickey Wright was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: New York Met announcer Ralph Kiner, on Wednesday's Dodger game:

 Boxing promoter Don King pleaded not guilty to wire fraud charges and signed a 
$250,000 personal recognizance bond set by New York Magistrate Nina Gershon in 
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the American system of justice and I will be cleared," King said 
outside the courtroom. "I've done nothing to warrant this action." 
</P>
<P>
 King was indicted July 14 on nine counts of wire fraud. He is accused of 
filing false documents with Lloyd's of London to collect $350,000 worth of 
training expenses after a fight between Julio Cesar Chavez, the World Boxing 
Council super-lightweight champion, and Harold Brazier was canceled in June of 
1991. Chavez was cut on the nose eight days before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, King faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine on each count.

GOLF ROUNDUP; SWEDEN'S ALFREDSSON SETS WOMEN'S RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweden's Helen Alfredsson broke the U . S . Women's Open record for a low 
round by two strokes with an eight-under-par 63 Thursday in the first round of 
the tournament at Lake Orion, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63 matches the lowest round in a major championship by any golfer, male or 
female. The only woman to reach that figure was Patty Sheehan at the 1984 LPGA 
Championship at King's Island, Ohio. It has been accomplished seven times in 
majors by men, the last by Vijay Singh in last year's PGA at Inverness. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson, whose only victory since joining the LPGA Tour in 1991 was the 
1993 Dinah Shore, played a bogey-free 18 holes over the 6,244-yard Old Course 
at Indianwood Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot an eight-under in Japan once, but it's certainly the best I've done 
out here," she said. "It was certainly nothing like the U.S. Open." 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance gave Alfredsson a three-stroke lead over Sheehan, Tammie 
Green, Judy Dickinson and amateur Carol Semple Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredsson broke the record of 65 shared by three others -- Little, Ayako 
Okamoto and Dickinson (when she was Judy Clark). Okamoto's 65 also came at 
Indianwood, during the 1989 Open. 
</P>

 Arnold Palmer, betrayed by a balky driver, bogeyed four of the final six holes 
and dropped four shots off the lead midway through the Senior British Open at 
Lytham, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Charles shot a three-under 69 and was at five-under 139 for two trips over 
the course at Royal Lytham and St. Annes. The left-hander from New Zealand was 
two strokes ahead of Doug Dalziel of Scotland and Tom Wargo.

 Four days after winning a tournament drenched by a Mississippi monsoon, Brian 
Henninger stayed hot -- and dry -- and shared the first-round lead in the New 
England Classic at Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Henninger birdied seven of the last nine holes and his seven-under 64 tied 
Mark Wurtz. They were one stroke ahead of Ronnie Black, Guy Boros and David 
Feherty. With little wind, 69 players broke par. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's playing very easy," Black said of the Pleasant Valley Country Club 
course. "I don't know what you'd change to make it play easier. Mow the rough a 
little maybe."

 John Daly took an unexpected break from a grueling six-week stretch of golf by 
withdrawing after struggling to a four-over 75.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; THERE'S NO INTEREST IN RUSSELL NOW 
</P>

 The Raiders are in training camp in Oxnard. The New England Patriots are in 
training camp in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 And Leonard Russell is sitting home in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the summer he envisioned. Not exactly what most people would 
envision for one of last season's 1,000-yard rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, a Patriot running back who has become expendable with the arrival of 
Marion Butts from the San Diego Chargers, had heard the rumors that he was 
headed to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, the Raiders explored the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 New England was asking for a second-round draft choice for Russell and might 
even be willing to settle for a third-rounder at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Raiders aren't interested. They're happy with their three tailback 
candidates -- Harvey Williams, Calvin Jones and Ty Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't rule out a bid for Russell at some point in the future if he's 
still available and their running game stumbles as it did last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But with that prospect appearing unlikely and nobody else banging on the 
Patriots' door for Russell, his only option is to accept New England's tender 
offer of $495,000. 
</P>

 The Raiders made some roster moves Thursday, exchanging a Thomas for a Thomas 
and a linebacker for a center. They cut wide receiver Tyrone Thomas and 
linebacker Keith Franklin and signed receiver Doug Thomas and center Matt 
Elliot. . . . Offensive tackle Greg Skrepenak, who injured an ankle Wednesday, 
is expected to be sidelined only a few days. . . . The Raiders will hold their 
annual family day Saturday at Channel Islands High in Oxnard, take Sunday off, 
then leave Monday for Barcelona, Spain, where they will open their exhibition 
season July 31 against the Denver Broncos. STEVE SPRINGER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; THOUGH BELLE HAS HIS REVENGE, WHITE SOX GET LAST WORD, 
6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take that, Albert Belle said with his bat, uncorking his third home run in as 
many games. 
</P>
<P>
 Take that, the Chicago White Sox answered with a 6-5 victory over the Indians 
on Thursday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a special game for Belle, a series-opener against the White Sox, who 
had caused him much embarrassment and, potentially, more money by complaining 
that he had a corked bat the last time they played, last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 He did then. Presumably he didn't Thursday, when his three-run homer, his 29th 
of the season, tied the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's a great hitter, corked bat or no corked bat," Chicago's Frank 
Thomas said. "He came out tonight and showed us what he could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas did too, hitting his 35th homer for the White Sox, who stretched their 
AL Central lead to three games over the Indians by winning the 17th of their 
last 21 games, 11 of 12 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning run scored in the eighth inning when, behind, 5-4, the White Sox 
got singles by Julio Franco and Robin Ventura. Warren Newson bunted and Murray 
slipped as he fielded it, throwing wildly past first to let Franco score the 
tying run. Mike LeValliere's sacrifice fly made it 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grass was wet, and when Eddie tried to make the throw, he was off 
balance," losing pitcher Dennis Martinez (9-5) said. "You cannot blame one 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Alvarez (11-5) gave up five runs -- four of them unearned -- and six 
hits in 7 2/3 innings. He retired the last 14 hitters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Texas 3 -- Paul Molitor hit two two-run homers and scored four runs 
at Toronto as the Blue Jays won their fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto has won 11 of its last 15 games to move six games under .500 for the 
first time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor, who hit his 10th and 11th homers, also scored the go-ahead run in the 
fifth inning. He reached on a fielder's choice, went to second on Joe Carter's 
walk, took third on a wild pitch and scored on John Olerud's sacrifice fly to 
put the Blue Jays on top, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 4, Baltimore 3 -- Geronimo Berroa singled home Mike Bordick from 
second base in the ninth inning, making a winner out of relief pitcher Dennis 
Eckersley (3-4) at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 3-3, Bordick opened the ninth with a single off Mark 
Eichhorn (5-4) and pinch-hitter Scott Hemond sacrificed. One out later, Scott 
Brosius walked and Berroa lined his game-winning single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Minnesota 3 -- Jose Valentin hit a three-run homer and the 
Brewers scored all their runs with two out in a victory at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin greeted right-handed reliever Carl Willis with his eighth homer on a 
1-and-0 pitch to cap a four-run sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Milwaukee rookies Matt Mieske and Mike Matheny hit back-to-back two-out 
homers off Jim Deshaies (5-10) in the second for a 2-1 Milwaukee lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee starter Bill Wegman (7-3) surrendered seven hits in seven innings to 
snap a personal three-game losing streak.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MADDUX ERA FALLS TO 1.71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The St. Louis Cardinals are already convinced that Greg Maddux will win a 
third consecutive Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't win it, I'd like the see the guy who does," Gregg Jefferies 
said after Maddux threw a five-hitter as the Atlanta Braves won, 6-1, to split 
a doubleheader Thursday at St. Louis. "He's obviously the best pitcher in both 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (13-5) has three consecutive complete games and leads the major leagues 
with eight complete games. He lowered his earned-run average to 1.71 -- more 
than a point lower than any other starter -- and tied Ken Hill of Montreal for 
the league lead in victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Olivares pitched a three-hitter and Jefferies went three for four with 
three runs batted in as the Cardinals won the first game, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare six-game series continues with another doubleheader tonight and 
single games Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux struck out eight and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves knocked out John Frascatore, making his major league debut, in 3 
1/3 innings. Tony Tarasco hit a run-scoring double and Fred McGriff followed 
with his 26th home run in a three-run first. Javier Lopez hit a three-run home 
run, his 12th, in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Frascatore (0-1), who was called up before the game from triple-A Louisville, 
gave up all six runs and seven hits. He was optioned back to Louisville after 
the game to make room for Tom Urbani, who will start the first game today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, Olivares (2-2) gave up all three hits and three runs in the 
first two innings, and the only Atlanta baserunners in the next five innings 
came on a pair of walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivares retired the final 16 batters to win for the first time in eight 
starts. He walked five and struck out two. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies had a run-scoring double in the first and RBI singles in the second 
and fourth off John Smoltz (6-10), who worked six innings and gave up six runs 
on 11 hits in his 200th career start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw a lot of pitches that were in a bad location," Smoltz said. "Three 
runs should have been enough for me. I'm as frustrated as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 13, Pittsburgh 6 -- Ken Caminiti drove in four runs and Andujar Cedeno 
hit a three-run homer to help Pete Harnisch win his fifth consecutive start as 
the Astros won at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnisch (7-4) is unbeaten since returning from the 15-day disabled list on 
June 30. He gave up two runs and five hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston built a 7-0 lead after three innings against Zane Smith (9-8), who 
gave up nine runs and nine hits in 3 2/3 innings.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; PITCHER BOSKIE ACQUIRED BY MARINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Shawn Boskie was traded to the Seattle Mariners by the Philadelphia 
Phillies for a minor league player to be named. Boskie, 27, is 4-6 with a 5.23 
ERA in 18 games and 84 1/3 innings this season, including 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners said Boskie is expected to join them in Boston on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi will miss no games during his 
treatment for chronic back problems, a team spokesman said. Larry Shenk said 
Fregosi was expected to be released from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital 
today before the Phillies play host to the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians put right-hander Mark Clark on the 15-day disabled list 
and recalled right-hander Jerry DiPoto from triple-A Charlotte. Clark's right 
wrist was broken Wednesday night when he was hit on the pitching hand by a line 
drive by Texas' Gary Redus. Cleveland's winningest pitcher, Clark (11-3) will 
be in a cast for four to six weeks. 
</P>

<P>
 Owners will vote this year on whether to consider expansion. Bud Selig, 
baseball's acting commissioner, has been under congressional pressure to take 
the step and Tuesday sent a letter promising the vote to Sen. Dennis DeConcini. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Democrat, a member of the Judiciary Committee, has local interest 
in the matter, with Phoenix a leading prospect for expansion, along with St. 
Petersburg, Fla.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; MEDIOCRE RACE, MEDIOCRE FIELD: IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
BEST PAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're a trainer with a California-bred who hasn't done much lately, and then 
you see an oasis: Hollywood Park has carded a race with conditions best suited 
to struggling horses. Your horse has to run only seven furlongs. All he has to 
do is beat other Cal-breds. It costs only $200 to enter and the purse is 
$60,000. How tough can it be? Wrap it up, you'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hitch is that trainers with horses that have earned $4 million read 
the condition books too. That is why Best Pal will return to the races tonight 
in an unlikely spot -- the third race on the program, the first running of the 
Answer Do Stakes. Five other horses are being led to this oasis, but none of 
them figure to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the cast. Best Pal has earned $4.8 million, more than any horse 
except Alysheba ($6.6 million), John Henry ($6.5 million), Sunday Silence ($4.9 
million) and Easy Goer ($4.8 million). The five other starters in the Answer Do 
have earned $424,475. The 81 horses running in all nine races tonight have 
earned about $700,000 less than Best Pal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the horses in the race is Years Of Dreaming, Best Pal's entrymate, who 
is also owned by John and Betty Mabee. Another entrant is winless in 11 starts 
this year. Another is undefeated in the two races it has run. And another is 
one for 19, lifetime, and hasn't raced in almost 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal hasn't run in more than five months himself and is winless since 
October. In his last start, he ran seventh as the favorite in the San Antonio 
Handicap at Santa Anita, and a postrace examination showed he had bled from the 
lungs, even though he had been treated with Lasix. The 6-year-old gelding was 
sent to his owners' farm near San Diego for a rest. Meantime, the Mabees and 
Gary Jones had a disagreement, and when Best Pal was ready to resume training, 
Richard Mandella was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The first goal for Mandella is to win the Pacific Classic, the $1-million race 
at Del Mar on Aug. 13. Under Jones, Best Pal won the inaugural Classic in 1991. 
Best Pal has won two other $1-million races: the Hollywood Futurity for his 
original trainer, Ian Jory, in 1990, and the Santa Anita Handicap under Jones 
in 1992. Alysheba is the only other horse to have won three races worth $1 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella had been saying lately that Best Pal's Pacific Classic prep would be 
the $125,000 San Diego Handicap, a 1 1/16-mile race at Del Mar on July 30. On 
Thursday, just back from the yearling sales in Lexington, Ky., Mandella 
explained the change: 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get him ready for the Pacific Classic by running him around two 
turns, and he hasn't sprinted since I don't know when. But if he wins this 
race, maybe it'll pick his head up. It should set him up good for the Classic. 
I haven't had a chance to look at the other horses, and maybe there's somebody 
in there who'll be faster than us. But the way my horse has been training, he 
should win. Racing at night shouldn't bother him. It might even help, because 
it'll be cooler." 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning the Hollywood Gold Cup a year ago, Best Pal has won only one of 
five starts, and that lone victory, in October, was little more than a workout 
accompanied by a paycheck -- a 3 1/2-length canter past Cal-breds in the 
California Cup Classic at Santa Anita. After that, he ran 10th in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic, also at Santa Anita, and his poor showing in the San Antonio 
followed a second-place finish in the San Pasqual Handicap. There was good 
reason to wonder if he was good enough to beat the best horses anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Black won the Hollywood Gold Cup with Best Pal and continued to ride him 
after that, but he is being replaced by Kent Desormeaux tonight. Desormeaux won 
four consecutive races with the horse in 1992, including the Strub Stakes and 
the Santa Anita and Oaklawn handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal has 14 victories, eight seconds and three thirds in 33 races, and the 
last time he ran at a distance less than a mile was when he won the Balboa 
Stakes at Del Mar in 1990, in his fourth start. The $80,325 Balboa was also 
Best Pal's last start in a race worth less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He carries 117 pounds tonight, four fewer than Years Of Dreaming, the same as 
three of his rivals and his lightest impost since he won the Pacific Classic 
with 116 pounds on Aug. 10, 1991. A 3-year-old running against older horses, he 
got an eight-pound concession that day. Earlier in the year, he had carried 10 
pounds more, finishing second to Strike The Gold in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park is where Best Pal ran his first race, on May 18, 1990, and he 
has won four of five starts on dirt there. His debut was against maidens, going 
five furlongs, and he won by a half-length for Pat Valenzuela. He wasn't even 
the favorite, going off at 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 That was about right for a Cal-bred gelding, a son of Habitony, from a barn 
that wasn't winning many races. When he was a yearling, there was never any 
thought about selling him. On a good bidding day, he might have brought 
$10,000. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After Gov. Pete Wilson signed the North-South betting bill Thursday, Hollywood 
Park announced that it will expand Saturday's card by offering betting on four 
races from the Solano County Fair. Hollywood also plans to offer full cards 
from the major Northern California tracks, Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields. 
Before the new bill, only races worth $20,000 or more could be imported. 
</P>
<P>
 After a court dismissed Kent Desormeaux's appeal, the stewards ruled that the 
jockey must serve a five-day suspension, starting Sunday. The other days will 
be Monday, closing day at Hollywood, plus the first three days of the Del Mar 
meeting, which starts Wednesday. Desormeaux had appealed the suspension he was 
given when his mount, The Wicked North, was disqualified and dropped from first 
place to fourth in the Santa Anita Handicap. Under California's designated-race 
rule, Desormeaux will still be able to ride Golden Klair, the high weight in 
Sunday's $300,000 Vanity Handicap. . . . Desormeaux is third in the national 
purse standings with $6.2 million. Ahead of him are Mike Smith, with $8.3 
million, and Gary Stevens, with $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 R Friar Tuck, who was 22-1 when he won the Affirmed Handicap on July 2, is 
among six horses entered in Saturday's $200,000 Swaps Stakes. The field, in 
post-position order: R Friar Tuck, Pollock's Luck, Valiant Nature, Wild 
Invader, Dramatic Gold and Silver Music. . . . After Best Pal, the next active 
horse on the money list is Devil His Due, 16th with $3.3 million. . . . Glass 
Ceiling, who hadn't run since November, won Thursday for her fourth victory in 
six starts. . . . A race later, Sikes won his third in a row on grass.

FAMALARO'S MOTHER ASSAILS TOWN'S 'LYING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From her next-door window, Anne Famalaro has been watching her family tragedy 
unfold day by day. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching as authorities search for more clues at her son's Prescott Country 
Club home that would link John J. Famalaro to the murder of Denise Huber. And 
listening uncomfortably as neighbors and others describe her son's "secretive" 
nature and herself alternately as combative and domineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are doing a lot of lying to build a juicy case here," she 
said in an interview at her home. "It is unbelievable what they are saying. 
This is killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Anne Famalaro, a self-proclaimed Christian conservative, emerged from 
seclusion Thursday, outraged by the "talk on the street" and bewildered by the 
personal criticisms leveled against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Attired in a modest housedress and her gray hair styled close to her tanned 
face, Famalaro's hands moved in rapid gestures as she addressed the crisis 
facing her son whose name is now casually spoken among curious patrons in local 
sandwich shops and barrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Famalaro remains devoted to her son, who she describes as a "very 
hard-working man" -- so dedicated to his business pursuits as a painter, real 
estate agent and home remodeler that she rarely saw him in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hardly knew what John was doing or where he was going," she said. "He would 
leave early in the morning and return late in the evening. He worked so hard 
last year that he came down with pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everybody else seems to think they know what he was doing," she said. 
"Those people all want their 15 minutes of fame." 
</P>
<P>
 She has said that she was never suspicious of the Ryder rental truck parked in 
the driveway, since her son's work required him to haul paint and other 
materials for his work. Neither, according to authorities, did she question the 
presence of an extension cord that sometimes ran from the truck to an outside 
plug at her home, about 100 yards away. That cord powered the freezer in which 
Huber's body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I have been leading a very isolated life until now," she said. 
"We are the kind of people who like being with one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes sweeping her own spacious home, Famalaro said the house was built 
before her husband had become sick a short time ago with Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not doing very well. This is hurting him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to neighbors, the family's spot in this quiet retirement community 
has always been regarded with some curiosity. But of all the family members, 
Anne Famalaro has been clearly the most visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Her conservative politics have led to her to become involved in campaigns to 
chase gambling interests from the area. Considered an astute businesswoman, 
local real estate agent Neil Prill said, she purchased a number of investment 
properties from him and turned them into profitable sales. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, though, Anne Famalaro has always been seen as 
extremely strident in her dealings with others and fiercely protective of her 
family's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I ran a tight ship," she said of her maternal role in the family. "But 
if I were a liberal and my kids got into trouble, people would have said it was 
because I was too liberal. Since I am a conservative Christian, they are making 
me out to be a domineering mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially troubling, she said, have been recent published accounts from 
neighbors that she did not approve of her son bringing female friends to his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do they get that kind of stuff?" she said. "That's just not true. . . . 
For anyone to say that is just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, she blames law enforcement officials for spreading false information 
about the family in daily briefings with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see them over there," she said, nodding to her son's home, "leaking 
information to reporters all the time. They are trying to build a case any way 
they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because I've been involved in politics," she said. "Maybe (that 
involvement) is all coming back now to kiss me off. You know all the suffering 
that Jesus went through? That's what's happening to me right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has been advised not to speak about the case and has been keeping 
a low profile since her son's arrest more than a week ago, increased attention 
was brought to her Wednesday when defense attorney Lawrence William Katz said 
he was dismissed from the case in favor of a Catholic lawyer in keeping with 
the family's strong religious ties. Katz is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of such a thing in my life," Katz said Thursday. "I put my 
heart and soul into this case. I liked him. I looked at him as the 
guy-next-door type who needed a real aggressive defense. We got along well. I 
don't know what the hell she did, but John was not a factor in that decision. 
It was her. . . . She has (John) gripped like a vise. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened here, I think, is that they wanted somebody cheaper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by Katz's remarks, Famalaro said religion played no role in Katz's 
replacement. She said Kelly "offered me a hand when I needed one." 
</P>
<P>
 From the very beginning, Anne Famalaro seems to have remained close to her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 She was in the red Jeep when her son was stopped near their Prescott Country 
Club homes and taken into custody. Pointing to abrasions on her lower lip, she 
said the ordeal left her so shaken that she nearly bit clear through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his illness, Angelo Famalaro has been accompanying his wife to the 
Yavapai County Jail to visit their son on every available occasion. They were 
there again Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, I think the end is coming," she said. "There are bad things 
happening out there. I am counting on Jesus to bring our family through this."

JUDGE SAYS HE'LL DEFY '3 STRIKES' SENTENCING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Lawrence Antolini is not what you would call soft on crime. A former 
prosecutor, he is a no-nonsense jurist who was named to the Sonoma County 
Superior Court by Mr. Law and Order himself, former Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 As Antolini puts it: "I'm not exactly a flaming liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the judge this week declared war on something dear to the hearts 
of California's most hard-core crime busters -- the state's new "three strikes 
and you're out" law. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be the first episode of its kind, Antolini announced that he will 
defy the law and refuse to send a Santa Rosa man to state prison for getting 
caught with a marijuana cigarette on a county honor farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am all for protecting society from violent, repeat offenders," the judge 
said in an interview. "But that's not what we have in this case. This man is 
not a threat to anyone, and to send him away like the law requires would be 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
 As Antolini sees it, applying the "three strikes" law in the case of Jeffrey 
Dean Missamore would be unconstitutional. Sentencing such a nonviolent offender 
to a state prison term, the judge says, would amount to cruel and unusual 
punishment in violation of the 8th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Antolini also believes the law turns judges into "robots," stripping them of 
their discretion to decide what sort of punishment fits a given crime. And he 
predicts that the statute will bankrupt the state by requiring the construction 
of prisons to house a ballooning population of convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "three strikes" law, an offender with two serious or violent 
felonies faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of a third felony of any 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma County Dist. Atty. Gene Tunney said he admires the judge for going out 
on a limb but disagrees with his position in the case at hand. If Antolini 
makes good on his pledge to ignore the sentence mandated by the "three strikes" 
law, "we will appeal and we will win," Tunney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antolini is not the first judge to protest the controversial law, enacted 
March 7 by the Legislature in the wake of the gruesome kidnaping and murder of 
12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Barbara County, a municipal judge recently called the law "a piece of 
junk" and reduced a "three strikes" felony case to a misdemeanor to circumvent 
its harsh sentencing mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, a retired judge filling in on the municipal bench took a 
similar step, reducing a petty theft charge from a felony to a misdemeanor and 
declaring the law unconstitutional as applied in the case before him. In 
another San Diego case, a judge ordered a defendant's two prior felony 
convictions dropped, sparing the man a possible life sentence for stealing a 
beer from a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 "This law has put judges in a terrible position," said Constance Dove, 
executive director of the California Judges Assn. "It removes their discretion 
to decide what level of punishment is fair given the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the Sonoma County dispute is Missamore, an auto mechanic and 
ex-Marine. Missamore, 32, has been in and out of trouble -- none of it 
involving violence -- for about a decade, a record he attributes to his drug 
habit and alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 The case dates to April, when he was caught with eight grams of marijuana and 
rolling papers at a county honor farm. He was at the facility to serve a 
four-month sentence for stealing $12 worth of food from a grocery store, which 
his attorney said he needed to feed his family. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Missamore pleaded no contest to the marijuana charge, a felony. 
Because he had a prior felony conviction -- for a 1984 burglary in which he 
stole his roommate's VCR -- the new offense meant Missamore fell under a 
provision of the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that provision, Missamore must be sentenced to up to eight years in 
prison. But in a move that stunned the Sonoma County courthouse, Antolini 
declared that he will not follow that mandate when he formally sentences 
Missamore on Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the judge indicated that he will send Missamore to jail for one year, 
place him on probation for up to five years and order him to enter a 
residential treatment program for drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who has no violence in his past, who is doing well in drug 
rehabilitation and who has a 5-month-old child," Antolini said in the 
interview. "I don't believe he's the kind of person the Legislature had in mind 
when they passed this law." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Kathleen Pozzi, Missamore's attorney, called Antolini's 
action "courageous and unusual," describing him as a "strict, tough judge who 
doesn't hesitate to send people to prison for long periods of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pozzi said her client wept with relief after the judge announced his 
intention: "He's been beating himself up about the marijuana because he knows 
that was a dumb thing to do. But he didn't feel he was the kind of person this 
law was aimed at. He is not a violent guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Antolini said his stand has triggered a flood of public reaction -- all of it 
supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting congratulated in the hallways by clerks and lawyers, but I'm also 
getting calls from regular people who say, 'I'm a conservative Republican but I 
support what you're doing,' " Antolini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, father of Polly Klaas, was among those who praised the judge. 
Klaas said the "three strikes" law casts "too wide a net" and should have 
focused on violent criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite such support, Antolini faces long odds if his decision is appealed, as 
expected, by the district attorney, several legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morally, he's entirely right because this law is idiotic," said Robert 
Weisberg, a professor of criminal law at Stanford University. "But legally, I'm 
afraid he's on the wrong side of the U.S. Supreme Court."

COLLEGES FEAR RESEARCH CUTS BY PENTAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major universities in California are girding for what they call an educational 
calamity if current efforts in Congress succeed in slashing the Pentagon's 
budget for academic research contracts by 50% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks, already approved by the full House, will be considered next week 
by the Senate Appropriations Committee -- triggering an intense lobbying 
campaign by California institutions and the California congressional 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Senate does not concur with the severity of the House cuts, a 
compromise would probably still result in serious cutbacks in university 
research, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Appropriations Committee initiated the effort out of growing concern 
that the readiness of combat forces has eroded too far, while academic research 
has gone unscathed. Moreover, critics charge that much of the research is 
wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 California schools, a major recipient of the contracts, collectively stand to 
lose half of their annual defense research funding, which totaled $236 million 
in fiscal 1993. The cutbacks would particularly hurt USC, UCLA, Stanford 
University and UC San Diego, though virtually every state and private campus 
would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering school at UCLA gets more than half of its research contracts 
from the Pentagon, amounting to about $18.7 million annually. Loss of contracts 
would curtail stipends for graduate and postgraduate students, as well as 
reduce spending for new laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the cuts would damage the school's ability to conduct basic 
scientific research, affecting what it considers one of its central educational 
missions, said Kumar Patel, UCLA vice chancellor for research. "It is a 
disaster," Patel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials have joined forces with Patel and others, arguing that the 
cuts would rob the military of its future technology leadership while doing 
little to solve the defense budget problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "This reduction in defense research would have very dire results," Anita 
Jones, the Pentagon's director of defense research and engineering, said in an 
interview. "You will not see them immediately, but over the long term they 
would be severe." 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1993, the Pentagon issued $1.9 billion in research contracts to 
about 580 universities nationwide, providing the largest block of federal 
support for basic university research in most engineering, physical sciences 
and computer sciences disciplines. The House cuts would pare about $950 million 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, universities get most of their medical, biological and other life 
sciences research funded through a variety of non-defense agencies, which are 
not subject to significant cutbacks this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the defense-sponsored research has yielded such important results 
as the atomic clocks for the global positioning satellite system that is 
rapidly moving into the consumer economy. Pentagon sponsorship also led to the 
creation of the Internet, the computer network that is fast becoming a key 
building block of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks also demonstrate the continuing vulnerability of California and 
its key institutions to the federal defense budget, which has continued to drop 
since 1986, but is still far from bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, university research funding by the Pentagon had gone 
unscathed and in fact had shown some modest increases. Because it is not 
appropriated as a lump sum, but rather as part of many other budgets, Congress 
had not focused on it until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, has grown increasingly worried that military preparedness is 
becoming weak and therefore spending not directly related to military forces 
must be sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
 The case for continued high university research was also hurt by disclosures 
in recent years of extravagant spending at taxpayer expense for such faculty 
perks as expensive meals, big liquor bills and even a yacht at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, said that after years of cutbacks affecting every other sector of 
the military, it was time for universities "to take their fair share" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said that if the Senate does not go along with the House position, the 
cuts might be reduced in severity, though not eliminated, in a later conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the universities are screaming . . . but there have been extra 
cuts in our military readiness, and research has gone unscathed," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon denied that Murtha's motivation for the cuts was as a retaliation 
against Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), chairman of the House Space, 
Science and Technology Committee, who has led a fight against Murtha's support 
of alleged pork barrel projects at universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Loren Thompson, an expert on defense procurement issues, said the 
cutbacks are justified because military forces have been cut far deeper than 
overall defense budgets. Congress, he said, has been reluctant to cut overhead 
and frills even as the number of aircraft, ships and tanks has rapidly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support costs of our defense Establishment are killing our ability to 
maintain a fighting force," Thompson said. "This creates a bureaucratic 
structure like a worm: all tail and no teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 But for strapped educational institutions, the proposed cuts would come at an 
inopportune time, university officials say. USC received about $50 million in 
research contracts from the Pentagon last year, the most of any campus in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech received $16 million in defense research contracts last year, 
representing 10% of the school's entire research budget, a spokesman said. Most 
of the impact would fall at Caltech's engineering school. The same problem 
affects Stanford, which received $42 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other University of California schools, Berkeley received $16.6 million 
in fiscal 1993, Irvine $5.6 million, Santa Barbara $15.8 million and San Diego 
$46 million. The California State University system received $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Dire predictions have prompted lobbying efforts to head off the cutbacks next 
week in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), among other members of the delegation, has 
asked Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, not to follow Murtha's lead on research funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer argued that the cuts "would seriously undermine the research base that 
is critical to so many aspects of our national security." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, California Assembly members wrote a letter to Murtha protesting the 
cuts, as did a large number of university officials from around the country. 
Congressional sources said it is too early to say what Inouye will do.

O.C. STORAGE UNIT MAY HAVE BEEN SITE OF HUBER MURDER; INVESTIGATION: 
AUTHORITIES HAVE FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE BLOOD IN LAGUNA HILLS FACILITY RENTED 
BY SUSPECT JOHN FAMALARO AT TIME NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN VANISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case have found what appears to be 
blood in an Orange County storage facility once rented by suspect John J. 
Famalaro, and authorities are trying to determine whether the Newport Beach 
woman was killed there, law enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as an Arizona grand jury indicted Famalaro, a 37-year-old house painter, 
on first-degree murder charges, law enforcement sources in Orange County 
revealed that authorities were testing the substance found in the Laguna Hills 
storage complex to see if it indeed was blood and to determine if it matched 
Huber's. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have combed the unit that Famalaro was renting in June, 1991 -- 
when Huber disappeared -- using a laser and an evidence-enhancing substance 
known as Luminol, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been doing tests at night. They've pulled up the carpet, searching 
for blood and hair," said Christy Clow, property manager at the storage 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, 23, vanished three years ago in Costa Mesa while heading home from a 
concert. Her nude and handcuffed body was found last week in a freezer outside 
Famalaro's country club home, about 75 miles north of Phoenix. She had suffered 
multiple blows to the head, and her eyes and mouth had been covered with cloth 
and sealed with duct tape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other significant developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * A team of investigators from Orange County -- including chief forensic 
pathologist Richard Fukumoto and other crime scene specialists -- was preparing 
to travel to Arizona today to meet with counterparts there to discuss the case 
and, presumably, take up jurisdictional issues, which, in light of Thursday's 
revelations, will likely take on added import. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court documents filed in Yavapai County, Arizona, revealed numerous 
additional items seized from Famalaro's home and vehicles in recent days, 
including a black whip, a microcassette marked "Save -- Important," a brown 
paper sack with two keys and pubic hair, and a 1977 Playboy pictorial entitled 
"Sexy Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 * Contacted by telephone, some of six additional women whose names were found 
in subsequent searches of Famalaro's belongings said they had no clue as to how 
Famalaro came into possession of their effects. "Good God! Even my middle 
initial," said Donna R. Evinger, 57, of Tustin. "I'm pretty shook up. . . . I'm 
alive; I can say that." 
</P>
<P>
 * After a three-day search, authorities located Deborah Aileen Clark, one of 
11 women whose identification and personal effects had previously turned up in 
a search of Famalaro's home. Police found her in a Glendale, Ariz., tavern she 
frequents, allaying concerns for her welfare and reinforcing some 
investigators' belief that the case involves one bizarre crime rather than 
multiple killings, as initially feared. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joining newly appointed defense counsel Thomas K. Kelly is Warren R. Darrow, 
an attorney who Kelly said is a distant relative of famed defense lawyer 
Clarence Darrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Ballou, who helped Famalaro measure his freezer in January to see if it 
would fit in his Prescott Country Club house, said Famalaro warned him "not to 
look in it." He also expressed surprise that Famalaro could be involved in such 
a bizarre crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "John didn't seem like he would do that," Ballou said. "He was strange, but in 
a normal sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Clow, the property manager for the Laguna Hills storage facility, at 23192 
Verdugo Drive, said Thursday that police have been conducting forensic tests 
inside a unit that had been leased to Famalaro from February, 1991, to 
September, 1992. Huber disappeared June 3, 1991, after her car blew a tire on 
the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronted by eucalyptus trees, the one-story warehouse containing Unit B is 
located in a mostly nondescript light industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Clow said investigators told her Unit B was a potential crime scene in the 
Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts familiar with the type of high-tech devices being used to search the 
warehouse confirmed that they can be used only in low light, and most 
efficiently at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Luminol reacts with blood, it's very faint," said Donald J. Johnson, a 
senior criminalist with the scientific services bureau of the Los Angeles 
County sheriff's office. "In order to see it, it has to be dark." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a moonbeam coming through a window can disrupt the test," said 
Johnson, adding that his agency schedules all of its Luminol probes at night. 
</P>
<P>
 John Conley, an Orange County assistant district attorney, confirmed Thursday 
that investigators have focused on a "possible" Orange County murder scene 
linked to Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to discuss where that site was but said investigators have 
examined the location for the past several days, trying to determine if Huber 
was slain there. He would not confirm or deny whether detectives have 
discovered blood evidence there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police are in the course of investigating that very topic," Conley said. "At 
the present time, the investigation is still ongoing as to whether the murder 
scene can be shown to be in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should the murder scene be proven to have been in Orange County," Conley 
added, "we could have jurisdiction" and try Famalaro here instead of in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 From Arizona, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith confirmed that authorities in 
Orange County are using special equipment at three locations, including the 
Verdugo Drive venue in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do right now is establish the location where Denise was 
murdered. We are looking at only those three locations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another law enforcement source said: "It may be that the crime actually 
occurred in Orange County -- in sheriff's office territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Clow said Famalaro was evicted in September, 1992, because he fell behind in 
rent payments. Following the eviction, Clow discovered he had been living in 
the unit -- which is against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure there, Famalaro painted the windows at the front of the 
facility black so people could not look in, Clow said. "It was very strange," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro moved out, he left a small refrigerator, a sleeping mat, a hot 
plate, paint cans and garbage, Clow said. "There was nothing juicy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although any evidence garnered at the storage facility may be 3 years old, 
experts said Thursday that today's technology is more than sufficient to 
provide a detailed analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in some cases where there's been an identification (of a 
victim) years after the crime has been committed," said Cyril Wecht, one of the 
country's leading forensic pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Using argon lasers and Luminol, investigators can enhance clues that are 
invisible to the eye in daylight so that they glow in the dark like tiny 
beacons, experts said. They can detect bodily fluids and trace evidence such as 
semen, fibers, blood and the residue left behind by fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with only a tiny splotch of dried blood, it is possible to identify a 
victim years after a crime has been committed, Johnson from the Los Angeles 
County sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most discriminating DNA test, we need no more than a bloodstain the 
size of a quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberating in secret in Prescott, Ariz., the Yavapai County Grand Jury 
indicted Famalaro on first-degree murder charges, making him eligible for the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury heard testimony from Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher 
before also returning an indictment on a felony grand theft count alleging that 
Famalaro stole a Ryder rental truck containing the freezer with Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapped by Famalaro on Wednesday, new defense lawyers Kelly and Darrow said 
they expected to file several motions in the next few days, but Darrow declined 
to reveal any strategy. Unlike former defense lawyer Lawrence William Katz, who 
was fired Wednesday, Darrow said he and Kelly would not discuss strategy 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who had aggressively criticized the case against Famalaro as 
circumstantial, said Wednesday that he was dismissed because he is Jewish and 
Famalaro's mother wanted a Catholic lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday Katz offered another reason for his abrupt termination: "I was 
too expensive," he said. "I'm just aghast. That has never happened to me 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 1 in 
Yavapai County Superior Court. Authorities will have 10 days after arraignment 
to notify Famalaro whether they intend to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 If Arizona authorities decide to make it a death penalty case, the issue of 
where the case would be tried takes on added significance. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, prosecutors must prove that the murder entailed "special 
circumstances" -- such as during a rape or involving more than one victim -- 
before they can seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, the law takes a more liberal view: Prosecutors can seek the death 
penalty by arguing that the murder alone was an "especially heinous, cruel or 
depraved" crime. Prosecutors proffered that argument Wednesday when they 
persuaded a judge to keep Famalaro held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the nuances of the differing capital punishment statutes, some 
observers have speculated that Famalaro would face the toughest time in 
Arizona, unless authorities here possess strong enough evidence to prove 
"special circumstances" -- that Huber was kidnaped from California or the 
victim of another felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Prosecutor Tom Lindberg sought to downplay jurisdictional 
issues. "We want to try the case in the jurisdiction it belongs and where there 
is the greatest likelihood for a conviction," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is evidence to rebut the assumption that the murder happened in the 
county where the body was found and that turns out to be California, we will be 
sending the case there," he said, declining to comment on whether any evidence 
has surfaced indicating that the murder took place in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities press to pinpoint when and where Huber was killed, 
investigators have said they suspect Huber was bludgeoned shortly after her 
abduction and then carted around in a freezer for three years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take several days before coroner's and crime lab reports will be 
released, according to prosecutor Lindberg, as is the case for pending forensic 
tests on the blood-like stains found on evidence seized from Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities plan to hold Huber's body at least until next week, and the 
autopsy may not be completed for 2 1/2 weeks. And a source said Thursday that 
defense attorneys may soon file a motion asking that their own forensic 
pathologist review the body, which could add delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, police obtained a third search warrant for Famalaro's home, a 
vehicle parked in front of Famalaro's home and two trucks Famalaro used in his 
work that are parked in front of his mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for additional places where there might be the possibility 
of blood," Lindberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior searches of Famalaro's hilltop home have unearthed a crowbar and claw 
hammer that appear to be bloodied, strips of white cloth and a tarp, also 
stained with a crimson-colored substance, and items belonging to Huber, 
including clothing, jewelry and a purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the hammer and crowbar are being regarded by investigators as possible 
murder weapons. Both are consistent with the type of wounds Huber suffered to 
her skull, which suffered as many as 10 blows from a blunt-edged instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's disappearance three years ago touched off a nationwide search, and 
authorities Thursday noted the irony that her body might have been here in 
Orange County for a good portion of that time.

Hernandez, David Reyes, Tracy Weber, Michael Granberry and Rebecca Trounson

COMET COLLISIONS END WITH SHOWSTOPPERS; SPACE: DRAMA ON JUPITER CALLED BIGGEST 
EVENT EVER SEEN BY TELESCOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bombardment of Jupiter climaxed late Thursday in a brutal finale to what 
some astronomers called the most extraordinary event in the 300 years 
telescopes have been trained on the gas giant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a thunderstorm of debris, four more fragments struck the planet, including 
the last of a series of mountain-sized pieces that exploded in overlapping 
fireballs at 10-hour intervals on the same spot. Each of the large blasts 
carried a force believed to be many times greater than Earth's nuclear arsenal. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The final major piece of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was to hit just after 
midnight, completing a ring of crater-like plumes of swirling superheated gas 
and debris thousands of miles across. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit Jupiter like a string of machine-gun bullets," said Eugene Shoemaker, 
an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., who helped 
discover the comet last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage of the last fragment signals the end of a celestial traveler that 
has circled the solar system since the creation of the planets, astronomers 
said. The dark plumes from the 21 fragments that hit Jupiter will remain 
visible for several days, even to small amateur telescopes on Earth, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hundreds of reports from observatories the world over and in the 
telemetry from five watching spacecraft, scientists may find the clues to some 
of the most fundamental puzzles of the planets and the solar system.  
</P>
<P>
 Sensors show that the impacts stirred a brimstone soup of ammonia, sulfur, 
hydrogen and helium in the Jovian atmosphere, scientists at NASA's Goddard 
Space Flight Center in Maryland said. That might lead to a better understanding 
of the reds, yellows and browns of Jupiter's signature clouds.  
</P>
<P>
 The comet's passage also released electrically charged particles that kindled 
unusual flares in the planet's aurora, said Renee Prange, of the French 
Institute Astrophysique Spatiale. That may help scientists better understand 
the enormous magnetic fields that protect planets such as Jupiter and Earth 
from solar gales of charged particles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the traces of molecules from the fragments, they hope to finally solve the 
riddle of the composition of comets, which are believed to be fossils that 
survived the birth of the solar system. Most scientists believe that comets are 
made of water, ice, rock and dust, but so far astronomers have not found any 
sign of water in the fireballs and gas plumes produced by the bombardment.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can't understand what happened on Jupiter until we really understand what 
plunged into Jupiter," said Hal Weaver at the Space Telescope Science Institute 
in Baltimore, underscoring the importance of determining the constituent 
elements of the comet. He is leading the scientists analyzing the images from 
the Hubble Space Telescope's new wide field planetary camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The shock of the explosions also sent what appeared to be visible ripples 
through Jupiter's atmosphere. Some scientists suspect they may be sonic booms 
or perhaps seismic waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is safe to say we will be arguing about all of this for years," 
said Donald K. Yeomans, a comet expert at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, who helped predict the pattern of impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 As scientists ponder their data, the comet's trailing wings will brush the 
planet for weeks to come, showering it with dust, sand and boulders. It even 
may give Jupiter a new ring, albeit one too faint to see from Earth, 
astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shattered comet began its bombardment of Jupiter on Saturday, fragmented 
in what astronomers called "a string of pearls." As it approached at speeds of 
130,000 m.p.h., some fragments shifted or split up, while others disappeared 
and reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 In the comet's last hours, one smaller fragment that had vanished months ago 
enigmatically winked back into view before plunging into Jupiter's atmosphere, 
leaving its audience on Earth wondering how the dark fragment suddenly lit up 
again. The Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii captured an image of the 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fragment, which was so bright that astronomers assumed it must be 
enormous, hit with relatively little force. Astronomers suspect it had 
dissolved into a swarm of pebbles and gravel in the weeks before impact. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching its erratic behavior carefully, some scientists suggested that 
Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have been near the end of its lifetime as a comet anyway, 
even if it had avoided the headlong plunge into the solar system's largest 
planet.  
</P>
<P>
 Comets owe their starlight dazzle and distinctive tails to the volatile gases 
and dust that heats up as they swing along their orbits toward the sun. The 
Shoemaker-Levy fragments showed little characteristic glitter. Yeomans at JPL 
suggested that the absence of water in the plumes on Jupiter and the apparent 
fragility of the comet fragments could mean that the comet had exhausted its 
stores of icy chemicals and was turning into a dark asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really is unusual about this comet is that we got to observe it on our 
watch, because this only happens once every few thousand years," Yeomans said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never see anything like this again. No way." A Fiery Life 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some statistics about the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet: 
</P>
<P>
 Created when the planets were formed 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn apart by Jupiter in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovered in March, 1993 at Palomor Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Began bombarding Jupiter last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Largest fragments hit with the force of 6 million megatons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 Last of 21 major fragments expected to hit at 1 a.m. PDT today.

SIMPSON PRIVATE EYE IS NO STRANGER TO BIG-NAME CASES; INVESTIGATION: JOHN 
MCNALLY AIDED IN PATTY HEARST DEFENSE. HE IS HIGHLY REGARDED, SOMETIMES 
CONTROVERSIAL.

<P>
 By the time John E. McNally retired from the New York Police Department in 
1971, he had 16 years under his belt and quite a name for himself: It was 
McNally who collared Jack (Murph the Surf) Murphy, a jewel thief who made off 
with the Star of India sapphire from New York's Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally captured Murphy and his cohorts in 1964 after tracking them across the 
country and eventually nabbing them in Miami, a case that "made him in the 
department," according to a former NYPD colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, McNally was back in the news, this time as a private 
investigator working for F. Lee Bailey on the defense of Patty Hearst. Then in 
the 1980s, McNally worked for Claus von Bulow, the multimillionaire acquitted 
of attempting to kill his heiress wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 30 years after Murph the Surf, McNally is back, plying his low-key, 
much-admired skills in the service of O.J. Simpson, the most famous man in 
America ever to be charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Leroy (Skip) Taft, who has advised the ex-athlete for 25 
years, announced Wednesday that McNally was hired "to head up a full 
investigation of the case in an attempt to find the real killer or killers in 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case represents the latest of McNally's many collaborations with 
Bailey, and it places the renowned private eye at the head of a scrappy crew of 
Simpson-hired investigators and consultants, all of them entrusted with the job 
of clearing the former athlete of charges that he killed his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked with McNally say Simpson is in capable hands. The burly, 
broad-shouldered, 60-year-old former cop is soft-spoken, meticulous and, when 
he has to be, unyielding, say those who know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "John McNally is without doubt one of the finest investigators in the United 
States today," said J. Albert Johnson, a Boston criminal defense attorney with 
long ties to McNally and Bailey. "He's the best." 
</P>
<P>
 But McNally's talents, hailed by Taft and others in the Simpson camp, have not 
always won him fans in the law enforcement community where he once served. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, federal prosecutors accused McNally and another investigator, John 
Conroy, of being part of the "security department" of Gene Gotti, the younger 
brother of notorious mobster John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Robert LaRusso said at the opening of Gene Gotti's 1989 
drug trafficking trial that McNally asked Conroy, who was also a former New 
York police officer, to ensure that no electronic devices were being used by 
the FBI to eavesdrop on one of Gotti's partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This drug cartel takes care and concerns to be sure they are not overheard," 
the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, when McNally was seeking to be appointed by a federal court 
as an investigator in a criminal case, prosecutors objected, alleging that 
McNally had assisted mob figures in screening potential employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "McNally thus served as a resource for determining the corruptness of 
potential conspirators," Assistant U.S. Atty. David W. Shapiro said in a 1991 
letter to U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi. 
</P>
<P>
 Objecting, McNally wrote his own letter to the judge, saying he had done 
nothing more than recommend an associate for a "debugging assignment, something 
we and anyone familiar with the laws of this country know is not illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 McNally added: "At the mention of my name the government develops acute 
paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
 Although McNally has only been on the Simpson case for a day or two, he is 
being scrutinized by California officials. McNally is not licensed to work as a 
private investigator in California, meaning that he cannot legally interview 
potential witnesses or perform other investigative functions. He can, however, 
analyze information and advise Simpson's legal team on its significance. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as he confines himself to those responsibilities, he can work as he 
pleases, said an official from the California Bureau of Security and 
Investigative Services. But if McNally undertakes more traditional 
investigative tasks, he could risk sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and other investigators say that no matter what role McNally performs 
for the defense, he can be expected to pursue it with characteristic diligence 
and precise attention to detail -- as well as with a willingness to court 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "John will operate right on the edge," said McNally's former colleague from 
the New York Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As he assumes investigative responsibility for Simpson's defense, McNally will 
be assisted by a team of consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Former LAPD Officer Zvonko (Bill) Pavelic, himself a controversial figure in 
police circles, partly for his outspoken criticism of the department where he 
worked for 19 years, is acting as a consultant. Florida private investigator 
Pat McKenna, a nationally known investigator who worked for William Kennedy 
Smith, has emerged as a key player in the Simpson investigative camp. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna and McNally have worked together on many cases and are close friends, 
associates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds to me like they have the genuine varsity in place," said one local 
investigator. "These guys are very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Under McNally's direction, Simpson's investigators face the monumental task of 
conducting a full-scale investigation in as little as two months, when the case 
could come to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 They are aided by a newly created hot line that callers can use to forward 
information in return for the promise of a $500,000 reward. That hot line only 
went into operation Wednesday afternoon, and despite some technical problems 
early Thursday, it produced a deluge of tips in the first 24 hours, said 
Pavelic, calling it an enormous task just to sift through leads and determine 
which ones seem worth pursuing and which should be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is up to it," said attorney Johnson, who shared a room off and on with 
McNally for three years as they helped develop a defense in the Hearst case. 
"He comes up with incredibly detailed investigative reports, and his ability to 
draw conclusions and make judgments about witnesses is uncanny. They have the 
right guy."

50 FIRMS BACK HEALTH MANDATE; DEMOCRATS MEET

 As President Clinton received a show of big-business support Thursday for his 
proposal to make all employers provide health insurance for workers, 
congressional leaders sought to heal painful divisions within Democratic ranks 
over the scope and cost of health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate Democratic leaders met with Clinton on Thursday night at the 
White House to brief him on their efforts to reach agreement on bills to take 
to the floors of their respective chambers and to discuss plans and strategy 
for the legislative floor fights to come. 
</P>
<P>
 After the White House session with the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, the congressional leaders proclaimed a "new spirit" of agreement but 
offered no new details to back up that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills that House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) plan to present, probably next week, 
will pursue Clinton's goal of universal coverage but will be "less 
bureaucratic, more voluntary and phased in over a longer period of time" than 
Clinton's original proposal from last year, Mitchell said, echoing statements 
that Clinton and his top aides have been making for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a coalition of 50 of America's largest corporate employers 
endorsed the "employer mandate" that has emerged as the biggest single 
stumbling block to passage of Clinton's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, whose membership includes the Big Three auto makers, Bethlehem 
Steel, Safeway, and Manpower Inc., warned that, if Congress fails to enact a 
major health measure this year, "it is unlikely to have another chance at 
comprehensive reform in this century." Many of the individual companies have 
been longtime supporters of the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 With House and Senate leaders wrangling over final details of their own health 
care bills, the big-business endorsement was offered to counter recent 
indications that the President has failed in efforts to recruit any significant 
business backing for his reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills being negotiated behind closed doors by congressional Democrats will 
provide the components of the blueprint that Clinton and his party will take to 
the final battle over the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In both houses, Democratic leaders spent much of Thursday plotting their 
strategy for bringing health bills to their respective floors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) presented crucial committee 
chairmen with a complicated compromise proposal. He hoped that the plan would 
end a nasty squabble over jurisdiction that has prevented any progress from 
being made on other substantive issues this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley and Gephardt plan to use a bill written by the Ways and Means Committee 
as the vehicle for building the legislation that they will take to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that plan drew objections from the chairmen and subcommittee chairmen 
of the other two committees with jurisdiction over the health issue -- the 
Education and Labor Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee -- in large 
part because it would remove much of their influence over health-related issues 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The heated intramural battle has set back by several days the effort to put 
together a bill to take to the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Even when Democratic leaders satisfy their committee chairmen, they will face 
the ultimate battle on the floors of the House and the Senate, trying to 
assemble a majority for the controversial core of the President's plan: a new 
federal law requiring employers to provide health insurance for all workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Major business organizations -- such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the 
National Assn. of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable -- have decided 
that the employer mandate for health insurance is a new and costly intrusion of 
government into business. They refused to accept it, despite promises from the 
President that the reforms would slow the rapid increase in the cost of health 
care and that smaller companies with low-wage workers would be given subsidies 
to offset the effect of the new mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 And many individual companies once enrolled on the President's side are now 
having second thoughts. On Monday, a corporate coalition of 21 firms, including 
General Electric, Pacific Telesis, Du Pont, Atlantic Richfield, McDonnell 
Douglas and US West, all early supporters of health reform, sent Clinton a 
letter with a blunt warning that they could never back any legislation giving 
states the power to design independent health care structures. 
</P>
<P>
 These firms, which operate throughout the country with a standard package of 
benefits set by management, fear that they would be confronted with a new 
patchwork of rules and varying benefits in different states. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to show that they still have some corporate allies, the Administration 
and congressional Democrats arranged a press conference Thursday by an ad hoc 
coalition of 50 firms that have been strong supporters of the mandate because 
they already provide generous health benefits to their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make sure every single citizen is covered," Gephardt said at the 
conference, "the real losers are big businesses that will wind up footing the 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler, Ford and General Motors spent nearly $6 billion last year to provide 
health insurance for 2.8 million workers, retirees and dependents, said Andrew 
H. Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved aggressively to control our health costs but we cannot control 
health costs shifted to us because of those who do not pay their fair share," 
Card, a former transportation secretary, said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Burd, chief executive officer of Safeway, said his firm competes "with 
some very large companies that don't offer the same kind of coverage." If 
health reform doesn't pass with the employer mandate, Safeway might be forced 
to curtail its coverage "to level the playing field," Burd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration business supporters appear to be in a distinct minority. At 
another news conference Thursday, Herman Cain, president of Godfather's Pizza 
and the National Restaurant Assn., denounced mandates as a new form of tax that 
would wipe out jobs. "Mandate, mandate, any way you say it, we oppose it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, which had backed mandates, 
said it now opposes all of the health reform bills adopted by the committees.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAWSUIT AGAINST CLINTON DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton won a major victory Thursday in the sexual harassment suit 
filed against him by Paula Corbin Jones when a federal judge issued a 
procedural ruling that could delay the case until after the 1996 presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the substance of the ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan W. Wright in 
Little Rock, Ark., concerns technical matters -- the order in which Clinton 
must file motions in the case -- lawyers on both sides agreed that its impact 
will be large. In effect, Wright's order grants Clinton the one thing that his 
attorneys have sought above all else -- a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue for Wright was whether Clinton should be required to respond to 
Jones' allegations before the courts rule on his claim that he is immune from 
being sued while he is President. The judge ruled that he does not have to 
respond until the immunity issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's immunity claim "may or may not succeed," the judge wrote in a 
nine-page opinion. But the issue "raises significant and important 
constitutional issues" and "deserves threshold consideration, prior to the 
filing of any other motions or pleadings." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of that ruling, lawyers on both sides of the case agreed, will be 
to put off any substantive response by Clinton to Jones' allegations for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to delay this whole case for a lengthy period of time," said Gil 
Davis, one of Jones' attorneys. The delay could easily extend well into 1996 
and possibly until after the elections that November, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another member of Jones' defense team said, "I bet they're popping champagne 
corks over there," referring to the offices of Clinton's attorney, Robert S. 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was somewhat more low key. "We're obviously pleased with the decision 
and think it's clearly the right one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, a delay in filing a response to the allegations is important for 
Clinton because, in any such response, his lawyers would have had to provide at 
least some detail about what may have happened between Clinton and Jones in a 
Little Rock hotel in May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has made no direct comment -- aides have said in the past that he does 
not remember any such encounter -- and almost anything his lawyers said on the 
subject would be a potential source of political embarrassment to him. Jones 
claims that she went to Clinton's hotel suite and that the then-governor 
exposed himself and asked her to perform a sexual act. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wright offered no direct indication how she would rule on the 
immunity claim, the tone of her opinion did not bode well for Jones. "It must 
be recognized that the relief (Jones) seeks is of a purely personal nature, the 
delay of which will affect but a single individual who waited two days short of 
three years in which to file her lawsuit," Wright wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting from an earlier Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, she 
said the President's claim to immunity from suits for civil damages is equally 
legitimate and may affect "not only the President and his office, but also the 
nation that the presidency was designed to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Wright's ruling, lawyers now plan to spend several months 
preparing arguments for and against Clinton's immunity claim. Wright gave 
Bennett until Aug. 10 to file his formal motion on immunity. Davis and his 
partner, Joseph Cammarata, are then likely to ask for substantial time to 
prepare a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers familiar with the case said they expect that Wright will not hear a 
formal oral argument on the motion before late fall and that a decision 
probably will not come before early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wright sides with Clinton, Jones' case would be dismissed, although she 
would be allowed to refile it once Clinton is out of office. Clinton's legal 
team believes that a parallel case against Arkansas state trooper Danny 
Ferguson also would be set aside until Clinton could be available as a witness. 
Davis said he would argue against that, although he conceded that the judge 
could well rule against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever side loses the immunity argument almost certainly will appeal, first 
to the federal appeals court and then to the Supreme Court -- a process that 
routinely can take two years or more. 
</P>

 If Clinton eventually loses the immunity argument, he could then file motions 
to dismiss Jones' claims on other legal grounds. Independent experts have said 
that, whether or not Jones' allegations are true, her case has substantial 
legal weaknesses, in part because she waited so long to file it. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolution of those legal issues could add still further delay.

COLUMN ONE; SEPARATING BLACK AND WHITE; THE GULF IN THE WAY PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT 
RACES VIEW THE SAME EVENT CAN CREATE FLASH POINTS OVER EVERYDAY ISSUES AS WELL 
AS THE NATION'S HANDLING OF BIG PROBLEMS SUCH AS CRIME AND DRUGS.

<P>
 As the O.J. Simpson case has dramatically illustrated, vast differences exist 
between the way black and white Americans view everyday reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Many whites have expressed surprise and bafflement over opinion polls showing 
a majority of African Americans sympathetic to Simpson and highly skeptical of 
the evidence against him while the same polls suggest most whites see things 
the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 However, such findings come as no surprise to many blacks and to numerous 
social critics, political scientists and other experts who study black American 
attitudes. They say a similar gulf splits blacks and whites as they interpret 
other facets of society. Such polarized views of reality inhibit the nation 
from effectively dealing with health care, crime, drugs, welfare, gang 
violence, out-of-wedlock births and a host of debilitating social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blacks are so instinctively mistrustful of white society that some 
automatically reject any idea or judgment whose origins are not easily traced 
to the black community. Some whites find black suspicions so extreme and 
far-fetched from their own mainstream views they make no effort to understand 
the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks and whites are more politically estranged from each other than they 
have been in the last 20 to 30 years -- since the era of the civil rights 
movement," said Melvin Oliver, a sociologist at UCLA's Urban Poverty Center.  
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, many black and white Americans worked together to shatter 
Jim Crow segregation, creating a sense of hope that the future would be less 
racially tense, Oliver says. Now, a generation later, as vestiges of racism 
continue to seep into private and public attitudes, members of both groups have 
less contact with each other because they don't wish to risk potentially 
painful interactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver theorizes that some blacks, especially the poor and working class, 
perceive Congress, courts and media efforts to grapple with social and 
political issues as conspiratorial attacks against black people. Most white 
Americans see nothing of the sort.  
</P>
<P>
 The consequence is that blacks and whites, as Oliver puts it, "live in the 
same world, seeing the same set of facts, but are interpreting them in parallel 
realities." 
</P>
<P>
 While some people of all races try to bridge this gap, many whites and 
minorities are so far apart in their basic perceptions of the problems that 
seeking common action against them is almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gloria Williams, a suburban Washington paralegal who is African American, 
the woes of black people stem from the coordinated racism of white men. "To 
some degree, there is a conspiracy to keep the black man down," she said. 
"White men view the black man collectively as a threat. They avoid hiring them 
and as a result it hurts black male-female relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Davis, a writer and filmmaker who is white, disagrees. "I'd say the 
opposite is true," said Davis, a Los Angeles native who lives in Castine, Me. 
"There is a belated effort . . . to recruit qualified black people into 
responsible positions in professional jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some blacks reject the idea that conspiracies are at the root of problems 
facing African Americans. Suzanne Lynn, a New York attorney who is black, calls 
such views "extremist." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the anecdotal, opinion surveys exhibit striking race-based disparities 
on a variety of policy issues. For example, a 1992 Washington Post poll 
reported that 71% of blacks surveyed nationwide felt they were not achieving 
equality as fast as they could because whites did not want them to get ahead, 
but only 35% of whites agreed that racism held blacks back. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a poll conducted last year by the Joint Center for Political and 
Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank, found that less than half of 
the black respondents favored setting two-year limits on welfare benefits 
without the guarantee of a job when the cutoffs take effect, a proposal that 
garnered support from more than two-thirds of whites. The finding is all the 
more striking because blacks and whites make up almost identical shares of the 
average monthly caseload of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 And, earlier this year, a Times Mirror poll found that 58% of whites believed 
universal coverage should be the top priority for health care reform, while 
nearly three-quarters of non-whites agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, a recent Los Angeles Times poll found that 70% of blacks 
were "very" or "somewhat" sympathetic toward Simpson, compared to 38% of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Simpson case, the exposure of black celebrities to seemingly harsh 
treatment by the courts and media focuses black outrage on white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In interview after interview with The Times, black Americans cited the 
unproven accusations of child molestation against singer Michael Jackson, the 
rape conviction of former boxing champion Mike Tyson, the stiff jail sentence 
given to former Washington Mayor Marion Barry for smoking crack and the Senate 
hearings into alleged sexual harassment by then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence 
Thomas to support their belief that the nation's white power elites act in 
concert to maintain white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The white Establishment, which includes big business, the government, the 
media and all the (white) people who run this country, are hellbent" on 
eliminating highly visible and successful black men, said Brenda Evans, a 
46-year-old marketing and promotions manager in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people will think I'm crazy, but I think they're crazy not to see it 
as I do," she said. "If they're not crazy, then they are naive, limited and not 
exposed to the same reality I'm exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bositis, who studies black political and social trends at the Joint 
Center for Political and Economic Studies, says African Americans who deeply 
distrust white institutions are not living in a fantasy world. He says some of 
their distrust is "justified and healthy" because African Americans experience 
racism that whites refuse to acknowledge exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Middle-aged white men, who have a disproportionate share of the power and 
influence in our society, believe that whatever they experience is reality and 
anything else is not reality," said Bositis, who is white and middle-aged. 
"They don't experience racism, so they say it doesn't exist. They are not 
seeing the same reality as the black person who knows racism is real, so it's 
logical for blacks to have this distrust." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Hawkins, a criminal litigator with the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Education Fund in New York, agrees, adding that African Americans have a long 
history of being victimized by the police and courts that explains their 
caution in accepting those institutions as legitimate authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 While things have improved, Hawkins says, many African Americans still have 
reason to view the judiciary as a vehicle for maintaining the status quo of 
white dominance over black people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a widespread notion among (African Americans) that the (criminal 
justice) system is unfair and needs to be challenged or at the least looked at 
with a skeptical eye," Hawkins said. "This need to challenge the system at 
every turn, especially when a black man is on trial, comes in contrast to the 
white society which has greater trust in the system because it works, by and 
large, in its favor." 
</P>
<P>
 It often comes without regard to the specifics of the legal issue in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sensibility in some quarters of the black community that we are 
under siege in so many ways that we can't understand or articulate," said 
Kimberly Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA. "Enough black people believe there 
is enough animus and ill will directed toward us in employment, in health care 
institutions, in housing and especially in the criminal justice system, that 
they believe nothing is beyond the pale. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when they see a black man standing in handcuffs or being hauled before a 
court," she added, "they are ready to believe that brother is innocent without 
even hearing the charges against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar feelings of estrangement are directed at the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people don't trust the white media," said Mary Helen Washington, a 
professor of African American literature at the University of Maryland. "The 
mass media is important because it makes (America) a small community where 
everyone, black or white, sees the same things. But for black people there is a 
huge blanket of humiliation that the media spreads over our lives, so we just 
don't believe what it says about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, she says, "blacks just don't buy the reality that's sold to us by 
whites. If some of those institutions were headed by people we trusted I don't 
think we'd be in this spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Often when African Americans are in positions of power, some black people 
doubt their legitimacy. "That's the paradox of desegregation," said Manning 
Marable, professor of history and director of the Institute for Research in 
African-American Studies at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 Many black people perceive black leaders in traditionally white institutions 
as "black faces in high places" who have to serve white interests to maintain 
their status, Marable said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marable believes the answer for the conundrum lies in the distant future when 
white America senses its well-being is threatened by prolonged neglect of black 
views toward society and shares political and economic power with people 
respected by the broader black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody gives a damn right now about the national concerns of African 
Americans," he said. "Take the Los Angeles riots. It was a terrible, costly 
example of what is wrong with the society, but no public policy has been put 
forth to address the underlying problems. The problem hasn't gone away; it's 
gone underground." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Jarvis, executive director of the National Coalition on Black Voter 
Participation, a Washington-based voting rights organization, says black 
attitudes concerning legislation aimed at social problems often reflect a deep 
despair or resignation that white institutions will not deal fairly with 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said some are reluctant to support the Administration's 
efforts to pass crime legislation that proposes spending $30 billion in federal 
money on prison construction, law enforcement and social programs targeted to 
crime prevention. Many fear the money will not help prevent crime in their 
communities and is more likely to be spent to enable police to lock up more 
black men, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis said her research also shows that many African Americans suspect the 
reason the White House has waffled on its policies aimed at restoring democracy 
to Haiti is out of fear of having an influx of black people entering the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear people saying all the time, 'Just compare what happened when 
boatloads of white Cubans came over with what happened when the Haitians came,' 
" Jarvis said, adding that many African Americans believe fair-skinned Cubans 
are more accepted and politically aligned with conservative whites than with 
darker peoples in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at it that way it seems reasonable for (African Americans) to 
conclude (whites) don't want the Haitians because they are black," Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia A. Turner, author of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine: Rumor in 
African-American Culture," says comments such as the ones Jarvis reports take 
on credibility among African Americans estranged from the white mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors, often broadcast over talk radio serving black audiences or in places 
where black people congregate like barber shops and beauty parlors tend to 
spread through black communities from coast to coast in times of perceived 
crisis to counteract the information contained in the white media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumors serve as a way of reconciling an event with (African Americans') sense 
of black history," said Turner, an associate professor of African American and 
African studies at UC Davis. "We know that conspiracies have occurred to the 
disadvantage of African Americans; we are often reluctant to believe that they 
can't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner cautions that blacks aren't the only group harboring distrust of 
the Establishment, noting that class and gender differences often compel whites 
to mistrust other, more privileged whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to have white-collar crime that places an affluent white 
corporate executive on trial, I'll bet some Depression-era (white) person might 
have a different perception than someone born in the '70s," she said. "Mistrust 
comes from differences in cultures and perspectives, not just from differences 
in color."

UCI, OTHERS FACE BIG PENTAGON RESEARCH CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major universities in California are girding for what they call an educational 
calamity if current efforts in Congress succeed in slashing the Pentagon's 
budget for academic research contracts by 50% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine alone, administrators estimate the cutback will rip $2.8 million 
out of the budgets and devastate defense-supported graduate research projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks, already approved by the full House, will be considered next week 
by the Senate Appropriations Committee -- triggering an intense lobbying 
campaign by California institutions and the California congressional 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Senate does not concur with the severity of the House cuts, a 
compromise would probably still result in serious cutbacks in university 
research, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Appropriations Committee initiated the effort out of growing concern 
that the readiness of combat forces has eroded too far, while academic research 
has gone unscathed. Moreover, critics charge that much of the research is 
wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 California schools, a major recipient of the contracts, collectively stand to 
lose half of their annual defense research funding, which totaled $236 million 
in fiscal 1993. The cutbacks would particularly hurt UC Irvine, USC, UCLA, 
Stanford University and UC San Diego, though virtually every state and private 
campus would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, the cutbacks would hit hardest in the schools of physical 
science, engineering and computer science, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Defense supports a disproportionately large percentage of 
our graduate students," said Vice Chancellor Bill Parker. He added that the 
cutbacks "would be devastating because of the impact on graduate education." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense grants support 137 of 678 graduate researchers, who depend on being 
able to complete their research to receive their degrees. Altogether, UC Irvine 
has $5.6 million in defense contracts that create as much as $15 million in 
spending in the Orange County economy, university officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Such research "strengthens not only the (national) defense capability, but the 
economic strength of the country," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering school at UCLA gets more than half of its research contracts 
from the Pentagon, amounting to about $18.7 million annually. Loss of contracts 
would curtail stipends for graduate and postgraduate students, as well as 
reduce spending for new laboratory equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the cuts would damage the school's ability to conduct basic 
scientific research, affecting what it considers one of its central educational 
missions, said Kumar Patel, UCLA vice chancellor for research. "It is a 
disaster," Patel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Orange County's two other major universities, Cal State Fullerton 
and Chapman, said the cutbacks would have little or no effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials have joined forces with Patel and others, arguing that the 
cuts would rob the military of its future technology leadership while doing 
little to solve the defense budget problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "This reduction in defense research would have very dire results," Anita 
Jones, the Pentagon's director of defense research and engineering, said in an 
interview. "You will not see them immediately, but over the long term they 
would be severe." 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal 1993, the Pentagon issued $1.9 billion in research contracts to 
about 580 universities nationwide, providing the largest block of federal 
support for basic university research in most engineering, physical sciences 
and computer sciences disciplines. The House cuts would pare about $950 million 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, universities get most of their medical, biological and other life 
sciences research funded through a variety of non-defense agencies, which are 
not subject to significant cutbacks this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the defense-sponsored research has yielded such important results 
as the atomic clocks for the global positioning satellite system that is 
rapidly moving into the consumer economy. Pentagon sponsorship also led to the 
creation of the Internet, the computer network that is fast becoming a key 
building block of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks also demonstrate the continuing vulnerability of California and 
its key institutions to the federal defense budget, which has continued to drop 
since 1986, but is still far from bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, university research funding by the Pentagon had gone 
unscathed and in fact had shown some modest increases. Because it is not 
appropriated as a lump sum, but rather as part of many other budgets, Congress 
had not focused on it until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Murtha (D-Pa.), the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, has grown increasingly worried that military preparedness is 
becoming weak and therefore spending not directly related to military forces 
must be sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
 The case for continued high university research was also hurt by disclosures 
in recent years of extravagant spending at taxpayer expense for such faculty 
perks as expensive meals, big liquor bills and even a yacht at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles), a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, said that after years of cutbacks affecting every other sector of 
the military, it was time for universities "to take their fair share" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said that if the Senate does not go along with the House position, the 
cuts might be reduced in severity, though not eliminated, in a later conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the universities are screaming . . . but there have been extra 
cuts in our military readiness, and research has gone unscathed," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon denied that Murtha's motivation for the cuts was as a retaliation 
against Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), chairman of the House Space, 
Science and Technology Committee, who has led a fight against Murtha's support 
of alleged pork barrel projects at universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Loren Thompson, an expert on defense procurement issues, said the 
cutbacks are justified because military forces have been cut far deeper than 
overall defense budgets. Congress, he said, has been reluctant to cut overhead 
and frills even as the number of aircraft, ships and tanks has rapidly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support costs of our defense Establishment are killing our ability to 
maintain a fighting force," Thompson said. "This creates a bureaucratic 
structure like a worm: all tail and no teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 But for strapped educational institutions, the proposed cuts would come at an 
inopportune time, university officials say. USC received about $50 million in 
research contracts from the Pentagon last year, the most of any campus in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech received $16 million in defense research contracts last year, 
representing 10% of the school's entire research budget, a spokesman said. Most 
of the impact would fall at Caltech's engineering school. The same problem 
affects Stanford, which received $42 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other University of California schools, along with Irvine's $5.6 
million, Berkeley received $16.6 million in fiscal 1993, Santa Barbara $15.8 
million and San Diego $46 million. The California State University system 
received $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Dire predictions have prompted lobbying efforts to head off the cutbacks next 
week in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), among other members of the delegation, has 
asked Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, not to follow Murtha's lead on research funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer argued that the cuts "would seriously undermine the research base that 
is critical to so many aspects of our national security." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, California Assembly members wrote a letter to Murtha protesting the 
cuts, as did a large number of university officials from around the country. 
Congressional sources said it is too early to say what Inouye will do.

HUNDREDS DIE AS CHOLERA SWEEPS RWANDA REFUGEES; AFRICA: IN GRIM SCENES AT 
ZAIRIAN BORDER, RELIEF WORKERS RUSH TO BURY VICTIMS OF EPIDEMIC IN MASS GRAVES. 
OVERWHELMED OFFICIALS HAVE LOST COUNT OF THE BODIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The acrid stench of death filled the air here Thursday, as hundreds upon 
hundreds of corpses -- a few here, a dozen a few yards farther, 25 more just 
beyond -- lined dusty roads and littered the cruel fields of what has become 
the world's closest glimpse of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief operations for the more than 1 million Rwandan refugees who have 
flooded this remote Zairian border town focused on the grim task of picking up 
and burying at least 1,100 men, women and children who fell victim in the last 
24 hours to what doctors confirmed as a suddenly raging cholera epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped counting at 800 bodies" along the road Thursday morning, said 
Koenraad Henckaerts of the relief group Doctors Without Borders. But that was 
early, and worse was to come as the fiercely contagious disease spread amid the 
squalor and filth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost the body count," French Army 1st Lt. A. Ramasco said wearily at 
midafternoon as he supervised six military trucks that rumbled slowly down the 
road outside the airport on burial detail. "We're a transport regiment, not 
morticians." 
</P>
<P>
 He wiped his brow and stared at the nearest row of roadside corpses. Most were 
wrapped in thin reed mats or tattered rags. Babies and children were tiny 
bundles in the dirt. A few legs and arms poked out, coated like all else here 
in the thick gray dust and smoke that chokes the air and stings the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the soldiers drove off with the dead, more victims collapsed behind 
them. One man simply fell over as he rode his bicycle; two others dragged him 
to the side where he lay, limp and shaking, amid the passing crowd. Another 
dropped as he walked, his head resting on a wrapped body. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, two boys, no older than 10, tugged at a filthy gray blanket to cover 
the thin corpse of another boy. Not far away, a girl, younger yet, gasped in 
silent sobs by her father's limp body. An infant sat, wailing weakly by her 
mother's lifeless form in a pile of volcanic rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the road, a French front-end loader dug a long trench near a grove of 
banana trees. Workers tossed body after body into the pit; each tumbled down to 
join the ghastly jumble of torsos, limbs and rags. At least 500 corpses were in 
the mass grave, officials said. Behind them, a bulldozer pushed dirt over the 
searing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the inner circle of this Dantesque tableau was three miles north at 
Munigi. Physicians from Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups worked a 
makeshift triage ward on an open field strewn with jagged lava rocks and the 
bodies of the dead and dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday morning we had 10 dead," said Dr. Isabelle Pardieu. "Last night, we 
had 100. Now it is just growing and growing." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of the still-living had intravenous drips hooked up. But most simply 
waited for the agony to end. Groans of pain and children's cries filled the 
still air. A corner of the field was reserved for the dead; fresh corpses 
arrived in a steady stream at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he dead yet?" shouted Kevin Noone, from the Irish aid group GOAL, pointing 
at the limp body of a man face-down on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet! Not yet!" shouted a colleague. "Soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Without pausing, they returned to their grisly work: spraying a dozen bodies 
with disinfectant and loading them, sad and sagging, into a brown pickup truck. 
More bodies arrived as fast as these were carted off, 60 in an hour, 300 by 
nightfall. "It's literally like a conveyor belt," Noone said as he worked. 
"They bring them in, and we load them on the truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Noone said he had rented a 40-foot trailer truck to carry bodies today, an 
indication of the horrors expected ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors predicted that the cholera -- which causes severe diarrhea, vomiting 
and sometimes death within five hours -- is likely to infect 10,000 to 50,000 
refugees. Untreated, half will probably die. "You cannot stop it at the 
moment," warned Henckaerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera initially spreads in contaminated water, but then can be passed 
directly from person to person. Corpses are especially contagious, so quick 
burial is critical. The chief treatment for those infected is immediate 
rehydration with special solutions to replace lost fluids. And the only 
reliable prevention is provision of chlorinated water. But both the solutions 
and clean water are in impossibly short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The first air shipment of 10,000 liters of solution arrived Thursday but most 
had been used by nightfall. Another shipment was expected today, but the 
airport is already running at near capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only got one runway and you can't just pound it and pound it or you'll 
have to close it," said Paul Gilham, in charge of the airlift here. Moreover, 
only six planes can be parked and unloaded at one time, or fewer if large cargo 
planes come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, relief supplies are increasing. About 80 tons of food were distributed 
Thursday and 200 tons are planned for today. Up to 400 tons may arrive by next 
week. About 600 tons of food are needed each day, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The first truck convoy is expected late today or Saturday, officials said. 
They hope the road link from Kampala, 420 miles away in neighboring Uganda, may 
open a lifeline for faster provision of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The epidemic, the latest legacy of Rwanda's 3 1/2-month civil war and 
slaughter, created obvious new demands on already-overwhelmed relief groups. 
They have barely begun to provide food, water and shelter for the estimated 1.2 
million Hutu refugees who fled here in the last week for fear of retribution 
from victorious Tutsi-led rebels in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton said the United States was ready "to lead the 
United Nations in responding to the cholera problem and in dealing with the 
other aspects of this human catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered Anthony Lake, White House national security adviser, J. Brian 
Atwood, administrator of the Agency for International Development, and Pentagon 
officials to develop a plan for U.S. emergency relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood said the first priority was to send water, medicine and medical 
equipment to help check the cholera epidemic. The Pentagon plans to use as many 
as 1,000 U.S. service personnel to deliver relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community has never seen anything like this," Atwood said, 
announcing an additional $41.4 million in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood said the only long-term solution to the crisis was to persuade Rwandans 
still in their country to stay there and to get refugees to return home. To 
that end, he said, the United States plans to send much of its food aid to the 
southwest part of Rwanda as an incentive to refugees to remain there. 
</P>
<P>
 In Goma, CARE country director Ralph Hazleton, who flew in Thursday from 
Nairobi, Kenya, on an Antonov cargo plane filled with a Toyota truck, 
mattresses and supplies, said his immediate plans were to help move 400,000 
refugees to a more rural site selected by the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees. Just where wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got one report that it's four kilometers north of Goma, and another that 
it's 70," Hazleton said. "We'll find out when we get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Refugee camps are a misnomer. Hundreds of thousands of people simply squat by 
the roadside, awaiting their fate. Survivors lead bleating goats and 
long-horned cattle; a few sell yams and corn by the road. Rwandan soldiers, 
routed by rebels, strut by in their camouflage uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Long lines of people shuffle endlessly down the road. Many carry yellow 
plastic jugs on their head, filled with water from Lake Kivu, about four miles 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 Others head north to promised food distribution sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can, cover their noses with handkerchiefs, towels or surgical masks 
to cut the odor of death, dust and diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun, dimmed by the smoky haze, is a dull orb overhead. The refugees have 
stripped many of the trees for firewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Their countless cooking fires were the only sign of life when night fell like 
a shroud on the tragedy of Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report. 
Cholera's Spread 
</P>
<P>
 Poor sanitation, lack of clean drinking water and crowded living conditions 
have prompted a cholera epidemic in Rwandan refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Human feces contain the cholera germs. Bacteria is spread by flies and 
unsanitary handling of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera spreads when germs are ingested from contaminated food and water. 
Bacteria causes diarrhea, vomiting and cramps, leading to dehydration. If 
untreated, half the victim die. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross dehydration can be treated with intravenous fluid and antibiotics. When 
treated promptly, and if no kidney damage has occurred, patients can fully 
recover.

RIORDAN REPLACES STAFF CHIEF IN POWER SHIFT; CITY HALL: MANAGEMENT EXPERT 
WILLIAM OUCHI IS NEW TOP AIDE, REPLACING WILLIAM MCCARLEY, WHO GETS DWP POST. 
MOVES TAKE MANY BY SURPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the most dramatic shake-up of his year-old administration, Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan on Thursday ousted a career bureaucrat as his chief of 
staff and replaced him with a UCLA management guru eager to restructure the 
City Hall bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. McCarley, a 29-year City Hall veteran, will leave as top aide to 
Riordan to take over as head of the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be replaced in the mayor's suite by William Ouchi, who has been on 
leave for a year from UCLA to advise Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan announced the moves to his staff just after noon, taking many by 
surprise. At a brief afternoon news conference, the mayor and his aides said 
many details of the power shift have yet to be resolved. Potentially 
controversial questions include whether Ouchi will retain his UCLA affiliation, 
who will pay his salary and how much he will make. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said both men will assume their jobs on an interim basis. McCarley's 
appointment requires the approval of the DWP commission, which is in the midst 
of a nationwide search for a permanent general manager to replace Dan Waters, 
who retired earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan went to great lengths to praise both men and assure that the change is 
not a demotion for McCarley. "Bill has the background, wisdom and guts needed 
to engineer this city agency so that it will work smarter and more 
efficiently," Riordan said. He went on to praise Ouchi, saying that he will 
bring his expertise as one of the top academics in the world to city 
government.  
</P>
<P>
 The moves will accomplish two key goals for the Riordan Administration: The 
first will put the mayor's staff in the hands of a close confidante who is 
expected to increase the pressure for streamlining the city bureaucracy. And 
the second will put at the DWP a proven team player who is expected to be more 
sympathetic than past managers to Riordan's efforts to tap the utility's funds 
for a continued expansion of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes come after a year in which Riordan succeeded in eliminating a 
$200-million deficit and finding $83 million more to expand the LAPD. McCarley 
helped shepherd those projects through the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But another prime goal for the mayor, rebuilding the city's huge and often 
dysfunctional bureaucracy, has languished. Riordan's proposals to eliminate the 
Board of Public Works and to consolidate eight agencies and commissions into 
two new super-departments were rejected by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Only small dollar savings were associated with the changes and council members 
protested that Riordan's staff, led by McCarley, did not make a compelling case 
on the value of change. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley, who had been the top policy analyst for the City Council before 
becoming the mayor's aide, is well-liked by most council members. But some 
members of the mayor's staff have found the Army veteran too authoritarian. 
</P>
<P>
 One top mayoral aide said the change had as much to do with personality as 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor respects Bill, but there has never been any chemistry between 
them," said the aide, who asked not to be named. "They just didn't click, and 
the mayor needed someone he is comfortable with to work with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi, a Japanese American who was born in Hawaii, is the first Asian American 
ever to hold the top administrative post in the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In his work at the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management he has been 
acclaimed as an expert in organization and is a frequent consultant to 
corporations. He took a leave from UCLA a year ago to test some of his ideas in 
the real-life crucible of City Hall. A private nonprofit group called the Fund 
for a New Los Angeles was established to help pay Ouchi's expenses and to 
reimburse UCLA for his salary, about $120,000 a year. The city's corporate 
elite provided most of the more than $500,000 that has gone to that effort so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Working just two doors down from Riordan's office, Ouchi has been an unknown 
quantity to many at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never met the man," one council member said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Ouchi has worked mostly behind the scenes as a special adviser 
to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a central role in drafting Project Safety Los Angeles, the five-year 
blueprint that Riordan and Police Chief Willie L. Williams unveiled last year 
for adding 2,855 officers to the LAPD.  
</P>
<P>
 He also brought together a group of high-powered business executives in the 
mayor's Committee on Fiscal Administration, which outlined plans for tapping 
city pension funds, improving bill collections and generally wringing more 
money out of city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a privilege for me to continue with (Riordan's) agenda of bringing 
public safety to the level we all expect, of bringing jobs back to the city of 
Los Angeles and of bringing the latest principles of modern management to every 
branch of city government," Ouchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi often played Mr. Outside to McCarley's Mr. Inside -- with the professor 
acting as the "idea man" who would change City Hall and McCarley frequently 
introducing a dose of political reality into debates among the mayor's top 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, some questioned whether the theoretician can put his ideas into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern that I share is that the office is still lacking in an ability to 
implement its ideas," said one businessman who deals frequently with the 
Administration. "They have a lot of good ideas, but some of us are looking for 
individuals to make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer pointed to Ouchi's work on the public safety plan 
and fiscal reforms as proof that he "is not just an academician with a bow 
tie." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he works within the mayor's suite, Ouchi's semi-independent status 
has allowed him to avoid the financial disclosure forms required of other top 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he intends to leave his position at UCLA, Ouchi would only say: "That 
has yet to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office is working with the city Ethics Commission and the city 
attorney's office on issues including who will pay Ouchi and whether he can 
retain his UCLA affiliation. Ouchi wants to maintain his campus ties in order 
to continue supervising several doctoral candidates and directing a special 
summer program for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least the time being, his salary will be covered by the nonprofit 
committee -- an arrangement that troubled at least one council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't want to be on the city payroll, he should not get the job," 
said the council member, who requested anonymity. "This is a city job and 
should be accountable to the taxpayers."  
</P>
<P>
 For the 54-year-old McCarley, the move to the DWP is part of a long and 
prominent City Hall career. He began as a junior analyst in the Bureau of 
Street Lighting and worked his way up to become the city's chief legislative 
analyst, a post he held for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, McCarley had grown restless as legislative analyst, the top 
researcher for the City Council. He tried to get a job heading Los Angeles 
International Airport but lost out. Then came the offer as Riordan's top aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill is the perfect choice . . . a person who is respected by the City 
Council, who will make certain the mayor and the City Council work as one team 
in turning this city around," Riordan said then. 
</P>
<P>
 But from his first days with Riordan, McCarley complained to associates about 
his frustrations. Initially, he was surrounded by former campaign workers with 
little experience in government, and Riordan himself is easily distracted. 
McCarley faced a flood of challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "During this year we've had a few, minor little things happen," McCarley said 
jokingly at Thursday's news conference. "A few labor disputes, nothing serious, 
a minor earthquake, a little budget problem of $200 (million) or $300 million." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley is nearing retirement and his temporary appointment to the DWP was 
seen as a way of removing him from the chief of staff post while allowing him 
to retire with a full pension. Officials said McCarley would be eligible for 
full retirement at 63% of his salary next June 28 -- his 30-year anniversary 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He made $149,000 as chief legislative analyst -- significantly higher than the 
$100,000 top salary permitted for mayoral staffers. To lure McCarley to the 
job, Riordan had pushed special legislation through the council to allow him to 
maintain his $149,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 For the mayor's office, the change means the loss of its most veteran staffer, 
one who knows City Hall inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people in the mayor's office who have a lot of ideas, some 
of them good, some of them bad," said one council member. "McCarley has been 
the one to say, 'You can't do that -- it's illegal, it's politically unwise, it 
will break the bank.' Ouchi has been the one with the wild ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarley, who said he may seek a permanent position as DWP chief, said he is 
not being cast away by the mayor but simply put to use elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a team player," McCarley said. "I've played a lot of positions. . . . I'm 
not going to Mars or Jupiter. I'm just going up the hill (to the DWP)." New 
Leadership

WILSON OKS WORKPLACE SMOKING BAN; TOBACCO: LAW COVERING OFFICES AND RESTAURANTS 
WILL TAKE EFFECT JAN. 1 UNLESS VOTERS APPROVE INDUSTRY- SPONSORED PROP. 188. 
GOVERNOR SAYS HE IS OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, declaring that tobacco smoke is toxic pollution, signed a 
sweeping statewide smoking prohibition Thursday, and announced that he opposes 
a November ballot initiative that would repeal the tough new ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking an action that is good for everyone's health," said Wilson, who 
signed the bill at his San Francisco office, and in doing so bucked some 
political allies. Looking on were the bill's author, Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), and several doctors and others who fought for nearly 
two years for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure bans smoking in most enclosed workplaces, from restaurants and 
offices to factories and most warehouses. It gives California one of the 
toughest statewide anti-smoking laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban will go into effect Jan. 1 -- unless California voters approve a 
pro-tobacco industry initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 That initiative, Proposition 188, is sponsored by Philip Morris U.S.A., the 
nation's largest tobacco company. If it passes, the initiative would supersede 
Friedman's bill, and permit smoking in restaurants and most other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing Friedman's bill, Wilson said he opposes the Philip Morris 
initiative. Wilson added, however, that he will not spend money to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say that I am against it, but obviously I have something else that I 
will be doing," said Wilson, who is battling Democratic Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown in a tight reelection race. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing standards set forth in the November initiative as "much, much 
weaker" than those in Friedman's bill, Wilson said "the public, left to (its) 
own devices, would support the legislation that I just signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also opposes Proposition 188. In an interview this month, she said she 
favored the Friedman restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicholl, a Los Angeles political consultant heading the campaign against 
the initiative, hailed Wilson's opposition to Proposition 188 as "very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 "It eliminates this partisan quality, if there was any," Nicholl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Stitzenberger, the consultant representing Philip Morris, tried to put the 
best spin on the governor's opposition by saying he was heartened that Wilson 
would not actively campaign against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that a politician is for or against anything in this state is just 
about meaningless," Stitzenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger said the campaign in favor of Proposition 188 will revolve 
around what he and the initiative's sponsor believe is "a reasonable solution 
to a problem," by giving business "some degree of choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would let business owners decide whether to permit smoking. 
Businesses that allow smoking would have to provide ventilation, though 
standards set forth in Proposition 188 are not designed to reduce health risks 
from tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Philip Morris is alone among major tobacco companies in its support of 
Proposition 188. Philip Morris spent $491,000 gathering signatures to place the 
measure on the ballot. Stitzenberger said he has received no other pledges of 
money from other tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 By signing the indoor workplace smoking ban, Wilson went against some allies, 
including the California Manufacturer's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor said Friedman's bill will create "a better environment for 
California business," and predicted that it will reduce fire insurance 
premiums, workers' compensation claims, health care costs, absenteeism and 
cleaning bills. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he based his decision on national health studies showing that 
secondhand smoke results in 53,000 premature deaths annually. The ban, he said, 
will free "California's workers from the toxic pollution of secondhand smoke, 
pollution that no one should be forced to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's bill is aimed at protecting the health of workers by prohibiting 
smoking in enclosed workplaces. Violation of the prohibition could result in a 
$100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure includes a handful of exemptions, such as the cabs of trucks, 
medical research facilities investigating the effects of smoking, and movie 
sets or theatrical productions where smoking is part of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession to the tourist industry, Friedman agreed to allow hotel owners 
to permit smoking in most guest rooms, hotel lobbies and banquet facilities so 
long as no food is being served. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also will permit smoking in bars and card clubs, but directs state 
health experts to draft safe standards for tobacco smoke exposure by 1997. If 
no standards can be developed, or if bar owners cannot comply with them, 
smoking would be phased out in bars by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill retains a provision allowing cities and counties to impose tougher 
smoking bans. Several municipalities have restricted smoking in outdoor 
stadiums, and those local ordinances would remain in effect.

MURDER PROBE FOCUSES ON STORAGE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case have found what appears to be 
blood in an Orange County storage facility rented by suspect John J. Famalaro, 
and authorities believe the Newport Beach woman may have been killed there, law 
enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were testing the substance to see if it is blood, and to determine 
if it matches Huber's, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, the Yavapai County Grand Jury indicted Famalaro on first-degree 
murder and theft charges Thursday, making him subject to the death penalty. He 
was arrested July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe picked up speed in Orange County, where law enforcement sources and 
the manager of the Laguna Hills storage facility confirmed that they have found 
what looks like blood. Huber, then 23, vanished three years ago in Costa Mesa 
while heading home from a concert. Her nude and handcuffed body was found last 
week in a freezer outside Famalaro's home, about 75 miles north of Phoenix. She 
had suffered multiple blows to the head, and her eyes and mouth were covered 
with cloth and sealed with duct tape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other significant developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Court documents filed in Arizona revealed numerous additional items seized 
from Famalaro's home and vehicles in recent days, including a black whip, a 
micro-cassette marked "Save, important," several audiotapes whose contents were 
unknown and a brown paper sack containing two keys and a pubic hair. Earlier 
searches have unearthed a crowbar and claw hammer that appear to be bloodied, 
strips of white cloth and a tarp, also stained with a crimson-colored 
substance, and items belonging to Huber, including clothing, jewelry and a 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newly appointed defense counsel Thomas K. Kelly was joined by Warren R. 
Darrow, an attorney who Kelly said is a distant relative of famed defense 
lawyer Clarence Darrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * A team of investigators from Orange County, including chief forensic 
pathologist Richard Fukumoto and other crime scene specialists, were preparing 
to travel to Arizona today to meet with their counterparts there. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Clow, property manager for the Laguna Hills storage facility, said 
police have been conducting forensic tests inside a unit that had been leased 
to Famalaro from February, 1991, to September, 1992. Huber disappeared June 3, 
1991, after her car blew a tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The storage unit is in a one-story warehouse in a nondescript light industrial 
complex. Clow said investigators told her the unit was a potential crime scene 
in the Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've pulled up the carpet, searching for blood and hair," said Clow, who 
has discussed the case with police. 
</P>
<P>
 John Conley, an Orange County assistant district attorney, confirmed Thursday 
that investigators have focused on a possible Orange County murder scene linked 
to Famalaro. He declined to discuss where that site was, but said investigators 
have been examining the location for the past several days, trying to determine 
if Huber was slain there. 
</P>

 Times staff writers Rene Lynch, Kevin Johnson and Gebe Martinez contributed to 
this story from Prescott, Ariz. Lait and Brazil reported from Orange County.

BUSINESSES PUSH FOR FEDERAL-STATE ACCORD ON DELTA WATER USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forging an unusual alliance, top California business executives are urging 
President Clinton and Gov. Pete Wilson to agree on environmental standards for 
the San Francisco Bay-San Joaquin River Delta, saying prolonged uncertainty 
over the state's main water supply is threatening California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The continuing gridlock in setting standards for the Bay-Delta is simply 
unacceptable," says a letter mailed Wednesday by chief executive officers from 
firms including BankAmerica Corp., Southern California Edison and Procter & 
Gamble. "The lack of approved standards is creating uncertainty that threatens 
the economic recovery we so desperately need. Please commit to achieving 
standards for the Bay-Delta this year."

 The letter from the executives may put election-year pressure on the 
Republican governor to reach agreement with Clinton's environmental aides over 
how much water to restore to the Bay-Delta for endangered fish and other 
wildlife. The two administrations have been debating for months over standards 
for the sprawling estuary, which supplies two-thirds of the drinking water in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pushing for environmental controls is unusual for business interests, 
the executives stress that some resolution is crucial because so much water is 
at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, the state has been unable to decide on permanent allocations of 
delta water for cities, farms and wildlife. Last year, the Clinton 
Administration, facing a lawsuit from environmentalists, proposed salinity 
standards that would reduce available fresh water by an average of 9% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration opposes the federal proposal, saying the standards 
were set arbitrarily and could harm agricultural interests and cities. Because 
the state operates the biggest aqueduct that drains the delta, without the 
governor's support the standards would not be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 California Secretary for Resources Douglas Wheeler said the state water board 
will develop its own proposal by Dec. 15 -- the deadline for the federal 
government's final standards -- and he is optimistic that some disputed issues 
will be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this letter, they are reminding us -- as we should be reminded -- that 
this is a matter of utmost concern to the entire state of California. This is 
an environmental issue as well as an economic one," Wheeler said. "We are in 
total agreement with them about the need to provide a solution that provides 
reliability and predictability." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the two administrations partly broke their deadlock by forming a 
partnership to work together on Bay-Delta protection. The real challenge, 
however, remains in developing standards that appease both. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders said they worry that bond ratings of major utilities, 
which are now undergoing review, could be lowered because of the lack of water 
standards. They also said a "water market" -- in which utilities and landowners 
buy and sell water rights -- cannot thrive until standards are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The business alliance is unusual in that it represents executives from both 
ends of the state, who historically have been at odds over the transfer of 
Northern California's water to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief executive officers who signed the letter are Richard Rosenberg, 
BankAmerica Corp.; Julius R. Krevans, Bay Area Economic Forum; Richard A. 
Clarke, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.; James R. Harvey, TransAmerica Corp.; John 
E. Bryson, Southern California Edison Corp., Robert E. Paulger, Procter & 
Gamble; Thomas A. Page, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.; Thomas W. Morgan, 
Semantic Solutions; Paul Hazen, Wells Fargo Bank; Robert T. Parry, Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco; and Loren Pannier, Industrial League of Orange 
County. A similar letter signed by Airtouch Communications CEO Sam Ginn was 
sent by the California Business Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the standards is to return enough fresh water to the estuary to 
normalize its excessive salt concentrations so that populations of rare chinook 
salmon and other spawning fish can be revived.

NUCLEAR TEST SITE WORKERS LOSE CASE; COURTS: FEDERAL JUDGE REJECTS THE 
CONTENTION THAT THEY CONTRACTED CANCER FROM EXPOSURE TO RADIATION. THEIR 
ATTORNEY SAYS THE RULING 'SLAMS THE DOOR' ON SIMILAR CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bringing an end to an acrimonious chapter in U.S. nuclear history, a federal 
judge has ruled against six men who claimed that they contracted cancer from 
exposure to radiation at the Nevada Test Site, an infamous stretch of 
restricted desert north of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Phillip Pro ruled that the government was immune to 
lawsuits in such matters and therefore he had no jurisdiction to rule in the 
case. He then went on to say that there was not enough evidence to show that 
the cancers -- ranging from a brain tumor to multiple myeloma -- were caused by 
government negligence or that they stemmed from exposure to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, decided Wednesday in a Las Vegas federal courtroom, was the last of 
the major lawsuits against the government stemming from nuclear weapons 
testing. The majority of the cases -- along with annual demonstrations by 
anti-nuclear activists -- focused on the arid expanse the size of Rhode Island 
where atomic weapons were tested above ground in the 1950s and early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five such major cases, the U.S. government has won four -- including 
the so-called Prescott case decided this week. The fifth is still being 
appealed. Stewart Udall, a former secretary of the Interior who brought many of 
the cases against the government, including Prescott, said the decision "slams 
the door shut" on future suits against the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past eight months, as U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary began to open 
secret government files concerning nuclear experimentation, "there has been a 
very clear indication that the old Atomic Energy Commission was reckless and 
lied consistently and abused the rights of people," Udall said. "Yet this 
decision comes as kind of a clunker from the past. . . . There is no remedy for 
the people who were harmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Udall said no decision has been made regarding whether to appeal. "We're 
exhausted financially," he said in an interview Thursday. "We will decide that 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 John Thorndal, an attorney involved in the government's defense, said that the 
decision confirms what those involved in nuclear testing have said all along: 
"That these people had very low levels of exposure to radiation and that their 
cancers were simply not caused by that exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Prescott case was originally filed in 1980 on behalf of 216 former test 
site workers; of those, six cases were selected to go to trial. Keith Prescott, 
now 67, is the only surviving plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott began working at the Nevada Test Site in 1961, digging tunnels for 
underground nuclear weapons blasts and helping recover instruments from those 
tunnels after the tests. He testified in the three-month trial that began in 
December that the government never warned him of radiation dangers at the site, 
although he often felt nauseous and was afraid to breathe the air there. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Prescott was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and continues treatment 
for that condition. "Even if multiple myeloma were determined to be a disease 
which can be induced by radiation . . . this court finds that Mr. Prescott's 
exposure to radiation when employed at the NTS did not cause or substantially 
contribute to his multiple myeloma," Pro said in his 52-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision speaks for itself," said Chris West, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Department of Energy in Las Vegas. "The Department of Energy feels it has an 
extremely safe operation at the Nevada Test Site."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN CLINGS TO 6-POINT LEAD, POLL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After seven weeks of attack television commercials, a new statewide poll finds 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein still locked in a tight race for reelection, although she 
may have stopped the surging support for Republican challenger Michael 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic incumbent clung to a six-point lead over Rep. Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara), virtually the same margin as the San Francisco-based Field 
Poll identified in May. Feinstein was favored by 45% of respondents compared to 
39% for Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found voters emerging from the campaign's most acrimonious 
exchange of television commercials without any signs of enthusiasm for either 
candidate. Feinstein's image continued to sink while Huffington has 
concentrated so much on attacking his opponent that half the state's voters 
said they still do not know much about him. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot was that voters appeared more confused than they were in May. 
Support for both candidates dropped slightly from the May survey while the 
number of undecided voters increased five points to 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public is really struggling with both of these campaigns," said 
Mark DiCamillo, associate director of the Field Poll. "You have to attribute a 
lot of the decline in Feinstein's image and ratings directly to Huffington's 
ads. And the effect of (Feinstein's) recent ads is just to stop the erosion, 
she hasn't turned things around." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein launched her barrage of television commercials a week before the 
June 7 primary when a series of polls found that Huffington had shrunk the 
incumbent's lead much more dramatically than most political observers had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Feinstein had a 26-point edge in the Field Poll that collapsed to 
seven points by late May. 
</P>
<P>
 The new survey contacted 609 registered voters over a five-day period ending 
Sunday. It has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll appeared to confirm that the Senate race many had expected to be an 
easy victory for Feinstein is now likely to be a hard-fought battle. It also 
proved once again the political power of Huffington's personal fortune, which 
he has used to fuel a campaign that has cost about $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's strategy in the last several weeks has been to respond within 
hours to every Feinstein commercial and, at the same time, to pay more for a 
heavier saturation of television airwaves than the Democrat's original attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll suggests that the clash has resulted in a stalemate and prevented 
Feinstein from recovering her previous lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still outspending us about 3 1/2 to 2, so it's a dogfight," Feinstein 
campaign manager Kam Kuwata said. "If that's the way the campaign is run and we 
end up winning by six points, I'm delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington adviser Ken Khachigian said the results prove there is fertile 
ground for the Republican campaign. "Clearly our message has been effective in 
alerting California voters to the things that Dianne has done that they don't 
approve of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent campaign finance statements, released last week, show that 
Feinstein has spent about $3 million since January, about a third of what 
Huffington has spent.  
</P>
<P>
 With three months remaining until the Nov. 8 election, the poll also seemed to 
indicate that plenty could still happen in the Senate race because so many 
voters know so little about Huffington. Both campaigns are now in a race to 
define the Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days ahead, Huffington's campaign plans to focus more attention on the 
candidate's vision for solving major social problems. Feinstein's campaign 
hopes to offer voters a different version of the Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important number of this poll is that nearly half of the respondents 
don't have enough of a sense (about Huffington) to rate him -- and that's very 
dangerous for a candidate," Kuwata said. "We are going to try to help him get 
known." 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian said: "I would look at it as a missionary looks upon nonbelievers. 
Basically it's an opportunity to convert people to your cause. . . . We have 
roughly 16 weeks to fill in the blank space." 
</P>
<P>
 About 29% of the poll's respondents had a favorable opinion of Huffington 
while about 22% had an unfavorable opinion. Both figures are up from April, 
when only 11% had a favorable opinion compared to 7% unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, voters' impressions of Feinstein continued to slide. Favorable 
impressions of the former San Francisco mayor dropped from 55% in May to 47%, 
while 43% reported that they have an unfavorable opinion, up from 35% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline has continued since January, when the Field Poll found 59% of 
voters had a favorable image of the senator while 28% did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Huffington) has chosen that rather to speak about what he believes in, he 
will bash her," Kuwata said. "And when you spend $10 million to tell people 
that someone is bad, some of it sticks."

GOLD-MEDAL SAVE; CABBIE KEEPS BRAZIL'S GOALIE FROM LOSING BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after Brazilian goalie Claudio Taffarel's nail-biting World Cup win, it 
was cab driver Juan Blanco's turn for a huge save. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco found a fanny pack with a World Cup gold medal, the Taffarel family's 
passports and $60,000 in cash, which Taffarel had left in the cab after a ride 
to the Fullerton Marriott on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 32-year-old Blanco, who had driven his cab to the Rose Bowl on Sunday 
in an unsuccessful search for an affordable ticket to the final game, ended up 
with a champion's reception of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco, a self-described soccer nut who rooted for Brazil after Mexico was 
knocked out of the World Cup tournament, knew his rider was a player when he 
picked him up Monday at the Anaheim Marriott, but didn't know which one. They 
chatted about the game on the way to Fullerton and Taffarel subsequently 
introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The cab driver then dashed home for breakfast and a quick nap. When he climbed 
back in his leased cab, he spotted the pink-and-black fanny pack in the back 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 He was stunned when he checked the compartments inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened the front bag. I noticed a bunch of key rings and tie clips. I 
opened the second one. I saw a passport and visa for him and his wife and his 
daughter," Blanco said. But the rear compartment held the big find: A wallet 
with the World Cup gold medal tucked inside, and $60,000 in four neat packets 
of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started shaking," Blanco said. "I thought, 'I'm holding a gold medal in my 
hand.' . . . I was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment he thought about how much the money could buy in Mexico. But the 
lure was brief: "It's not for me. It's not inside me to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 About the time Blanco was showing his find to his brother Roselio, Taffarel 
had discovered his mistake and contacted Cal State Fullerton police with 
sketchy information: A cab, white and yellow. No number. No driver name. 
</P>
<P>
 But the white-and-yellow description fit Blanco's cab firm, A-AAA Yellow Cab 
of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time police contacted the company and a call went out to drivers, the 
brothers were already on their way to deliver the pack, said Michael Casey, the 
company's general manager. On their way out, the pair grabbed a camera and 
Blanco took along two videotapes he had made of the final World Cup games, in 
hopes the goalie would sign them. Roselio Blanco clutched the medal all the way 
to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco handed the pack to a police officer at the hotel, but Taffarel demanded 
to meet his driver in person. Blanco remembers a dreamy encounter: Star players 
he knew only from TV, big hugs and profuse thanks from a much-relieved 
Taffarel. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco said Taffarel gave him $1,000 from the wallet, souvenir tie clasps and 
a team sweat-shirt. The goalie even autographed the shoulder of Blanco's white 
driver's shirt. And before he knew it, he was standing with Taffarel in front 
of a television camera broadcasting the tale to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey has plastered news of the good deed around the cab firm and has plans to 
buy a special dinner for Blanco and his girlfriend.

 A Lebanese Muslim was sentenced to four years of hard labor Thursday for 
complicity in the 1976 kidnaping and murders of U.S. Ambassador Francis E. 
Meloy, an embassy counselor and their Lebanese driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Nameq Ahmed Kamel hid in Meloy's car after guerrillas of the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine snatched the victims at a checkpoint in West Beirut 
during Lebanon's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Meloy, economic counselor Robert O. Waring and their driver, 
Mohammed Moghrabi, were found hours later in another district of West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected killer, an agent of the Palestinian group who uses the name 
Mahmoud Awadah, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The court cited a lack of evidence in handing down Kamel's relatively light 
sentence. It acquitted another man accused in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The two defendants had earlier been convicted in absentia and sentenced to 
life in prison. They later turned up and, under Lebanese law, a new trial was 
ordered.

LIFESTYLES; JUST THE FACTS ABOUT LIFE IN EUROPE; BOOKLET COMPARES EU NATIONS' 
HEALTH CARE, GAS PRICES, DIVORCE RATES AND MORE

<P>
 Got a minor ailment? The best place for treatment in Europe could be Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece? 
</P>
<P>
 While the fact may be hard to believe, it's true -- officially listed in a 
recently published document that compares life in the European Union's 12 
member states. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in black and white, it shows that, at least in terms of quantity, 
Greece leads the way, with more doctors per capita than any of the richer 
northern countries. It also has the second-highest number of dentists in the 
Union, topped only by Denmark, and stands fifth in the number of pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
 But if things get serious, head north. Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Germany 
have the highest number of hospital beds per capita. 
</P>
<P>
 On the verge of a nervous breakdown? Ireland offers more than a tranquil 
setting. It has the most psychiatric beds per thousand inhabitants of any 
country in the Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, avoid Italy, which sits at or near the bottom in nearly every 
medical category listed. 
</P>
<P>
 These and thousands of other facts are tucked into a small 28-page booklet, 
published by the EU's statistical office in Luxembourg, designed and 
distributed to give voters in recent European Parliament elections a chance to 
see where their own country stood in comparison with neighboring nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it has done much more. The book's simple design and broad 
distribution in all the Union's nine official languages has given it an impact 
far beyond the normally dry fare dished up by the statistical office, known as 
Eurostat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten a lot of publicity," said John Wright, the office's press 
adviser. "It has confirmed people's national prejudices, but there's also some 
surprises. Either way, the press loves to jump on these kinds of comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the surprises, beyond Greece's medical strength: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Denmark, a nation noted for its progress toward sexual equality, women 
have a shorter life expectancy than in any other member country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The highest percentage of women in higher education is in Portugal -- 153 
women for every 100 men. The lowest is in Germany -- 71 women for every 100 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fertility and birthrates are currently running far higher in the northern 
countries, such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, than in the 
southern Roman Catholic nations, such as Spain, Italy and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the not-so-surprising category, Britain has the wettest climate; Spain and 
Greece have the driest. Belgium and Italy have the region's oldest populations, 
Ireland the youngest. The Dutch produce the most trash and the Irish the most 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eurostat survey, "Facts Through Figures," also carries some interesting 
information for those just passing through. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're filling the gas tank, for example, do it either in Luxembourg ($2.50 
a gallon) or Britain ($2.80), but avoid Italy ($3.83) and the Netherlands 
($3.74). 
</P>
<P>
 Taken collectively, the Eurostat figures sketch a region that is still divided 
by vastly different living standards and lifestyles, despite a gradual 
political and economic convergence over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing power of a Greek or Portuguese white-collar worker remains less 
than half that of their Dutch, German or British counterparts, their social 
benefits are far fewer, and their earnings are more likely to be eaten by 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Spain is also nearly 10 times that in Luxembourg and nearly 
quadruple Germany's rate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the southern Mediterranean countries remain the principal 
guardians of traditional values, listing fewer divorces, larger families and 
fewer children born out of wedlock. In Denmark, with its relaxed approach to 
family structure, just under half of all births (46.4%) in 1992 occurred out of 
wedlock. In Greece, the figure was closer to 1 in 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, la dolce vita remains firmly anchored in the south, where Eurostat 
discovered that the Greeks and Portuguese spend more than twice as much of 
their disposable income on food, drink and tobacco than do the more reserved 
Dutch, Germans and Belgians to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense interest in the recent survey has spurred Eurostat to present 
other issues in an easy-to-read form. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on one now that looks at education in the Union, showing the 
number of people learning English in every country," Wright said. "It's not 
going to please the French very much." Spotlighting the Differences

BLAIR CHOSEN NEW LABOR PARTY CHIEF; BRITAIN: CHARISMATIC 41-YEAR-OLD IS PRAISED 
FOR HIS MODERATE POLICIES, POLITICAL SAVVY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Blair, the 41-year-old advocate of moderate, democratic socialist 
policies, was elected the new Labor Party leader Thursday by a comfortable 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, he gained a clear majority -- 57% of the votes cast by Labor 
members of Parliament, the constituency membership and affiliated unions. The 
other two candidates, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett, polled 24.1% and 
18.9% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the deputy leadership, Prescott defeated Beckett, with 56.5% 
to her 43.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Party supporters widely hailed the leadership team as a "dream ticket," 
matching Blair's brainy charm with Prescott's rough-hewn common touch. 
</P>
<P>
 As leader, Blair would be the next prime minister if the Labor Party defeats 
the ruling Conservative Party in a national election that must be held within 
32 months. He now heads a "shadow cabinet" with Labor Party members of 
Parliament designated as spokespersons for all departments of the British 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership vote was unexpectedly low, mainly among trade unionists: 
Figures showed that fewer than one in four of those eligible had voted -- 
952,109 ballots out of 4.3 million. Still, Labor Party Chairman David Blunkett 
said the election was "the most extensive democratic exercise ever within a 
European political party." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair -- a tall, slender, articulate member of Parliament who was born in 
Scotland -- succeeds John Smith, who died of a heart attack two months ago. 
Beckett had been acting leader since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Party has lost four national elections since last holding power in 
1979. The last defeated leader, Neil Kinnock, is widely reported as likely to 
become one of Britain's two European Union commissioners in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, educated as a lawyer, is credited with a wide knowledge of politics and 
issues. His good looks have led some Tories to christen him "Bambi." But he is, 
by all accounts, a tough political operator with a firm grasp on the party 
machinery -- and so will avoid the fractious inside battles that have split the 
Labor Party in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In an acceptance speech, Blair declared: "I shall not rest until, once again, 
the destinies of our people and our party are joined together again in victory 
at the next general election -- Labor in its rightful place, in government 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 He said of his task: "It is a mission to lift the spirit of the nation, 
drawing its people together, to rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are at 
the heart of any country fit to be called one nation." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Conservatives, he said: "You have had your chance. You have had 15 
years to get it right. If you can't change this country for better after 15 
years, you never will. It is time for you to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair shrugged off divisions between the "old left and the new right," calling 
for a "new left-of-center agenda." But he added: "We must avoid foolish 
illusions and false promises" and said that just because the Tories had "lost 
the nation's trust" did not mean that Labor would "inherit it automatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair's election was praised by Labor Party senior figures, as was Prescott's 
in the No. 2 position. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jeremy Hanley, the newly appointed Conservative Party chairman picked to 
revive his party's low standing in opinion polls, congratulated Blair, 
mentioning they had entered Parliament together in 1983. But he added: "How is 
he going to pay for the perfect world he is advocating? That's what we've got 
to get out of him."

ARAFAT TELLS CHRISTOPHER OF PROSPECT FOR MORE VIOLENCE; GAZA STRIP: PLO CHIEF 
SAYS SELF-RULE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT $2.4 BILLION IN PROMISED AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During a Thursday visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the 
newly autonomous government in the squalid Gaza Strip, PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat warned of increased violence unless international donors come through 
with promises of $2.4 billion in aid to transform the Palestinian self-rule 
into reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gaza Strip has arrived to the red line of starvation," Arafat said at a 
news conference, adding, "This has to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The humiliation and frustration of Palestinian workers, he insisted, has 
produced a "very dramatic situation." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, two people were killed and almost 100 were injured in riots 
triggered by thousands of frustrated Palestinians barred from working in 
Israel. Unemployment in Gaza, home to almost 1 million Palestinians, is 
estimated to be nearly 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move certain to create controversy in Israel, Arafat also declared 
Thursday that Israel has no right to invite Jordan's King Hussein to Jerusalem 
as part of the separate Israeli-Jordanian peace process. He said that right was 
reserved for him only as leader of the Palestinian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my duty and my responsibility to offer the invitations to all my 
brothers and to all my friends to visit the holy city, and the holy Christian 
and Muslim places in the holy city," said Arafat, who wore his familiar drab 
green fatigues but not his trademark holster for the meeting with Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat then invited the Jordanian monarch to visit Jerusalem's Islamic shrines 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks triggered an immediate backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know that Arafat had a mandate over Jerusalem," said Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres at a reception for Egypt's National Day in Tel Aviv. 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was "furious" but refused to comment, according to 
an Israeli official. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's statement also carried implications for Hussein, who considers 
himself the guardian of Jerusalem's holy places. It was interpreted as a 
warning to the king not to unilaterally visit Jerusalem. Over the past year, 
the monarch gave $65 million to restore the historic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the primary focus of the trip by Christopher, the highest-ranking foreign 
official to visit since Arafat's arrival July 1, was the Palestinian economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 After their 90-minute exchange, Christopher acknowledged that the new 
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho faces "a time-urgent situation. . . . 
Clearly, the Palestinians face a very difficult time here. It will not be easy 
for them, but I urge them to work through it with determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said he assured Arafat that the United States, international 
community and Israel all "have a large stake in the success of this 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 But in blunt language, he also told the Palestine Liberation Organization 
chairman that the new government must show it can handle the loans responsibly 
and can account for how donors' money gets spent. He said they held "sober and 
serious" talks about donors' need for documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that for more than two decades, the PLO had a 
reputation of corruption and undocumented spending. But the new government also 
is still unfamiliar with basic functions, from designing project proposals for 
aid to setting up payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher was accompanied by Joan Spiro, the undersecretary of state for 
economic affairs, who will remain behind to advise the Palestinians on 
procedures to satisfy international donors and financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of the problem facing Arafat was visible as Christopher's delegation 
drove through Gaza. In stark contrast to the modern roads and buildings on the 
Israeli side of the new sandy border, even the main streets of Gaza are 
littered with masses of garbage; the walls here are covered with graffiti. 
Christopher entered through the Erez crossing where the riots erupted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the session, Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, told 
reporters: "The euphoria has passed. Now is the time for action." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat praised the Clinton Administration for its support. "We have found a 
real friend in the White House. It is President Clinton, and we are sure you 
will help us," Arafat said, telling the U.S. delegation, "I'm sure that with 
your help, we'll be able to touch the fruits of the peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also held two rounds of talks Thursday with Rabin about efforts to 
find terms for peace with Syria. In Egypt earlier in the day, Peres said the 
peace process would not be truly comprehensive until Syria is included. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot leave any open wounds on the body of the politics in the Middle 
East," he added. Since the announcement of a breakthrough between Jordan and 
Israel last week, the Israeli government has taken pains to make clear that it 
does not intend to isolate Syria from the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher will wrap up his weeklong peacemaking effort with a stop today in 
Syria for talks with President Hafez Assad.

SOLZHENITSYN TRIP OFFERS GRIM PICTURE OF RUSSIA; REFORMS: CITIZENS ARE 
SUFFERING, WRITER SAYS AFTER CROSS-COUNTRY TREK TO GAUGE NATION'S PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 20-year exile in the West and an eight-week rail trek across Russia, 
Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn returned to Moscow on Thursday night with a litany of 
complaints from his compatriots and a grim verdict that this country and its 
reforms are "in big, heavy and multifaceted trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody expected that the way out of communism would be painless, but nobody 
expected it would be so painful," Russia's greatest living writer declared. "We 
have tried to break away from communism, but again and again we have taken the 
clumsiest, hardest and most twisted path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere, you can hear moans that the state is, again, not fulfilling its 
obligations before its citizens," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 His harsh judgment, delivered to about 1,000 people in the rain outside 
Moscow's Yaroslavl train station, put the 75-year-old sage squarely in the 
struggle to change Russia's direction. It marked a new challenge for Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin, who in recent months has gained a measure of 
political and economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spoken with thousands of people on a 5,900-mile journey of rediscovery 
from Russia's Far East, through Siberia, the Ural Mountains and the Volga River 
valley, Solzhenitsyn brought added authority to complaints he had uttered from 
exile that the Yeltsin government's free-market reforms are helping to 
impoverish this country and corrupt its values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote down everything they said . . . their advice, requests, pleading, 
insisting . . . and I will bring all this to the ears of those who have power 
and influence," Solzhenitsyn said upon arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he ticked off their woes: Farmers are being ripped off by middlemen, he 
said. Huge failing factories are dragging down the welfare of entire cities. 
Doctors and teachers are working "almost without reward." The 25 million ethnic 
Russians who live in neighboring countries are being ignored. "A snake of crime 
is threatening to strangle all of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his most damning appraisal, which drew the loudest applause, mocked 
Yeltsin's claim to be Russia's first democratic leader. "People in our country 
are not masters of their fate," he said. "We cannot say that democracy is in 
power. There is no democracy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Russians will be hearing all this again when Solzhenitsyn addresses Parliament 
after its summer recess. Moving quickly to get Yeltsin out of the firing line, 
his spokesman suggested Thursday that the author meet soon with the president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other politicians of varying stripes lined up to welcome the writer and court 
him as an ally. Sergei Barburin, a right-wing nationalist, predicted that 
Solzhenitsyn will side with the "patriotic opposition." Moscow Mayor Yuri M. 
Luzhkov, who has presidential ambitions, introduced Solzhenitsyn at the rail 
station as "the man who best knows Russia from within." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked from the crowd whether he will run for president, Solzhenitsyn repeated 
his vow to shun public office. "But I will use all the possibilities to speak 
and exert influence," he added. "That is my role." 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians have suggested that the conservative anti-Communist writer, 
who has refrained from criticizing Yeltsin by name, will bolster the 
anti-Yeltsin ranks while moderating their extremism. Apparently sensing his 
isolation, neo-fascist politician Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whom Solzhenitsyn 
has labeled a "crude caricature of (a) patriot," said Thursday that the writer 
should "go back where he came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn has lived 18 of the last 20 years in Vermont. Having spent eight 
years in Josef Stalin's prison camps and exposed their cruelties in his 
powerful writings, he was arrested by Soviet authorities in 1974 and stripped 
of his citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 His east-to-west trek across Russia began May 27 in the Pacific port city of 
Vladivostok, where he hitched his private luxury rail car to the Trans-Siberian 
Express. He unhitched it in cities along the way, staying for days at a time 
and packing auditoriums and public squares with admirers, many of whom welcomed 
him as a prophet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing Solzhenitsyn is as cleansing as going to a beautiful temple," said 
Yuri Bakhtin, 35, a businessman who came to hear the writer speak. "He is a 
living legend. . . . Let's see if he will change us and our ways or if we will 
change him." 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn's conversion from literary hermit in Vermont to touring celebrity 
in Russia can only enhance his influence. Having finished his biggest work, a 
four-volume history of Russia on the eve of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, he 
has returned to a nation that, to his surprise, is more eager to hear his words 
than to read them. In one poll last month, 44% of those questioned had not read 
one of his books. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the author said he had "met lots of healthy souls, curious, active, 
searching minds, often in confusion, not knowing how to direct themselves." In 
his lone note of optimism, he said Russians "will manage to get out of this 
pit" but only with "high responsibility at the top and great effort from 
beneath."

PROBE CONTINUES IN PANAMA CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plane crash in Panama that killed 21 people, most of them Jewish, was 
probably linked to business deals and not ethnically motivated, President-elect 
Ernesto Perez Balladares said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez told reporters during a visit to Washington: "We think (the) true motive 
is probably related to illegal activities in (Colon's) Free Zone," a duty-free 
center that attracts foreign business people and, some say, questionable 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators combed the plane's wreckage Thursday to look for evidence in 
Tuesday's crash, which came on the heels of a deadly explosion Monday at a 
Jewish community center in Argentina.

ANGRY ITALIAN LAWMAKERS KILL DECREE FREEING CORRUPTION SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a shouting and shoving match between government allies, lawmakers 
Thursday overwhelmingly nullified a Cabinet decree that released nearly 200 
political corruption suspects from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl illustrated the disarray within Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi's fraying 2-month-old government. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree, approved by Berlusconi and Cabinet allies a week earlier, 
unleashed a storm of protest and handed Berlusconi his first crisis since he 
took office in May. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Berlusconi bowed to pressure and announced the decree would be 
rescinded by the Cabinet and be presented to Parliament as proposed 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, the Chamber of Deputies voted 418-33 with 41 abstentions to 
nullify the measure. Without the vote, the decree would have stayed in effect 
until the Cabinet rescinded it later in the week, potentially allowing dozens 
of other corruption suspects out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday evening, 2,137 people out of about 4,000 eligible suspects had 
been released from prison under the decree. Most were small-time drug dealers 
or thieves, but close to 200 corruption suspects were released, including a 
former health minister. Many of those released were put under house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree sharply limited the kinds of suspects who can be jailed while an 
investigation continues. Corruption, graft and other nonviolent crimes were 
eliminated from the preventive detention category. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics call preventive detention an infringement on civil liberties. But 
prosecutors say it has helped them crack down on endemic political corruption.

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; WOMAN WHOSE ITEMS WERE AT SUSPECT'S HOME IS ALIVE, WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Deborah Aileen Clark was at Critters Cocktail Lounge in Glendale, Ariz., on 
Thursday night, surprised at being the center of attention and feeling "freaked 
out" about her possible brush with a murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, who had found Clark's birth certificate and other personal 
effects this week about 200 miles away in the Dewey, Ariz., home of murder 
suspect John J. Famalaro, had spent two days searching for the 39-year-old 
woman who they feared was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 But that fear was dispelled late Thursday when Clark was found at Critters 
"alive and well," Glendale Police Officer James Toomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel much better knowing she's all right," Toomey said. "We still want to 
talk to her about any possible connection to Mr. Famalaro." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have been trying to trace a list of women whose names were 
garnered from items found during a search of Famalaro's home -- including 
identification, credit cards and clothing, some with crimson stains. They have 
successfully located all of the women.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've moved rather swiftly through the list of names and have been fortunate 
that we've been able to find everyone," said Yavapai County Sheriff's 
spokeswoman Laurie Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Clark said she finds the whole thing "very eerie," adding that 
patrons at Critters have asked for her autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "It freaks me out very much. I'm just glad to be alive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said she had read stories about Famalaro's arrest in a local newspaper 
and had even seen her name published in a story Thursday morning. But she did 
not make any connection until she was contacted by police later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the name in the paper, I thought it must have been somebody else 
because there are a lot of people with that same name," Clark said. "I didn't 
think anything of it. I never thought I would be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she does not know Famalaro or recognize him from his pictures. But 
she said she does remember meeting a man at a bar in December who stole her 
purse after she rejected his advances.

 Clark said she was drunk the night she and the man met and does not remember 
much about him. But she said she does remember that he was driving an 
orange-and-silver U-Haul truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to force himself on me and when I said no, he got mad and left with 
my purse and the U-Haul," she said. "I never saw him again after that."

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; SCIENCE CAN BRING A MURDER SCENE BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Armed with new gee-whiz technology, crime scene investigators can often 
re-create who was at a murder scene, what they were wearing, whether sex of 
some sort took place -- even choreograph a struggle -- long after a killer has 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in some cases where there's been an identification (of a 
victim) years after the crime has been committed," said Dr. Cyril Wecht of 
Pittsburgh, one of the country's leading forensic pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Such techniques may assist investigators as they try to determine what 
happened in a Laguna Hills storage bin under investigation as the possible 
murder site of Denise Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Using argon lasers and a chemical spray called Luminol, investigators can make 
clues invisible to the eye in daylight glow in the darkness like tiny beacons, 
criminalists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argon lasers, the most common laser used at crime scenes, emit a stream of 
amplified light waves that cause physiological fluids and trace evidence -- 
such as semen, fibers from clothing, car upholstery and rugs, and the chemicals 
left behind by fingerprints -- to fluoresce in various colors, forensic 
scientists said.  
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Black, supervisor of the identification bureau of the Orange County 
Sheriff-Coroner's Office, said she has used lasers to identify fingerprints six 
years after a crime occurred. But, she said, "the older it is, the less likely 
it is to glow." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood, which does not react to the laser, appears velvety black, forensic 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, usually working in the dead of night, use Luminol to find 
bloodstains invisible to the naked eye, said Donald J. Johnson, senior 
criminalist with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Scientific 
Services Bureau. The chemical in Luminol reacts with the hemoglobin component 
in blood and causes bloodstains to change color and emit a faint glow, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one murder case in Washington, D.C., in 1992, Luminol showed where a 
woman's bloodied fingers were dragged off the edge of a bed before her death. 
Before the Luminol test, there had been no visible sign of the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators who have spent recent nights probing a Laguna Hills storage 
locker where murder suspect John J. Famalaro was staying at the time of Huber's 
disappearance are thought to be using both lasers and Luminol. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Quo, assistant director of forensic science services for the 
coroner's office, declined to discuss the Huber case. But she said the 
department frequently uses both techniques. Once the blood and bodily fluid 
samples are identified and collected, investigators can identify both the 
victims and perpetrators using the DNA in semen and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 With new technology, it is possible to identify a victim years after a crime 
occurred just from a tiny splotch of dried blood, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the quality of the blood, " he said. "For the most 
discriminating DNA test, we need no more than a bloodstain the size of a 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson and other forensic scientists emphasized that exposure to other 
chemicals or the sun can affect whether a sample can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's not the age of the blood that matters; sometimes it's the 
chemical it comes in contact with," Quo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a blood sample is retrieved, the tiny fragments of DNA in the sample can 
be replicated over and over into a much larger sample through a process called 
PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, Johnson said. The sample is then matched 
with the DNA in the tissue or hair from a victim, he said.

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; MORE WOMEN'S NAMES -- MORE MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tucked inside boxes, hidden among stacks of papers, on food stamps and credit 
cards strewn among the debris in accused murderer John J. Famalaro's country 
club home in Arizona, investigators have collected a mysterious series of 
women's names. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the connection between these women, most of whom live in Orange 
County, and Famalaro? 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not know. And neither do many of the women themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be interesting to know what my connection would be, but all this is 
doing is tormenting to me because I don't remember," said Leila Leland, 44. Her 
Irvine address and her name -- with one letter missing -- were discovered on a 
label on a box of kitchen utensils stored on a shelf in the suspect's garage. 
"I wish I could tell you something that would make it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, a painter and handyman who grew up in Orange County, was arrested 
last week in Arizona when police discovered the frozen body of Denise Huber in 
a truck parked outside his home. Huber, 23, of Newport Beach, had been missing 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first search of Famalaro's home, police compiled a list of 10 
women's names, including Huber's, and worried that the others might be 
additional victims. They have since found all those women alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But in documents revealed Thursday, police noted half a dozen more names. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Linda Globerman, M.D., an Irvine dermatologist whose name was on a 
magazine stuffed inside a box. Famalaro cleaned her home and office regularly a 
decade ago, Globerman -- who now uses her married name, Jackson -- said, but 
she hasn't seen him since.  
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed nice, he did his job, he even took his grandmother to see me," she 
remembered. "I've been racking my brains trying to think, but that's all we 
knew of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Donna R. Evinger, 57, a Tustin woman whose name was found on a 
scrap of paper among a stack of real estate documents -- but has no clue as to 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good God, even my middle initial!" Evinger exclaimed. "I don't understand 
where he got my name. . . . He even got the R. I only use that as a signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't register with me at all," she said of Famalaro's picture in the 
paper. "The name means nothing to me." After a pause, she added: "I'm pretty 
shook up. It's definitely something I never expected to have happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The other names included a retired Seal Beach woman, an 18-year-old California 
resident whom The Times could not locate Thursday night, and what appeared to 
be the name of a local chiropractor, though one letter of her name is wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Evinger, Globerman-Jackson and Leland all said Thursday that they had not been 
contacted by police. But once alerted by reporters, they started wondering 
about possible links to Famalaro's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking in the (paper) and I don't even recognize him," Leland said, 
sighing. "I tried to imagine him without a beard. . . . I'd hate to think I 
hired a murderer. It's crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know what's in the (utensil) box," she added. "But, obviously I'm 
having a good life without whatever's in the box."

HAM RADIO OPERATORS LINKED BOSNIA TO OUTSIDE WORLD; BALKANS: HUSBAND-AND-WIFE 
TEAM BROUGHT NEWS, BOTH JOYOUS AND TRAGIC, TO SEPARATED FAMILIES. BUT NOW 
AUTHORITIES HAVE CUT THEM OFF. 
</P>

<P>
 With Bosnia-Herzegovina cut off from telephones, telegrams, cards, letters and 
packages, Dragan and Ljiljana Dimitrijevic tried to provide a crucial 
information lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the husband-and-wife team sent out and received thousands of 
messages via their ham radio, providing a link for separated families and 
friends to receive critical news -- joyous and tragic -- about each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as with dozens of their Good Samaritan broadcast colleagues, the 
Dimitrijevics' services have been cut off by Yugoslav authorities. The 
government here this spring issued and since has enforced restrictions barring 
the 150 or so local ham radio operators from transmitting messages from Serbia 
and Montenegro, the two former republics that make up the rump nation of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some radio contacts are still permitted, but not for purposes of passing on 
messages to and from those who live in Bosnia.  
</P>
<P>
 A report released last month by the Humanitarian Law Fund, a Serbian human 
rights watchdog, condemned the ban, labeling the Yugoslav Defense Ministry's 
decision to limit the work of radio amateurs illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither human rights advocates nor ham operators can explain why the 
government cracked down on the broadcasts; speculation of the motive ranges 
from fear of espionage to outright cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army thinks that radio amateurs send coded messages," said Dragan 
Dimitrijevic, 53, of the espionage theory. "But there are 1,000 other ways if 
someone wants to transmit ciphers." 
</P>
<P>
 Milos Vasic, an editor of the independent Belgrade newsmagazine Vreme, 
dismisses the authorities' theory that ham radio operators have transmitted 
military secrets. He says the ban on their activities came because "the 
authorities want to forbid human contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Ljiljana Dimitrijevic says she is angry that their humanitarian efforts should 
be forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the government cracked down recently, she and her husband received phone 
calls from people all around the world anxious to garner any scrap of 
information about friends or relatives in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I hooked up someone in Bosnia with just one person in Germany, then I 
would get five calls," she said. "Our home was like an international telephone 
exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 For up to 15 hours each day, the couple would contact ham counterparts in 
Bosnia, who would, in turn, establish a radio-to-telephone hookup so that 
long-separated people could speak with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day the messages from the outside world poured in: "Are you still alive?" 
"Can you get out?" "What do you need?"  
</P>
<P>
 And from war-torn Bosnia in reply: "Send food." "Amra had a baby." "Enes is 
dead."  
</P>
<P>
 The first step to restrict such communications was taken by the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government. It banned direct telephone contacts, insisting that ham 
operators pass on messages rather than allow a third party to speak directly 
over the radio. Serbian authorities retaliated by outlawing the transmission of 
all messages, except for those handled by a handful of radio stations, such as 
the Jewish Community Center in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, ham radio operators have been the only link between the world and a 
besieged community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times I spoke with radio amateurs while their towns were being bombed," 
says Ljiljana Dimitrijevic. 
</P>
<P>
 A ham radio devotee for 38 years, Ljiljana even met her husband over the radio 
waves. Numerous radio awards decorate the "control room" in their fourth-floor 
apartment. But when the more than 2-year-old war began, their onetime hobby 
became something of a crusade to foster human contacts throughout the war-torn 
former federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ljiljana Dimitrijevic says the work has sometimes been painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say when a young ham radio operator tells a weeping father to 
pull himself together so that he could speak to his son, who was on the other 
side?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crackling airwaves sometimes have carried laughter too. 
</P>
<P>
 "One woman had not seen her husband in two years," she recounted. "Finally, we 
established a telephone contact, but his voice, relayed through several links, 
was so distorted that she insisted that it was not her husband. When he started 
to curse, she laughed and said, 'So it really is you!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Dimitrijevics say they have maintained strict neutrality in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never discussed politics or even wondered about the nationality of the 
person on the other end," Dragan Dimitrijevic says.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Dimitrijevics have not yet managed to collect the multitude of 
documents that the government demands to re-register their station, they have 
escaped any trouble. They are even allowed to establish direct radio contacts 
so long as they take care to avoid saying anything that could be construed as a 
third-party message.

TIPS DON'T RING TRUE AT THIS NUMBER 
</P>

<P>
 Got a hot tip in the O.J. Simpson murder case? Please don't call Teri Thomas 
in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Simpson's attorneys announced they were setting up a toll-free 
phone line -- (800) 322-3632 -- to take tips in the case, Thomas says her phone 
has been ringing off the proverbial hook. That's because Thomas' phone number 
is (310) 322-3632 -- just an area code away from O.J.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 200 calls in less than 24 hours, Thomas, a 39-year-old mother 
of two young children, is getting more than a little tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ruins your whole day," Thomas said, wearily, during an interview that was 
interrupted four times in five minutes by O.J. calls. After one such call, she 
said, "He (the caller) said he thinks he knows who killed her. I told him to 
call the 800 number." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sample calls from Thomas' answering machine: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I love O.J., O.J. is my man!" one caller said -- over and over -- in a rap 
song cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'd like to speak to O.J. Simpson's lawyer about those two people who 
climbed over the fence," said a man calling from the Philadelphia area. "I 
think I seen one of them drop a glove." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Man, I sure would hate to have this number," said another caller who 
obviously realized that he had the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least, Thomas said, no one has confessed to committing the murders. 
And she hasn't collected any interesting tips from callers. Fact is, she's not 
that interested in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware of the basics, but I haven't really been following it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone calls started coming Wednesday night after news reports about the 
Simpson 800 number. Thomas and her husband, Bruce, a G.M. Hughes Electronics 
engineer, weren't aware that the Simpson number had the same seven digits as 
their number. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman called from New York and said she had a tip on O.J.," Thomas said. "I 
said, 'Why tell me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After that the calls came pouring in, until finally the Thomases unplugged 
their phone. They thought they were just harassment calls until Thursday 
morning when they heard the Simpson 800 number on the news and realized that, 
except for the area code, it was their number too. 
</P>
<P>
 Some callers apparently tried calling the 800 number, couldn't get through and 
then tried the seven-digit number in Los Angeles' three area codes. (In the 213 
and 818 area codes, the number is not in service.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed the message on our answering machine," Thomas said. "It used to 
say, 'Hi, thanks for calling.' Now it says, 'If you're calling for (Simpson 
attorney) Robert Shapiro, please hang up and call the 800 number." 
</P>
<P>
 That has helped a little, Thomas said. But she still has to listen to the 
calls on her answering machine so she won't miss any important calls -- 
important to her, not O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 In between incoming phone calls, Thomas made a call of her own -- to Shapiro's 
law office. She got an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left a message telling him I thought it was really inconsiderate to do that 
(set up the 800 number) without checking to see if it was anybody else's 
number," Thomas said. "I asked him to call me back." 
</P>
<P>
 She's still waiting for that call.

U.S. TO MAKE AIRLINES TELL OF PESTICIDE SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday identified 25 countries that require 
airlines to spray a roach-killing pesticide on inbound airline passengers and 
said it is drafting a proposal that would require advance notification of the 
practice when passengers buy their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to pressure from lawmakers and the public, Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena said he will issue a regulation requiring U.S.-based and foreign 
airlines and travel agents who book such flights to alert customers to the 
possible danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said travelers should take account of the information in making their 
plans. "Hopefully," he said, "this information will . . . lead many countries, 
especially those dependent on U.S. tourists, to consider the spraying 
requirement." 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying of the pesticide d-phenothrin in closed airline cabins, an 
insect-control measure required by many countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, is likely to pose a health threat to people who are sensitive to 
certain industrial chemicals, federal health officials have concluded. There is 
also evidence that it exacerbates the conditions of those with chronic 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cans of the pesticide sold commercially for use in the home are labeled with a 
warning: "Avoid breathing; avoid contact with skin and eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-based air carriers and the travel industry have opposed any regulation 
requiring them to notify passengers of the spraying, and Pena initially 
resisted issuing such a rule. But on Thursday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) 
threatened to offer an amendment to the Transportation Department authorization 
bill that would have barred flights to and from any countries that have not 
provided the United States with information on their "disinsection" policies. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pena reversed his position and promised to propose the regulation, Leahy 
dropped his amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the list issued by the Transportation Department, these countries 
require airline passengers to be sprayed with pesticide before getting off 
inbound planes: Costa Rica, Madagascar, Antigua, Belize, the Congo, Grenada, 
Mauritius, the Seychelles, Yemen, Mexico, Mozambique, American Samoa (a U.S. 
trust territory), Cape Verde (a frequent stopover point for flights to South 
Africa), the Dominican Republic, India, New Caledonia, St. Lucia, Jamaica, 
Argentina, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, El Salvador, Kenya and 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia, New Zealand and Panama also require spraying of the pesticide in 
airline cabins but allow it to be done before passengers have boarded. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be at least a year before the proposed rule took effect.

HOUSTON GETS 1ST WIND-SHEAR RADAR IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air traffic controllers switched on the nation's first wind-shear radar system 
Thursday, allowing them to give pilots earlier warnings of the dangerous, 
shifting winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The system at Houston Intercontinental Airport is the first of 47 Doppler 
radars to be installed nationwide at storm-prone airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar warns controllers instantly when sudden wind shifts occur within 50 
miles of the airport. Current wind-shear detection systems monitor only the 
airport's immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board blamed microbursts -- powerful 
downdrafts of air -- for the August, 1985, crash of a Delta jet at Dallas-Ft. 
Worth International Airport. The crash killed 137 people. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a USAir jet crashed in a thunderstorm on July 2 in Charlotte, 
N.C., less than two minutes after pilots were warned of wind shear. 
Thirty-seven people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the crash is still under study and federal investigators have not 
determined if wind shear was a contributing factor. The Charlotte-Douglas 
International Airport is 38th on the list to receive the new radar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Doppler radar, developed in response to the Delta crash, can detect turbulence 
that is invisible to conventional radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Controllers can warn approaching aircraft of the condition, and pilots can 
take appropriate measures to avoid landing at the airport or even approaching 
the area," said Scott Wiggins, air traffic management coordinator at Houston 
Intercontinental. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Congress authorized $373 million for the systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The main contractor, Raytheon Co. of Sudbury, Mass., said wind shear and gust 
fronts have been a cause or a factor in 18 airplane crashes and 575 related 
deaths in the United States since 1970.

LIMBAUGH'S CONTRACT TOUTING ORANGE JUICE WON'T BE RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's 12-member Citrus Commission said Thursday that it will not renew 
talk show host Rush Limbaugh's $1-million contract when it expires in 
mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state lawmakers, women's rights groups and Gov. Lawton Chiles, a 
Democrat, said Limbaugh should not have gotten the six-month contract because 
of his politically conservative views. 
</P>
<P>
 But commission member Rex McPherson said criticism had nothing to do with the 
decision and that the panel had only planned to use Limbaugh for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the National Organization for Women claimed victory. The group's 
boycott of Florida orange juice and its letter-writing campaign "sent a message 
that hate and intolerance will not be tolerated by thinking consumers," said 
Kim Gandy, NOW executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy criticized Limbaugh for "spewing bigotry and hatred and calling feminist 
rights supporters 'feminazis.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh representatives did not return a telephone call late Thursday to his 
New York TV studio. 
</P>

 Limbaugh's contract represented 6% of the citrus department's $17.1-million 
industry-funded marketing budget. Under the contract, he plugs orange juice on 
his TV and radio shows.

 The department also spent $600,000 on Larry King's daytime program and 
$200,000 on a health-advice talk show hosted by Dr. Dean Edell. Citrus 
officials said Thursday that those contracts also were not being renewed.

PANEL BACKS BILL COMPENSATING SICK PERSIAN GULF WAR VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gulf War veterans with debilitating but undiagnosed illnesses would be 
eligible for benefits under a bill approved Thursday by the House Veterans 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, passed unanimously and sent to the House floor, requires the 
military and the Department of Veterans Affairs to compensate sick veterans 
even when the cause of their health problems cannot be directly linked to 
service in the 1991 war. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of veterans have complained of muscle pains, memory loss, skin 
rashes, respiratory problems and tumors. They have suggested a number of 
causes, including possible exposure to Iraqi chemical and biological agents, 
fumes from oil fires and insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have not been able to obtain health care or compensation for 
service-related health problems because no single cause of "Persian Gulf 
Syndrome" has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation "takes a bold step forward to recognize their sacrifices and 
accord them the same benefits that other service-connected disabled veterans 
receive," said Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.), a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, compensation would be paid to Gulf War veterans for three 
years, with automatic extensions, if, at the end of that period, the cause of 
the illness is still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
 It would require the VA to set up an outreach program for Persian Gulf 
veterans and their families, and would authorize $5 million a year for fiscal 
years 1995 through 1997 for research into Gulf War veterans' health risks and 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 VA Secretary Jesse Brown has said that the Clinton Administration strongly 
supports the legislation.

CLINTON ISSUES MUTED NATIONAL SECURITY REPORT; POLICY: THE DOCUMENT INCLUDES 
WATERED-DOWN VERSIONS OF EARLIER WHITE HOUSE PRONOUNCEMENTS. IT IS DISTRIBUTED 
WITHOUT FANFARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton unveiled his long-awaited national security strategy 
Thursday, outlining a broad approach to foreign policy issues decidedly more 
muted than the one he and his aides described during the early days of the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-page document, distributed without fanfare after the normal workday, 
contained watered-down versions of earlier White House pronouncements on issues 
such as the use of military force, global peacekeeping and expansion of 
democracy around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 To rebut the growing criticism of the Administration's foreign policy, the 
report also put forward a three-page list of Clinton accomplishments, including 
American support for economic reform in Russia, aid to Eastern Europe and 
completion of two free-trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement accompanying the report, Clinton said the document "charts a 
course for American leadership that has already begun to produce tangible 
results with respect for our security requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 The document, required by a 1986 law, traditionally is sent to Congress 
earlier in an Administration, but the Clinton White House delayed it, partly to 
give the Pentagon time to complete an assessment of U.S. defense forces in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the document was made public Thursday night, some officials 
suggested, was to counter a report on readiness that a special Pentagon 
commission is to issue today. That report says military preparedness cannot be 
fully assessed until the security strategy has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 As has been expected, most policies outlined in the report have been described 
in previous presidential statements and directives -- often after the realities 
of world events forced the Administration to trim back its previous aims. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton published a new, more conservative policy on American participation in 
global peacekeeping earlier this year, for example, after Congress balked at 
his more ambitious plans following the deaths of 18 U.S. Rangers as a result of 
a firefight in Somalia in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting Clinton's view on the importance of the economy to the nation's 
security, the document for the first time listed economic policy as a pillar of 
national security policy, along with continued global leadership and promotion 
of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House continued to call for a military that is capable of 
winning "two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts" -- as the Pentagon's 
review proposed in September -- it conceded that could not be done without the 
weapons modernization it has planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The document also warned against isolationism, with Clinton asserting in an 
accompanying statement that the country could address post-Cold War dangers 
only "if we remain actively engaged in global affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 With the national security strategy now out of the way, the Administration is 
expected to complete a national military strategy setting out broad goals and 
aims for the armed forces.

HURRICANE EMILIA SKIRTS HAWAII; WINDS UP TO 165 M.P.H. REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hurricane Emilia skirted the Hawaiian Island chain Thursday, bringing a 
five-foot-high surf to Waikiki Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm had weakened slightly, but still had maximum winds of 135 m.p.h. and 
gusts to 165 m.p.h., the National Weather Service reported. On Wednesday, the 
storm's winds were 160 m.p.h. with gusts recorded at 195 m.p.h., the strongest 
on record for this area of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of the storm was 280 miles southwest of Hilo, on the island of 
Hawaii, moving northwesterly at 12 m.p.h. after a slight jog toward the north 
brought it closer to the islands than earlier predicted, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale-force winds extended 140 miles out from the center. If the storm 
continues that track, its center would move 230 miles south-southwest of 
Honolulu, said Tom Heffner, lead forecaster at the weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can never rule out that Mother Nature may change her mind. There's 
always the chance that it can turn northward or that something unexpected can 
happen," forecaster Glenn Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil Defense officials closed six beach parks on the southeast coast of the 
island of Hawaii and considered closing others. 
</P>
<P>
 Brisk sales of water, batteries, flashlights and other hurricane-related 
supplies were reported at stores across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, Hurricane Iniki brushed Oahu and then ran straight over 
the island of Kauai with 150 m.p.h. winds, killing seven people, injuring 100 
and causing $1.8 billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the remnants of a tropical depression that made landfall in the 
Carolinas on Wednesday continued generating showers and thunderstorms Thursday 
across sections of the central Atlantic states as it moved northward. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash flood watches were posted for sections of northern West Virginia and 
western and southwestern Pennsylvania, the weather service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Tropical Storm Alberto, which caused flooding in Georgia, the remnants 
of this tropical depression were expected to move quickly to the north and 
spread showers and thunderstorms across the Northeast.

GOP URGED TO FOCUS ON '94, AVOID INTRA-PARTY SQUABBLES; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN 
CHAIRMAN SAYS IDEOLOGICAL BATTLES SHOULD BE DEALT WITH LATER. DISSENSION 
CENTERS ON ABORTION ISSUE, RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Against a backdrop of increasing dissension by moderate Republican leaders, 
the national Republican hierarchy gathered in Los Angeles Thursday intent on 
burying its nascent problems and celebrating a mounting optimism about the 
party's prospects this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, speaking to reporters as 
the twice-yearly gathering began, sent a strong signal to his GOP brethren to 
keep their attention riveted on 1994 and leave until later any contentious 
battles over ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus has to be on 1994," he said. "The best thing that we can do to 
elect a Republican President in 1996 is to have a big Republican victory in 
1994. . . . We'll worry about 1996 and all that after Nov. 8." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican prospects, indeed, are far sunnier now than might have been 
imagined after the party's thundering losses in 1992, which saw the election of 
the first Democratic President in 12 years and sweeps by the perennially losing 
Democrats in many states, particularly California. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour estimated that 175 House seats, out of a total of 435, are up for 
grabs this year, and he insisted that the current Democratic majorities in the 
House and Senate are threatened. He said he believes that Republicans could 
walk away with more seats than they have held in more than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is reasonable to expect that we may be able to put together 
working control, working majorities in the House on many issues," said Barbour. 
He added that while it is conceivable that Republicans could win an outright 
majority, that scenario was "unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, where the retirement of several Democrats has opened up more 
balanced battles than could have been predicted, Republicans would have to gain 
seven seats to take control. "That is uphill but it is not nearly as uphill as 
it was in the beginning of the year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The party of the President traditionally loses congressional seats in the 
midterm elections, but Republican hopes have been fanned this year by a host of 
occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton himself -- broadly unpopular in many areas of the country, 
though still seen favorably in California -- has emerged as the Republicans' 
greatest electoral weapon. In addition, voters this year have increasingly 
seized on issues that traditionally are in the GOP domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues have helped Republicans in every election this year and last year: 
crime, taxes, welfare reform and spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans are not without their own problems, which Barbour and 
other GOP leaders hope to discuss only minimally during the three-day Los 
Angeles meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Republicans have been grumbling about the growing prominence of 
religious conservatives. So far, most of the discontent has surfaced in 
disputes about the party's anti-abortion stance. In recent weeks two Republican 
governors -- California's Pete Wilson and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey 
-- each have called for the deletion of the anti-abortion plank in the GOP's 
1996 platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pronouncements, by leaders of two of the biggest electoral states, may 
presage a huge battle over the issue in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour, clearly seeking to avoid any intra-party squabbles before November, 
issued a conciliatory appeal to Republicans on all sides of the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Whitman and Gov. Wilson's positions as pro-choice have widely been known 
and I think it's fine for them to have their positions," he said. "In our 
party, there are millions and millions of good pro-choice Republicans. I'm 
pro-life, but they're just as good of Republicans as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour added later: "I don't see any benefit to try to speculate about 
something that is not going to happen till 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles session will have a distinct flavor of 1996, however, when it 
comes to those planning to speak to RNC members. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the prospective 1996 presidential candidates scheduled to speak are 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Texas 
Sen. Phil Gramm, Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld and Wilson, who was due to 
attend Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 California Senate candidate Michael Huffington, the Santa Barbara congressman 
who is battling incumbent Dianne Feinstein, is scheduled to speak today.

CLINTON DEFENDS PRESCHOOL VACCINATION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vowing that "there is no task of greater importance for a national government 
than to protect this nation's young children," President Clinton on Thursday 
came to the defense of his Administration's controversial new preschool 
vaccination program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This government will carry out the challenge to build a coherent, properly 
functioning system for immunizing our children," Clinton said in a letter to 
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). "We will do 
it on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration released Clinton's letter as the $500-million program's 
leading critic, Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), presided at a hearing intended to 
dramatize a report by federal auditors raising numerous questions about the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Vaccines for Children program, the federal government will buy 
inoculations and distribute them through private physicians at no charge to 
youngsters who are on Medicaid, are uninsured or are Native Americans. Children 
whose insurance does not cover vaccines will be eligible for free shots at 
federally approved community health centers and rural clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers said that the new government-run distribution system "is indescribably 
complicated and will create significant burdens for public and private 
providers as well as the states." He said that it will not "help us immunize 
one more child." 
</P>
<P>
 The Appropriations Committee approved Bumpers' proposal Wednesday to delay the 
program's scheduled Oct. 1 implementation until the Administration satisfies 
congressional concerns about safe distribution and costs. A fight over the 
measure is expected on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency, 
found that the vaccine program is behind schedule and might be unable to assure 
the integrity of the sensitive biological materials, which must be shipped at 
precise temperatures or frozen to retain effectiveness. About one-third of the 
nation's vaccines will be distributed through a New Jersey facility run by the 
General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who made boosting childhood immunization rates an early goal of his 
Administration, said he was assured by the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, which are overseeing the new program, that the initiative can 
kick off on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept this assurance, and I expect no less than full performance on that 
agreement by everyone involved," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's hearing before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on labor, 
health and human services and education, GSA Administrator Roger W. Johnson 
said that the agency already "operates a distribution network that receives, 
stores and ships consumable supplies to over 165,000 customers worldwide."

SAMUELS MAY JOIN A SELECT CLUB ON DEATH ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels is about to join an exclusive club. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Van Nuys jury's recommendation Thursday is upheld, the woman dubbed the 
"Green Widow" for masterminding the murders of her husband and a hit man will 
become just the fifth woman on California's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four women have been legally put to death in California since 1893, 
although the records are unclear whether any were executed by local authorities 
before that time. 
</P>
<P>
 All the women were convicted murderers like Samuels. And all died in the gas 
chamber at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are sentenced to die at San Quentin -- which also houses the 377 
men awaiting execution -- condemned women are imprisoned about 200 miles away 
at the Central California Women's Facility in the San Joaquin Valley town of 
Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 If their sentences are carried out, the women are driven to San Quentin for 
the actual execution, after choosing whether to die strapped to a chair in the 
gas chamber or strapped to a gurney and be injected with a combination of 
lethal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since executions were authorized by California in 1851, 503 state prisoners 
have been put to death. Most were hanged -- 215 at San Quentin and 92 at 
Folsom. The rest -- 196 -- died in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The last to die was David Edwin Mason in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been 32 years since a woman was last put to death by the state. All 
of the women now awaiting execution were sentenced in the last five years. One 
was sentenced in Van Nuys, just like Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who have defended Death Row inmates said it is unlikely that the 
numbers will swell much further. Encino attorney James Gregory said most juries 
are unwilling to sentence women to death -- even in heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is harder for a jury to sentence a maternal person -- therefore a 
woman -- to death," Gregory said. "We are taught from childhood to be 
chivalrous to women. We don't view violence by women as premeditated." 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys said the number of women on Death Row will likely remain low 
because women overall are less violent than men. Even among women who are 
convicted of murder, most have no history of criminal activity that would 
justify the death penalty, said Los Angeles lawyer Rowan Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the circumstances of their crimes differ widely, all of the women on 
Death Row -- both past and present -- shared a certain celebrity. Their cases 
were widely covered and their stories widely told. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to be strapped into the gas chamber was San Francisco crime leader 
Juanita Spinelli in 1941. Known as The Dutchess, Spinelli was convicted of 
killing a gang member to prevent him from "squealing" about a recent killing.  
</P>
<P>
 She did the deed by slipping a "Mickey Finn" into his drink and then with the 
help of other gang members drowning him in the Sacramento River. She was 
described by a prosecutor as a "scheming, cold, cruel woman," and as an 
"ex-wrestler and a knife thrower who could pin a poker chip at 15 paces." 
</P>
<P>
 The last to die was Elizabeth Ann Duncan, a 59-year-old Ventura County woman 
convicted of hiring two men to kill her daughter-in-law, Olga. The two 
accomplices got $6,000 for their crime -- and the gas chamber. Duncan's son 
helped represent her at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 A respected nurse, Maureen McDermott, was convicted in Van Nuys in 1990 of 
hiring a co-worker to kill her roommate to collect a $100,000 mortgage 
insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott, who sits in Chowchilla awaiting execution, once told an interviewer 
that death holds little fear for her. "What kind of life is this?" she asked. 
"Waking up every morning to a cement wall is an unbearable future. I sometimes 
think the gas chamber is better than staring at these walls for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most famous woman ever to end her days on Death Row was Barbara 
Graham, an attractive "gun moll" convicted of robbing and murdering a wealthy 
Burbank woman, whose execution in 1955 was graphically depicted in the Susan 
Hayward film "I Want to Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham could have avoided death by telling authorities about other crimes 
committed by her Mountain Murder Mob. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't snitch on the guys," Graham is reported to have said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Graham was strapped into the gas chamber chair, prison guard Joe Feretti 
patted her on the shoulder and whispered: "Take a deep breath and it won't be 
so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Her final words were: "How the hell would you know?"

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RUSSELL WHITE CUT AFTER REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Russell White reported to the Rams' UC Irvine training camp site 
Thursday only to be told to keep his bags packed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams released White, who was selected in the third round from California a 
year ago, to make room for former Arizona Cardinal running back Johnny Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 White rushed two times for 10 yards last season and failed to impress the 
coaching staff in off-season workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put him at tailback and give him the ball I think he could do just 
fine, but we have Jerome Bettis there," Coach Chuck Knox said. "I think he can 
play, but he didn't do anything for us on special teams and we have a number of 
good backs here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey comes in as the Rams' No. 1 punt and kickoff returner. He also has the 
ability to work on third downs in obvious passing situations in relief of 
Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to sign Bailey several months ago, but he was asking for more 
than $1 million. He agreed Thursday to a one-year contract for $162,000, which 
will escalate to $200,000 if he makes the final roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also released punter Jeff Buffaloe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Wayne Gandy, the team's No. 1 pick, and his agent Neil Schwartz were 
flying to Orange County Thursday night in an effort to break a deadlock in 
contract negotiations. The Rams begin two-a-day workouts today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy has been asking for a four-year deal, while the Rams have countered with 
a five-year offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be willing to do a one-year, two-year or three-year deal, too," said 
Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president. "But we won't do a four-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Gandy's status at the expiration of his contract. A four-year deal 
would allow him to become an unrestricted free agent. Anything short of four 
years will allow the Rams to maintain their rights to Gandy. A five-year deal 
would potentially tie him up for six years because of a change in the 
collective bargaining agreement that kicks in during 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Ashmore, who is pegged to start at right tackle, is close to reaching 
an agreement on a contract. . . . Defensive tackle Marc Boutte fell ill 
Thursday and will not participate in today's workouts. . . . The Rams will 
practice in T-shirts and shorts this morning and shoulder pads and shorts this 
afternoon. The Rams intend to reduce the amount of physical contact in this 
year's camp to prevent injuries. The salaries for injured players count against 
the salary cap, and in some cases players will have to be cut to sign new 
players to replace injured ones. . . . Running back David Lang (knee) has been 
cleared to practice once a day, but a sore knee will keep wide receiver Todd 
Kinchen on the sideline. T.J. SIMERS

BOXING IN IRVINE; JAPANESE CRUISERWEIGHT PUTS ON A GOOD SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cruiserweight Yosukezan Nishijima came to the United States from Japan to 
avoid crowds. But when he stepped into the ring Thursday night at the Irvine 
Marriott, he was welcomed by eight Japanese still photographers and a cameraman 
from Japanese television, which bought exclusive rights to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima gave his countrymen in the media something to write home about with 
an impressive six-round unanimous-decision victory over Kenny McCullough of 
Tampa. Nishijima raised his record to 7-1 with five knockouts, while McCullough 
fell to 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima's performance was far more interesting than the main event, which 
was won by Liberia's Sammy Stewart (7-1-1), who stopped Jose Luis Peralta 
(10-11-2) of Mexico in eight rounds. Referee Burt Gilliam stopped it on the 
advice of the ringside doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima got McCullough's attention early with some heavy combinations in the 
first two rounds. He kept up the attack and never let McCullough find any 
punching room. McCullough, normally a super middleweight, said Nishijima was 
simply too big for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he felt my punches that much," McCullough said. "I had to gain 
10 to 15 pounds to take this fight. But I took it because I thought I could 
beat him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima, who spoke through an interpreter, seemed more frustrated than 
pleased with his outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've seen a left-puncher," he said. "I couldn't see where 
the punches were coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima didn't have much side-to-side movement, but his body shots moved 
McCullough back far enough to give him punching room. In the sixth round, 
Nishijima did a little hot-dogging as he threw a karate-like jump punch that 
didn't connect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was hurt and he tried to play it off," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough said he was impressed with Nishijima's stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of fighter that you think is out of gas and then he comes out 
of nowhere with a bunch of punches," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nishijima's next fight will be in Japan, but he expects to return to the 
United States, where he has fought five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer to fight here," he said. "I'm a very shy person. I don't like having 
people know me. I was very nervous with all the cameras here." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese media said Nishijima is such a celebrity because he is Japan's only 
promising heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 On the undercard, junior welterweight Manny Castillo (8-1-1) of East Los 
Angeles withstood a first-round knockdown to win a five-round majority decision 
over Jose Ferrer (5-5-1) of Hanford. Junior lightweight Rodrigo Arando (2-1) of 
San Pedro won a four-round decision over Fresno's Rudy Cruz (2-8-3). 
Bantamweight Oscar Saenz (9-2) of San Diego won a decision over Rogelio Sosa 
(3-7-1) of East Los Angeles.

SPLASH GIVES CROWD A LATE SHOW; INDOOR SOCCER: ERVINE TIES IT WITH 20 SECONDS 
REMAINING AND NEELY'S GOAL WITH A FRACTION OF A SECOND LEFT BEATS THE 
SANDSHARKS. 
</P>

<P>
 He predicted a playoff atmosphere, but not even Splash Coach George Fernandez 
could have written the script that was played out Thursday in front of its 
largest home crowd of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Ervine scored the franchise's first short-handed goal, with 20 seconds 
left, and Doug Neely scored the game-winner with 0:00.1 left to give the Splash 
a 10-9 victory over the Arizona Sandsharks in a Continental Indoor Soccer 
League game.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pond of Anaheim played host to 5,223 on "Melrose Place" actor Andrew 
Shue's second and final appearance, but the crowd was clearly more enthralled 
by the heroics of the everyday players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash took a half-game lead over the Sockers (9-3), which it plays Sunday 
in San Diego. Arizona (6-7) and San Diego are the two Western Division teams 
the Splash plays three times on its 28-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was less than 10 seconds left," said Neely, who called his 
three-goal performance in the fourth quarter the greatest 15 minutes of his 
professional life. "The whole team kept fighting back, and you have to give 
Ralph (Black) all the credit in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Black was the sixth attacker while the Splash was a man down and made the 
assist to Ervine that tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is why we play the game," Ervine said. "We don't play for the lucrative 
contracts, but this is exactly why we play this game for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine, too, scored three times, taking a pass from Black and drilling the 
ball through a defender's legs and past goalkeeper Wayne Seaber from beyond the 
red line while a man down. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely had brought the Splash to within 9-8 with a goal with 3:55 left off an 
assist from Raffaele Ruotolo, his second of the game. Ruotolo added to his 
CISL-record with assists in 16 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 second-half goals were in stark contrast to the first half, in which 
the Splash held a 3-2 lead after consecutive goals by Black, Armando Valdivia 
and Ervine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest regular season game I've been a part of," said Fernandez, 
who began his professional career in 1984. "I thought we played a poor second 
half. Outside of the great win, I'm not happy with the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona scored four consecutive goals in the third quarter, including three 
within 1:28, to turn a 3-2 halftime deficit to a 6-3 lead. The Splash got goals 
from Paul Ratcliffe, Rod Castro and Ervine and it was 7-6 entering the final 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue left the game with about three minutes to play and it was later revealed 
he had a concussion.

BIDING HIS TIME; EX-RAM PAGEL PLAYS ARENABALL WHILE WAITING TO RETURN TO NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months ago, the Rams gave backup quarterback Mike Pagel his severance pay 
and sent him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 A victim of the team's cost-cutting moves last November, Pagel was sent 
packing when the team decided not to waive a struggling Jim Everett and his 
$2.5-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Pagel has waited for a call from the NFL that hasn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, his football career has been reduced to miniature-scale 
-- as quarterback of the Massachusetts Marauders of the Arena Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel, a 12-year NFL veteran with the Rams, Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis 
Colts, now plays on a 50-yard indoor field, faces only three pass rushers and 
earns a little more than $500 a game, plus a $150 bonus if the Marauders win. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sure isn't the NFL," Pagel said from the Centrum, the Marauders' arena 
in Worcester, Mass. "It's a much different game. It's a faster game, and you 
have to be very quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel hopes to use the Arena league to earn another shot on an NFL roster. NFL 
scouts regularly scour the league looking for players, and occasional Saturday 
games are televised on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good timing because the latest our season goes is Sept. 2, just a couple 
of days before the NFL regular-season starts," Pagel said. "I'm hoping some 
teams will make some roster changes in the first couple weeks of the season and 
they'll be looking for a veteran to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel is among several veteran players dropped from NFL rosters who have 
jumped to Arenaball since the indoor league began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Miami Dolphin tight end Jim Jensen is currently the quarterback of the 
Miami Hooters, and former New Orleans quarterback John Fourcade just signed 
with the Milwaukee Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not alone," Pagel said. "For some of the younger guys, it's a chance to 
catch a scout's eye and make the jump to the NFL. For the older guys, it's a 
chance to keep playing a little more and have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at a guy like Jensen. He played tight end all those years with the 
Dolphins, and now he's getting a shot at playing quarterback again. That's why 
this league is so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when you're winning. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a new concept for Pagel, who suffered through three consecutive losing 
seasons with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders are 6-2 and contending for a playoff berth. Pagel has completed 
135 of 248 passes (54.4%) for 1,780 yards and 32 touchdowns with 10 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 He has thrown five or more touchdown passes in three games this season, 
including five to receiver Andre Langley in Saturday's 58-51 victory over 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 And the best part about being an Arena quarterback? Pagel has been sacked only 
three times in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They only rush three guys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-team league is designed to be offense-oriented. Eight-player lineups 
play on a 50-yard-by-28-yard field with eight-yard end zones. The field is 
bordered by padded walls, protecting the coaches and bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Short passing routes control the flow of the game -- teams rarely run the ball 
because of the narrow field. One receiver is allowed forward motion from the 
line of scrimmage, usually leaving defensive backs in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The result -- inflated stats and a scoreboard where numbers keep spinning like 
they do on a pinball machine. A typical Arenaball score is 63-49. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Strock, the former Miami Dolphin quarterback and now Marauder coach, said 
Pagel's quickness and quick release when throwing the ball make him a natural 
for the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still has a live arm and good footwork," Strock said. "That's a must 
because there's no seven-step dropback for quarterbacks here, it's only five. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you have only 1.8 seconds to throw the ball instead of 2.3 in the NFL. 
That doesn't sound like much, but it's a hell of a lot of time for a 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is only one adjustment for Pagel. He's a full-time starter again for 
the first time since 1985, his final season with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams, his main duty last season was to hold for Tony Zendejas on 
kicks. He completed only three of nine passes for 23 yards with one 
interception, and even his role as backup quarterback seemed on shaky ground 
because the coaches were rushing the development of T.J. Rubley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it (getting cut) was coming eventually," Pagel said. "In March of '93 
the coaches told me T.J. would eventually get a chance as the No. 2 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at that point of the season (November) all the talk was that Everett was 
going to get cut. I didn't have any idea it was going to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel had even joked with Everett the day before about the prospect of Everett 
being released. So Pagel was surprised to get a call from quarterbacks coach 
Ted Tollner the next day, an off-day for players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tollner left a message on my answering machine to come in and talk to Coach 
(Chuck) Knox," Pagel said. "By then, I knew what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel, who was to earn $475,000 in salary last season, received $20,000 in 
severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to his home in Cleveland, hoping the Browns would pick him up 
after cutting the popular Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a call from the Browns never came, one from Strock did. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock had played with Pagel in Cleveland in 1988, two years before the Browns 
released Pagel and the Rams signed him as a free agent for the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he was assembling a short list of quarterbacks for the upcoming Arena 
season, Strock made sure Pagel was on it. Pagel signed in early May, a week 
before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's doing the right thing by playing here," Strock said. "Scouts 
come through here all the time looking at guys. We've had the Jets, Bears, 
Washington and Buffalo in here in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if the right situation comes along in the NFL, he could be the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Rams begin two-a-day workouts today at UC Irvine, Pagel already is in 
midseason form. Not only has he wondered if he still has a future in the NFL, 
but also about the future of Everett, who was traded to the New Orleans Saints 
in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jim will do well in New Orleans," Pagel said. "That's the perfect 
offense for him. He has a big arm and can set up and throw deep there, plus he 
has a very good defense to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everything works out hand in hand, and it has for Jim. I think he can 
play as well as anybody in the NFL. Although I don't know if should be telling 
that to an L.A. paper."

 IRVINE -- Chris Miller, new Ram quarterback, looks great in opening workouts. 
He drops back briskly, plants his right foot firmly and heaves perfect 50-yard 
spirals that . . . leave divots as they repeatedly nose dive into the ground, 
because the Rams have no wide receivers in camp. 
</P>

 AUSTIN, Tex. -- Big 150-question intelligence exam going down at the Dallas 
Cowboys' training complex. Those who fail will not be permitted to participate 
in two-a-day drills. 
</P>

 "Question No. 17," the moderator calls out. "Name every team in the NFC East 
Division. . . . Yes, you in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK. All right. I know this one. Here goes: There's us. And there's . . . 
Green Bay, I seem to recall. And . . . let's see . . . there's . . . Arizona? 
Yeah! Arizona and Arizona State and Iowa State and Nebraska."

 "Well, you got two right, Coach Switzer. Close enough. That's two better than

 FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. -- In yet another break from tradition, the ex-Chicago, 
ex-St. Louis, ex-Phoenix Arizona Cardinals have dispensed with their customary 
Red-White intrasquad scrimmage, at the request of new Coach Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new boss in town," Ryan informs his team before the scrimmage, "and 
it sure as hell ain't you. So listen up, this is how it's gonna be. 
</P>

 "Ex-Eagles on this side of the ball, ex-Bears on the other. And you, Garrison 
Hearst, I got a new position for you. Move that towel off the bench and you'll

 DAVIE, Fla. -- Don Shula, Sports Illustrated's 1993 Sportsman of the Year 
despite losing his last five games of 1993, missing the playoffs and extending 
his Super Bowl championship-less streak to 20 years, signs a contract extension 
with the Miami Dolphins through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "How ya like them apples, mousse-head?" Shula says in a prepared statement

 OXNARD -- High-level Raider officials meet behind closed doors to discuss 
recent newspaper and magazine reports favoring them to win the AFC championship 
in 1994 and what to do about them.

<P>
 After two hours of debate, potential sabotage is ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 After two more hours of debate, the meeting is adjourned because Raider 
officials are stalemated over the question: "If we ban all newspaper and 
magazine reporters and then win the Super Bowl, will anybody notice?"

MIKE DOWNEY: FOREMAN LOOKING FOR A FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Foreman, the former (and future?) heavyweight boxing champion of the 
world, sat back in his hotel suite at the Biltmore and spoke of the manly art 
of fighting cowards. He had just been downstairs in the ballroom, daring 
Michael Moorer to be a man and mix it up with him at the MGM Grand in their 
title fight Nov. 5, going so far as to gesture toward Moorer and say, "I'm 
going to knock this coward out." 
</P>
<P>
 Big George, having digested a number of chickens in his day, says that this 
business of boxing cowardly began 20 years ago Oct. 30, when at 4 o'clock in 
the morning in a jungle clearing in Africa, the rope-a-dope strategy of 
Muhammad Ali "made him the rope and me the dope, but he didn't exactly stand up 
to me, did he?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fighters have been running from him ever since, Foreman said, clinching and 
backpedaling and counting on the judges' sympathy. Now here he is, approaching 
the 20th anniversary of his most famous fight, fighting still, fighting a man 
"young enough to be my son." But will Moorer swap punches the way Sonny Liston 
would have, or the way Joe Frazier once did? No way, Foreman knows. He could 
beat Moorer with one ham hock tied behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, almost 50 years old, and these monkeys are still running from me!" 
Foreman practically shouted at the news conference downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer sat there, astounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stand up to me like a man!" George barked. 
</P>
<P>
 Squinting through dark glasses, Moorer couldn't believe his eyes. Neither 
could the champ's trainer, Teddy Atlas, who crossed the room to tap Foreman's 
shoulder and demand a retraction or satisfaction, like a swordsman requesting a 
duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking forward, refusing to acknowledge Atlas face to face, Foreman said, 
"Let me alone. Go mind your manners, boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go from me," Foreman demanded. "Go from me. Go get me a sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not like Big George to be the villain, to play the lout. Twenty years 
ago, Ali was the man of the people and Foreman the one who kept to himself. 
Today, their roles have reversed. It is Foreman who has become the most amiable 
figure in boxing, and it is unlike him to be calling another man out this way, 
to not be paying an opponent his propers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer seemed caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberately keeping his volume from rising, Moorer said: "There's a lot to be 
said, but let's not say it. Let's not be disrespectful to each other. This is a 
business. This is boxing. We're in it to make money. But we're still human 
beings outside the ring. So I'd appreciate it if you would respect me as a 
gentleman, just like I respect you as a man. I don't want this to be one of 
those ugly promotions." 
</P>
<P>
 In his room later, Foreman chuckled and said, more or less, mission 
accomplished. He had nothing against Moorer personally. Thought him a suitable 
foe. Yes, he had dissed the man on HBO during fight commentary, but what did 
the boxer or the network expect? He wasn't in this racket to be anybody's yes 
man. He wasn't impressed with anything Moorer did against Evander Holyfield, 
any more than he was impressed with Holyfield for holding, holding, holding 
when the man outpointed George. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call it the art of boxing, the science of boxing," Foreman said, 
stretching out on his sofa, "but is this what people are paying hundreds of 
dollars to see? Holding? Ali defeated me with that rope-a-dope nonsense, there 
ain't no denying that. But look what that gave us. Twenty years of fighters 
running from better fighters, afraid to stand there and slug it out. All we got 
now's a bunch of cowards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm sick of fighting cowards. And I'd think the American public is sick 
of watching cowards. And what about you? You're a writer -- write something! If 
television won't say it, then you say it. Embarrass these cowards publicly. 
Expose 'em for what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 George, on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 He is serious about this bout, he promises. He is taking no upfront guarantee, 
so serious is he. He is no more worried about Michael Moorer than he would be 
about Mary Tyler Moore. He will reduce to 235-240 pounds for this bout, he 
vows. He will not train on bags of Doritos. He will fight and he will win 
because, he says, he's got nine children at home and they won't stop eating, so 
until they're all grown and gone, he must buy the groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Holmes, his attorney and adviser, is more specific. Holmes swears, 
"George is about to make the greatest comeback of all time. The cheeseburgers 
will be on hold. The fried chicken, on hold. The hot dogs, on hold. No more 
burgers, at least until Nov. 6. You're going to see George on broccoli, 
sparkling water, tofu and Vitamin E. He'll be training at Gold's Gym. He'll be 
running the sands of Malibu. The only acting he'll be doing is on a 
Stairmaster. Michael Moorer, my advice to you is from the movie 'The Fly.' Be 
afraid -- be very afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the champ's camp very afraid? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so you'd know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer's manager, John Davimos, said, "Oh, George. Go eat all the 
cheeseburgers you want. Michael'll destroy you." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly what George wants, of course. For Moorer to feel offended. 
For Moorer's people to tell their man to go out there and shut Big George's big 
mouth. For Moorer to go stand in the middle of the ring and remind this old 
fogy that it isn't 1974 anymore. George laughs and laughs and wonders what it 
will take to make Moorer meet him halfway. 
</P>
<P>
 Because if that happens, then George Foreman, 46, will have made the greatest 
comeback of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why come back at all?" a man asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Big George attacks the question hungrily, as he would a burger -- er, 
broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I think all fighters want to come back," he says. "Shame on us."

IT'S AN OLD BRAZILIAN CUSTOM; SOCCER: WHEN YOU BRING HOME THE WORLD CUP FOR THE 
FOURTH TIME, YOU ALSO BRING TONS OF DUTY-FREE LUGGAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's government tax chief resigned Thursday in a dispute over the failure 
of the victorious Brazilian World Cup soccer squad to pay nearly $1 million of 
customs duties on excess luggage brought from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute threatened to spoil the euphoria produced by Brazil's fourth World 
Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho told reporters he was quitting 
over differences with President Itamar Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopes said the last straw had been the president's decision to overrule his 
order that 17 tons of luggage brought back from the United States by the 
Brazilian soccer delegation should be subject to normal customs inspection and 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my objectives as a member of the government was to show that the law 
could be carried out in Brazil," said Lopes, who has spearheaded a government 
drive against tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian newspapers ran front-page stories Thursday on how the players and 
soccer federation officials had refused late Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to allow 
customs officials to inspect their luggage, which was carried in five trucks to 
their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation arrived in Rio on the last leg of a marathon three-city 
homecoming celebration marking the World Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The team brought home refrigerators, televisions, videos, washing machines and 
microwave ovens, which customs officials estimated would be subject to duties 
of nearly $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the merchandise was bought while the team was staying in Orange 
County. Players, coaches and their wives purchased so much merchandise during 
their stay at the Fullerton Marriott that some of it had to be stored in the 
hotel's ballroom, hotel officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian customs laws require duties on any purchases abroad over the value 
of $500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officials, coaches and players are making a bad start to their careers as 
four-time world champions," Brazil's O Globo newspaper said in a front-page 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They achieved a great feat and deserve the gratitude of their compatriots, 
but neither one thing nor the other makes them into special citizens," the 
newspaper said, adding they should set an example by paying the customs duties. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer players had spent nearly an hour late Tuesday arguing heatedly with 
Rio airport customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy threatened to disrupt an already delayed victory parade 
through Rio's streets until an order came through from the Presidential Palace 
in Brasilia, via Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero, to release the luggage 
uninspected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of the moment, soccer federation officials and players -- 
including star forward Romario -- even threatened to boycott the Rio parade and 
hand back medals they had been awarded by President Franco, Brazilian 
newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truck is not leaving the airport without my luggage," O Globo quoted 
Romario as saying. "We're not smugglers. We represented Brazil in front of 2 
billion people in the world. If they don't release my luggage, I'm giving back 
my medal."  
</P>
<P>
 Rio customs chiefs then threatened to prosecute the Brazilian Soccer 
Confederation for non-payment of the duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The homecoming itinerary of the victorious World Cup squad had already 
provoked a controversy by not including Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city. Sao 
Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf publicly condemned what he said was a deliberate snub. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said Thursday that the team would visit Sao Paulo on July 29 
to receive the city's separate homage.

POINT TO PROVE; RATHMAN WANTS TO SHOW THAT THE 49ERS ERRED IN LETTING HIM BE A 
RAIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Rathman's future with San Francisco appeared as solid as his 6-foot-2, 
232-pound frame when he arrived at the 49ers' training camp a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off what he considered his best season as a pro, Rathman was among the 
NFL's highest-paid fullbacks. With two Super Bowl rings to his credit, the 
former Nebraska power runner went into last season earning $985,000 in the 
final year of a three-year, $2,655,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to say, that before last season I really didn't see myself 
leaving the 49ers," said Rathman, who was drafted by San Francisco in the third 
round in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed with one injury. 
</P>
<P>
 After having missed only one game because of injury in his first seven years 
with the 49ers, Rathman suffered a dislocated shoulder in the 1993 season 
opener against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out eight games and then did not reclaim his starting job for four 
more. That's because in his absence, Marc Logan, a veteran of five NFL teams, 
made the most of his opportunity as a starter by scoring seven touchdowns and 
catching 37 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman knew this spring that his future with San Francisco was in question. 
Not only had Logan emerged, but the 49ers also had drafted Florida State 
fullback William Floyd in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prepared myself for this off-season, knowing that I would become a free 
agent," Rathman said. "I talked with the (49er) coaches and talked to my agent 
(Marvin Demoff), who talked with management. I had to find out what they had in 
mind and where I fit in for this year." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco, which spent a truckload of money for defensive free agents 
Richard Dent, 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Plummer and Ken Norton Jr., told Rathman that the starting fullback's job 
was no longer his, although he would be able to compete for it in training 
camp. The 49ers also offered him $500,000, a drastic cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we had to make some decisions," said Carmen Policy, San 
Francisco team president. "We made a conscious decision to roll the dice, to 
strengthen the areas where we were weak, even if it meant taking a chance that 
we'd leave ourselves short in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing an opening, the Raiders pursued Rathman as a replacement for veteran 
Steve Smith, whom they released because of his contract. Smith was reportedly 
to earn more than $1 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In what appeared to be a last-minute, decision, Rathman signed a two-year deal 
worth $1.2 million with the Raiders last Friday, the last day unprotected free 
agents could sign with new teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough on me because I didn't think that I'd deserved to be put in that 
type of situation," Rathman said about his contract discussions with the 49ers. 
"I didn't feel that I needed to prove anything to anyone. But, obviously the 
coaches there felt that somebody could do a better job than I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas San Francisco told Rathman that his services were no longer needed, 
the Raiders greeted him warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Rathman and the signing of tailback Harvey Williams from 
Kansas City give the Raiders two proven veterans to bolster a running attack 
that struggled at times last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell says Rathman's versatility will complement the high-powered 
passing attack, directed by quarterback Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done everything I heard about him," Shell said. "He can block, run and 
catch the ball out of the backfield. He's done everything we've asked from him 
so far, and he has picked up our system very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman, who will be 32 in October, is happy to have a chance with the 
Raiders. Although he was listed behind Napoleon McCallum and Derrick Gainer on 
the fullback depth chart at the start of training camp, he expects to 
contribute to a team that he feels has enough talent to make a lot of noise 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to come in and show people what I am capable of doing," said 
Rathman, who has scored 34 touchdowns and caught 294 passes. "I think they have 
a pretty good idea of what I can do already. I just need to keep my standards 
-- which I always have -- and just demonstrate in practice that I am still very 
capable of carrying the ball, blocking and catching passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman has always been regarded as a team player willing to do the 
intangibles that help the team win. He has never rushed for more than 80 yards 
in a game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up working hard," said Rathman, who spent his summers working for his 
father, a building contractor in Grand Island, Neb. "Nothing was ever given to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Working on his father's concrete crew, pouring foundations in 90-degree heat 
for up to 11 hours a day, Rathman learned how to sacrifice and to look at the 
bigger picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something that just carried over to football with me," he said. 
"Playing with the 49ers, I sacrificed statistics for playing time, and I had no 
problem with that. But I never really was given the opportunity to show all of 
my skills because they've always had such a potent offense with so many 
weapons, and just one football." 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman hopes to play at least two more seasons with the Raiders before 
thinking about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things went, it's unfortunate that I had to leave (San Francisco)," 
he said. "But the structure of the game has changed. You have teams dealing 
with free agency and salary caps now. I don't think you'll see anyone staying 
with an organization for eight or nine years anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just know that I have something to prove to myself more than anything. I 
know that I can still play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are counting on that.

ANALYSIS; DODGERS PROVING NOT HARD TO LICK; BASEBALL: BULLPEN IS BIGGEST 
PROBLEM, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS, AS LEAD CONTINUES TO SHRINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Every afternoon, as long as the Dodgers are in first place and increasing 
their lead, front-office employees at Dodger Stadium are treated to ice cream, 
sorbet and sometimes nonfat yogurt by owner Peter O'Malley. The celebration is 
a Dodger tradition that started years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, though, like ice cream left in the sun, the Dodgers' lead is 
melting. The current trip has been a disaster, the Dodgers winning only two of 
seven games on the part that was thought to be the easiest. The six games 
ahead, though, are almost certain to be tough, and, with a strike looming, 
could mean the season for the Dodgers, whose grip on the lead in the National 
League West is slipping rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 You can blame in on the bullpen, Fred Claire, Tom Lasorda, the lack of scoring 
or, recently, the struggles of the starting pitchers and fielding lapses. 
Depending on how the next three games go with the Montreal Expos, you might 
even blame it on the dome atop Olympic Stadium, in which the Dodgers have a 
5-22 record over the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Dodgers hit Candlestick Park on Monday for a three-game series 
against the San Francisco Giants, there will be no more excuses. There also may 
be no more ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, with a 48-47 record, lead the Colorado Rockies by three games, 
but the Giants are charging. On July 6, they were 9 1/2 games behind the 
Dodgers. The next day, Darryl Strawberry started playing for them. Since, they 
have won 10 of 11 and moved within 3 1/2 games of the Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, since July 7, the Dodgers have won only four of 11, only two of 
seven since the All-Star break, prompting the question, Is the pressure getting 
to the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Lasorda said. "We have to think about what we can do, not what somebody 
else can do." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of reasons for the slump, not the least being the bullpen, 
which has blown 19 save opportunities. The Dodgers have come back to win five 
of those 19, but losing the other 13 is a key element in the team's stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen's most recent blunder, blowing a 4-2 lead in Tuesday night's 7-4 
loss to the New York Mets, caused Lasorda to make one of his earliest postgame 
exits in recent memory. The next day, Lasorda looked beat. 
</P>
<P>
 'I am very disgusted, very disappointed," the manager said. "I can't remember 
any of my teams ever doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was despondent after that game. When you are up, 4-2, you are supposed to 
win those ballgames. You have guys who are reputable who have done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers and the Rockies, with 19 each, have the most blown saves in the 
major leagues, and the Dodgers' percentage of saves to opportunities is one of 
the worst -- 17 saves in 36 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' 17 saves are the fewest in the National League -- the San Diego 
Padres have 20 in 29 opportunities. In comparison, the Florida Marlins have the 
fewest blown saves, five in 32 opportunities, and that's without Bryan Harvey. 
The Giants, whose relievers have been sidelined periodically, have 25 saves in 
35 opportunities. Even the Angels have a better percentage, with 19 saves in 27 
opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do?" Lasorda asked. "I have tried to figure it out. I've 
got to go with the guys that got us to where we are, and we have to go from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger bullpen has been a drawback to Lasorda for the last couple of 
seasons. Last season, Jim Gott took over for the oft-injured Todd Worrell and 
saved 25 games. But Lasorda wanted a dominating left-handed closer, and all 
Claire, the executive vice president, has provided him with is a tryout camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is seemingly too late. The Dodgers, along with the other clubs, are 
obviously reluctant to trade for a high-priced premium closer when there might 
be a strike. Claire, sticking to a plan of building from the farm system, says 
he will not part with two premium prospects anyway, and the cost of the Chicago 
Cubs' Randy Myers appears to be high. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Mets' John Franco might be available for one quality outfielder, 
such as Henry Rodriguez, but Claire says he's not parting with him either. 
Franco is a free agent at the end of the season, which could be in three weeks, 
and Myers is signed through next season. He will make $3.5 million next season. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Dodgers have Worrell, who has earned 13 saves in 1 1/2 seasons 
with the Dodgers and is on the verge of losing his closing role to Gott. But 
Gott needs to step up soon. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Worrell think about this? Who knows? He has quit talking to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting pitchers, after a superb two-month stretch, are faltering too. 
When Orel Hershiser walked off the mound before Saturday's game in Philadelphia 
because of a muscle strain, it threw the staff in disarray. Ismael Valdes, who 
has pitched well in relief, was given a spot start. But he had cut a fingernail 
too short a few days previously and developed blisters in the first inning. He 
was relieved by Tom Candiotti in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Valdes was just there to help us get through to the off-day," Lasorda 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti came through, pitching two games in four days and giving up only two 
unearned runs in 13 innings. Those are the two games the Dodgers have won on 
this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we are a little short with Orel out, but we have to pick up 
the bullpen and go eight or nine innings," Kevin Gross said. "We back everybody 
100% and we worked hard to get where we are. And we are not going to let it 
slip away. . . . If we were pointing fingers and complaining about this guy or 
that guy, we run into trouble. We are not about to change that as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, the pitching staff has accumulated a 5.64 earned-run average in 
the last seven games, with a 2-5 record, two saves and two blown saves. But it 
hasn't been all their fault. Of the 43 runs scored against them this trip -- 
including seven home runs -- only 37 have been earned. The Dodgers have 
committed five errors in the last seven games, and faltered at other times that 
don't show in the box score.  
</P>
<P>
 The team is hitting, but not scoring as much as necessary to prop up the 
pitching staff. The Dodgers have scored four or more runs in five of the seven 
games, but in their last three left 35 runners on base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played well since the break, and we have to get something 
rolling," said Tim Wallach, who is batting .429 during a nine-game hitting 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Dodgers trudge to dreaded Olympic Stadium, where they have 
suffered miserably with a condition former Dodger Eric Davis described as 
"domitosis." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about it, hope it goes away," Brett Butler said. "You hope you 
change what is in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda will make no predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what is going to happen in Montreal, and I don't know what is 
going to happen in San Francisco, but I sure as hell know what happened here 
(in New York) and Philadelphia," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 So do the Giants.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RUSSELL WHITE CUT AFTER REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Russell White reported to the Rams' UC Irvine training camp site 
but got no chance to unpack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams released White, who was selected in the third round of the draft from 
California a year ago, to make room for former Arizona Cardinal running back 
Johnny Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 White ran two times for 10 yards last season and failed to impress the 
coaching staff in off-season workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey comes in as the team's No. 1 punt and kickoff returner. He also can 
play on third downs in obvious passing situations in relief of Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried to sign Bailey several months ago, but he was asking for more 
than $1 million. He agreed Thursday to a one-year contract for $162,000, which 
will escalate to $200,000 if he makes the final roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also released punter Jeff Buffaloe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Wayne Gandy, the No. 1 pick, and his agent, Neil Schwartz, flew to 
Orange County on Thursday night in hopes of breaking a deadlock in contract 
negotiations. The Rams begin two-a-day workouts today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy has been asking for a four-year deal. The Rams have countered with a 
five-year offer. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Gandy's status at the expiration of his contract. A four-year deal 
would allow him to become an unrestricted free agent. Anything short of four 
years will allow the Rams to maintain their rights to him. A five-year deal 
would potentially tie him up for six years because of a change in the 
collective bargaining agreement that kicks in during 1999. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Running back David Lang has been cleared to practice once a day, but wide 
receiver Todd Kinchen will remain on the sideline. Both players are recovering 
from knee injuries. T.J. SIMERS

 The Philadelphia Eagles signed two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Townsend 
to a one-year contract for a reported $730,000, two days after he was cut by 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think getting Greg Townsend is a great thing for us," Eagle Coach Rich 
Kotite said."He has proven over the years with the Raiders that he's a force on 
the defensive line against both the run and the pass."

<P>
 Don Shula signed a new contract in his 25th year with the Miami Dolphins that 
will give him a minority ownership and let him coach through 1996 unless he 
decides to run the team from the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be Don's decision," Dolphin owner Wayne Huizenga said. "He can coach 
as long as he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came a week after Shula, the coach with the most victories in 
NFL history, let it be known he might not coach past this year when his 
contract expired. There was speculation after Jimmy Johnson left the Dallas 
Cowboys that Huizenga might recruit him to replace Shula in the 1995 season. 
Shula's contract is worth $4 million for two years, the Miami Herald reported.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ABBOTT WILL BE COURTED THIS WINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, trying to remedy a 2-year-old mistake, are expected to exhaust all 
efforts this winter to reacquire New York Yankee starter Jim Abbott, who is 
eligible for free agency in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are prohibited from publicly discussing their intentions because of 
tampering rules. Yet, after trading Abbott to the Yankees on Dec. 6, 1992, they 
will try to bring him back. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the Yankees' last-minute decision to pull out of a three-player 
trade on the weekend before the season opener, three high-ranking executives 
said, Abbott would be in an Angel uniform today. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman J.T. Snow would be a Minnesota Twin. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rick Aguilera would be the Yankee closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-team trade that nearly was consummated April 1 stayed alive until 
May before dying, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels would have sent Snow to the Twins, two minor league pitchers to the 
Yankees and acquire Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees would have sent Abbott to the Angels, third baseman Russ Davis to 
the Twins, and acquired Aguilera and two minor league pitchers who are not on 
the Angels' 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins would have sent Aguilera to the Yankees and acquired Snow and Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole hang-up was the Yankees' refusal to part with Russ Davis," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels are successful in acquiring Abbott, who is interested in 
returning to the Angels, it's possible they could field an all-left-handed 
starting rotation: Mark Langston, Chuck Finley, Brian Anderson, Andrew Lorraine 
and Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich is the only right-hander now in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Chad Curtis shaved his goatee, but it was not necessarily 
because of club policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife didn't like it," Curtis said. "When she saw I had it in New York on 
the last trip, she told me, 'It better be gone before you come home.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a joke that got blown out of proportion. It wasn't fun anymore. I 
never wanted that kind of attention in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon, who has sat out the last four games because of an 
aggravated right hamstring, will test it today and hopes to be in the lineup as 
a designated hitter. "I can still feel it," Salmon said, "but I think the 
quickest way to get me back is as a DH. . . . But they're winning without me in 
the lineup, so maybe they're thinking, 'Hey, no hurry.' " . . . If Salmon 
returns to the lineup as a DH, Chili Davis would play left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Rex Hudler was emotional when Angel hitting coach Rod Carew gave 
him a present that Hudler says he will cherish for a lifetime. Carew gave 
Hudler an autographed bat from Henry Aaron. "Rod's the greatest," Hudler said. 
"Can you believe he did this for me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, who earned his fifth victory Wednesday, underwent a magnetic 
resonance imaging test on his sore right leg to determine if there's a stress 
fracture. Leftwich, however, says he should be ready for his scheduled start 
Wednesday against Oakland. . . . The Angels have six scheduled days off in the 
next five weeks, but Manager Marcel Lachemann said he wants to continue 
pitching Finley and Langston every fifth day, and juggling the other three 
starters. BOB NIGHTENGALE

NOW EVEN FINLEY HAS ANGELS SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels' decision-makers have wrestled with their starting rotation, 
flipping it, flopping it, turning it over in their minds and in that space 
under the standings that lists probable pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to get it done," Manager Marcel Lachemann said the other day, 
"we're going to have to pitch consistently well and not just when Mark and 
Chuck are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, even those pillars of the rotation -- Mark Langston and 
Chuck Finley -- are liable to get rocked. When it comes to the Angel staff, you 
can't count on anything anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night at Anaheim Stadium was yet another long -- 3 hours 42 minutes 
long -- case in point. The Angels pushed across a run in the second inning, 
another in the third and one more in the fourth. They ended up scoring four 
runs against New York's Jimmy Key, baseball's winningest pitcher, and seven in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, Finley would take three or four runs and turn them into a 
runaway victory. But not in this season of the juiced ball, the corked bat and 
screwed-up pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 So Finley labored with his lead. He gave up a home run to Mike Gallego, who 
had been 0 for 6 since coming off the disabled list Tuesday and had hit only 40 
homers in 10 seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he gave up five hits and six runs in the fifth inning, forcing Lachemann 
to reluctantly walk to the mound and summon help for his ace from a bullpen 
that hasn't provided much aid in the Angels' time of need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really came down to four or five bad pitches in a row, when I needed to 
get an out," Finley said. "You just can't expect to do that and win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on it, I'm very disappointed. It's especially frustrating 
because you hate to waste that kind of offense." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a weird season for Finley, who started slow, failing to win in 
April for the first time in his career. He won four in a row between May 8 and 
24, allowing more than two runs in just one of those outings. But he fell out 
of that groove as fast as he slid into it and dropped five of his next six 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 He pitched very well at times and pretty darn poorly at others. The 
roller-coaster used to be for others to ride, Finley preferred the Bullet 
Train: a warm-up, a blur and another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I feel like I've thrown the ball like crap all year," Finley 
said. "I've mixed in a few good games, a little streak here and there, but 
basically I'm disappointed. I know I can win games and I'm not doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Angel managers -- five have had the pleasure of writing Finley's name 
on the lineup card -- could count on a bullpen-saving effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Finley led the league in complete games with 13 and this year he 
has pitched seven or more innings in 13 of his 20 starts. In the last three, 
however, he has averaged 5 2/3 innings per outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann admitted that he might have let Finley stay in too long, hoping the 
veteran left-hander would return to form. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a tendency to do that with him," Lachemann said, "because he's 
worked himself out of so many jams like that over the years."

LAKERS, JONES IN AGREEMENT; PRO BASKETBALL: TOP PICK FROM TEMPLE EXPECTED TO 
SIGN NEXT WEEK. VAN EXEL ALSO CLOSE TO WRAPPING UP DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving quickly to lock up what could be their backcourt of the future, the 
Lakers reached an agreement in principle with first-round draft pick Eddie 
Jones and appear close to a new deal with restricted free agent Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, expected to challenge to become the starting shooting guard, should 
sign sometime early next week after the obligatory physical. The package is 
believed to be worth $13.65 million over six years and, barring any delays, 
could make the former Temple star the first draftee of 1994 to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel and his agent, Tony Dutt, are expected at the Forum today to iron out 
the details on a new contract. The starting point guard signed a one-year 
contract for the league minimum of $150,000 last summer after being picked in 
the second round rather than try for a two- or three-year deal that would have 
offered more security. Van Exel said at the time that he was confident he could 
turn a good rookie showing into first-round money and the gamble apparently 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers signed rookie Trevor Ruffin to a partially guaranteed contract 
Thursday, hoping that he can develop into Van Exel's backup. An All-Western 
Athletic Conference choice last season at Hawaii, Ruffin was not drafted but 
has become one of the stars of the summer league at UC Irvine while averaging a 
team-high 24.3 points.  
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity comes only days after a judge lifted a ban on signings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers also apparently remain in the running for the three most prominent 
unrestricted free agents -- Horace Grant, Danny Manning and Dominique Wilkins. 
Grant on Wednesday concluded his five-city tour that covered Los Angeles for 
the Lakers and Clippers, Dallas, Detroit, Charlotte and Orlando, and hopes to 
sign within a week. Chances of his returning to the Chicago Bulls seem slim.

THIRD TIME IS THE CHARM FOR HASLIP; FOOTBALL: HIS DETERMINATION TO HANDLE THE 
SAT MATCHES USC'S DETERMINATION TO OFFER HIM A SCHOLARSHIP, AND BOTH ARE 
WINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Annie Haslip can't recall everything she did last May, but there was one day 
she says she will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sunny weekday when the mailman brought the news she and her family 
had been waiting for: Kenny Jr., her oldest son, had scored enough points on 
his college entrance exam to get a football scholarship to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Months of stress were relieved by that single sheet of computer paper. Annie 
quickly drove from the family home in Altadena to Muir High in Pasadena to 
share the news with her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't wait until I got home from school," Kenny said. "She wanted to 
show me and all of my coaches that I finally did it. She was waving the paper 
around like a proud mom. It was a nice moment for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip is a wide receiver and defensive back who signed a letter of intent 
with USC in February. The scholarship was contingent, however, on his scoring 
at least 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, the minimum required for 
athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 After twice coming up short, Haslip took the test again in April. Aware that 
he was running out of time, Haslip didn't think about the possibility of losing 
his scholarship. He spent little time preparing for the first two tests but 
took the third seriously and spent three weeks studying with a tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt a lot of pressure at the time," he said. "A lot of people were 
aware I was having trouble with the test, and some asked me if I was going to 
go to a junior college. That was something I never thought about." 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip, 18, said that when he saw he had scored 800, he quickly called the 
coaches at USC with the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the day was set aside for celebrating with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been easy for my wife and I to give up on our son," said 
Haslip's father, Kenny Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so proud of the way he handled all the pressure, and we just kept 
telling him not to give up. We knew things would work out the way they were 
meant to." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure is nothing new to Haslip, who started at defensive back his junior 
season on a team that went 11-1 after losing in the Southern Section Division 
II semifinals the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-sport standout had a successful track season as well, going undefeated 
in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles and winning a State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Football recruiters were impressed with Haslip's speed, which he displayed 
last fall, intercepting five passes and returning two kickoffs for touchdowns. 
But the Mustangs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs and 
finished a disappointing 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also problems off the field. In November, Haslip got the result of 
his second test, which showed he had finished 10 points shy of the needed 700. 
Considering him an academic risk, many recruiters backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip was leaning toward Colorado as the signing date neared, but the school 
did not offer him a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 USC was one of the few schools that did not give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to get too stressed out and let any of this embarrass me," Haslip 
said. "It's a tough test, but I knew it was something I could pass if I put my 
mind to it. I never thought about not passing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip went on with track season as he awaited the result. He established 
himself as the top hurdler in the nation early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Turner, Muir's track coach, said he and Kenny often talked about the 
SAT. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told him if he put as much effort into the test as he does his 
athletics that he would be fine," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the good news arrived, Haslip turned all his attention to track. He 
finished the season undefeated once again in the 300 hurdles and also added a 
State title in the 1,600 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he reports to practice at USC next month, Haslip is spending this week 
preparing for the 43rd Shrine all-star football classic. The game matches the 
32 best graduating seniors from Northern California and the top 32 from 
Southern California. It will be played Saturday night at 7 at Citrus College in 
Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show that I'm one of the top players in the state, athletically and 
academically," Haslip says with a laugh. "I've got a lot to prove."

GROWING PAINS; LIFE WASN'T ALWAYS EASY BUT THAT TOUGHENED USC-BOUND PERRYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wherever he goes, whatever he does, Willie Perryman seems to ooze 
All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 During his senior year at Burbank High, if he wasn't reading stories to 
elementary school kids in his spare time, he was probably tending to his duties 
as student body president, an office he held for two terms. And with whatever 
time was left, Perryman served as the school's homecoming king and prom king. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC-bound defensive end even looks the part of an All-American. His 
hulking 6-foot-4, 235-pound frame is hard to hide. "He's the stud of our 
campus," said Kendall Nohre, his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this, however, has come only after Perryman tackled more adversity in 
his 18 years than some people face in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The events came ruthlessly in rapid-fire succession -- a life-threatening 
premature birth, two debilitating childhood illnesses, a rocky family life that 
saw him bounce among three different homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I think it helped me out," he said of his upbringing. "I don't think 
about any of those things as being bad. It all helped me, so it worked out for 
the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The one constant in Perryman's life has been athletics. Friends persuaded 
Perryman to play football as a freshman at Burbank High in 1990. When his 
mother refused to sign release forms allowing her son to play, he forged her 
signature. "I played and I guess I played pretty good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore in 1991, he was so excited about starting in his first varsity 
game that he passed out on the team bus afterward. "Football was the only way 
out for him because his family didn't have a whole lot of money," Nohre said. 
"He knew sports was his ticket out." 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior in 1992, Perryman began to attract college recruiters when he was 
Burbank's most valuable player after recording 102 tackles, including 29 for 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in him increased until he suffered torn ligaments in his right knee 
three weeks into his senior season. The injury sidelined him for several games, 
scaring away recruiters. Perryman thought his dreams of going to college were 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cried and cried," Nohre said. "He thought that was it. College was out of 
reach now. His schoolwork and everything went downhill. Nobody could tell him 
it was all right because things really weren't all right. It looked like 
everything he worked for went down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 USC coaches, though, remained interested. "They acted like it was no big 
thing," Perryman said. "I thought my life was over. They stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman returned in late October and played the last few games, eventually 
being named a first-team All-American by Super Prep and Blue Chip magazines. He 
signed with USC in February and will play defensive end for the South team in 
the Shrine high school all-star football game Saturday night at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unlikely plot twist for Perryman, whose childhood reads like a Charles 
Dickens novel, but his tales were all too real. Perryman's mother, Cynthia 
Fremont, gave birth to her son two months early. She was only 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman drifted in and out of consciousness as an infant, sometimes hardly 
showing signs of life. "He died three times in that hospital," Fremont said. "I 
never wanted to leave him." 
</P>
<P>
 She kept a bedside vigil, staying at the hospital 16 to 18 hours a day for a 
month, praying her son would be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was even afraid of not hearing him cry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman survived, but health problems persisted. He was born with scoliosis, 
a lateral curvature of the spine, and when he was 9, doctors discovered he had 
Osgood-Schlatter's disease, a condition in which tendons pull way from bones 
when a child grows too quickly. Both conditions were eventually corrected. The 
same could not be said of his relationship with his father, Willie Perryman 
Sr., who left Fremont a year after his son was born. Though they kept in 
contact, Willie Jr. always felt awkward around his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Perryman's mother suffered in her marriage. When Willie Jr. was 7, 
Fremont was beaten so badly by her then-husband that she had to be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont left town "to get back on her feet" and sent Willie Jr. to live with 
his father. She later returned to live with her mother in Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
 This triggered a period that saw Perryman shuttle among his mother, his father 
and the Regopoulos family, whose son, Ricardo, was Perryman's best friend. He 
stayed with the Regopouloses in Burbank on and off for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got along with my dad, but I was afraid to talk to him because I didn't 
know him that well," Perryman said. "It was hard not having a dad around all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman responded by isolating himself from family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad at my mom because she was kind of irresponsible and I would stay 
away from her," he said. "I didn't call my father (often) because he got 
married and has three daughters and I thought he loved them more than me." 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman's mother wishes he had been more open with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyes give it all away," Fremont said. "I'm not an open person, so I guess 
he got it from me." 
</P>
<P>
 With his future more in focus, Perryman has begun to look to the past. He now 
talks with his father regularly. "Every now and then we check out a movie or he 
takes me out to lunch or we just talk," Willie Sr. said. "I've always had a lot 
of love and respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman is beginning to open up more to his mother as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the relationship with my parents is the best it's ever been," he 
said. "It was just hard growing up because I just didn't understand. I thought 
there was something wrong with me, that they didn't love me. As I grew up, I 
learned that wasn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman wants to study psychology and eventually open a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to work with kids when I get out," he said. "I've been through a lot 
in my life and . . . now I can go and learn to work better with people and 
understand people a little better. Hopefully, my experiences will help them."

SCGA FIELD AIMS TO IMPACT HACIENDA'S ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the parlance of the players, the Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra Heights is 
a ball-tracker's course. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the 95th Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship, 
which begins at 7 a.m. today and includes nearly two dozen players with area 
ties, isn't particularly long, hilly, hazard-heavy or punitive. However, 
because Hacienda was constructed in 1919-20, a premium is placed on accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely doesn't fit the cookie-cutter mold of the many lengthy, 
tricked-up contemporary courses. No island greens, few railroad ties. It's au 
naturel.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes it a great golf course," said Andy Thuney, the head pro at 
Hacienda. "They were more into target golf then. They worked around the natural 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they only had 350 yards to work with (while building) a hole, they made 
you lay up." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, long-ball hitters need not apply. Players in the 92-man field would 
be well-advised to leave their woods in the bag on as many as four driving 
holes on the 6,650-yard, par-70 layout. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17th hole, a relatively short par five for members, has been converted to 
a 470-yard par four for the tournament. Thuney said no other alterations have 
been made -- with the notable exception of the rough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hacienda rough typically is mown on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. 
This week, it hasn't been mown and could approach a wrist-jarring five inches 
in length in certain places, Thuney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hacienda has more than a few parallels to the storied Riviera Country Club. 
Hacienda, like Riviera, meanders through a hidden valley and has quite a few 
stands of eucalyptus trees. Thuney said members sometimes refer to Hacienda as 
"Riviera East." Not surprisingly, both courses were built in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there are 20 players with ties to the region entered in the event. The 
tournament is the second-oldest continually contested amateur championship in 
the nation and includes many PGA Tour standouts among its past champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrants will play 36 holes today, after which the field will be trimmed to 
the low 42 players plus ties. The field will play 18 holes on Saturday and 18 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of players from the region earned one of 28 automatic exemptions 
based on past play. Players from the area include top college standouts, a 
former PGA Tour pro who regained his amateur status and one top senior player. 
</P>
<P>
 Automatic qualifiers include Don Baker of Canoga Park, a former touring pro 
who regained his amateur status; Jason Gore of Valencia and University of 
Arizona, the Pacific 10 Conference individual champion; Paul Ladin of Westlake 
Village, the 1993 State Senior Amateur champion; Jim Tassano of Camarillo, who 
placed in the top five at the SCGA Mid-Amateur last year; left-hander Mike 
Turner of Woodland Hills, a four-time Southern California Public Links 
champion; Chad Wright of Ventura, a sophomore from USC; and Charlie Wi of North 
Hills and California, the 1990 State Amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four players earned berths through regional qualifying events. Area 
players who qualified via this route include Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth, who 
advanced to the match-play portion of the State Amateur; Lawrence O'Neil of 
Camarillo and the University of Houston; and Kelly Schlender of Ventura 
College, the state junior college individual champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford-bound Tiger Woods of Cypress is playing in the SCGA for the first 
time. Woods is a three-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion. Steve Woods of 
Upland, the newly crowned State Amateur champion, also is entered.

CSUN TRYING TO PICK UP PIECES OF SHATTERED SEASON; COLLEGE BASEBALL: FOUR KEY 
PLAYERS SIDELINED BY INJURY ARE ON THE MEND, BUT IT'S GENERALLY A SLOW AND 
CAUTIOUS PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was dark humor, to be sure, but it was a dark season. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of Cal State Northridge's unsettling baseball campaign, 
somebody in the grandstand cracked that the Matadors' team physician was named 
Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it, a doctor with a dull scalpel and a sharp eye could have 
constructed a pretty good ballplayer by using the healthy parts of four key 
athletes who were sidelined because of season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops grew thin, the cast was hardly complete. In fact, for three of the 
wounded, the cast was on their respective right arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the final game of 1994, the healing of John Najar, Keven 
Kempton, Chad Thornhill and Andy Shaw continues. Will the injury storm clouds 
blow over by spring? To assess the team's chances, it might be advisable to use 
a hospital thermometer instead of a barometer. 
</P>
<P>
 The season was the worst in the six-year tenure of Coach Bill Kernen, who had 
led the Matadors to the NCAA Division I playoffs in each of the three previous 
seasons. The staff earned-run average was a bloated 6.35, within a homer or two 
of the worst in school history (6.41), and the Matadors finished 25-30, their 
first losing season since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a few team records were set in the futility department, but it was a 
series of injuries that was at least partly responsible for the team's dismal 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 By season's end, because of injury and attrition, only 14 healthy players were 
available. More specifically, five of the nine pitchers on the opening-day 
roster were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-handers Najar and Kempton accounted for two-thirds of the Matadors' 
three-man starting rotation when the season opened in February, but neither 
finished the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, who won 10 games as a junior in 1993, was strafed in four starts, 
during which he was 0-3 with a 7.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 He had major reconstructive surgery on his right elbow March 7. This summer, 
he is working out with a personal trainer in San Diego and was given the green 
light this week to begin light throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to begin throwing off the mound by December. While recovery from the 
Tommy John-type surgery usually takes at least a year, Kempton, who was given a 
medical redshirt year and will be a 25-year-old, fifth-year senior in 1995, 
hopes to be available by midseason at the latest. He is even considering trying 
to make the team as a position player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do whatever it takes to get back out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar did whatever it took to stay out there, pitching in excruciating pain 
for several weeks with a hairline fracture in his right forearm. Still, he 
wanted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 8, during a key series at San Diego State, the bone gave way as Najar 
made a pitch. In a frightening moment, the crack was heard by his teammates in 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar's recovery has been steady but not particularly fast. The cast wasn't 
removed until last month. This time, Najar isn't taking any chances as he heads 
into his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to really make sure it's healed," Najar said. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't plan to press the issue until he's given full medical clearance to 
throw, which could come as soon as next month. Najar (5-3, 5.83 ERA in 1994) 
said he briefly tossed around a Nerf ball a few days ago and was more than a 
little worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of tentative," he said. "Kind of scared. I want to make sure it's 
ready. If I'm healthy (next spring), I'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill, the team's starting shortstop, suffered a broken bone in his right 
elbow April 24 during a collision at first base. He already has begun playing 
for a traveling summer team in Fresno, his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill, a transfer from Fresno City College who batted .278 and drove in 26 
runs last season, has been playing with the Fresno Royals, a National Baseball 
Congress team. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill recovered quickly -- once he cleared the mental hurdles. "At first, 
I thought I'd never be able to throw again," he said. "I just had to get over 
the fear of throwing." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill said his arm has gradually gained strength and feels about 90% 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, a transfer from College of the Canyons and the 1993 Western State 
Conference player of the year, never had a chance to play in '94. He underwent 
knee surgery before the season opened in February, but his recovery is ahead of 
schedule. Shaw has been working out six days a week at Matador Field and is 
riding a stationary bicycle 20 miles daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who was Northridge's projected starter at first base, hopes to receive 
clearance to begin jogging next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's felt real good lately," he said of the knee. "I don't know if it'll ever 
feel 100% again. It'll always probably hurt a little bit, but I think I can 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, like many of his wounded mates, is proceeding carefully. While many 
college ballplayers across the nation are playing in summer leagues in Alaska 
or Cape Cod, the Northridge foursome operate at half speed. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye on the calendar, you could say their theme is: Spring forward, 
fall back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take your time now," said Shaw, who will be a junior. "There's no 
hurry. We all need to make sure we do it right so we're ready. It's a lot more 
important to be ready in the spring than the fall."

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; VAN NUYS EAST ROUTS UNARMED WEST, 11-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In retrospect, Van Nuys East's 11-0 victory over Woodland Hills West in the 
American Legion baseball District 20 playoffs Thursday at Burroughs High was 
about as surprising as finding a Bible in a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills West, after all, was out of pitchers. Because the top three 
pitchers from El Camino Real High -- Randy Wolf, Tony Kyber and Shaun Fishman 
-- chose not to play Legion ball, the team had only one legitimate pitcher, 
Greg Kmet, and he worked Tuesday. What remained were a few converted position 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 And Van Nuys East had 6-foot-3 left-hander Rich Igou on the mound. Igou, who 
has signed with the University of San Francisco and was drafted by the Kansas 
City Royals, has been nearly unhittable in Legion play. 
</P>
<P>
 Igou went all the way in a game called after seven innings because of the 
10-run rule. He gave up two hits and struck out 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had, what, 12 strikeouts? And this is supposed to be one of the best 
hitting teams around," Van Nuys East catcher Ed Romero said. "He wasn't 
throwing hard at first, but all of the sudden he just took command. He started 
just gassing it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Igou, who improved to 5-0 in Legion play, also contributed to Van Nuys East's 
12-hit attack with two home runs and four runs batted in. Francisco Dongo, 
Justin Bunch and Joe Orlando also homered for the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The drubbing was administered to reluctant Justin Balser (2-2), forced to take 
the mound for just the fourth time in the last four years because of Woodland 
Hills West's lack of pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at our staff," Balser said. "It's pretty much pitching by committee up 
there. But (Van Nuys East) is a really good hitting team. They are the best 
I've seen. They mashed the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East (17-5-1), which is 13-1-1 in recent weeks, will face Valley 
North at 4:30 p.m. today at Burroughs in a matchup of the only two teams yet to 
lose in the double-elimination District 20 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are playing pretty well and it's going to take a good pitcher to beat us," 
Van Nuys East Coach Jody Breeden said. "We're doing everything properly, 
pitching well and hitting well." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills West (16-8) drops into a losers' bracket game against Encino at 
4 p.m. today at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 In other District 20 playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North 6, Sun Valley 5 -- Tony Montiel was three for four with five 
RBIs, including a two-run single to give Valley North the lead in the seventh 
inning of a winners' bracket game at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Danny Martin picked up the victory with 2 2/3 innings of 
scoreless relief. It was Martin's first pitching appearance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Ray Daryabigi was three for three with a home run for Valley 
North (15-8), which was the 10th-seeded team in the tournament but has won its 
first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall-Santa Clarita 4, Verdugo Hills 1 -- A three-run outburst broke a 1-1 
tie in the eighth and Newhall-Santa Clarita (18-6) eliminated Verdugo Hills in 
a losers' bracket game at Birmingham High. Brian Eggleston drew a bases-loaded 
walk that scored Brian Baron to break a 1-1 tie.  
</P>
<P>
 One out later, Brett Tonkiss hit a two-run single to break the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Solomon, who pitched seven strong innings, and Bobby Graves, who picked 
up the victory in relief, combined on a five-hitter for Newhall-Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron went three for four and scored two runs to lead Newhall-Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Geller and Bryan Chan each had two hits for Verdugo Hills (16-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Encino 4, Antelope Valley South 1 -- Right-hander Ron Jones pitched a 
three-hitter and struck out 11 while walking three to pace Encino in a losers' 
bracket game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat eliminated Antelope Valley South (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
 John Campanella went three for four and Barry Matthews had two hits for 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino (18-6) increased its lead to 3-0 with a two-run third inning on a 
run-scoring grounder by Ray Munoz and a run-scoring single by Matthews.

WORLD CUP RATINGS BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC averaged an A.C. Nielsen rating of 5.3 for its coverage of 11 World Cup 
soccer games, up 18% from predictions made by the tournament's U.S. organizer, 
Alan Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup final between Brazil and Italy on Sunday got a 9.5 national 
rating with a 24 share, the highest-rated soccer game ever on U.S. network 
television.The record coming into the World Cup was 6.6 for the Italy-West 
Germany final in 1982, but that was broken several times during this 
tournament, the first ever in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The rating is the percentage of television households in the nation, and the 
share is the percentage of homes with their TVs turned on. Each ratings point 
represents about 942,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rating for Brazil's penalty-kick victory narrowly topped the 9.3 rating 
for Brazil's 1-0 victory over the United States in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tournament began, Rothenberg projected an average rating of 
4.0-4.5. The 5.3 average translates to an average of 4,993,000 homes watching 
each game. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first World Cup shown on network television in the United States 
since 1986.

REYNA APPEARS SET TO PLAY FOR TEAM IN GERMANY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Midfielder Claudio Reyna, the youngest player on the U.S. World Cup team, was 
scheduled to leave for Germany on Thursday to sign with Bayer Leverkusen in the 
first division. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. soccer official said the basics to the deal had been agreed to last 
Saturday.Reyna will join Thomas Dooley, a defender and midfielder on the U.S. 
team, who last month agreed to a two-year contract with Bayer Leverkusen. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna, 21, has two goals in 17 appearances with the U.S. team. But he sat out 
the World Cup after tearing his right hamstring in practice on June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna started all three games for the United States at the 1992 Olympics and 
was the U.S. college player of the year in 1992 and 1993, when his Virginia 
team won NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Heinz, a spokesman for Bayer Leverkusen, said he had no information on 
the negotiations, but the U.S. official, speaking on the condition of 
anonymity, said an agreement had been reached.

JURY URGES EXECUTION OF WOMAN; COURTS: MARY ELLEN SAMUELS, WHO ARRANGED 
SLAYINGS OF HER HUSBAND AND HIS KILLER, WILL BE SENTENCED IN SEPTEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Porsche, the parties, and the Cancun beaches she savored as a newly rich 
widow now only a memory, Mary Ellen Samuels sat stunned Thursday as a jury 
recommended that she be executed for orchestrating the murders of her estranged 
husband and the man she hired to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 A hush fell over the packed Van Nuys courtroom as the jury delivered the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, did not change expressions as a court clerk read the verdict of 
the jury -- reached after two days of deliberations. But she was unable to 
respond when the judge asked her a procedural question, and her eyes filled 
with tears as she was escorted from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff scheduled sentencing for Sept. 16. If he 
carries out the jury's recommendation, Samuels will join four other women on 
California's Death Row. All have been sentenced by Southern California juries, 
one of them in the same Van Nuys courthouse where Samuels was tried. 
</P>
<P>
 As they left the courtroom, members of the jury used words such as "cold," 
"selfish," "uncaring" and "evil" to describe Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was trash," jury foreman Nick Catran-Whitney said. "She had no 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was dubbed the "green widow" by police and prosecutors because she 
spent her husband's $500,000 estate in less than a year after he was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 She was convicted July 1 on two counts of first-degree murder, and the jury 
found special circumstances that warranted the death penalty -- that she 
orchestrated multiple murders and that she killed for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, a 40-year-old motion picture camera assistant who worked on 
the films "Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was shot in the back of the 
head with a shotgun in his Northridge home Dec. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his body was found, the suspected hit man took out a $25,000 
life insurance policy, naming Samuels' daughter, Nicole, as beneficiary. Seven 
months later, he was dead -- strangled, beaten and dumped along the highway in 
an isolated Ventura County canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial testimony was lurid. Tales of murder and treachery poured forth from 
witnesses, stories involving steamy love letters, shopping sprees, limousines, 
cocaine parties, hit men, insurance checks, fast cars, male strippers, 
mother-daughter cheesecake photos and a talking pet parrot who cursed the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 A key prosecution exhibit was a photograph of Samuels taken by a lover less 
than nine months after her husband's slaying, on a hotel bed in Cancun, her 
naked body covered only by $20,000 in cash.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi alleged that greed was Samuels' motivation in a 
crime "so bizarre no fiction writer could write it. She almost got away with 
the perfect murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels arranged to have her husband killed when she learned he planned to 
divorce her, Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 As his ex-wife, Samuels would have received a $30,000 settlement and monthly 
alimony payments of $1,100, according to testimony. But as a widow, she 
inherited $500,000 -- including her husband's house, his Subway sandwich shop 
and the proceeds from several insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The defense had argued that Samuels was a victim of domestic abuse and that 
Nicole Samuels-Moroianu, who testified on her mother's behalf, had been 
sexually abused from age 12 by Robert Samuels, her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not 'Leave It to Beaver.' It's not 'Make Room for Daddy.' This was a 
dysfunctional family," defense attorney Phil Nameth had told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors rejected that argument, saying the defense offered no proof to 
support the accusations by Samuels and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 One male juror described Samuels' testimony as "a pack of lies."  
</P>
<P>
 After her husband's death, Samuels testified, she used the insurance money to 
pay bills, and her lifestyle did not change. But prosecution testimony showed 
that Samuels defaulted on her mortgage payments, paid cash for a new Porsche, 
rented limousines for bar-hopping jaunts, and lent money to her friends. She 
spent thousands on trips to Las Vegas and Cancun, and on fur coats and custom 
outfits. She threw a huge birthday party for herself at the Knollwood Country 
Club four months after her husband's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bernstein, the 27-year-old suspected hit man, was slain because Samuels 
feared that he would succumb to police pressure and implicate her, Maurizi 
said. Bernstein died believing he was engaged to Samuels' daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 As they filed out of the courtroom, jurors paused to embrace Robert Samuels' 
sister, Susan Conroy, who sported his portrait on a large button she had pinned 
to her sweater. Conroy attended the four-month trial almost daily, and said she 
had trouble maintaining her composure as Samuels branded her murdered brother a 
wife-beater, a drunk and a child molester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted," at the death sentence, Conroy said. "She gave the exact same 
sentence to my brother. I think it's exactly what she deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels' death sentence will be appealed automatically and reviewed by the 
state Supreme Court. Among the issues that probably will be raised is the 
dismissal Wednesday of a juror after she wrote to the judge, saying she was 
unsure she could vote for a death penalty. The defense is expected to raise the 
possibility that the woman was pressured by other jurors into asking to be 
excused. She was replaced by an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Josh Groshan said he found the death verdict grossly 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors expressed amazement at testimony that Samuels could openly solicit 
-- and find -- willing killers in the same San Fernando Valley bars and 
restaurants they frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever someone turned her down, she'd just go to someone else," 
Catran-Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some jurors said they found it offensive that Samuels summoned her ailing, 
elderly parents to the courtroom to beg for her life, even though she rarely 
visited them and never told them her husband had left her a large estate. 
</P>
<P>
 And they laughed at a defense attorney's description of the murder plots as a 
midlife crisis for Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd better look out, then. There's a whole lot of us who could go ape at 
any time," juror Karen Hudson joked.

MAN HELD IN DEATHS OF SON AND EX-WIFE; COURTS: HOLLYWOOD ENGINEER IS ACCUSED OF 
TRYING TO GET $2-MILLION INHERITANCE BY HIRING A HIT MAN TO KILL THE PARALYZED 
BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Hollywood recording engineer has been arrested and charged with hiring a hit 
man who suffocated the engineer's paralyzed 8-year-old son and shot his former 
wife and the boy's nurse to death, court officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Lawrence T. Horn ordered the killings last year in Silver 
Spring, Md., in an effort to inherit about $2 million from a 1990 settlement 
with a Washington hospital, where the boy had been involved in an accident that 
left him a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy's relatives tied up the settlement with a lawsuit designed to 
prevent Horn from getting the money. As a result, Horn was unable to pay off 
the alleged hit man, convicted felon James Edward Perry, and Perry's repeated 
phone calls demanding payment eventually provided the evidence needed to make 
the arrests, a source close to the case said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 54, and Perry, 45, were indicted Tuesday on three counts of first-degree 
murder and one count of conspiracy. Both were arrested later that day -- Horn 
at his apartment in Los Angeles and Perry at his home in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
 Perry's attorneys have indicated he will fight extradition, but Horn's Beverly 
Hills lawyer, Donald B. Marks, said at a Los Angeles Municipal Court hearing 
Thursday that his client -- who once worked for Motown Records in Detroit -- 
will go to Maryland voluntarily to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will fight these charges," Marks said. "He has protested his innocence 
since the very first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Whalen, an assistant state's attorney in Maryland who will be 
prosecuting the case, said the bodies of Trevor Horn, his 43-year-old mother, 
Mildred Elizabeth Horn, and Trevor's nurse, Janice Saunders, 38, were found at 
the Horn home by Mildred Horn's sister, Vivian Rice, on the morning of March 3, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women had been shot several times in the face at close range. Both 
were sprawled on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The blind, paralyzed boy was lying in his bed. His breathing tube -- attached 
to a respirator that operated around the clock -- had been wrenched from his 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Police determined quickly that someone had broken into the house during the 
night through a small basement window, killed all three occupants and fled in 
the family van. The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor's twin sister, Tamielle, had spent the night at Vivian Rice's home. The 
twins' older sister, Tiffani, now 20, was away at college. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tall, burly engineer insisted that he had been in Hollywood when 
the crime was committed -- an alibi corroborated by a girlfriend -- detectives 
theorized that he might have hired someone to do the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Police soon learned that Horn had made a videotape of the route from downtown 
Washington to the home where the slayings occurred, and that he had obtained 
tapes Tiffani had shot earlier of the interior of the house -- which he had 
never seen, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also learned about the hospital's settlement money, which Horn stood to 
inherit with the deaths of Mildred Horn and his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say Trevor and his twin were born prematurely, and although she grew 
up strong and healthy, he suffered from asthma. Eleven months after his birth, 
a respirator at Children's Hospital failed while Trevor was undergoing 
treatment for his respiratory disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Trevor suffered severe brain damage in the accident. The boy 
required around-the-clock nursing care and needed the constant assistance of a 
respirator, equipped with an emergency backup battery, to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement reached in 1990, Trevor amassed an estate that now has an 
estimated value of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after the slayings, Rice -- acting on behalf of Tiffani and 
Tamielle Hunt -- filed a suit to block Lawrence Horn from inheriting Trevor's 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family uniformly believes that he committed the crime," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 By last fall, a grand jury had begun investigating the case. A court order was 
obtained authorizing the tapping of Lawrence Horn's telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months that followed, Horn received calls from Perry, whom Horn had met 
through mutual friends in Detroit, sources said. Perry -- who has served prison 
terms in Michigan for armed robbery and assault with intent to rob -- wanted 
payment for the killings, but Horn said "he couldn't get his hands on the 
money," the sources said.

EAST MEETS WEST; HINDU CONGREGATION WINS OK FOR TEMPLE BY ADOPTING MISSION 
DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The golden Indian domes have been replaced by a red tile roof, and the ornate 
Hindu carvings at the entrance have been scrapped in favor of curved archways. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Natoo Patel, the latest sketches of his congregation's new place of 
worship in Norwalk are beautiful -- even if the building will end up looking 
more like a Spanish mission than a Hindu temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The modified design was approved by the Norwalk City Council this week, 
despite continuing protests about parking and traffic from residents of the 
neighborhood near the temple site at Pioneer Boulevard and Ferina Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention was to use traditional Hindu architecture," said Patel, a 
Diamond Bar resident who heads the small Hindu congregation. "But we want to be 
good neighbors, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Patel's group was forced to give up its original plans two years ago after 
dozens of residents complained that its distinctive, traditional design was 
incompatible with the surrounding area -- a tract of small stucco homes built 
in the 1950s and two Christian churches from the same era. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors also worried that the $1.2-million temple would attract 
thousands of Hindu worshipers from all over Southern California, creating 
parking and traffic problems on their quiet residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first plan was rejected, Patel spent two years working with city 
planners, traffic engineers and residents to come up with a design that 
everyone could live with.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides removing the temple's nine steeples, its gold domes and intricate 
carvings, they reduced the size of the two-story building to leave room for 
more parking spaces. They also removed one driveway, diverting traffic off 
residential streets to busy Pioneer Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that they changed the design," Councilwoman Eleanor Zimmerman 
said. "It doesn't look Hindu, but it does fit the neighborhood." Zimmerman, one 
of three new council members who has taken office since the project was turned 
down in 1992, voted in favor of the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the still unnamed temple is expected to begin this year and be 
completed by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Patel said most of his 110-member congregation will be relieved to 
finally have a permanent place to worship, he added that not everyone is 
pleased with the new Spanish mission-style design.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to make a lot of concessions and we eliminated many of the proper 
ceremonial elements that we would have preferred," Patel said. "The mission 
design was hard to swallow for some of the more orthodox members." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including 74-year-old congregation founder Dinker Inamdar, said 
finding the right spot -- a centrally located piece of property large enough to 
accommodate the temple -- was more important than the design. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not disappointed; this is a gift from God," he said. "What we needed 
was a place to worship, not a decoration or a monument to our religion. What is 
most important is that we now will have a place to offer prayers."  
</P>
<P>
 The congregation, the International Swaminarayan Satsang Organization, is made 
up of 28 families that belong to a faction of Hinduism that worships Lord 
Swaminarayan, an incarnation of Krishna, as its god. Since Patel's group was 
formed in 1982, they have been meeting in private homes or rented halls and 
schools, which many times did not meet their standards of cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are strict vegetarians, and it is very important that we have the proper 
place to cook our meals," Inamdar said. 
</P>
<P>
 After searching for years for a temple site, the congregation found the 
property in Norwalk in 1991. The families pooled their savings and bought the 
land for $630,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The group met immediate opposition when its plans to build a 
15,000-square-foot, 530-seat temple were submitted to the city the next year. 
(It has now been reduced to 12,000 square feet, with a 322-person capacity) 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before the Norwalk Planning Commission, the Rev. Nyal Royse, a 
pastor of the neighboring Church of Christ, called the temple a "grotesque 
monstrosity." Others feared the neighborhood would be "inundated with Indians." 
One woman asked if the plans included a crematory, a reference to Hindu funeral 
rites in which the dead are cremated. No crematory is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel said such misconceptions did not bother him nor did they lessen his 
congregation's determination to build their temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we mostly found was a fear of the unknown," he said. "And our job was to 
communicate to them what we are and what we do. There is nothing to fear."

ARCO TO ELIMINATE STAFF OF FOUNDATION; BUSINESS: STEP IS CALLED A MAJOR BLOW TO 
CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY. FIRM'S OFFICIALS REAFFIRM COMMITMENT TO AREA. 
</P>

<P>
 In a major blow to corporate philanthropy in Los Angeles, Arco is eliminating 
the entire staff of its respected Arco Foundation, staffers said.  
</P>
<P>
 Arco officials said the cuts do not represent a change in the company's 
philosophy of community involvement, but acknowledged that the amount of money 
it gives -- now $13 million a year -- may decline because of drops in the 
company's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in the world of corporate giving said the severe downsizing of the 
Arco Foundation is a disturbing symbol because Arco has been seen as a national 
pacesetter in corporate philanthropy, as well as one of the corporations most 
committed to the Los Angeles region.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's staff is credited with setting an example for other 
corporations in the way it has carefully scrutinized the projects it funds, 
including millions devoted to post-riot community building in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will send shock waves across the country," said Lon Burns, president of 
the Southern California Assn. for Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Eugene Wilson, president of the Arco Foundation, whose position 
will be eliminated within months, "has been viewed as one of the visionaries of 
corporate philanthropy, arguing strenuously that corporations address root 
causes (of social problems) and not just give away money."  
</P>
<P>
 Foundation staff members were informed Wednesday that their positions would be 
terminated in the fall. Wilson, who was on vacation, said he got the news when 
he checked in by phone that day. The job of six foundation staffers will now be 
done by one person in the community affairs section.  
</P>
<P>
 Hard-hit by falling oil prices in recent years, Arco announced earlier this 
week that it would cut 1,250 positions companywide, including several hundred 
at its Downtown headquarters. The restructuring is being led by Arco's new 
chief executive officer, Michael Bowlin. He took over July 1 from Lodwrick 
Cook, who remains chairman of the company. Neither executive was available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The change at the foundation "doesn't signal a change in philosophy," said 
Stephen Giovanisci, vice president for public affairs, who will take over the 
title of president of the Arco Foundation. "The commitment by this company in 
the community is still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanisci noted that many other departments have suffered cuts during Arco's 
downsizing.  
</P>
<P>
 However, philanthropy experts said that regardless of whether Arco reduces its 
donations, the foundation staff cuts are disturbing because foundations like 
Arco's can act as crucial social catalysts, spreading information and advice to 
improve nonprofit programs.  
</P>
<P>
 This year the Washington-based National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy 
ranked Arco first among U.S. corporations in its giving to minority 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arco was going out on a limb funding lots of new and different 
organizations," said Kate Conover, assistant director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the expertise of its foundation staff, Arco "may not have the 
man-hours to find out what the community needs," Conover said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Powers, assistant director of the Jaime Escalante Math and Science 
Program on the Eastside, said that Arco has been a major funder of the program, 
which has had great success in preparing inner-city students for the advanced 
placement mathematics exam. He said Arco staffer Gloria DeNecochea has helped 
him make contacts at other foundations and given crucial advice on the best way 
to prepare grant proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God. That's terrible," Powers said upon learning that the Arco 
Foundation staff was being eliminated. "That doesn't bode well for our 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennie Lechtenberg, executive director of the PUENTE Learning Center in Boyle 
Heights, said Arco did not just respond to requests for funding, but sometimes 
initiated projects. Lechtenberg said that last year, Arco Foundation staffer 
Russell Sakaguchi approached her organization with the idea of establishing an 
adult job training center at the site of a South-Central Arco gas station 
burned out during the riots.  
</P>
<P>
 The center is scheduled to open next week with computer-equipped classrooms 
after receiving $700,000 in funding from Arco in addition to donation of the 
site, worth $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco has been the largest single corporate donor to the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's education reform initiative, called LEARN, giving $150,000 a 
year for the past three years. Mike Roos, head of LEARN, said the staff of the 
Arco Foundation has been an important resource.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of their intelligence, interests and passions, they have acted as a 
switchboard of information for people doing things in education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Smith, president of the Seattle-based think tank Corporate Citizen, said 
Arco seems to be following a trend among large corporations that are under 
increasing pressure to link their philanthropy to their bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of widespread layoffs and declining profitability among many large 
corporations, contributing to a community simply out of a sense of obligation 
is considered "foolish unless it gives added benefits that (other companies 
don't get)," said Smith, who recently published a Harvard Business Review 
article on how companies can use their philanthropy for strategic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Social pressure for corporations to give has waned in the 1990s, Smith said. 
"Companies will not cut their philanthropy if they feel they're losing 
something with strategic value. (But) the message from the public is, you won't 
lose brownie points if you cut corporate giving. The research shows that the 
general public doesn't care that much."

 We got him to the moon, but could not get him to the Marriott at LAX.

 Neil Armstrong was to hop on a plane for Los Angeles on Wednesday night after 
a 25th anniversary ceremony at the White House. But the first man to walk on 
the moon found himself stuck in Washington when his United Airlines flight was 
grounded because of mechanical problems.

<P>
 That left the 500 guests at the Marriott event honoring Apollo contractors a 
bit disappointed. But organizers found a stand-in: comedian Bill Dana, famed 
for his portrayal of Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you're all delighted to have me instead of Neil," quipped Dana, whose 
comedy character chased several careers, including astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
 At the event, sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics, Southern California contractors and engineers who worked on the 
Apollo program each got certificates signed by the three Apollo 11 astronauts. 
The crowd included retired aerospace executives, rocket scientists, secretaries 
and actress Nichelle Nichols, a former NASA recruiter who played Lt. Uhura on 
TV's "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience -- old enough to identify with the days of three-martini lunches 
and Sinatra's Rat Pack -- laughed loudly at Dana's routine, especially the 
nightclub jokes that once were considered risque. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in from my table in Redondo Beach," Dana joked when he reached the 
podium from a distant table. "One small schlep for man." 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, though. "I have all of you to thank for my career," Dana told the 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana's portrayal of Jimenez as a reluctant astronaut became a favorite of the 
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo crews, and the comedian hosted parties for the space 
explorers at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became accepted into probably the most exclusive fraternity in the history 
of the whole planet," he said before going on. "It wasn't casual. We are all a 
close family." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Dana recounted his favorite story from those days, when NASA official 
Deke Slayton uttered the first words from Earth to an American astronaut in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, Jose, you're on your way," Slayton told Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Jimenez bit, Dana turned the program back over to the engineers. A 
former NASA administrator paid tribute to about a dozen agency and aerospace 
officials for shepherding the Apollo program. And a former top Rockwell 
executive read off the names of Apollo's builders, recognizing them by the 
spacecraft parts they contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Litton Industries Inc., for the Saturn S-IVB transducers," he said. "Parker 
Bertea Aerospace, for Saturn S-IVB semiconductors. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the event -- recounting a decade of engineering innovation -- lasted 
less than four hours. And many felt that the tribute was long overdue given 
Southern California's contribution to the space race -- local workers built the 
Apollo and much of the Saturn rocket, which dwarfed any other that had been 
launched at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been too little attention paid to the Apollo team," said keynote 
speaker George Mueller, a NASA administrator during the Apollo days. "One would 
think that at least the (executives of aerospace companies) would go down in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the event say that is why Armstrong wanted to come: to recognize 
the rank-and-file workers who routinely logged six-day weeks and 16-hour days 
to get to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Armstrong didn't make it, but 
Apollo veterans used the time as a chance to catch up with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing else, it was a chance to see the people, once more, that you 
worked around the clock with, fought with and achieved success," said Albin D. 
Kazanowski, a retired aerospace engineer who chaired the dinner. "The end 
result of the effort is what counted." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the evening was over, the well-dressed crowd slowly filtered out of 
the hotel ballroom. The ones who put Armstrong on the moon.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LYNWOOD; DETECTIVES 
SEEK HELP IN SLAYING OF WOMAN, 24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives asked for help Thursday in solving the 
stabbing death of a 24-year-old woman whose body was dumped on a freeway 
on-ramp in Lynwood early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers found the partially clothed body of Laura Nanuelu Alegria on 
the Imperial Highway on-ramp to the southbound Long Beach Freeway, said Deputy 
Irma Becerra of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Alegria's friends saw her leave the Los Globos nightclub, 3158 Martin Luther 
King Blvd., with two Latino men about 2 a.m. that day, Becerra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are awaiting test results to determine if Alegria was raped, 
Becerra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the killing, or anyone who may have seen Alegria 
leave the bar with the two men, was asked to call detectives at (213) 890-5500.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WOODLAND HILLS; SUSPECT 
IN FATAL SHOOTING OF BYSTANDER SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man suspected of killing a bystander in a shooting last month 
turned himself in Thursday, two days after police released his name and 
photograph and a $25,000 reward was posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaveliaee Hammond, 20, walked into the Los Angeles Police Department's Van 
Nuys station at 3:30 a.m. accompanied by his mother, said Detective Dan 
O'Hanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, whose street name is "Lil Man," is scheduled to be arraigned today 
for murder and an unrelated robbery charge. He is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been looking for Hammond since the June 11 fatal shooting of Renee 
Hurtado, 21, outside a Panorama City convenience store at Van Nuys Boulevard 
and Plummer Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado had returned to her car where her daughter, sister-in-law and niece 
were waiting. Gunfire erupted and a stray bullet struck Hurtado in the chest. 
She died at a hospital. Police believe that Hammond was shooting at a group of 
men who were behind Hurtado's car in a dispute over who could sell drugs on 
that corner.

ARGENTINE, ISRAELI DIPLOMATS VOW TO FIND BOMBERS OF JEWISH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing shoulder to shoulder at a memorial to Jewish victims of terrorism, 
diplomats from Argentina and Israel vowed Thursday in Los Angeles to find those 
responsible for this week's bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that 
killed more than 45 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the truth comes very soon," said Luis Maria Riccheri, consul general 
for Argentina. "Argentina needs that. The world needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 Uri Oren, consul general for Israel, said: "The enemies of peace will not 
deflect Israel from its way," adding that his country is "gratified" by 
Argentina's swift reaction to Monday's bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 The consuls' unusual meeting at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of 
Tolerance came as rescue workers in Buenos Aires continued digging for 73 
people thought to be missing in the ruins of a building that housed the 
Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Assn. and the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Assns. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, about 150,000 Jews and others filled a Buenos Aires plaza to protest 
and listen as prayers and messages from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were read. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Museum of Tolerance, Riccheri and Oren met privately with about two 
dozen Los Angeles-area Jews who have friends or relatives who may have been in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Wiesenthal Center said they have set up an information hot 
line in conjunction with the two consulates to relay news of victims. 
Twice-daily updates of the names of those killed, missing or injured are 
available at (310) 553-9036. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Argentina has long had a reputation as a haven for Nazis who fled 
Germany after World War II, security experts have blamed a pro-Iranian 
guerrilla group for the bombing. They speculate that Argentina was targeted 
because of its relatively lax security and large Jewish population. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the center, said the Museum of 
Tolerance -- which recognizes the 6 million Jews killed in the World War II 
Holocaust -- was picked for Thursday's meeting to underscore that Jews will not 
ignore terrorist acts against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The message should go out that Jews will pursue those responsible for the 
attack even "if it takes half a century" to bring them to justice, said Rabbi 
Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the center. BOB POOL

KIDNAPERS RELEASE VICTIM, SPURN $800,000 RANSOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena police were wondering Thursday why the kidnapers of a 26-year-old 
man, the son of a prominent local family, freed him without picking up the 
$800,000 ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Gray Jr., float chairman for the Tournament of Roses Parade, took the 
money in a duffel bag to a Highland Park meeting spot on Tuesday in an attempt 
to ransom his son, Robert, who had been kidnaped that morning. But Robert Gray 
had been released unharmed in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested two women after tracing calls made to the father's house 
and are seeking more suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnapers accosted Robert Gray at gunpoint just after 6 a.m. Tuesday as he 
was in the parking garage beneath his North Sierra Bonita Avenue condominium 
about to leave for work. He is general manager at Edmund A. Gray Co., a Los 
Angeles manufacturer of pipe nipples owned by his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The abductors blindfolded and bound Gray, then drove him in his Toyota pickup 
to a spot where they switched to another vehicle, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously the motive is money," said Pasadena Police Lt. Gene Gray, who is 
unrelated to the victim. The lieutenant said police are investigating the 
possibility that employees at the family business might be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8:30 a.m., Robert Gray called his father's San Pasqual Avenue home to 
say he had been kidnaped and that his captors were going to kill him if 
$800,000 ransom was not paid. Minutes later, Lawrence Gray received a second 
call from one of the kidnapers, who reiterated the message, and the father 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnapers called again just after noon, instructing him to go to a 
location in Highland Park at 3 p.m. Undercover officers staked out the area and 
waited in vain for two hours for someone to show up. At 9 p.m., the kidnapers 
called a third time, telling the father to go to Debb Park in Highland Park. 
About 20 undercover police officers staked out that area. 
</P>
<P>
 A motorcyclist rode up to Lawrence Gray and asked if he had the money, Lt. 
Gray said. The father said yes and asked the man about his son. Instead of 
replying or taking the money, the man sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, police said, the victim's mother received a call from the 
LAPD's Southeast Division, saying that Robert Gray had been found unharmed in 
an alley at Vermont Avenue and 92nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Walella Mayson, 32, of Norwalk, and Laura Melgar, 28, of Los Angeles, are in 
the Pasadena City Jail on suspicion of kidnaping. LISA O'NEILL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN 
CONVICTED OF MURDER FOR LYE ATTACK ON WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After acting as his own lawyer in a retrial that rekindled memories of an 
excruciating death 14 years ago, Ricardo H. Robinson was convicted Thursday of 
first-degree murder in a 1980 lye attack on an aspiring lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the murder conviction, the jury also found Robinson guilty of mayhem, 
conspiracy and assault for attacking Patricia Worrell with a caustic 
chemical.The jurors, who deliberated for two days, declined to talk about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patricia Worrell can finally rest in peace," prosecutor Robert L. Cohen said. 
"I'm happy there's some closure for her friends and relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, formerly of Las Vegas, faces 25 years to life in prison when Judge 
Michael Harwin sentences him Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's trial featured gruesome testimony about law student Worrell's fatal 
injuries, and appearances by Robinson's two co-defendants. One implicated him; 
the other tried to clear him. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson denied any role in the attack during his own testimony and claimed 
that he was framed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RESEDA; SHOTS INTENDED 
FOR MOTHER HIT 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ongoing dispute between neighbors in Reseda escalated into a drive-by 
shooting Thursday in which shots intended for a mother wounded her 3-year-old 
daughter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 1:15 p.m. in the 17800 block of Saticoy Street when a 
truck carrying three adults and two young children stopped nearby, according to 
an eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
 As the passengers in the cab leaned forward, the driver, identified by 
authorities as Juan Manolo Cienfuegos, fired four or five shots from a handgun 
at Eileen Cortez, 21, the child's mother, said Lt. George Rock of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez was not struck by gunfire, but one of the shots hit the child, Vanessa 
Barcenas, in the shoulder, Rock said. Vanessa was in UCLA Medical Center in 
stable condition Thursday with injuries that were not life-threatening, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Thursday, Los Angeles police arrested Cienfuegos and Christina Stevens, 
21, who was identified as a passenger who is engaged in a long-running feud 
with Cortez.

RAPIST INDICTED IN KIDNAPING OF WOMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury Thursday indicted an accused rapist for allegedly 
kidnaping a Castaic real estate broker and taking her to Arizona, where she was 
found tied up in a motel room.  
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, faces life in prison if convicted of abducting Paula 
Doreen Harrington, 26.She was lured from her office June 29 after Shue asked 
her to show him several properties.  
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested in Ogden, Utah, after allegedly showing his gun to a 
stripper at a club called Ladies of Lace. He was returned to Los Angeles last 
week and will be arraigned Aug. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Shue forced Harrington to withdraw money from automated 
tellers, but did not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found July 1 when deputies in Gila Bend, Ariz., responded to a 
report of a woman screaming for help.  
</P>
<P>
 Shue was paroled last July after serving 11 years in prison for armed robbery. 
He was later linked to several attacks on women and a rape.

MEETING TO EASE TENSIONS IN VENICE AREA TURNS RAUCOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tempers flared Thursday night at a meeting called to combat violence between 
black and Latino gangs in Venice as residents vented their frustrations over 
unemployment, a lack of recreational programs for young people and what they 
called police apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about blacks and Latinos not getting along," said Raphael Anderson, 
a longtime resident of the Oakwood area of Venice where the meeting was held. 
"It's about a drug trade. It's about the police not caring." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents assailed the media, saying too much emphasis has been placed on 
racial tensions and not enough on possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting between black and Latino gangs in Oakwood has claimed 17 lives and 
left 55 people injured in the last 10 months. Many of the victims were 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 In early June, two Latino students at Dorsey High School in Southwest Los 
Angeles were killed in a drive-by shooting near Venice High School. Their 
assailants were described as black. 
</P>
<P>
 The warfare in the streets has left some residents complaining that they feel 
as though they are prisoners in their homes, and they are afraid to let their 
children venture out alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 60 vocal residents at Thursday's meeting said the problems in Oakwood 
could best be addressed by providing more jobs and economic opportunities, and 
former California Supreme Court Associate Justice Cruz Reynoso agreed with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Real change in Oakwood will come when individuals, schools, churches and other 
organizations come together to attack the community's problems, said Reynoso, 
now a UCLA law professor and vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no easy solutions," he said. "We have an issue of civil rights. 
It's not just between African Americans and Latinos. It's the right of people 
to enjoy their community." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Cota, the Oakwood community activist who organized the meeting, was 
sternly criticized for calling Venice gang members "termites" in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Cota pleaded for community cooperation in combatting the gang violence, 
telling residents Thursday that those at the meeting had come together because 
"we want a truly peaceful community." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the feud in Oakwood started early last year when a black woman 
fatally stabbed a Latino man over who would take the first puff from a crack 
cocaine pipe.

OFFICER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 9 ROBBERIES; CRIME: THE RECENTLY RETIRED DETECTIVE 
ONCE RAN THE LAPD'S ORGANIZED CRIME INTELLIGENCE DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A once-celebrated Los Angeles police detective accused of going on an 
armed-robbery spree that began weeks before his retirement pleaded not guilty 
Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Craig E. Veals ordered bail lowered from $500,000 to $200,000 
for Michael D. Brambles, 45, but the former organized-crime investigator 
remained in custody because his attorneys said he could not immediately raise 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking anybody rich. We're talking an LAPD person (who) lives on 
his retirement," said Audrey Winograde, who is serving as co-counsel for 
Brambles with noted Santa Monica defense attorney Charles R. English. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles, who once was a supervising detective for the LAPD's Organized Crime 
Intelligence Division, is accused of nine robberies around Los Angeles, most at 
restaurants. A lone gunman was reported in each case, usually arriving near 
closing time and escaping with small amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Lamb said that two of the robberies occurred before 
Brambles' retirement became official March 26, but that he was not on duty, 
apparently having taken sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said that Brambles' revolver, recovered when he was first picked up for 
questioning May 5, was "similar in nature to the gun used in the robberies." 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles was arrested July 5 in Las Vegas, where he moved after retirement. He 
was brought back to Los Angeles, where he is being held in a protective-custody 
area of the County Jail, a precaution commonly taken with law enforcement 
officials behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going through hell," defense attorney Winograde said outside court. "He 
told me, 'I put many people in County Jail in my day. I never realized what a 
hellhole it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Winograde said that Brambles' response to the charges was "it is not him. . . 
. He didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 She called it "one of the strangest cases we've seen" because of the 
allegation that a veteran officer turned to "penny-ante little robberies with 
no disguises." 
</P>
<P>
 During 23 years with the LAPD, Brambles was given many high-profile 
assignments, including heading the investigation into the collapse of the ZZZZ 
Best carpet cleaning company and serving as the LAPD's main contact with 
longtime Beverly Hills madam Elizabeth Adams, who passed him the pillow-talk 
intelligence gleaned by call girls in her employ. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last years on the force, however, Brambles was the subject of a series 
of internal disciplinary cases, including ones accusing him of lying under oath 
and leaving an obscene photograph on the desk of a female colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing in the case was set for Sept. 8. Brambles' attorneys 
agreed that he would stand in a lineup before then to see if the robbery 
victims can pick him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are seeking to determine whether more robberies can be 
linked to Brambles. "There is an ongoing investigation," prosecutor Lamb said.

A JOURNEY OF LOVE; BLACK MAN AND THE KOREAN BOY HE RAISED ARE INVITED TO SEOUL

 Leon T. Graves, whose story of rearing an abandoned Korean child has touched 
countless hearts across the country, on Thursday left for South Korea with the 
boy on a 10-day trip sponsored by nonprofit groups in Seoul whose members 
wanted to thank the African American for what he has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to the trip," said Graves, 68, as he prepared for his 
departure. "I'm a little nervous about what I'm going to say." He is scheduled 
to deliver a sermon Sunday at the Namson Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 His message will be about love, he said, about how "we can come together 
(regardless of race, ethnicity and color) if we just try." 
</P>
<P>
 Graves, who was wounded during the Korean War, also said he has been praying 
and dreaming that South and North Korea will be united within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 13 years, Graves, 68, has cared for Roy, whom he found crying and 
near death as an infant, abandoned by his mother in an apartment building at 
the edge of Los Angeles' Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Roy "God's gift to me," Graves hired a Korean woman to care for the 
baby while he was at work. Graves remained close to Koreatown because he wanted 
the boy to acquire a Korean identity. He has learned to cook Korean food, shops 
in Korean grocery stores and attends a Korean church. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the story about the pair's life together appeared in The Times on 
Father's Day, they have been inundated with telephone calls, requests for 
interviews from Connie Chung and other television personalities and offers of 
movies and TV series. Universal Studios and Disneyland invited Roy and his 
friends to visit the theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy and Graves have also received gifts and cash donations. A builder, who 
wants to remain anonymous, presented a TV and a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves is pleased with the outpouring, but is not letting his renown go to his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite offers from big-name production companies, Graves chose a young Korean 
American woman with "no track record (or) reputation" to produce a movie of 
their story because, he said, "I want to return the story back to the (Korean) 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to maintain the integrity of their story," said Anna Shon, who was 
consulted on the decision. She and her husband, Young Joon Shon, own a golf 
shop and driving range where Graves works in a variety of jobs. "Leon felt that 
a Korean American woman would be more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 At Graves' insistence, Anna Shon is accompanying him and Roy on the trip. 
"Timing couldn't be worse for me because my boys (ages 6 and 8) are in school, 
but Leon says he won't go without me," she said. So, she is taking her sons 
with her because her husband will be running the shop by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop on their itinerary is a tailor's shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to have a suit made for Leon," said Shon, who has been talking with 
people from the Namson Presbyterian Church and the Nak-Do Children's Support 
Assn., a women's group that helps disadvantaged children. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, they will get a tour of Seoul and attend church services at 
Namson. On Sunday, Roy will also celebrate his 13th birthday. After taking in 
cultural sights in Seoul and outside the South Korean capital, the Graves party 
will fly to Cheju Island, "the Hawaii of Korea," to relax. They will return to 
Los Angeles on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Graves, who said he has not shopped for clothing in years, 
bought two pairs of wrinkle-free pants and a couple of short-sleeve shirts for 
himself, and four pairs of shorts and tops for Roy. For once, Graves could 
afford to buy a few things. He received $3,000 a week ago from the producer who 
bought the TV and movie rights to his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Fate brought Leon Graves and Roy Chung together in 1981. Graves was working at 
a wholesale fish market and lived in a four-story building occupied mostly by 
blacks and Koreans.  
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, a neighbor told him that she and her husband had not been able 
to sleep for nights because of a crying baby next door. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened the door to the room the cries were coming from, he saw an 
infant on the floor, wailing. "I saw that the baby needed immediate attention," 
Graves recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 Next to the baby was a birth certificate naming him Roy Dae Yon Chung. Graves 
took the baby to Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. Doctors there said the 
infant would not have survived another three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Graves, who was 55 and single, picked up the baby from the 
hospital, and the two have been inseparable ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves is his legal guardian, but Roy said he considers Graves "my father." 
</P>
<P>
 And Graves said he lives for Roy.

BEST MEDICINE: DOSE OF HOME; OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE HELPS THE HEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 As doctors collected blood cells for her bone marrow transplant, Barbara 
Delgado Garcia remembers, she watched an Ann-Margret movie about a dying breast 
cancer victim who must find homes for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it wasn't the best movie choice, Garcia today is grateful that 
instead of having to find new families for her 2- and 3-year-old girls, she has 
them for comfort and motivation as she recovers from breast cancer, thanks to 
an unconventional form of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment, a bone marrow transplant, was unusual because Garcia received 
it as an outpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had undergone a mastectomy, but her lymph nodes still were cancerous. 
Her best hope was a bone marrow transplant, an expensive proposition for the 
San Clemente homemaker and her husband, a maintenance worker at a Dana Point 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctor at St. Joseph Hospital told her that Medi-Cal, which provided her 
insurance, was wary of paying the $150,000 for a relatively new procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget it," she told him. "I can't pay that with my whole life. I can barely 
pay my rent!" 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital and Medi-Cal agreed to share the expense, and Garcia became a 
trial patient for a new procedure that would cut the cost of the operation in 
half. The entire process, from cell collection to chemotherapy to the 
transplant itself, would be done on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Garcia passed the danger point, when an infection can be critical 
for her suppressed immune system. That milestone gave the hospital the 
confidence to start treating other breast cancer patients on the same 
outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is being done all over the country, according to Dr. Winston Ho, 
director of St. Joseph's bone marrow transplant program and Garcia's 
oncologist. Other hospitals rent rooms in a nearby hotel or college housing and 
have nurses stay and monitor the patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment for this treatment is now small enough to move around, Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients are home with their own families in their own comfortable 
settings. They get the same kind of care, just not in a hospital setting." 
</P>
<P>
 In Garcia's case, the outpatient facility was her small home, and her nurse 
was her terrified sister, Leticia Delgado, who flew up from Garcia's native 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Lettie," Garcia said, laughing now about how scared her sister was. "She 
kept saying to me, 'What if something happens to you in the middle of the 
night? Something will have to be done in seconds.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That "something" never happened, but Delgado, who has since returned to Mexico 
City, was trained for three days by hospital staff in case it had. A small 
computer monitor and a modem next to Garcia's brass bed provided a lifeline to 
the staff. And everyday, Delgado drove her to the hospital's outpatient clinic 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once breast cancer comes back after a mastectomy, it can almost never be 
cured," Ho said. With bone marrow transplants, "we may be curing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho noted that doctors so far have no proof that the procedure cures anyone, 
because it is only five years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have shown is that of patients who get this treatment, many more are 
alive and well after five years," Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a breast cancer case, which differs from other cancers, patients can be 
their own donors for transplants, Ho said. Blood-producing cells that normally 
live in the bone marrow can be stimulated to go into the bloodstream and 
collected. Those cells are frozen and stored and are reintroduced after the 
chemotherapy has killed the cancerous cells in the body.  
</P>
<P>
 On the 27th day of her treatment, the day of the transplant, Garcia was still 
sick from the chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 She lay down and the staff started introducing the frozen healthy cells 
through her catheter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever see 'The Exorcist?' " she asked. "That's the way you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 She slept for four hours and swore she could feel the difference when she 
awoke, even though the doctors told her that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I woke up, I feel stronger and alive," she said. "I was more 
alert. I told the doctor I feel like I'm born again." The doctor said they 
would have to wait 21 days to make that determination. 
</P>
<P>
 July 15 marked the day the doctors could agree with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has gone through this safely, soundly and she is fine," Ho said. "Her 
treatment is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Garcia made her first trip to the supermarket and has since taken 
the girls to the park and the beach. And on Aug. 12, she will celebrate her 
37th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy," she said. "I'm very, very, very happy."

DISPLACED SHOP OWNER, STATE SETTLE LAWSUIT; COURT: HENRY BARTLE WILL GET MORE 
THAN $1 MILLION FOR THE LOSS OF HIS BUSINESS TO MAKE WAY FOR THE SANTA ANA 
FREEWAY WIDENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state has agreed to pay more than $1 million in compensation to the owner 
of a Corvette specialty shop who lost his business to make way for widening of 
the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement between the state Department of Transportation and Henry 
Bartle, owner of California Corvettes, came minutes before a jury trial was set 
to start Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court. Lawyers in the case would 
not specify the settlement amount, except to say it was more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartle, who had run the full-service automotive shop on North Santiago Avenue 
in Santa Ana since 1975, was forced out of business several months after the 
state moved to take the property in 1992 for the freeway project, said his 
lawyer, Michael H. Leifer. Bartle has been unable to find a new home for the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He searched approximately 50 sites to determine if he could move," Leifer 
said. "It was extremely difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials offered Bartle about $286,000 for his company machines and 
equipment, but the two sides were unable to agree on compensation for his 
inventory and less tangible amounts related to benefits the shop gained through 
its location and reputation, said Eric J. Fleetwood, an attorney with the 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual owner of the property housing the Corvette business settled with 
the state for more than $1 million several months ago, Leifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is just one of hundreds acquired by the state for the massive, 
multibillion-dollar Santa Ana Freeway widening project. Federal law requires 
that government entities pay fair market value for private property taken for 
public use through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled trial before Judge Leonard Goldstein, with the jury already 
seated, helped spur the Corvette business settlement, which both sides 
described as fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a greater sense of urgency at trial time," Fleetwood said. "Also, 
more facts tend to come to light." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Overall, this (settlement) was probably in the range of what a jury 
would have come in at."

THEIR WORLD CUP RUNNETH OVER WITH MERCHANDISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's soccer team brought home more than the World Cup championship this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 They also lugged back video cameras, shoes, leather bags, luggage and various 
appliances collected during a shopping spree that forced some Orange County 
stores to restock their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchases have created a scandal in Brazil, where the country's tax chief 
resigned Thursday in a dispute over the team's failure to pay nearly $1 million 
in customs duties on excess luggage brought from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian officials said the team brought back 17 tons of luggage, including 
microwave ovens, washing machines and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how much of the merchandise was bought in Orange County. But 
the players, coaches and their wives purchased so much merchandise during their 
stay at the Fullerton Marriott that some of it had to be stored in the hotel's 
ballroom, hotel officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Large boxes from various stores were moved from the ballroom onto vans and 
buses bound for Los Angeles International Airport, when the team left for 
Brazil on Monday, said Nancy Morgan, director of marketing for the Fullerton 
Marriott. Other items were sent directly from the stores to the airport, Morgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the shopping occurred in and around South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal Chiecchino, a salesman at the mall's Robinsons-May department store, 
said he was surprised to see 15 to 20 members of the team enter the store 
Monday morning, just a day after their World Cup victory against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very unusual," Chiecchino said. "Monday is usually a slow day." 
</P>
<P>
 The team members purchased $2,000 worth of luggage -- about 30 suitcases and 
bags, Chiecchino said. They were especially interested in Samsonite luggage and 
extra-large "Pullman cases" on wheels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very happy. They seemed like very nice people," Chiecchino said. 
"I'm Italian, so we discussed the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Team members were also spotted at various sporting goods stores in the mall 
including Fila, where players searched for World Cup clothing, said clerk Jeff 
Hosilyk. 
</P>
<P>
 A sales clerk confirmed that the team purchased items from the Warner Brothers 
Studio store, but she said it was against company policy to reveal what was 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, the furor over the merchandise brought back by team members 
threatened to spoil the euphoria that had greeted Brazil's fourth World Cup 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes Filho told reporters he was quitting 
over "differences" with President Itamar Franco. He was to hand in his 
resignation letter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lopes said the "last straw" had been the president's decision to overrule his 
order that 17 tons of luggage brought back from the United States by the 
Brazilian soccer delegation should be subject to normal Brazilian customs 
inspection and duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian newspapers ran front-page stories Thursday on how the players and 
soccer federation officials had refused late Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to allow 
customs officials to inspect their luggage, which was carried in five trucks to 
their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian customs laws require the payment of duties on any purchases made 
abroad over the value of $500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy threatened to disrupt an already delayed victory parade 
through Rio's streets until an order came through from the Presidential Palace 
in Brasilia, via Economy Minister Rubens Ricupero, to release the uninspected 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of the moment, soccer federation officials and players, including 
star striker Romario, even threatened to boycott the Rio parade and hand back 
medals they were awarded by President Franco, Brazilian newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truck is not leaving the airport without my luggage. We're not smugglers. 
We represented Brazil in front of 2 billion people in the world. If they don't 
release my luggage, I'm giving back my medal," O Globo quoted Romario as 
saying.

 Lesley Sebek, 12, found it hard last school year to drag herself out of bed in 
time for class at Springbrook Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, though, Sebek has awakened in plenty of time to get to her 7:45 
a.m. summer school class at Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Her explanation: This three-week session for the fall's incoming students at 
Rancho San Joaquin and South Lake middle schools isn't just some boring summer 
school class. 
</P>
<P>
 It's equal parts old-fashioned academic enhancement and newfangled "how-to" 
guide for surviving the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the survival material -- how to be brave enough to tell other kids you 
don't want to tag buildings, join gangs or do drugs -- that has made Sebek and 
the hundred other participants feel ready to make the jump to middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really nervous," Sebek said Thursday, after giving her final 
humanities presentation on how restaurant owners and residents feel about 
smoking bans in public places. "We saw pictures of South Lake, met the 
principal, and I've met new friends who will be in school with me. It was worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselor Lynn Kaminsky, who has been with the Rancho San Joaquin's 
"Transitions Institute" summer school program since it began four years ago, 
said children moving from elementary to middle school need to know what to 
expect in terms of school layout, class rules, peer pressure and homework 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell who these kids are in September," she said. "They're like little 
ambassadors running around the school."  
</P>
<P>
 Middle school can be stressful for young children fresh off the more 
structured and friendly elementary school campus, said Kathy McKeown, who 
teaches the summer school's humanities classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In middle school they face "more independence and responsibility," McKeown 
said. "And it's a time of great emotional and physical changes. It all wears on 
them."LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: TUSTIN; COUNCIL VOTES DOWN MOVE TO OUST PLANNER

<P>
 An attempt to remove Planning Commissioner Al Baker from his post during the 
middle of a two-year term has failed to win the approval of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-2 vote Monday, the council refused to remove Baker, who has served on 
the advisory panel for the past nine years. The commissioners are appointed by 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Jim Potts, who proposed Baker's removal, said he wants to "give 
new people a chance on the commission." Potts said the issue was length of 
service, and "had nothing to do" with Baker personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time for term limits" on commissioners, said Potts, who helped 
lead the fight to place a measure on this November's ballot that would limit 
the terms of City Council members. Tustin voters will decide in November if 
council members should be limited to two consecutive terms or three consecutive 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael J. Doyle, who also voted for Baker's ouster, said it was 
time for "new blood" on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamantly opposing Baker's removal, however, was Councilman Jeffery M. Thomas. 
He apologized to Baker and said that debating the issue during a council 
meeting amounted to a "public caning." 
</P>
<P>
 "This should not be happening," said Thomas, who criticized Potts for putting 
the matter on the council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli praised Baker's service to the city and said his 
experience was needed during this "critical time in Tustin" when the city is 
facing issues such as the closure of the Marine Corps Air Station.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Tracy Worley also came out in support of Baker, saying that in 
the interest of fair play, Baker should be allowed to finish his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he was pleased that a majority of the council wanted him to remain 
on the commission for another year. "It's a kind of a success," he said. "Now 
it's time to get to work." ALAN EYERLY

 A 33-year-old man drove his car into a pizza restaurant Thursday, injuring 
himself and one of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver hit a curb, a street sign and lost control of the car 
before ramming into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Robert Chavez of Santa Ana, who was arrested on suspicion of felony 
drunken driving, was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange after being 
found unconscious, Police Sgt. Bob Chaney said. Chaney said it was not 
immediately known what evidence officers had to arrest the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who is in serious condition, was driving south on Indiana Avenue just 
before 2:30 p.m. when his car swerved across the street, hit the curb and then 
the street sign. Chaney said the man then lost control of his car, which 
crashed into the front of Frank's Italian Food, 8242 Commonwealth Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez's car wound up four feet inside the building. One of the owners was hit 
by flying debris, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hye Cha Kuark, 36, had minor cuts on her knee and ankle and was taken to 
Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim for treatment and released, Chaney said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: FULLERTON; HOSPITAL OPENS YOUTH CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Jude Medical Center this week unveiled its new Youth Care Center, where 
youngsters will be treated for behavioral disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, 
depression, learning disabilities and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, police and hospital administrators said the center will 
provide a place where youths, mainly teen-agers, could get help before their 
problems get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the city deal with troubled youth oftentimes in the criminal justice 
system," City Manager James L. Armstrong said at the center's ribbon-cutting 
ceremony Wednesday. He praised the new center, calling it a "prevention 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Ruth, the center's medical director, said: "I think this is a very big 
asset to the city of Fullerton. We'll do preventive work to try to decrease 
problems in the schools. . . . The emphasis is on trying to get to people early 
on -- before they get into situations that will affect them for life." 
</P>
<P>
 The program focuses on treatment of outpatients, including group, family and 
individual therapy, counseling and education. In addition, troubled adolescents 
will be taught how to deal with change, communicate with family and peers, 
resolve conflicts and deal with daily pressures, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients already are being screened and interviewed for the program, which 
will begin Aug. 2, said Joseph Solomita, clinical coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most patients are being referred to the new center by medical 
professionals, including psychiatrists and therapists, and schools and 
churches. He expects some referrals to come from law enforcement agencies as 
well. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: TUSTIN; COUNCIL TIGHTENS ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved stricter regulations on smoking in 
public, but the action has been superseded in large part by a measure signed 
into law Thursday by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's office called the law the nation's toughest statewide anti-smoking 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin still has the option of regulating smoking in workplaces not covered by 
the state law, which is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The council could decide to regulate smoking in tobacco shops, warehouses, 
ventilated employee lounges and areas not covered by the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tustin's revised smoking ordinance came before the council on Monday, the 
council voted 3-2 in favor. Voting for the tougher regulations were Mayor 
Thomas R. Saltarelli, Mayor Pro Tem Jim Potts and Councilwoman Tracy Worley. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting against the stricter smoking regulations were Councilmen Jeffery Thomas 
and Michael J. Doyle. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PROPOSAL ON GIFT LIMITS GETS 
CITY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week gave preliminary approval to a proposed ordinance 
that would prohibit public officials from accepting gifts worth more than $50 
from anyone who does business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance bans gifts from lobbyists and anyone under contract with the 
city or seeking a grant or contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Dapkus, management assistant, said the ordinance is intended to "preclude 
public officials from receiving gifts, period." 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially they can't take anything of monetary value of someone who is 
doing business with the city or who potentially could do business with city," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would allow "any food or beverages with a cumulative value of 
$50 from any single source within a 12-month period," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell said she would prefer a complete ban of food or 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be happy for it to be zero," she said. "I'd pay for my own lunch, but I 
do let people buy me a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Gifts also allowed include any food, beverages and free admission at any event 
sponsored by a charitable organizations with a cumulative value of $100 or less 
from any single source during a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell, who served on a council committee that studied the gift issue, said 
city officials are invited to a number of fund-raisers by charities and are 
expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's being realistic because there are places where people want us to appear 
and we can't afford to pay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gift exceptions include informational material, such as books or 
reports, and flowers, plants, balloons or similar tokens that are given to 
express condolences, congratulations, sympathy, or to mark a special event as 
long as the value is not more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Silva said that the ordinance was not a result of any abuse of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really had a problem with council members receiving gifts," Silva 
said, adding that state guidelines are also very clear. "We're just duplicating 
what's already on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city of Huntington Beach has always had elected officials who 
have worked within the framework of good moral conduct, which has served the 
citizens of Huntington Beach very well -- and this new ordinance just 
reinforces that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson also said the ordinance ensures that city 
officials maintain the "very highest standards."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COMMUNITY 
SERVICE CUTS GET INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given its nod to an initial staff plan to trim $140,000 
from the Community Services Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the areas slated for possible cuts are after-school programs, the flu 
shot clinic, annual trail ride and city support for special events such as the 
Fiesta de las Golondrinas reception. 
</P>
<P>
 About $100,000 in cuts to recreation programs and special events were made 
Tuesday, and another $40,000 will be trimmed from personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff is also considering where fees might be raised for such 
activities as renting ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that private nonprofit organizations will be able to help 
keep alive city-supported programs that end up being cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Final council approval, expected in 30 to 45 days, would roll the department 
back to its 1987 funding level, said Al King, community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 King has said that layoffs could be possible among the 25 employees, eight of 
whom are full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 The council this month approved the department's $1.48-million budget request 
when passing a $10.2-million general fund, but it asked the department to 
reduce its budget by the $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Scarborough said the city must carve another $60,000 in 
personnel costs elsewhere in the city's budget. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL OKS 
CONCEPT OF WIDENING ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of opposing any widening or straightening of the curvy Laguna 
Canyon Road, the City Council has agreed in concept to widening the road to 
four lanes and realigning it where it cuts between three natural lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council stopped short, however, of endorsing a plan proposed by the county 
that calls for a more extensive realignment of the highway, which winds through 
some of the most scenic land in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action followed a 4 1/2-hour public hearing Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Laguna Beach residents have been ambivalent about whether the winding 
roadway should be altered to make it safer and to allow the lakes to be 
restored or whether it should be left as is to preserve its rural ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 These feelings were summed up by landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, who was 
hired by the city to describe the effect changes to the roadway might have on 
the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park at the city's edge. Halprin is designing the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a wonderful project, and I'm ambivalent about it myself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area being considered for change is a 4.6-mile strip of highway from about 
El Toro Road to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A "preferred alternative" favored by a 17-member committee that met in 
closed-door sessions last year calls for the two- to three-lane highway to be 
widened to four lanes and shifted several hundred yards west of its current 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 That option has also been favored by some environmentalists because of its 
benefit to the lakes at the edge of the road. With the road removed, two of the 
three lakes could be reconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility considered by the council calls for the road to be widened 
to four lands but keep its current alignment. The council majority agreed it 
would be wiser to create a third alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will work with county representatives to come up with an acceptable 
alternate plan. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, the council voted 4 to 1 to approve the concept of a 
four-lane road with a median and shifting the road away from the three lakes. 
Councilman Wayne L. Peterson voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson and Councilwoman Kathleen Blackburn both favored the county's 
"preferred alternative" but were unable to sway any of the other three council 
members.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: FILIPINO AMERICAN GETS AWARD FOR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the slightest urging, Rudy T. Reyes of Huntington Beach would open a 
scrapbook he carries with him most of the time to a picture of a mayor and two 
state legislators at a gathering with a group of Filipino Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing dramatic about the snapshot. But Reyes, who is in the picture with his 
wife, says that it is an indication politicians are finally paying attention to 
the Filipino American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble with Filipino Americans is that we came here in large numbers and 
then kind of disappeared," Reyes said. "We don't have Little Saigons, Little 
Tokyos or Koreatowns. Most of us like the anonymity of living in the suburbs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although one of the largest ethnic groups in California, Filipino Americans 
often are considered the "invisible minority," said Reyes, an Orange County 
resident for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 1990 Census, the United States has about 1.4 million people 
of Filipino descent, more than half of them on the West Coast. More than 30,000 
live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, 49, said that Filipino Americans must be politically active, starting 
at the local level, to be taken seriously. Several have been elected to public 
office, but the majority do not want to get involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people who will take the time and effort to educate the community," 
Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, a sales representative with FHP Inc., recently received the Los Angeles 
County Achievement Award for his work in the Filipino American community in the 
Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recognized for promoting the culture by organizing events, such as the 
patriotic day and fiesta on June 18 that attracted hundreds of participants, 
including public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He has helped poor and elderly Filipino Americans apply for housing assistance 
and helped set up a food distribution program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're blessed, you've got to give something back to the community," said 
Reyes, who came to the United States 24 years ago. "My mission is to make our 
community a better place to live by promoting volunteerism and caring for the 
poor and elderly in our community." BERT ELJERA

 Wives of California Angels players will be collecting canned food for the 
needy at various Anaheim Stadium gates this weekend when the New York Yankees 
come to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who contribute will receive autographed pictures of Angels players.The 
women will be at gates 1, 3 and 4 before and during the first two innings of 
each of the last three games of a four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 The second game and third games take place at 7:05 tonight and Saturday night. 
The last game will be played at 1:05 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The wives who will take part in the drive are Paula Myers, Marci Salmon, Linda 
Jackson, Candace Curtis, Janee DiSarcina, Dawn Easley, Ann Leftwich, Kelly 
Springer, LeAnn Edmonds, Staci Snow, Allison Leiter, Renee Magrane, Gail Owen, 
Lauri Turner, Louisa Patterson and Kelly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the women collected more than 7,000 pounds of canned foods for the 
Food Distribution Center of Orange County. They expect to double that this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get every fan to bring in one can of beans or soup or something, 
we could easily double what we got last year," said Myers, whose husband, Greg, 
is a catcher.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAGUNA NIGUEL; AFTER 15 
SEASONS, TEAM IS IN TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of 14-year-old boys is thrilling the community as their Laguna Niguel 
Pony League baseball all-star team has advanced to the sectional tournament for 
the first time in the league's 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the district championships, the Laguna Niguel team skunked three opposing 
teams, each by 10 runs. Umpires operating under the "mercy rule," which keeps 
losing teams from becoming totally demoralized, ended each game after five 
innings, not the regulation seven, because of Laguna Niguel's huge leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally we've done something to put Laguna Niguel on the map," said manager 
Tom Grzecka, who chalked up the team's success to pitching depth, "timely" 
doubles from John Dabbs and John Cappeletti, and a grand slam from his own son, 
Casey. "Nobody's ever really talked about us much. But this time the boys have 
done really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball fever has been especially strong here because the team's victories 
over the Saddleback, Lake Forest and Newport-East Pony all-stars have all come 
on Laguna Niguel's own newly improved Chapparosa Park baseball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the city completed $1.3 million in improvements to the Chapparosa 
Park complex, which now sports towering backstops, lights, regulation-size 
fields and more parking. 
</P>
<P>
 With the upgrade, Laguna Niguel Pony could finally host the district 
championships for the first time this year. Hundreds of spectators packed the 
bleachers and lined the fences for the Pony League games, as well as the Little 
League Majors district tournament, which Laguna Niguel also hosted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old players gathered at Chapparosa Park Wednesday night for a 
final two hours of batting practice. They stroked line drives off fastballs 
served up by manager Grzecka, who was wisely pitching from behind a protective 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin play today in the Southern California Section 1 tournament at 
Whittier's York Field. At 5 p.m. the team will meet the all-stars from Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 But these 15 high school baseball prospects -- and their parents -- aren't 
letting the string of victories swell their heads.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Jim Thompson as he watched his son, Jeff, at Wednesday's practice: "It's 
like what the coach on the 'Coach' TV program said. 'You can be the best team 
out there and not get any of the breaks. Or you can be the best team and things 
go your way. You just have to sit back and enjoy it.' " LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAKE FOREST; BAN ON NEW ADULT 
BUSINESSES RENEWED 
</P>

<P>
 An urgency ordinance to ban new adult businesses from moving into the city has 
been extended by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said this week that the temporary city law will protect the 
city against adult businesses such as strip parlors and adult book stores while 
a permanent ordinance is being developed by city lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have time to work out our final ordinance," Councilwoman Ann Van 
Haun said. "This gives us breathing room." 
</P>
<P>
 The council first enacted a moratorium against adult firms on June 21. The 
extension will last until May 6, 1995. If the permanent ordinance isn't ready 
by then, the council can stretch the temporary law for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Mission Viejo worked on its adult-business law for more than a 
year, holding several public meetings before passing the law last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nude and topless dance clubs have opened in Orange County over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake Forest, Captain Cream's has been open on Lake Forest Boulevard for 
several years. The strip club switched to topless entertainment last summer, 
after a series of favorable court rulings involving two Orange County 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lake Forest moratorium extends to massage parlors, adult motels, 
mature-theme bookstores and other adult-oriented businesses. FRANK MESSINA

 Municipal Court Judge Daniel C. Dutcher has filed a lawsuit against the 
opponent he will face in a Nov. 8 runoff for his seat, alleging she and her 
campaign produced a libelous mailer and advertisement that cost him victory in 
the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit involves campaign material sent out by Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryl Lee, 
who is challenging Dutcher. The material accused Dutcher of being too lenient 
in his sentencing of Matthew Wilbur, a repeat drunk driver who struck and 
killed 13-year-old Jeff Martinez last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents are featured in the material, saying that Dutcher "freed" 
their son's killer, failed to take into account 2,000 signatures they had 
collected asking Dutcher to require bail for Wilbur and sentenced him to "one 
year actual jail time" even though the district attorney's office "demanded a 
stronger sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher's lawsuit says Lee's campaign knew those allegations were false. The 
mailers hurt his reputation and cost him a victory in the primary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't bend the truth -- they broke it, and they knew they broke it," 
Dutcher said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "These people have demonstrated in the past six months they just have a very 
low regard for truth, and I'm tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the suit are Bruce Bridgman, an attorney and campaign manager 
for the Committee to Elect Caryl Lee for Judge, and Linda Rovito, a member of 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher filed the suit Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court, also naming 
Jeff Martinez's parents, Ed and Gail Martinez. But an amended claim filed 
Wednesday no longer names the couple, and Dutcher said his attorney had 
included them against his wishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who edged Dutcher in the June primary's tightest judicial race by 38.1% 
to 38%, called Dutcher's suit "outrageous" and an "abridgment of the First 
Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilbur case is fair game for scrutiny during an election, added Jeff 
Adler, who heads Lee's campaign management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Filing a lawsuit like this in the heat of a campaign is an act of absolute 
cowardice and desperation," Adler said. "A judge's record is open to the public 
to review, and this was a case that even before the election was being 
questioned by members of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher's suit alleges that to have taken the Martinezes' petitions into 
consideration would have violated the California Code of Judicial Conduct, 
which bars judges from considering outside communications while a matter is 
pending before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher also said that the police, not he, had released Wilbur, and that the 
district attorney's office never objected to Wilbur's no-contest plea, as the 
Martinez mailer alleges. He also said that he sentenced Wilbur to two years in 
state prison, not one year in jail as the mailer suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said that, if nothing else, he hopes the lawsuit will keep the 
Martinez mailer out of the race as the runoff date nears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see that piece at the end of October," he said. "I'm really 
quite frankly more interested in stopping them from lying about me in the 
future than I am about enriching myself at their expense."

NEW WESTMINSTER CITY MANAGER TO ASSUME DUTIES IN SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Smith, currently city manager of Manhattan Beach, has been appointed 
Westminster city manager. He will assume the job on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council appointed Smith last week after a five-month search. He was 
picked from among four finalists to fill the position after Jerry Kenny retired 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley, who was hired when Kenny left, will 
remain until Smith begins, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major increase in responsibilities," said Smith, who will take over a 
city with a population of 81,000, compared to Manhattan Beach's 30,000. "But 
I've heard only good things about the city staff and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 54, said the current labor negotiations with the firefighters union and 
the municipal employees union are his immediate concerns, but "my intention is 
to come with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's friendly, not flamboyant, but easily established rapport with the 
members of the council," Mayor Charles V. Smith said. "We like his management 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, no relation to the mayor, is expected to sign a one-year contract that 
will pay him $9,166 a month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of New York, Smith spent 25 years in the Marine Corps before entering 
public administration in 1981. He had three tours of duty in Vietnam and was 
awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts for wounds 
suffered in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has a master's degree from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and a 
master's in public administration from Golden Gate University. He has been 
Manhattan Beach's city manager for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was city administrator of Sonora and assistant city manager of 
Monterey.

CITY TO EASE RULES FOR WINDOW SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a compromise move, the City Council has asked that a new city law be 
drafted on the amount of temporary signs allowed on storefront windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which is infrequently enforced, forbids stores to put signs on more 
than 10% of window space.A new city ordinance, scheduled to be introduced Aug. 
8, will allow stores to cover up to 50% of their windows with temporary signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise is aimed at cracking down on stores that cover virtually all 
window space with signs. It is also designed to help store owners who feel they 
need part of their windows for paper and cardboard signs advertising temporary 
sales.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue first surfaced in February, when some council members said that 
excessive signs make it easier for criminals to rob stores, unseen from the 
street.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Walter K. Bowman, however, said the council should not impede 
businesses. If store owners "feel it's a safety issue, they'll take the signs 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said at least half of the store windows should be available for 
temporary signs. 
</P>
<P>
 After some debate, others on the council agreed with him with a 5 to 0 vote.

JULY 4 MELEE CLAIM FILED AGAINST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Midway City man who contends he was struck in the head by a baton-wielding 
police officer before a disturbance broke out downtown on July 4 has filed a 
claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Luetto, an Orange attorney representing Jim King, 19, filed the claim 
this week with the city clerk's office on behalf of his client. King said 
Thursday that he received a cut on the left side of his face that required 15 
stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people were arrested July 4 in a melee downtown during which 
furniture was burned in the streets, illegal fireworks were set off and rocks 
and bottles were thrown at police and passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people have accused the Police Department of using excessive force. 
Lt. Jim Cutshaw said that as of Thursday, the Police Department had received 
eight complaints alleging misconduct by officers. The complaints are being 
investigated, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luetto said Thursday that he hopes his client's case can be resolved without 
having to file a lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously aren't interested in making this a high-visibility case," Luetto 
said. King is "interested in being compensated for the injuries that he 
suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 Luetto said he is pursuing a settlement for King's medical expenses and 
damages for pain and suffering. Luetto declined to specify the amount of 
monetary damages he will be seeking for his client. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he was hit twice with the baton and kicked in the buttocks by a 
police officer. He said he suffered a mild concussion and a bruised tailbone. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he was walking north on Main Street and leaving the downtown area as 
police moved through to clear the crowds. He says that police did not issue a 
warning to disperse the crowds and that he was not doing anything wrong or 
illegal to warrant being struck by an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that he was "feeling OK" but that the wound to his face left an ugly 
scar. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Clerk Kate Whitney said that a number of people have taken out 
claim forms regarding July 4 incidents but that King's claim is the only one 
that has been filed. An individual has six months from the date of an incident 
to file a claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 After a claim is filed with the city clerk's office, it is forwarded to the 
city's office of risk management to be reviewed, Whitney said. The city 
attorney's office also receives a copy of the claim. By state law, the city has 
45 days to accept or reject the claim, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing of a claim is the first step before the filing of a lawsuit.

LAGUNA COUNCIL OKS 'CONTAINER' LAW ; ORDINANCE: DOG-WALKERS WOULD HAVE TO CARRY 
SOMETHING THEY CAN USE TO CLEAN UP AFTER THEIR PETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vowing not to become the "container police," but determined to make pet owners 
more responsible, the City Council tentatively approved an ordinance Thursday 
forcing dog-walkers to carry containers for animal waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote came in response to ongoing complaints that dog feces 
litter the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're not going to be container police," Councilwoman Kathleen 
Blackburn said. "But I think it sends a message to people. They have to clean 
up after their dogs. It's disgusting. It really is." 
</P>
<P>
 A current city law already requires that pet owners clean up after their 
pooches, but Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said that ordinance is readily 
ignored by some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People complain about dog excretion on our beaches, on our sidewalks, in our 
parks -- just all over," Purcell said. Downtown, "you walk down Forest Avenue 
and you see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Karen Difede also encouraged the council to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pet owners hold in contempt our rights and think they have special 
privileges." 
</P>
<P>
 Purcell, who proposed the tougher law, maintains that dog-walkers will be more 
likely to tidy up after Rover if they are properly equipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would force residents to carry "a suitable wrapper, bag or 
container" whenever they walk their dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the stricter ordinance wins final approval Aug. 2, it would become 
effective the following month. In the meantime, the city will begin an 
education campaign to advise people that they will have to carry containers and 
keep them visible. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first few months, animal control officers will issue warnings before 
giving citations, Purcell said. Violation of the ordinance would be a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Blind people with guide dogs are exempt from the law.

SAN CLEMENTE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO LEWD ACTS WITH GIRL, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old San Clemente man who had been working as a high school coach and 
college instructor pleaded guilty Thursday to a count of committing lewd acts 
with a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement in South Municipal Court, Andrew Earl Malone was 
sentenced to three years' probation, 57 days on work furlough and 90 days of 
jail through a home electronic surveillance program, according to his lawyer, 
Paul Wallin. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, who had no prior criminal record, contended that the victim initially 
told him she was 18 years old, then 17, and that the brief relationship did not 
involve intercourse, Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrest in March, Malone has lost his job as a walk-on boys' 
basketball and baseball coach at San Clemente High School and as a part-time 
geology instructor at Saddleback College. "This is really a tremendous 
nightmare" for him, Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who does not attend San Clemente High School, told police 
investigators that she had sexual intercourse with Malone at his home in 
February, according to court records.

STUDENT SUES DEPUTY DIST. ATTY. WHO ALLEGEDLY DROVE INTO HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saddleback College student has filed a lawsuit against an Orange County 
deputy district attorney, alleging that she intentionally struck him with her 
van as he walked through a crowded campus parking lot last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stevens, 22, who said his knee was injured in the July 20, 1993, 
incident, is seeking unspecified damages from Kelly MacEachern and her husband, 
Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Connors, who is representing Stevens, said Thursday that his client 
is making a good recovery and that he is optimistic the suit will be settled 
out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing basketball again -- that was his big concern," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacEachern, a 12-year veteran of the Orange County district attorney's office, 
could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a South Orange County Municipal Court jury acquitted MacEachern 
of a misdemeanor charge of reckless driving in connection with the incident. 
The trial included two days of dramatically conflicting testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens testified that MacEachern hit him with her van while trying to get to 
a parking space and that she looked him in the eye as she drove forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, MacEachern denied hitting Stevens and said she did not see him until 
he was spread-eagled across the hood of her van and pounding on the windshield, 
then yelling that she had stolen the parking space from another driver. She had 
been taking three of her five children to swimming lessons.

BLOOD IS APPARENTLY FOUND IN STORAGE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators in the Denise Huber murder case have found what appears to be 
blood in an Orange County storage facility rented by suspected killer John J. 
Famalaro, and authorities believe the former Northridge woman may have been 
slain there, law enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were testing the substance to see if it indeed is blood, and to 
determine if it matches Huber's, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, the Yavapai County Grand Jury indicted Famalaro on first-degree 
murder and theft charges Thursday, making him eligible for the death penalty. 
He was arrested July 13 after Huber's body was found in a freezer at Famalaro's 
Arizona country club home. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe picked up pace in Orange County, where law enforcement sources and 
the manager of the Laguna Hills storage facility confirmed they have found what 
appeared to be evidence of bloodstains in the storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber, 23 -- whose family moved to Orange County after living for many years 
in the San Fernando Valley -- vanished three years ago in Costa Mesa, after her 
car blew a tire as she headed home to Newport Beach from a concert. Her nude 
and handcuffed body was found last week in a freezer outside Famalaro's home, 
about 75 miles north of Phoenix. She had suffered multiple blows to the head, 
and her eyes and mouth were covered with cloth and sealed with duct tape, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other significant developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Court documents filed in Arizona revealed numerous additional items seized 
from Famalaro's home and vehicles in recent days, including a black whip, a 
micro-cassette marked "Save, important," multiple audiotapes whose contents 
were unknown and a brown paper sack with two keys and a pubic hair. Earlier 
searches have unearthed a crowbar and claw hammer that appear to be bloodied, 
strips of white cloth and a tarpaulin, also stained with a red substance, and 
items belonging to Huber, including clothing, jewelry and a purse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contacted by telephone, some of six additional women whose names were found 
in subsequent searches of Famalaro's belongings said they had no clue as to how 
Famalaro came into possession of their effects. "Good God! Even my middle 
initial," said Donna R. Evinger, 57, of Tustin. "I'm pretty shook up. . . . I'm 
alive, I can say that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Joining newly appointed defense counsel Thomas K. Kelly was Warren R. 
Darrow, an attorney who Kelly said is a distant relative of famed defense 
lawyer Clarence Darrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * A team of investigators from Orange County, including chief forensic 
pathologist Richard Fukumoto and other crime scene specialists, were preparing 
to travel to Arizona today to meet with their counterparts there. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Clow, property manager for the Laguna Hills storage facility, said 
police have been conducting forensic tests inside a unit that had been leased 
to Famalaro from February, 1991, to September, 1992. Huber disappeared June 3, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've pulled up the carpet, searching for blood and hair," said Clow, who 
has discussed the case with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were said to be using high-tech devices and a chemical called 
luminol that enhances blood and other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 John Conley, an Orange County assistant district attorney, confirmed Thursday 
that investigators have focused on a possible Orange County murder scene linked 
to Famalaro. He declined to discuss where that site was, but said investigators 
have been examining the location for the past several days, trying to determine 
if Huber was slain there. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said that "should the murder scene be proven to have been in Orange 
County, we could have jurisdiction" and try Famalaro there, instead of in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberating secretly in Prescott, Ariz., the grand jury heard testimony from 
Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher before returning an indictment on 
murder and a felony grand theft count alleging Famalaro stole the Ryder rental 
truck that contained Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Mascher testified in a lengthy bail hearing that several former 
girlfriends of Famalaro had told investigators they had been threatened or felt 
threatened by him. One woman said she had been knocked down and handcuffed by 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned August 1 
in Yavapai County Superior Court.

3-YEAR-OLD HURT AT RESEDA HOME IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING; FEUD: POLICE SAY THE SHOTS 
WERE INTENDED FOR THE CHILD'S MOTHER, WHO ACCORDING TO A FRIEND HAD ENGAGED IN 
DISPUTE WITH SUSPECT.

<P>
 An ongoing dispute between neighbors escalated into a drive-by shooting 
Thursday in which shots intended for a mother wounded her 3-year-old daughter, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 1:15 p.m. at the victim's residence, Saticoy Plaza, 
in the 17800 block of Saticoy Street when a truck carrying three adults and two 
young children stopped nearby, according to a 15-year-old eyewitness who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 As the passengers in the cab leaned forward, the driver, identified by 
authorities as Juan Manolo Cienfuegos, fired four or five shots from a handgun 
at Eileen Cortez, 21, the child's mother, said Lt. George Rock of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez was not struck by the gunfire, but one of the shots hit her child, 
Vanessa Barcenas, in the left shoulder, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa was in UCLA Medical Center in stable condition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours after the shooting, Los Angeles police arrested Cienfuegos and 
Christina Stevens, 21, who was identified as a passenger, at an undisclosed 
location in the Sunland-Tujunga area, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The truck and gun used in the attack have not been recovered, Rock said. A 
witness at the scene identified Cienfuegos as the person who shot the gun, Rock 
said. Police are still seeking the third adult who was in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Anaya, a friend who sometimes stays with Cortez, said that the 
firing continued as she and others tried to remove the child from the line of 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was recently evicted from the 16-unit building, and Anaya said that 
Stevens and Cortez had engaged in a long-running feud. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa was transported by ambulance to a waiting Los Angeles Fire Department 
helicopter at Van Nuys Airport and airlifted to UCLA Medical Center, said Brian 
Humphrey, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 She was admitted to the hospital, but her wound was not "life threatening," 
said Warren Robak, a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour of the shooting, the front yard outside the apartment building 
was filled with children gathered around a bank of television crews at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing that he is in custody and off the street if he is willing 
to open fire in an area where there are kids and when there are kids in the bed 
of his pickup truck when he does it," Rock said of Cienfuegos.

CRITICS HISS OVER ASTEROID NAMED AFTER FINDER'S CAT; ASTRONOMY: A SHORTAGE OF 
RELEVANT MONIKERS LEADS MANY COSMOS WATCHERS TO IMPROVISE. BUT SOME SAY THIS 
GOES TOO FAR.

 A cat. A Vulcan. And an asteroid. Mix them together and you have a controversy 
of cosmic proportions brewing around James Gibson, a planetary scientist from 
Tujunga who has become the target of scientific ire for naming an asteroid 
after his late cat, Mr. Spock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that there would probably be some flak for it, but we didn't expect 
it to go this far," said Gibson, 66, who chose the name in 1985 with the help 
of his wife. He could have done far worse, he argued. "I let the whole universe 
of tasteless names go unaddressed." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 300 asteroids named every year, scientists are running out of 
names, and turning to those of political dissidents, musicians and even 
mistresses. That has irritated some members of the international astronomy 
group that registers such names, setting off a debate in the letters columns of 
astronomy journals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler can't get one named after him until 2045 (there is a century-long 
moratorium from the time of death on naming asteroids after military or 
political figures), but otherwise the rules are limited: an asteroid that could 
eradicate all life on Earth -- something the size of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 
9, which has been pounding Jupiter all week -- could be named Dudu (Asteroid 
564). Or it could even be named after a peace-loving Beatle (Asteroids 4147 to 
4150 are named for John, Paul, George and Ringo). 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibson's naming of Asteroid 2309 after his marble gray tabby, who kept him 
company at an isolated mountaintop observatory in Argentina, was apparently the 
last straw. In 1985, a review panel at the International Astronomical Union 
passed a resolution discouraging such pet names. 
</P>
<P>
 And, following the written debates in the journals, some scientists expect the 
issue may come hurtling back into view at the IAU meeting next month in 
Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules that now regulate such names are "not entirely satisfactory," 
concedes Brian Marsden, who serves on the IAU's Minor Planet Names Committee. 
"It can get silly. But you have to have a sense of humor in this business." 
Marsden, putting that philosophy into practice, supported the application to 
name 2309 for Spock the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gehrels, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who 
coordinates the Spacewatch search for asteroids that may collide with the 
earth, is anti-Spock, saying the choice "has hurt (astronomy) enough that the 
committee will not allow it to happen again."  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe most asteroids are rocky space chunks ranging from the size 
of a house to the city of San Fernando -- cosmic debris left over from the 
solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Asteroids are first given numbers upon their discovery. After their orbits 
have been confirmed in subsequent sightings by other astronomers, the 
discoverer has 10 years to assign a name, Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, 6,057 asteroids have been discovered hurtling through the solar 
system and about 4,600 of them have been named, said Marsden, who also serves 
as director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Mass. The names are 
registered by being published in the Minor Planets Circulars edited at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden said obvious names like Copernicus, Galileo and other famous 
astronomers have already been taken. "It does make things rather difficult when 
it comes to naming things," Marsden said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, however, is happy with the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson -- an astronomer for 36 years who previously named asteroids after his 
wife, Ursula, and his hometown of Ellensburg, Wash. -- submitted the name in 
part to reaffirm that asteroids should be named after those who have made 
helpful, significant or unusual contributions to astronomy. His late cat 
qualifies, he said, but some other personal choices do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with people who name objects after the seven 
astronauts who went down in Challenger," Gibson said. "But to name an asteroid 
for a granddaughter who isn't out of the crib yet, that's a little extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spock -- so named in part because his pointy ears resembled those of the 
"Star Trek" TV series Vulcan -- deserves to be immortalized in the heavens for 
his services to astronomy by keeping Gibson company on his lonely work of 
watching the sky, Gibson figures. The tabby was often Gibson's only companion 
on moonlit walks to the lonely observatory he worked at from 1971 to 1974 in 
Argentina.  
</P>
<P>
 It was in that observatory that he discovered Asteroid 2309 in 1971, which he 
would name after Mr. Spock in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great cat," said Gibson, recalling the nights when the friendly 
feline would spend hours outside the observatory dome waiting for him, or 
entertain the couple in their home. "He had done more for us than some people 
(that) asteroids are being named after now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spock died in 1985, shortly after the space rock was named for him. And 
Gibson has gone on to become a research assistant at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, scientists hope that the controversy over what to name asteroids is 
settled soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At next month's IAU General Assembly of 3,000 astronomers, Marsden said he 
expects to pitch a simpler idea: allowing a computer to invent names by 
randomly grouping several melodic vowels and consonants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name won't make any sense to anybody," Marsden said. "But at least it 
will sound good."

BIT OF COUNTRY; FAIR UNDER WAY WITH RIDES, ENTERTAINMENT AND ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Kimberly Keeble grasps her hen's legs and tries to control the flopping turkey 
on the judging table. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old Sun Valley girl's only competition in the preliminary round of 
the San Fernando Valley Fair's junior livestock competition on Thursday are her 
older brother and sister. And this dream of becoming a fowl champion got her up 
early every morning to feed her brood, which also includes a lamb and a pig, at 
her family's small ranch near La Tuna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But hard work and determination were not enough -- her older sister won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to win because they are always mean to me," she said, glancing 
toward her siblings with a mischievous grin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keeble children are a rare breed at the city of Los Angeles' largest fair 
-- which began Thursday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank -- 
where more attention is paid to the fast rides, the science exhibits and the 
ethnic food than to the quality of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither are the Keebles immune to big-city attractions. After the 
competition, Kimberly's 14-year-old brother, Scott, ran out of the stable yard 
with this parting shot: "I'm not staying around here all day. I'm putting my 
lamb away, and I'm going on the rides." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, which is in its 48th year, features live music, a rodeo, carnival 
rides, pig races and an auction and lasts until Sunday. About 4,000 people 
showed up for opening-day ceremonies Thursday, including busloads of children 
from schools and day-care centers who came because it was Youth and Senior Day, 
when children under the age of 15 and seniors over 55 were admitted free. 
</P>
<P>
 City dwellers like Michelle Yeung, 5, who arrived with her dad and two 
schoolmates from Northridge, came to enjoy the rides and entertainment, 
including a clown who painted a white bunny on Michelle's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, it sparkles," she told her friends, who gathered around to examine each 
other's drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my turn to baby-sit, and I knew there would be a lot of things to do 
here," said Michelle's father, William, as he opened up his wallet to give the 
girls a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Fair board is banking on many more people following 
William Yeung's example, helping the fair get back on its feet after three lean 
years. Fair officials expect to pay off an estimated $300,000 deficit with 
revenue from this year's fair, and they have begun negotiations to make the 
Equestrian Center its permanent site, which they believe is crucial for a 
money-making fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-existing horse arena, animal stables and exhibit facilities at the 
Equestrian Center have allowed extensive savings from previous rental costs, 
fair officials said. And for the first time in the fair's history, the horse 
show -- to be held all day Saturday at the center's Equidome -- will be held on 
fair grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime fair aficionados seemed to approve of the new digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting under a shady tree, 59-year Valley resident Bob McCloskey and his wife 
recalled the fair's past moves while also keeping their grandsons from dripping 
ketchup down their T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to this fair when it was at Devonshire Downs every year, and then when 
it moved to Lake View Terrace (at Hansen Dam)," said McCloskey, 71, of Pacoima. 
"I have brought my kids here for years, and this is so much more improvement 
here. It is a much better location."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE LAUNCHES NEW SYSTEM FOR POOL 
SANITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goodby to those hallmarks of summers poolside: the stale, chlorine aftertaste 
from swimming; the chemical odor on your drying skin; the red eyes, the green 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, I hate chlorine," said Jennifer Hans, a West Hills mother of two boys 
who swim at the Pierce College pool. "So do my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boys' favorite swimming hole this week became the first public pool in Los 
Angeles County to convert to a revolutionary sanitation system that leaves 
water relatively chemical-free. 
</P>
<P>
 It uses ozone, a product of oxygen, to purify the pool water and a small 
amount of bromine, a relative of chlorine, to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County health officials are studying the newly installed equipment 
at Pierce as a test case for the possible elimination of chlorine in all large, 
public pools someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a clearer, crisper water," said Richard Kebabjian, chief of the 
recreational health program for the county Department of Health Services. "And 
there's no problem with it, in terms of safety. The unit is very expensive, 
though, so it probably isn't practical for smaller pools." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, a group of swimmers at Pierce won a $73,000 grant from the 
state to convert the pool from a gas-based chlorine system, which is generally 
considered less reliable than other methods of purification. Most pools use 
liquid or powdered chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pierce, which has the largest outdoor pool in the West Valley, the switch 
delighted many afternoon swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the water six hours a day, so I'm used to going home smelling like 
chlorine," said Kelley Royer, a swim instructor and lifeguard at the pool. 
"This is great. It's like normal water." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like drinking water," said Pierce swimming coach Fred Shaw, mimicking a 
wine taster as he took a sip of pool water. "Tastes good, kind of sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the ozone-bromine system is the latest in a string of 
victories for Friends of Pierce Pool, a swimmers group that formed in 1993 in 
an attempt to keep the beleaguered facility open. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the grant for the sanitation system, the group has raised more than 
$50,000 in cash and donated equipment for crucial repairs that the college 
could not afford. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; TART EXCHANGES MARK RETRIAL OF BABY-SITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Displaying emotions that ranged from tears to bristling hostility, baby-sitter 
and former PTA President Deborah Suzanne Cummings vehemently denied Thursday in 
Van Nuys Superior Court that she hurt a 9-month-old boy under her care. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cummings said, "I consider myself one of the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, charged with second-degree murder in the June, 1990, death of Kevin 
Young, wore a baby-pink jacket and floral skirt on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never hurt Kevin," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But her demure appearance offered a counterpoint to the tension of the 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you get angry with Kevin on June 15 because he vomited in your neat, tidy 
house? Did you lose your temper?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch asked. "Did 
you hit him with a frying pan?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings spat back: "I did not hit him with a frying pan, Miss Fisch. I did 
not slam him against a wall. You do not harm a child for vomiting or spilling 
food from the highchair or missing the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, a former Reseda resident, is being retried on second-degree murder 
charges after a jury deadlocked two years ago in favor of acquittal. Most of 
the retrial has focused on expert medical testimony about the boy's injuries, 
although it also featured emotional testimony from Kevin's mother, who 
tearfully recalled driving him to the hospital the day he died. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Cummings burst into tears at the sight of the investigating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That man handcuffed me," she wailed, complaining that the prosecution was 
trying to intimidate her with his presence.  
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by defense attorney Tamar Rachel Toister, Cummings said she 
had grown attached to Kevin while she cared for him. She said she called the 
hospital to check on his welfare, and inquired about his funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 She wept softly recalling how she learned she would be arrested for Kevin's 
death when her lawyer left a message on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings testified that Kevin seemed "gray' that Thursday and Friday and had 
been vomiting on and off for about two weeks. On Friday, she said, she was in 
the kitchen when she heard "a noise." She said Kevin had a bump on his head, 
but she didn't consider his injury "an emergency situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch, in her cross-examination, exposed contradicting testimony about details 
of the case that Cummings has given during her two trials and under questioning 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at times she said she didn't put ice on Kevin's head. But on 
Thursday she testified that she clearly recalled she had, using a washcloth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of my pretty washcloths and I never got it returned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At her previous trial, Cummings testified that Kevin had watched "The Little 
Mermaid," but on Thursday, she testified that he was watching "Dumbo" and 
"Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been four years, Miss Fisch. A Disney animated film is a Disney animated 
film -- 'Dumbo,' 'Pinocchio,' 'The Little Mermaid.' Let's get to the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch responded: "Would it refresh your recollection if I told you 'Pinocchio' 
wasn't released in video until March, 1993?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a copy of 'Pinocchio,' thank you," Cummings said. ANN W. O'NEILL

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMPUTER MAY HAVE CAUSED MAIL DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Postal officials said Thursday a computer glitch may have caused Valleywide 
mail delays for thousands of people who were having their mail forwarded 
between July 5 and July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Such computer problems are extremely rare, postal officials said, and there 
usually are backups when they do occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide computerized forwarding system was updated less than two years 
ago to make it faster and more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But mail delays are particularly devastating six months after the Northridge 
earthquake. Many people -- especially San Fernando Valley residents -- forced 
out of their homes are still living in temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Jan. 17 temblor, the Van Nuys facility forwarded 80,000 pieces of 
mail a day. That volume is now up to 106,000 pieces a day, a 33% increase. The 
facility has been staffed around the clock since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent computer problems may have affected Valley residents who were 
forwarding mail from addresses in the 91300 to 91699 ZIP code area, which 
includes among other communities, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Van Nuys and Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Local post office branches began having trouble delivering forwarded mail to 
new addresses when a mainframe computer at the Van Nuys forwarding unit crashed 
July 5. The unit serves postal branches throughout the San Fernando Valley, 
which deliver mail to 672,000 homes and businesses each day. 
</P>
<P>
 It took postal workers at the Van Nuys facility until July 12 to reload 
forwarding addresses that had been dropped from the system when the crash 
occurred, said Terry Bouffiou, spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Service in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 During that week, some forwarded mail may have been delayed a couple of days. 
It should all have been delivered by now, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou stressed that mail forwarded while the Van Nuys unit was impaired was 
not lost. The forwarding addresses are in the system now. Everyone's mail is 
being forwarded, and no one should be experiencing any problems, Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however, that anyone who thinks their mail is being delayed should 
call the station manager of their local post office branch. 
</P>
<P>
 When people notify their local post office branch that they are moving, the 
branch forwards their first-class mail and packages, as well as anything sent 
parcel post, for a full year, Bouffiou said. Bulk-rate mail, such as 
advertising flyers, is not forwarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwarding addresses remain in the computer system for 18 months and then are 
purged, said Bouffiou. Local mail carriers are also supposed to keep a record 
of forwarding addresses for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 20% of all Americans move every year, Bouffiou said. "If we kept 
all of that forwarding information any longer, no system would be big enough to 
handle it." JILL BETTNER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; ALARCON UNVEILS PLAN TO IMPROVE STREET LIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a back alley that just a few months ago was a gang stronghold, City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon unveiled a plan Thursday morning to light the 
darkened streets of his district, which he describes as one of the most poorly 
lighted in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever you turn the lights on, the criminal flees," said Valley Deputy 
Police Chief Martin Pomeroy, who joined Alarcon in the press conference to 
announce the project, "Operation Lights On." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon and other Los Angeles officials laid out the plan to install and 
upgrade scores of lights in the next two months and potentially bring thousands 
more street lights to Alarcon's district in the future. Alarcon's district 
includes the northeast Valley as well as parts of Sun Valley and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials promised to have 16 street lights added and five others 
upgraded by Oct. 1 on the standard city system that provides uninterrupted 
light along major streets. They also promised another 60 "utilitarian" lights 
throughout the district, which would be installed in alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilitarian lights are smaller and easier to install on telephone poles, city 
officials said. They also promised to upgrade another 85 of the utilitarian 
lights already installed in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon gave special thanks to Minor E. Jimenez, a Foothill Division senior 
lead officer who brought to his attention how inadequate street lighting is 
connected to crime when.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I noticed was that the majority of crimes we were having 
were in the late afternoon and evening hours," Jimenez said. In this particular 
alley, between Amboy and Rincon streets, just off Van Nuys Boulevard, the 
territory had been tightly controlled by two neighborhood gangs as recently as 
seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But by using community policing tactics, Jimenez was able to turn the alley 
around, getting pay phones that had attracted drug dealers pulled out, 
persuading neighbors to help paint over graffiti and getting the utilitarian 
light installed on a telephone pole in the middle of the alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gang members, by their attire, by their walk, by their graffiti, are sending 
out a message," Jimenez said. "We have to send a message out to them that we 
are not going to tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
 George Eslinger, director of the bureau of street lighting in the Department 
of Public Works, said the number of lights in the 7th Council District had been 
low in the past because "there had never been an expression of interest" in 
lighting, which is not a mandated service. 
</P>
<P>
 Only recently have residents started to push for more and better lighting as a 
way of improving their neighborhoods and fighting crime, Eslinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding for the new lighting is still unclear, however. Alarcon has 
included private help in his effort to light streets. For example, his office 
was able to get a developer for a project in Sylmar to agree to put in lighting 
on nearby Hubbard Street even though it does not directly affect their project 
but does illuminate a darkened street.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials are also trying to put together funding from a variety of 
federal sources, including the recently approved Los Angeles Neighborhood 
Initiative Project, which targets improvements to a neighborhood in Sun Valley, 
and empowerment zones that would help improve part of Pacoima. But some of the 
costs to maintain the lighting may have to be paid through assessment 
districts.  
</P>
<P>
 Eslinger said the bureau of lighting will be using two new anti-vandalism 
crews to repair damaged lights and make improvements to prevent further damage, 
including bullet-resistant shields and steel plating to protect wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to work on this until every single street is lighted," Alarcon 
said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; VAUGHN SCHOOL BUYS PARCEL FOR EXPANSION

 In their continuing efforts to expand the campus, Vaughn charter school 
officials bought a nearly 8,000-square-foot property Thursday for $132,000. 
Escrow will open Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, the San Fernando Valley's first charter school, is seeking to build 12 
classrooms, extra rooms for counselors and restrooms on two properties. The 
school already bought a smaller parcel adjacent to the new land for $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the new property at 13253 Eustace St. were asking $169,000. Vaughn 
Principal Yvonne Chan, who announced in the spring that the school has saved 
$1.2 million in its first year as a charter campus, said she believes both 
sides were flexible and agreed on a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion, Chan said, "will change the whole look of the school. We'll 
landscape it beautifully. With two properties, we can get more space for our 
teachers and our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima school is the first in the Los Angeles Unified School District to 
buy land and build classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Chan said she would like to switch from a multitrack year-round 
system to a more traditional school calendar. The additional classrooms will 
enable all teachers to have their own classrooms and reduce the need for 
sharing space. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan also said she would like to create a special academic program at the 
school for urban studies -- similar to a magnet -- but the campus first needs 
the additional space. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the charter school law, campuses operate independently from school 
districts and are allowed to seek waivers of state and federal laws. BETH

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WILSON SIGNS MOBILE HOME 'TIE-DOWN' BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson this week signed a bill requiring new mobile homes in 
California to be tied to the ground, in an effort to help prevent the type of 
wreckage at mobile home parks experienced during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill will help reduce the damage and destruction that occurs to mobile 
homes during earthquakes," said Wilson, who signed the bill late Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which takes effect 60 days after signing, requires all new or 
relocated mobile homes to be fastened to the ground with a system of 
"tie-downs" used in high-wind regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile homes installed before the law takes effect will not be required to be 
fixed to the ground. That provision helped gain support for the bill from 
mobile home owners, many of whom are senior citizens living on fixed incomes 
who had long opposed required safety devices because of the costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10% of the 51,062 mobile homes in Los Angeles County parks were 
rendered uninhabitable within seconds of the Jan. 17 earthquake, most of which 
were jolted from their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 184 burned to the ground in fires fueled by gas lines ruptured when 
the homes shifted from their supports. One blaze resulted in the death of a 
92-year-old Chatsworth woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, more than 1,700 of the severely damaged mobile homes are 
still considered unlivable, according to the California Department of Housing 
and Community Development. KURT PITZER

SUSPECT REARRAIGNED IN 1990 PARK SLAYING; CRIME: NATHANIEL BLALOCK AND DUNCAN 
MARTINEZ ARE ACCUSED IN THE KILLING OF THEIR ROOMMATE, RONALD BAKER. 
</P>

<P>
 The case of a UCLA student whose mangled corpse was discovered more than four 
years ago at a Chatsworth park inched closer to justice Thursday when a former 
Van Nuys man was rearraigned on murder charges and authorities forged forward 
with attempts to have a second suspect extradited from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Blalock, 26, who pleaded not guilty last June to a count of murder 
with the special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait, was rearraigned 
Thursday on an additional special-circumstance allegation of committing murder 
for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-circumstance allegations allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty 
against a defendant in murder cases. However, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls 
said that based on the facts of the case and Blalock's history, her office 
instead would seek a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility 
of parole. She would not elaborate on the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Blalock and co-defendant Duncan Martinez, 24, are accused in the knife slaying 
of their roommate, Ronald Baker, a 21-year-old UCLA astrophysics major whose 
body was found in June, 1990, near a railroad tunnel in Chatsworth Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have stated in court documents they believe Blalock killed Baker 
during a kidnap attempt designed to extort money from Baker's parents, but they 
have declined in interviews to specify what role Martinez played in the 
killing. A grand jury indicted both men. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who helped police unravel the case against Blalock and ultimately 
himself, is fighting extradition from Salt Lake City, Utah, on charges 
identical to those against Blalock, police said. Ingalls said her office has 
not made a decision whether to seek the death penalty against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Baker, who had been stabbed 18 times and whose head was nearly 
severed, initially prompted detectives to investigate whether his exploration 
of the occult had somehow gotten him killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, slender youth with curly blond hair frequently meditated in the 
railroad tunnel, which had been the scene of occult activities and purported 
animal sacrifices, police said. Police got a break in the case when an attorney 
representing Martinez contacted them in February of last year and arranged a 
meeting during which Martinez discussed the night of Baker's death and events 
which he said followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez also agreed to tape three conversations with Blalock that police 
later used to confront Blalock and get a taped confession of the stabbing from 
him. Blalock also told detectives during the conversation that the kidnap and 
extortion plot was Martinez's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had at one time considered charging Martinez with lesser counts or 
using him as a witness at Blalock's trial because he had cooperated with 
authorities. However, Ingalls said, her office decided to seek murder charges 
against Martinez based on the role they believe he played in Baker's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was obviously very active in this case," Ingalls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who eulogized Baker at his funeral, was working as a waiter and 
attending the University of Utah at the time of his arrest. He is being held at 
a Salt Lake City jail, pending extradition to Los Angeles County where he is 
expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and Blalock had moved into a Van Nuys apartment in January, 1990, 
that Ron Baker's parents had helped their son rent the previous month, 
according to Katherine Baker, the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said her son had met Martinez, who would join the Baker family for 
birthdays, during his freshman year of college when they both worked at Sears, 
Roebuck & Co., and that they later shared a West Hollywood apartment for about 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's proper that they (Blalock and Martinez) are both being charged 
because it's clear they were both involved," she said in an interview Thursday.

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN 1980 LYE ATTACK; CRIME: RICARDO ROBINSON WAS 
ALLEGEDLY RECRUITED IN A PLOT TO DISFIGURE THE VICTIM, A LAW STUDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After acting as his own lawyer in a retrial that rekindled memories of an 
excruciating death 14 years ago, Ricardo H. Robinson was convicted of 
first-degree murder in a 1980 lye attack on an aspiring lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the murder conviction, the eight women and four men on the jury also 
found Robinson guilty of mayhem, conspiracy and assault for attacking Patricia 
Worrell with a caustic chemical. The jurors, who deliberated for two days, 
declined to talk about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patricia Worrell can finally rest in peace," prosecutor Robert L. Cohen said. 
"I'm happy there's some closure for her friends and relatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, formerly of Las Vegas, faces 25 years to life in prison when Judge 
Michael Harwin sentences him Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's trial featured gruesome testimony about law student Worrell's fatal 
injuries and appearances by Robinson's two co-defendants. One implicated him, 
the other tried to clear him. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson denied any role in the attack during his own testimony and claimed he 
was framed. But the jury was ordered to disregard Robinson's testimony after he 
refused to answer Cohen's questions under cross-examination.  
</P>
<P>
 Worrell's son, William, who was 13 when his mother died, and other prosecution 
witnesses identified Robinson as the man who threw the lye. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, Richard Morton Gilman, Worrell's fellow law student 
and jilted fiance, hired a Las Vegas pimp named Bobby Ray Savage to disfigure 
her when she refused to return an engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage in turn recruited Robinson, who, according to witnesses, threw the 
quart of lye in Worrell's face when she answered a knock on the door of her 
Sylmar home on Aug. 14, 1980. Gilman was inside the house at the time of the 
attack and drove her to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The lye blinded and disfigured Worrell, and continued to burn her flesh. She 
died 10 days after the attack when the caustic chemical ate through her 
esophagus and an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman promised Savage and Robinson $2,500 but paid them only $750 for the 
attack, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying for the prosecution, Savage said Robinson threw the lye. Testifying 
for the defense, Gilman denied hiring Savage to disfigure Worrell, or ever 
meeting Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's 1982 conviction was overturned two years ago after an appeals court 
ruled that his confession to the crime was obtained illegally. Robinson had 
asked for a lawyer but wasn't provided one before he implicated himself in his 
statement to police.

SUSPECT IN SHOOTING TURNS HIMSELF IN; INVESTIGATION: REWARD AND RELEASE OF 
PHOTO ARE CITED BY POLICE IN THE SURRENDER OF THE WOODLAND HILLS MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Woodland Hills man suspected of killing an innocent bystander in a shooting 
last month turned himself in to police Thursday, two days after police released 
his name and photograph and a $25,000 reward was posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaveliaee Hammond, 20, walked into the Los Angeles Police Department's Van 
Nuys station at 3:30 a.m. accompanied by his mother and told police, "I'm Lil 
Man," according to Detective Dan O'Hanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, whose street name is "Lil Man," is scheduled to be arraigned today 
for murder and an unrelated robbery charge. He is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we put too much pressure on him to stay out," O'Hanian said, 
referring to the public plea for help and the reward posted by the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been looking for Hammond ever since the June 11 fatal shooting of 
Renee Hurtado, 21, outside a Panorama City convenience store at the corner of 
Van Nuys Boulevard and Plummer Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado had just made a purchase at the store and had returned to her car 
where her daughter, sister-in-law and niece were waiting. As Hurtado put her 
daughter on her lap, gunfire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stray bullets pierced through the windshield. The shots missed the little 
girl, but one struck Hurtado in the chest. She later died at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that Hammond was shooting at a group of men who were behind 
Hurtado's car in a dispute over who could sell drugs on that corner. The men 
apparently were unarmed and did not shoot back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, O'Hanian said that Hammond, believed to be a gang member, told police 
that the shooting had nothing to do with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the other guys were talking gang stuff to him and he felt he had to 
do something," O'Hanian said.

DEPUTIES CLOSE REGION'S ONLY EXOTIC DANCE CLUB OVER PERMITS; INQUIRY: COUNTY 
OFFICIALS LEARNED CASTAIC JUNCTION LACKS APPROVAL TO OFFER FOOD OR 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Young women clad in bikinis and lingerie were sent scrambling for their street 
clothes Thursday when sheriff's deputies shut down the Santa Clarita Valley's 
only exotic dance club because it does not have the necessary county permits. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint by a resident about Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club, which 
opened June 30, prompted an investigation early this month into the 
establishment's permits, said Dwight Andersen, assistant division manager for 
the Los Angeles County Department of Treasurer -- Tax Collector.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, inspectors discovered the club did not have its food license 
allowing it to function as a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than menus met the eye at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became aware after that there was more going on there than public eating," 
he said. "We said, 'Wait a minute, you didn't say anything about dancers. You 
need a license for entertainment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The club's owner, Stuart Cadwell, has been warned repeatedly not to operate 
the club until he obtains the food and entertainment licenses, Andersen said. 
Cadwell has applied for both, but approval is pending, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station accompanied a county 
investigator to Castaic Junction, at the Golden State Freeway and California 
126 in Castaic, at about 2:30 p.m. Thursday, said Lt. Barbara Persten.  
</P>
<P>
 Lunch was being served and dancers were performing when deputies ordered the 
club to be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees did not resist deputies' orders and no citations were issued, 
Persten said. However, she said, misdemeanor charges for operating the business 
without the appropriate licenses will be sought against Cadwell and Richard 
Saunders, a manager at the club, through the Los Angeles district attorney's 
office  
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell and Saunders could not be reached Thursday for comment. However, 
another manager at the club said the business will reopen as soon as the 
permits are obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got too much at stake," he said. "We don't just want to pack up and 
walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment license will probably be the most time-consuming because a 
public hearing is required first, Andersen said. He said a hearing date has not 
been set and it will take at least another month to decide the license's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval is anything but a sure bet. Castaic Junction has generated 
controversy ever since its opening night June 30, when it featured nude dancers 
in an alcohol-free setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's landlord, Newhall Land and Farming Co., went to court and 
obtained a restraining order the next day prohibiting nude dancing. The company 
claimed that it had been misled about the type of entertainment the club would 
offer, and that its lease prohibits "lewd or offensive" entertainment. No 
hearing date has been set on the restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents have also complained to Newhall Land and county officials 
that the club is inappropriate for a family oriented community. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers have been wearing bikinis and similar clothing since the restraining 
order was obtained, but Cadwell has indicated he will have to serve alcohol to 
ensure financial survival while the legal battles are being fought. He also 
said attendance has been good. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials said they are hoping to close the club or force it to 
become a "first-class" restaurant suitable for family dining.

CHURCH TO MARK 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's oldest Roman Catholic church will celebrate its 50th anniversary 
Saturday with a Mass by Cardinal Roger Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mass will be attended by former priests who led services at Our Lady of 
Perpetual Help Church in Newhall more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong service will be at 5:30 p.m. at the church, 23233 Lyons Ave., 
said Father Patrick Power, the church priest. A reception will follow in the 
parish hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight priests who taught at the church as far back as 1961 will attend, he 
said. In addition, high-ranking members of the Catholic fraternal organization, 
the Knights of Columbus, will serve as ushers and lecturers during the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-page yearbook highlighting the parish's 50 years in the Santa Clarita 
Valley will be sold for $6 following services Saturday and Sunday.

CITY OFFERING $75,000 TO NONPROFIT GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although faced with a tight fiscal budget that includes few new programs and 
no cost-of-living raises for city employees, Santa Clarita once again is 
offering $75,000 in grants for nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Community Services Grant Program was established in 1990 and has 
been offered annually -- except in 1992.During that year, the funds were used 
for recreation activities at the Santa Clarita Valley Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit organizations that can show a benefit to the city and demonstrate 
financial need are eligible for a grant. 
</P>
<P>
 A workshop is scheduled at 8:30 a.m. July 29 at City Hall, 23920 Valencia 
Blvd., to assist agencies with grant applications. The deadline to apply for a 
grant is 5 p.m. Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to equitably distribute the funds, the city will solicit 
applications and proposals from a variety of agencies in the Santa Clarita 
Valley," said Rick Putnam, city director of Parks, Recreation and Community 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Past awards have included $5,000 for the Assn. to Aid Victims of Domestic 
Violence for a family violence protection project, $5,000 to the Santa Clarita 
Valley Boys & Girls Club for after-school programs at two campuses, $3,000 to 
the Samuel Dixon Family Health Center for expanded service hours, and $2,500 to 
the Santa Clarita Valley Food Pantry for computers.

OUTGOING SUPERINTENDENT STILL FACES TOUGH ISSUES; EDUCATION: WALTER SWANSON'S 
RESIGNATION COMES AS HART DISTRICT DEALS WITH QUAKE DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Walter Swanson's resignation as superintendent of the William S. Hart Union 
High School District will probably take effect in early September, giving him 
enough time to help the district with major upcoming projects, school officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson, 50, surprised colleagues by announcing last week that he was leaving 
the district to accept a similar position in Missouri.His resignation comes 
when the district is struggling to recover from earthquake damage, balance a 
drastically underfunded budget and open two new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal agreement has been reached with the district's board of trustees 
that will allow him to leave Sept. 2, Swanson said. The agreement has to be 
formally approved by the board, which could occur at its Aug. 10 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be here basically to complete all of the preparations for the beginning 
of the school year, but I probably will not be here for the new year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board hopes to find a replacement for Swanson within 90 days of his 
departure, but that is by no means guaranteed, said board member John Hassel. 
He said the search probably will be conducted by a personnel agency hired by 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson will become the superintendent of the Cass R-IX School District in 
Harrisonville, a suburb south of Kansas City. He said he grew up in that area 
and much of his family is still there. 
</P>

 The Cass district has about 3,000 students, compared to 11,500 in the Hart 
district. But Swanson said the opportunity for growth and new programs is 
abundant, and Missouri schools are not facing the same funding problems as 
those in California.

MAN ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY BEATING MOTHER 
</P>

 Sheriff's deputies arrested a Van Nuys man who allegedly beat his 74-year-old 
mother repeatedly in her Palmdale home during a dispute over money, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responded Wednesday night to a report that an assault was taking 
place in a home in the 2500 block of Olive Drive.When deputies arrived, they 
found the mother, Jeanne Canfield, with numerous bruises and a nine-inch cut on 
her right forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told deputies that her son, Mark Canfield, 42, who had left the 
house, had been beating her the past three days because of a disagreement over 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Canfield was taken to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, where she was 
treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the woman reported the beatings, sheriff's deputies arrested 
Mark Canfield in the 37000 block of 25th Street. He was jailed at the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Antelope Valley Station in lieu of 
$50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Barbara Fryer said the son remained in custody Thursday on 
suspicion of felony battery. He may face an additional charge of elder abuse, 
which carries a penalty of up to four years in prison, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Canfield is expected to be arraigned today in Antelope Municipal Court.

KIDNAPING SUSPECT INDICTED; CRIME: IF CONVICTED, TIMOTHY SHUE COULD FACE LIFE 
IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE IN ABDUCTION OF VAL VERDE REAL ESTATE AGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted a Michigan man Thursday for allegedly kidnaping 
a Val Verde real estate agent at gunpoint while posing as a prospective home 
buyer and, two days later, leaving her tied up in an Arizona motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-count indictment charges Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, with kidnaping and 
the use of a handgun in connection with a crime of violence, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Debra Yang. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on the kidnaping charge, Shue faces a maximum sentence of life in 
prison without parole, Yang said. A conviction on the weapons charge would add 
five years to any sentence Shue receives and the possibility of a $250,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue could also receive extra time because he is on parole for robbery in 
Michigan and because he has other previous convictions. But just how much would 
be added to his sentence is unknown, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 1 in Los Angeles federal court before 
Magistrate Brian Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is accused of abducting Paula Harrington, 26, on June 29 as she was 
showing houses to him in Val Verde, a community of about 1,500 northwest of 
Santa Clarita. She was found two days later in the motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested July 6 in Ogden, Utah, after he allegedly displayed a 
handgun to a topless dancer in a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was allegedly sexually assaulted during her two-day ordeal, 
authorities said. Yang said such allegations could be included in the kidnaping 
charge when the case goes to trial and would add to Shue's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is accused of similar kidnapings in several other states, including 
Michigan, Ohio and Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 Local law enforcement agencies in some of those areas have indicated they plan 
to pursue charges against him -- especially if he is convicted and receives 
less than a life sentence in the Harrington kidnaping case. But other legal 
proceedings against him will have to wait until the conclusion of the federal 
case, authorities said.

ACCOUNTANT MISSING SINCE JULY 7 IS FOUND DEAD IN HIS CAR; SIMI VALLEY: BODY OF 
FRANK PLAICE IS DISCOVERED AT BOTTOM OF EMBANKMENT. HE MAY HAVE DIED FROM A 
MEDICAL CONDITION, NOT THE CRASH, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Missing for two weeks, a Simi Valley accountant was found dead Thursday at the 
wheel of his car, which had smashed into thick brush at the bottom of a steep 
embankment off the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Frank Plaice, 57, was still belted into his white 1994 Ford Probe 
when the car was spotted near Rocky Peak about 10:35 a.m. Thursday by Simi 
Valley police investigators in a sheriff's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 A tow-truck driver winched the car back up the 100-foot slope, and Ventura 
County coroner's investigators removed Plaice's body for an autopsy scheduled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully he didn't suffer and wasn't trapped in there," his ex-wife, 
Jeanette Plaice, said Thursday as she waited for relatives to arrive in Simi 
Valley and plan the funeral. "We're just kind of re-grieving, because we were 
really grieving originally in trying to find out where he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Plaice was last seen July 7 at the Simi Valley Elks Club. 
</P>
<P>
 He had stopped there -- he often did as club secretary -- to drop off some 
papers, a fellow Elk said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had seen him since, and when his false teeth were discovered in his 
empty Simi Valley condo, his friends and family feared the worst. They sent out 
flyers and scoured the route he often drove from his Chatsworth office to his 
Ventura County clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of his body Thursday ended the grim search. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did not solve the mystery of his disappearance or the cause of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical problem -- not the crash -- may have led to Plaice's death, said 
police and a coroner's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford had not rolled over, its air bag had inflated, and Plaice's body 
showed no signs of massive injuries, said Simi Valley Police Lt. Mark Layhew. 
Also, the car's pop-up headlights were up and its light switch was on, Layhew 
said, indicating Plaice may have gone over the side at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears as though he may have succumbed to some sort of medical 
condition," Layhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaice's family said he had complained of chest pains as recently as July 6, 
the day before he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Kaiser Hospital in Woodland Hills had diagnosed the pain as 
indigestion and prescribed medication for his stomach, but he still complained 
of the pain, said Gerry Grooms, his girlfriend of five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Plaice said her ex-husband was the type who would rush himself to the 
hospital if he was feeling gravely ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he must have had a sudden attack of something," she said. "He threw 
on his clothes -- it must have been like early morning -- and he was trying to 
get to Kaiser when he realized it was more than indigestion . . . . Instead of 
calling for assistance, he went himself." 
</P>
<P>
 That, she said, could also explain why Plaice, a diabetic with some missing 
teeth, had left behind his false teeth and insulin in his condo's bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 And California Highway Patrol Sgt. Robert Dickie pointed out, "There's no skid 
marks at all. I don't think he braked . . . . He just veered off the roadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaice's car left the freeway grade at the eastern end of Simi Valley just 
west of Rocky Peak Road, plunged down the 100-foot embankment at a 45-degree 
angle and buried itself nose first in a stand of live oak. 
</P>
<P>
 Two slight gouges are visible where the Ford's front end scraped over the 
asphalt curb, police said. But no one on the freeway or the Southern Pacific 
railroad tracks more than 200 feet below could have seen the wreck or the two 
smooth tracks the car had beaten into the brush as it barreled down the slope, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were right here," Dickie said, "There's no skid marks. There's nothing 
to even intrigue you to come over here to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Layhew added: "The big question is . . . why didn't someone see him go over 
the side?  
</P>
<P>
 "Indications are, based on the fact that the headlights were in the up 
position and the switch was on, that he was driving in the hours of darkness 
and was driving in a break in traffic when he went over."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN BLASTS WILSON FOR DMV COMPUTER 'DEBACLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Announcing the first of what she said will be weekly "Rip Van Wilson" awards, 
Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown said Thursday that Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson took far too long to do anything about the DMV's failed 
multimillion-dollar computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is typical of the Rip Van Wilson style: You slumber until election year. 
You wake up and you do something about it," Brown said, contending that she 
would address such management problems more quickly. "California needs a 
governor who's going to be on the job from Day One." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it took Wilson three years and millions of dollars in costs before 
his Administration dealt with the $44-million computer "debacle" at the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. She said the problem is only "the tip of the 
iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of the Hollywood DMV office, and an array of more than 50 
old computer monitors and other equipment, Brown noted that the office of the 
legislative analyst has indicated that the state has problems with 11 computer 
systems worth $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyst's office said the systems either had failed or were in serious 
trouble because of a lack of an effective system for managing and overseeing 
the information processing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Wilson reelection campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said the DMV 
problem was minor compared to a 1991 incident in the state treasurer's office 
in which $2.8 billion in state funds were improperly credited to a state 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's taken a couple of wrong turns herself trying to find the information 
superhighway on-ramp. . . . Her own treasurer's office somehow managed to 
misplace almost $3 billion until the state auditor general found it for her," 
Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could stack DMV computers from here into the 21st Century before you got 
to numbers like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the error was inherited from her Republican predecessor and that 
her office uncovered it through a management review she initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.8 billion was an accounting error and "did not cause loss of actual 
cash deposits or security values," Brown said in a May, 1992, letter to the 
state auditor general. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it has been cleaned up with a plan to fix it that was put into place over 
a year ago," she said Thursday. "That's the kind of action that I think ought 
to take place up and down state government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a problem Pete Wilson inherited and let drift until 
millions more dollars were being wasted. It's a perfect example of contrast in 
leadership style." 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV computer modernization program was undertaken in the late 1980s to 
transfer driver's license, vehicle registration and other data from archaic 
databases to a new system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project never worked and the Wilson Administration decided to abandon it 
this year. An internal DMV investigation released in late May concluded that 
DMV officials bought the system on the basis of overly optimistic sales pitches 
without properly evaluating whether the computer could meet the department's 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she planned to make a new "Rip Van Wilson" award each week. Asked 
what she would have done if she had been in Wilson's place, taking office as 
governor in early 1991, she said: "The first thing I would have done is to have 
a management audit internally and find out what the problem was and cure it. 
We've had to wait three years."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR GAINS, DOW CREEPS; STATE 'RAW' YIELDS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Staff and Wire Services

<P>
 The dollar shot up against the German mark and rose against other major 
currencies Thursday as Treasury officials and German central bankers spoke out 
firmly in favor of a stronger buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bond yields continued to rise on worries about 
another potential Federal Reserve Board credit tightening. The turmoil in the 
Treasury market helped push up yields on the 22-month notes, or "RAWs," sold by 
California on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, most indexes closed marginally higher despite the bond 
market's problems. The Dow industrial average added 5.18 points to 3,732.45, 
but analysts noted that the Dow's gain was paltry considering that bellwether 
IBM rocketed 6 1/2 to 62 3/8 after reporting surprisingly good quarterly 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's rally caught many traders off guard. The dollar jumped to 1.589 
German marks in New York from 1.565 on Wednesday, one of the largest single-day 
dollar-mark jumps in several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the dollar was boosted by some of the strongest talk to come out 
of the U.S. government since the greenback's latest descent began a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said in Senate testimony 
Thursday that a higher dollar "would have important economic benefits for the 
United States" and would restore confidence in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, also 
made dollar-supportive statements. The combination of his comments and Summers' 
suggested to some traders that major industrial nations could be mulling a 
concerted move to defend the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things came together at once" for the dollar, said Chris Igo, 
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "There's been a fundamental change in market 
sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also rallied against the Japanese yen, fetching 99.20 yen in New 
York, up from Wednesday's 98.65. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's verbal intervention," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at 
Mellon Bank, describing Summers' and Tietmeyer's comments. "They're doing 
better with these comments than they did when they were buying dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the bond market didn't get much of an assist from the dollar's boost. 
Short-term yields, which had jumped Wednesday on comments by Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, rose again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month T-bills rose to 4.45% from 4.40% on Wednesday and 
4.37% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury yields, however, were flat. The 30-year T-bond closed at 
7.54%, unchanged after leaping Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan had warned in Senate testimony Wednesday that the Fed may be forced 
to boost short-term rates again if inflation flares. Some analysts believe 
Greenspan is priming the nation for yet another rate hike in August, to slow 
the economy further. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in short-term Treasury yields this week has been bad news for Wall 
Street brokerages that bought $4 billion in revenue anticipation warrants, or 
RAWs, from California on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerages bought the RAWs at an annualized yield of about 4.9% and 
intended to market them to institutional and individual investors at yields of 
4.8% or lower. But as other short-term yields have jumped since Wednesday, the 
brokerages have been forced to mark down the prices of the RAWs -- thereby 
boosting the yield on the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders said investors demanded yields as high as 4.97% on the RAWs late 
Thursday. Some money managers said they were holding out for 5% or better. That 
could hurt California next week: The state needs to sell another $3 billion in 
notes Wednesday, this time in 11-month securities, to fund its huge budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Wall Street, IBM's healthy earnings report failed to energize 
the broad market. Losers edged winners by 11 to 10 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders noted that when IBM reported surprisingly good first-quarter earnings 
on April 21, the stock jumped 6 1/8 to 58 3/8 -- and the Dow index surged 53.83 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, IBM's gain was offset in the Dow by United Technologies' 3 7/8 
plunge, to 62 1/2, on its earnings report, and by smaller losses in nearly half 
of the 30 Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market (Thursday was) one stock -- IBM. That is the story of the day and 
the story of the week," said Lawrence Rice, market strategist at Josephthal 
Lyon & Ross in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech issues rallied with IBM. Gainers included Apple, up 1 3/8 to 28; 
Dell Computer, up 7/8 to 26 5/8; Advanced Micro Devices, up 1 1/4 to 25 7/8, 
and Computer Associates, up 1 1/8 to 40 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other companies gaining on earnings reports included AT&T, up 5/8 to 53 3/4; 
Sears, up 1 3/8 to 47 3/8; Monsanto, up 1 to 76 3/4; Johnson & Johnson, up 1 
5/8 to 46 3/8; Gillette, up 2 1/4 to 68 3/4, and information systems developer 
Cerner, which rocketed 6 7/8 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks falling on earnings reports included Colgate Palmolive, down 1 3/4 to 
50 1/2, and Caterpillar, down 1 1/4 to 106 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, computer parts supplier Golden Systems tumbled 1 to 
2 1/2 after reporting quarterly earnings of 1 cent a share, down from 12 cents 
a year ago. Another tech firm, Rainbow Technologies, sank 2 1/2 to 10 7/8 after 
reporting lower earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But electronics distributor Marshall Industries rose 1/2 to 21 1/2 after 
reporting quarterly earnings of 53 cents a share, up from 41 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golf club shaft maker Aldila dropped 2 1/4 to 13. The San Diego-based firm 
reported higher quarterly earnings but also announced that major investor 
Forstmann Little will distribute its 29.4% stake in Aldila to individual 
Forstmann partners. The market fears that the individual partners may then dump 
significant amounts of stock on the market, depressing the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX stock index lost 25.35 points to 2,113.30, while 
Tokyo's Nikkei average ended off 157.84 points at 20,622.92. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index gained 17.9 points to 3,095.1. In Mexico City, 
the Bolsa index rebounded 21.86 points to 2,223.88.

EARNINGS: AT&T SEES 8% PROFIT GAIN; BIG LOSS AT SALOMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. reported an 8% increase in second-quarter profit and a surge in 
revenue Thursday, indicating it has recovered some business lost in the 
long-distance brawl with competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest telecommunications company was also helped by strong 
growth in telephone equipment sales, particularly for cellular systems. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T earned $1.13 billion, or 83 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30. 
It earned $1.04 billion, or 77 cents a share, in last year's second quarter, 
before a 3-cents-a-share charge for an accounting change. Revenue rose 9% to 
$17.7 billion, from $16.3 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T said its volume growth was led by new customers for toll-free 800 lines. 
The company also credited a change in its consumer marketing, including the 
launch of products around the "True" brand name. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from long-distance and other telecommunications services was up 5% 
from the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of telephone equipment and computer systems rose 19%, led by wireless 
products, as cellular phone companies improve their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from financial services, including the AT&T Universal credit card, was 
up 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by turmoil in bond markets, Salomon Inc. reported a huge second-quarter 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon said weak second-quarter results at its investment banking and 
securities firm Salomon Bros. were linked to drops in prices for fixed-income 
products such as bonds and a decline in liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent firm showed a net loss of $204 million, or $2.08 a share, 
contrasted with a profit of $433 million, or $3.32 a share, for the second 
quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue fell to $1.28 billion from $2.59 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. had a $410-million pretax loss for the quarter, mostly due to a 
loss of $291 million in client-driven businesses, which is the trading of 
securities -- mostly bonds, in Salomon's case -- for pension funds and large 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines Co. reported a 39% increase in its second-quarter net 
income, which it attributed to lower operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwest, considered the master of low air fares, said net 
income rose to $58.52 million, or 40 cents a share, from $42.15 million, or 29 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue rose 16% to $661.1 million, from $568.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were higher than the company and most analysts had forecast. A 
survey of 13 analysts by Zacks Investment Research produced a mean estimate of 
37 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's costs, already among the lowest in the industry, dropped to 7.18 
cents per mile for each available seat, from 7.41 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest attributed the drop in operating costs to lower fuel prices and 
lower overhead at its Morris Air unit.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NORTH': IN SEARCH OF ITS INNER CHILD; ROB REINER'S FABLE FOCUSES 
ON A FOURTH-GRADER WHO SEEMS TO HAVE AN ENVIABLE LIFE, BUT DECIDES HE NEEDS NEW 
PARENTS. HIS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS TAKES HIM FROM ALASKA TO ZAIRE.

 Shed a tear for "North." Not for the 11-year-old boy it's named after, who 
thinks he has problems and doesn't, but for the movie itself, which is in more 
trouble than it knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being disappointing, which it certainly is, "North" is baffling, a 
cause for sadness rather than anger. How could director Rob Reiner, whose touch 
for what pleases a mass audience is usually unfailing, have strayed this far? 
And how could anyone else have concluded that this languid fable about a boy 
who decides he needs a new set of parents was a film worth making? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously Reiner's impressive commercial track record ("Stand by Me," "When 
Harry Met Sally . . . ," "A Few Good Men") caused everyone from actors to 
executives to shrug and sign off on a project so lacking in sparkle that no one 
with less power would have had a chance of getting it made. 
</P>
<P>
 As for why the director himself wanted to be involved, the press material 
carefully stipulates that the "North" story line "echoed Reiner's own 
maturation process." So, like Barry Levinson and the equally ill-starred 
"Toys," the director couldn't get this project off his mind for a decade, 
biding his time until he had the clout to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a novel by Alan Zweibel, who co-wrote the lackluster script with 
Andrew Scheinman, the film focuses on a fourth-grader who seems to have an 
enviable life. North (Elijah Wood) is a scholar, an athlete and a role model, 
but when he sits down at the dinner table, he can't seem to get his folks' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the difficulties children today have to face up to, living with a pair 
of comically self-absorbed parents (played by "Seinfeld" regulars Jason 
Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus) may not seem unduly traumatic. But in the 
uncertain tradition of previous "liberate the inner child" movies, North's 
situation is treated as a candidate for the trials of Job. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the influence of a wily fellow fourth-grader (Mathew McCurley) and an 
unscrupulous adult lawyer (Jon Lovitz), North decides enough is enough and 
declares himself a free agent, intent on scouring the world for parents worthy 
of his exceptional gifts. After all, as his tireless guardian angel (Bruce 
Willis) tells him, "Parents are supposed to make kids feel better, not the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Questionable as all this may be as a premise, it's not really what sinks 
"North." Rather it is how incompletely imagined the alternative parenting 
scenarios we're presented with turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 First up are Texans Pa and Ma Tex (Dan Aykroyd and singer Reba McEntire), 
wealthy folk who like the biggest and the best of everything. Next comes a 
completely inexplicable interlude with parental wanna-bes in Hawaii, another in 
Alaska, and increasingly shorter ones in China, Paris, Zaire and assorted other 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few amusing moments in "North," mainly involving jokey references 
to other movies, but they are overshadowed by a dubious plot turn involving a 
full-scale revolt of America's children inspired by North's antics. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem overall is not so much that the humor, especially in the 
parent-tryout situations, is forced, but that it simply is not there at all. So 
little is going on in this mildest of fantasies that it is hard to even guess 
what kinds of emotional effects were aimed at in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Bruce Willis turns to game but overmatched Elijah Wood near the finale 
and tells the boy, "You've realized something it takes most people a lifetime 
to figure out," it is hard to resist yelling something like, "Be more careful 
next time," at the screen. It's a lesson everyone involved in "North" ought to 
take to heart.

 2nd Bomb Defused: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is probing the 
discovery on Tuesday of a parcel bomb addressed to the president of the ABC 
Television Network Group. It was the second failed bombing attempt against 
Robert A. Iger in two months. Tuesday's bomb was discovered by an employee at 
the United Parcel Service in Jackson, Miss., and was defused by police there. A 
network spokeswoman declined to speculate about any possible motive for the 
attempted bombings. She said that "appropriate security measures are being 
taken."

 New KUSC Programs: In an effort to "broaden" its programming "to mirror a 
region whose population is the most diversified in America," classical radio 
station KUSC-FM (91.5) on Thursday announced plans for seven new shows, ranging 
from acoustic and world music to a program on cutting-edge science and 
technology. The new shows, which include several National Public Radio shows 
such as a weekly Latino journal and an environmental program, debut Aug. 1. The 
station will also have a new morning host starting Aug. 17: Tom Crann, KUSC's 
afternoon host in 1991-92, will return to the station as host-producer of the 
6-10 a.m. "Morning Program," where he will feature a "wake-up mix of music, 
anecdotes and high spirits." All program changes will also be in effect on

 Alice Breaks Tour Chains: The Seattle rock band Alice in Chains has announced 
it is dropping out of the Metallica tour, which begins Sunday at the Glen Helen 
Blockbuster Pavilion. AIC was scheduled to open for Metallica through late 
August. The band's appearance in next month's Woodstock show has also been 
canceled. The official statement from management cites health problems within 
the band, but doesn't specify any further. That raises speculation about the 
condition of lead singer Layne Staley, whose drug problems have been well 
documented. Reports have surfaced that Alice in Chains may be splitting up, but 
management says the band plans to record this fall.

 Verdict for 'The Client': Warner Bros.' film adaptation of John Grisham's 
novel "The Client" opened Wednesday to a strong $3.1 million in first-day 
ticket sales. But while the Susan Sarandon-Tommy Lee Jones film was the new kid 
on the movie block, it was "Forrest Gump," starring Tom Hanks, that was in 
first place for the day, with a Wednesday gross of $3.7 million. ("Gump" also 
opened on a Wednesday, July 6, when it brought in a gross of $4 million. In 
comparison, last summer's Grisham novel-turned-movie, "The Firm," pulled in 
$7.2 million in its Wednesday opening.) "Gump," which has grossed $83.5 million 
in its first 15 days, is poised to cross the $100-million mark this weekend.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'LIKE A WOMAN': ROMANTIC COMEDY IN DIFFERENT GARB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Just Like a Woman," a romantic comedy with a decidedly different twist, finds 
a young American (Adrian Pasdar) rushing home from the London merchant bank 
where he is working on a half-billion-dollar deal with a Japanese company. 
Unfortunately, he arrives just in time to witness his wife, who has 
unexpectedly returned early from a trip with their two small children, throwing 
a large amount of women's clothing out the master bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
 She won't let him explain, and she very well might not be able to understand 
if she gave her husband the chance to do so. Naturally, she assumes the 
clothing belongs to some unknown other woman. The truth is that Pasdar's Gerald 
is himself the other woman, for he is a transvestite who calls himself 
Geraldine when he dresses in feminine attire. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking for new digs, Gerald has the good fortune to end up at the doorstep 
of Julie Walters' Monica, a recent divorcee who's just decided to take in some 
boarders to afford staying in her large and comfortable Edwardian row house. 
Gerald is such an ideal tenant, thoughtful and considerate, and Monica is such 
a warm, good-humored woman, that it's not surprising that mutual attraction 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just Like a Woman," which was written and produced by Nick Evans and directed 
by Christopher Monger, is resolutely buoyant. Although not without pathos, it 
avoids any probing of what may cause transvestism, content to make the point 
that many transvestites are straight. It does a good, credible job in depicting 
Gerald gathering strength to confess his predilection -- a first for him -- to 
Monica, whose stunned response is laughter, but who proves strong and caring 
enough to accept Gerald the way he is. She even encourages Gerald to dare to 
transform himself into Geraldine for a daytime outing, urging him to be less 
fearful in the guise in which he seems so comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Having drawn from a true story (based on a book by Monica Jay) up to this 
point and thereby setting the stage for some serious considerations, the 
filmmakers nevertheless plunge ahead with a giddy farce plot that involves 
Gerald's escalating clashes with his bombastic boss (Paul Freeman). 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Just Like a Woman" becomes increasingly contrived, it offers 
splendid performances from its stars. The film itself may proceed gingerly at 
times but Pasdar, tall and strapping, wisely plays Geraldine with a bold 
display of confidence. Despite his husky physique and strong jaw, Pasdar 
manages to be convincingly feminine. As Monica, Walters has never looked so 
attractive or underplayed so effectively, even though she thrives in the showy 
parts afforded her in "Educating Rita" and the current "Wedding Gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Just Like a Woman" strains a bit in emphasizing what a likable, 
emphatically masculine guy Gerald is, it is nevertheless a landmark in 
mainstream movies for its compassionate view of a straight transvestite. 
</P>
<P>

includes adult sexual themes and situations, and some rough language. 'Just

MUSIC REVIEW; 'CABARET': MOOD MUSIC LOSES ITS ATMOSPHERE AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even if life is a cabaret (old chum), the Hollywood Bowl definitely isn't . 
With nearly 18,000 seats on a hillside facing a half-buried architectural 
saucer, it's obvious that this amphitheater is no intimate, atmospheric boi te 
, and titling the Wednesday pops concert "A Cabaret" represented the first of 
the evening's miscalculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting the Bowl Orchestra, John Mauceri presented instrumental music by 
composers who fled the Nazis and ended up writing scores for Broadway musicals 
or Hollywood films. In concept, his choices provided an expanded artistic 
context for guest soloist Ute Lemper's medley of Kurt Weill songs -- and, to a 
lesser extent, her tributes to Marlene Dietrich and Edith Piaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the theme of artistic displacement wasn't enough to make the 
grandiose soundtrack music that Mauceri conducted as satisfying as the gritty 
and often profound ballads sung by the charismatic Lemper. In particular, the 
endless, bloated "Hotel Berlin" waltzes by Franz Waxman proved a tedious 
intrusion on Lemper's performances of great passion and stylistic authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, the young German vocalist never sounds more ravishing than when she 
sings in French, and never more problematic than when she sings in English. In 
"La Vie en Rose" and "Les Feuilles Mortes" on Wednesday, her beauty of tone and 
mastery of nuance seemed to belong to another artist than the tight-throated, 
desperately histrionic interpreter of "They Call Me Naughty Lola" or the 
Alabama Song. Even when she switched from German to English midway through a 
stark rendition of "Falling in Love Again," Lemper became suddenly diminished, 
somehow prosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 In her Weill suite, Lemper invoked both the moon of Alabama and the old Bilbao 
moon, but, alas, no kind of moon pierced the clouds over the Bowl until much 
later. No matter. Accompanied only by pianist and arranger Bruno Fontaine, she 
offered a drop-dead definitive "Surabaya Johnny," a sustained meditation on 
hopeless longing (from "Happy End") that Lemper made into a lament for all 
abused women everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Weill's overture to "Lady in the Dark" suffered Wednesday from Mauceri's 
tendency to flatten out highly theatrical music and from the curious warping of 
the show songs previewed therein -- especially "One Life to Live." His finest 
moment: the artful buildup to (and through) "Lost in the Stars" during a Weill 
"Songbook for Orchestra" originally arranged by Morton Gould and reworked by 
Mauceri for this occasion.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'CIAO, PROFESSORE' ROUNDS UP LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lina Wertmuller's "Ciao, Professore" is a welcome, modest change from the 
blustery, slam-bang productions that made her reputation. "Swept Away" or 
"Seven Beauties" it's not. Her approach to drama is still exhaustingly 
knockabout but, because she's not working a political/sexual agenda in her new 
film, it doesn't seem as punishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is about what happens when a primary school teacher from northern 
Italy, Marco Sperelli (Paolo Villaggio), gets mistakenly transferred to a 
school in the southern village of Corzano. Marco doesn't want to be in this 
hothouse community of tiny truants, and for a long time his teaching job 
consists of rounding up his students in the streets and plunking them down in 
his classroom. Marco isn't a martinet -- he tries to reach his students by 
appealing to their best instincts -- but it's only after he slaps one of them 
that he gains their respect. (He regrets both the slap and the respect it earns 
him.) Because he cares about the children he becomes a hero to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertmuller and her team of five screenwriters don't spend much time involving 
us in Marco's classroom teaching. For a movie that centers on education there's 
very little learning going on. The lessons are all outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not exactly a novel approach -- just about every classroom film from 
"To Sir, With Love" to "Renaissance Man" tried the same thing. And there's 
something dubious about a movie about the relationship between a teacher and 
his students that neglects the reasons for the learning in the first place. 
Still, the streets of Corzano are so bursting with life that you don't regret 
Wertmuller's decision to bring the film outdoors. There's lots to learn there 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, many of them unprofessionals, are charmers, and Wertmuller 
indulges them -- she practically pinches their cheeks for us. Hers is mostly an 
idealized view of childhood, but Italians have always had a special feeling for 
childhood revelry (and heartbreak too, as in many of De Sica's greatest films). 
The one bad seed in the bunch, the punkish Raffaele (Ciro Esposito), is in the 
movie to be redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't go entirely flabby on us. When Marco, in a fit of pique, 
punches a nun, Raffaele reacts with awe. So do we. 
</P>

 * MPAA rating: R, for language. Times guidelines: It includes a scene of nun 
being punched and some don't-try-this-at-home daredevil stunts by preteens.

 But do we need a new Lassie movie? Apparently the studio marketeers think so. 
There's been a revival in animal movies -- we'll see seals and stallions before 
the summer is through. And the New Wholesomeness in family entertainment was 
tailor-made for a movie about a silky, fluffy collie who teaches kids (and 
adults) the importance of togetherness. You take your soothsayers where you 
find them these days. Woof woof. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassie is picked up at the beginning of the film after surviving a car wreck 
on a rain-swept highway. She's a wanderer -- kind of like Richard Kimble. The 
Turner family, en route to Virginia from Baltimore to start a new life on a 
farm in the glorious Shenandoah Valley, picks up the dog. But the bonding 
doesn't begin right away. Seven-year-old Jennifer (Brittany Boyd) takes an 
instant shine to her -- after all, we've already seen her watching "Lassie" 
reruns on television. And her stepmother, Laura (Helen Slater), is all for 
keeping the dog too. But 13-year-old Matt (Thomas Guiry) and his dad, Steve 
(Jon Tenney), take a while to be convinced. Is this some sort of Male thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Would Matt, the "Power Ranger" fan, have liked Lassie better if she'd been a 
he -- if Lassie were a pit bull or a Doberman? (Actually, this Lassie, like all 
the Lassies in the previous TV shows and movies, is a male and a direct 
descendant of Lassie No. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 But this "Lassie" is, after all, a story about a boy and his dog, and it's not 
long before Matt is cajoled by Lassie into romping with her across the lush 
countryside. This Lassie is as preternatural as her forebears: Matt is 
constantly being rescued by Lassie from wolves and bad weather and spoiled rich 
kids on tractors; she even gives him a knowing look when he sets up a telephone 
date for the Livestock Expo with a local cutie (Michelle Williams). Lassie is 
all things to Matt: Savior, Tutor, Matchmaker. And, oh yes, Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia landscape is postcard pretty -- no, make that postcard gorgeous. 
And Lassie is pretty gorgeous too. The fairy-tale charm of the story works 
fitfully whenever the dog and the scenery come together, which is not often 
enough. There's something lulling -- no, make that boring -- about the way this 
film ladles out the homespun homilies. It's just not as easy making movies 
about childhood innocence as the filmmakers of "Lassie" want to believe it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Daniel Petrie and screenwriters Matthew Jacobs, Gary Ross and 
Elizabeth Anderson don't bring anything fresh to this old warhorse -- or 
wardog. And that may be their point. "Lassie" is an attempt to apotheosize the 
cliches of the collie myth. When Lassie jumps into a raging waterfall to save 
Matt, or grapples with a wolf, the suspense isn't real suspense because we're 
supposed to already know how it all turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the drawbacks of the film's syrupy approach -- at least from a 
family-entertainment point of view -- is that you keep waiting for danger and 
bad guys to liven things up. And, sure enough, the presence of Frederic Forrest 
as Sam Garland, the biggest and baddest sheep farmer in the state, turns out to 
be a boon. Perpetually scowling and sunglass-clad, Sam is a rude dude; he looks 
over his flock of sheep and sees only lamb chops on the hoof. His two young 
sons (Charlie Hofheimer and Clayton Barclay Jones) are like a pair of 
range-riding homunculi. You keep expecting the Garlands to get seriously nutty 
and take over the picture -- maybe try to mate Lassie with a lamb, or spike the 
ol' swimmin' hole, or force-feed Matt's kindly granddad (Richard Farnsworth) 
Puppy Chow. The producer of "Lassie," after all, is Lorne Michaels, executive 
producer of "Saturday Night Live." But even the Garlands are ultimately 
redeemed by the love of a dog. Their bark is worse than their bite. (On the 
other hand, Lassie's bite is worse than her bark. Go figure.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, children may find themselves transported by the images of Lassie 
rippling in the chill wind. Their adult chaperons may too. But more likely, 
they'll be thinking about the price of real estate in the Shenandoah Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG. Times guidelines: It includes a snarling wolf endangering a 
teen-age boy, a dognaping and possible drowning that may upset small children.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MOBAY: BEST REMEMBERED FOR ITS PATIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malibu's cheerful and popular Cafe Mobay has produced its first offspring, the 
neon-bright Mobay on Abbott Kinney Boulevard in Venice. The name refers to 
Montego Bay, Jamaica, and its colors, indoors and out, are as loud and squawky 
as a flock of parrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Faux trees hold up the dining room ceiling, original art blasts from the 
walls. Even the chair upholstery has not eluded the brush of a relentlessly 
cheerful colorist. Outside, where everyone wants to sit, the heated patio is 
full of potted banana palms, hibiscus, thumpy reggae music. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to like this restaurant. The menu is interesting, varied, creative: 
Chef and co-owner Derek Harrison is well-respected for his nouvelle approach to 
Caribbean favorites in Malibu. There are never, in my opinion, enough good 
patios for hot summer nights, and Mobay's terrace, for all its theme-park 
exuberance, is lovely after dark. And who doesn't like Caribbean food -- its 
curries and dense spiciness, plantains, rice and beans? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of my visits -- Mobay has been open a scant two months -- the 
service has improved steadily. Still, the staff has certain regrettable quirks, 
like telling us repeatedly our table will be ready in "two or three minutes" 
when, in truth, it will be another 15 minutes or half an hour. It also seems 
that two women dining together are invisible (a quirk by no means limited to 
this restaurant). Or maybe there's another reason why the one time I visit 
Mobay with a female friend, we wait 40 minutes for our first appetizer, are 
largely neglected by our server and never receive a basket of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this may not have been so irritating had I been more entranced by 
Harrison's disheveled, heavy-handed, and ultimately unmemorable approach to 
nouvelle Caribbean Cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for "stamp and go fritters," salty and charming little cod cakes, 
appetizers are disappointing. Some of this is due to the kitchen's sloppiness. 
One night we order both a vegetable-filled "pattie" (Jamaican-style empanada ) 
and jerk chicken ravioli. The pattie we're served has a turmeric, yellow crust 
and a bland, ground-chicken filling and comes in a smooth, spicy, 
tomato-cinnamon sauce . . . as does the ravioli, which according to the menu 
comes with mango salsa. Thus, we end up with two dull chicken appetizers in the 
same sauce. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 On another evening, crab cakes are undercooked and gummy, although fully 
cooked crispy edges hint at how good they might be. A $9-appetizer of charred 
jumbo scallops has only three thin, by no means charred, scallops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobay salad, with fried balls of goat cheese, is lovely and refreshing, 
but a Caesar salad is made with wilted lettuce and the grilled vegetable salad 
is a big squishy heap of sweet barbecued vegetables and plantains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are arranged in stacks and swirls: A thick, curried, not particularly 
interesting mound of goat stew is, if the kitchen remembers, topped with a 
spicy sweet potato fritter; black-pepper sea bass floats on a mound of potatoes 
in a sea of spicy sauce; jerk chicken, emitting strong fumes of Worcestershire 
sauce, mooshes into saucy red beans and plantains. 
</P>
<P>
 While sometimes these assemblages are effective -- the bass is lovely, for 
example, as is a flavorful, sliced turkey breast arranged in petals over mashed 
potatoes and a spritely fresh corn salsa -- more often than not, entrees are 
murky, muddled and impossible to remember: Was that chicken in a sauce, or 
beans or both? 
</P>
<P>
 The only certainty is that big, flappy slices of not particularly ripe or 
sweet plantain are omnipresent; I even fish them out of my oxtail tureen where 
they actually outnumber oxtail segments and butter beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, cool and distinct, come as a welcome relief from all the preceding 
muddiness. Airy, tart Key lime mousse is perfect with crunchy shaved fresh 
coconut. A chewy, compressed bread pudding is the bland, blank page for three 
distinctive sauces (lime, caramel and vanilla). The same sauces complement 
smooth, powerful rum raisin ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobay, 1031 Abbott Kinney Blvd., Venice (310) 452-7472. Open daily for lunch 
and dinner, Saturday and Sunday for brunch. Beer and wine only. Major credit 
cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $32 to $66.

ART REVIEWS; 'REFLECTIONS ON CINEMA' OFFERS TARNISHED PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many art films, the group exhibition "Screening Space: Reflections on 
Cinema in Recent L.A. Art" is more rewarding to think about than to see. 
Curated for Jan Kesner Gallery by artist Charles LaBelle, this 10-artist show 
is an intelligent if overly literal meditation on Hollywood's influence on 
everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Predominantly made of low-tech leftovers scavenged from the movie industry, it 
has the feel of a countercultural rebellion. Its pieces embody substantial 
disdain for a monolithic industry, while acknowledging how badly the odds are 
stacked against the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of each artist seems doomed when it tries to challenge Hollywood's 
well-financed power. There's something pathetic about Carter Potter's paintings 
made from strips of film wrapped around stretcher bars, Bruce and Norman 
Yonemoto's squares of home-movie screens stitched into a grid, and Jody 
Zellen's collaged magazines photo-transferred to window blinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Cindy Bernard's photographs of locations where old movies were shot 
were made so long after the fact that they resonate only for fanatical film 
buffs. Brad Dunning's increasingly blurry and finally blacked-out film stills 
from "The Postman Always Rings Twice" offer a slow-motion replay of Bernard's 
sendup of film's aura. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Komater and Mary Parker strike hollow poses. He collages his face over 
those of actors and actresses in stills from film noir classics, and she 
dresses up as "Maryboro," a transsexual version of the Marlboro man. 
</P>
<P>
 Having worked as a propman and gallery assistant, Kevin White is the only 
artist whose understanding of Hollywood runs deeper than a layman's. His three 
pieces combine film's capacity to create compelling illusions with art's 
similar goals. 
</P>
<P>
 White's exact clay, foam and plastic duplications of antique icons from Asia 
seamlessly fuse real life and the movies. By playing Hollywood's game on its 
own terms, he raises the stakes of the exhibition, suggesting that the best way 
to undermine the status quo is not by frontal assault, but by sneaky 
infiltration. 
</P>

 Mixed Media: Jamey Bair's solo show at 1301 looks like a group exhibition. Its 
four sculptures, three paintings and six photographs share very little 
stylistically and only tentatively resemble the young, L.A.-based artist's 
earlier work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many artists since the 1960s have built prominent bodies of work in 
diverse media, few with as much talent as Bair have followed this strategy as 
ineffectively as he has. His mix of media does not appear to be part of an 
ambitious conceptual program but seems to result from confusion and laziness. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusion is an essential ingredient of art that strives to do more than 
illustrate ideas. Even laziness can be interesting. The problem with Bair's 
show is that it doesn't put either element to good use. 
</P>
<P>
 His lead sculptures, cast from Lincoln Logs, Milk Bone dog biscuits, a light 
bulb and a small slide viewer, are little more than trinkets made from a 
poisonous material. His canvases, which consist of dozens of layers of oil and 
resin, look like muddy, muddled reprises of previous paintings depicting giant 
eyeballs or tiny optical explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to these half-baked bodies of work, Bair's super-saturated 
close-up photographs of snapdragons are not infatuated with their own glibness 
or plagued by cool insincerity. Their sumptuousness is stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 Made with many filters, these intense, vivid pictures are more beautiful than 
meticulously cultivated gardens or gorgeous floral arrangements. Ravishing 
light seems to radiate from behind them. These handsomely framed prints look 
like liquid stained-glass windows through which a surplus of sunlight 
incessantly pours. 
</P>
<P>
 Bair's photographs of flowers do more than steal the show. They reveal the 
depth of a largely untested talent. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'THREE TENORS,' THE VIDEO, COMING SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Is Tenormania over? 
</P>
<P>
 No way. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenors Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo crooning arias and 
pop tunes at Dodger Stadium last Saturday night was breathlessly billed as the 
concert of the century. The most heavily hyped concert of the century was more 
like it. Anyway, it's about to become one of the most heavily hyped music 
videos of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape of the concert is coming out Aug. 30 on A*Vision Entertainment, at 
$30. Hands down, it'll be the music video of the year. The video is part of a 
multimedia blitz that's being launched that day, including the release of the 
CD ($20) and the laser disc ($40). There will also be a collector's package -- 
not yet priced -- featuring an audiotape, a video tape and a program. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV broadcast of the concert merely whetted appetites for the home video. 
Even those who taped it might want to buy the video, which offers first-rate 
sound -- crucial to the appreciation of such a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotional campaign, explained A*Vision's president Stuart Hersch, will 
include TV ads, billboards and posters. Consumers will also be able to order 
the recordings by phone from TV ads, the usual marketing strategy when 
targeting an audience that's somewhat older and doesn't frequent the typical 
music video outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to sell in the hundreds of thousands," Hersch said. Usually, if 
a classical music tape sells 20,000 copies, video companies are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 At $30, it's a bit expensive for a music video, which rarely cost more than 
$20. Defending the price, Hersch said: "The usual hourlong music video is 
$19.98. This tape is much longer (two to two and a half hours), so it should 
cost more." 
</P>
<P>
 To make the tape even more attractive, there's an extra. "It will include one 
song that was not on the TV show," Hersch said. "We wanted to save something 
for the video that was exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second tape of a performance by the three singers. The first, 
"Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti: The Three Tenors in Concert," came out in 
1990, and has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide -- the biggest-selling 
classical music video ever. The first was released by PolyGram, which lost out 
to A*Vision for the rights to release this one. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is just Phase 1 of Tenormania. Phase 2 is scheduled for next year 
when, Hersch said, A*Vision will release a making-of tape, featuring 
behind-the-scenes footage and, possibly, leftovers from the upcoming video. 
Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult," a comedy featuring O. J. 
Simpson, is due out Sept. 21. It sounds likes Paramount is trying to have it on 
the market in time to take advantage of the media furor over Simpson's trial, 
which may be scheduled this fall. But a Paramount spokeswoman said the movie, 
which debuted in theaters in March, was always slated to come out then -- the 
usual six months after theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sales market, one of the fall's biggest titles will be FoxVideo's 
"Sleepless in Seattle," starring Tom Hanks -- who's red-hot after winning an 
Oscar and starring in the huge hit "Forrest Gump." "Sleepless" is due out Sept. 
6, repriced to $20. FoxVideo is also offering the 1957 movie "An Affair to 
Remember" at a new price, $10. Featured in "Sleepless," "Affair," starring Cary 
Grant and Deborah Kerr, was a hit all over again. Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 If you're considering a home theater and don't know where to start, there are 
many helpful hints -- both on what to buy and how to assemble it -- on 
"Consumer Guide to Home Theater." Put out by Dolby Laboratories, (800) 
241-4115, it's somewhat of an ad for the company. Still, this 48-minute video 
($20) is an outstanding guide. . . . One of the more informative videos on the 
market, particularly for those over 40, is "How to Stay Healthy, Live Longer 
and Cut Your Medical Costs." This 90-minute video is full of useful financial 
and medical advice. For $30 from In the Black Video, (212) 864-0318. What's New 
On Video 
</P>
<P>
 "On Deadly Ground" (Warner). Steven Seagal directed and stars in this 
eco-thriller, about the hero's efforts to foil an oil tycoon (Michael Caine) 
building a refinery in Alaska that would pollute the environment. Admirable 
message, but the movie is preachy and amateurishly directed. Vastly inferior to 
his last movie, the exciting "Under Siege," but OK entertainment for hard-core 
Seagal fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Searching for Bobby Fischer" (Paramount). The trials of a 7-year-old chess 
prodigy, played by Max Pomeranc. His parents (Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen) have 
differing views about how he should use his skill and his tutors (Ben Kingsley 
and Laurence Fishburne) school him in vastly different approaches. Though 
you'll spot elements of the "Karate Kid" series and a bit of "Rocky" too, it's 
basically a well-made, absorbing family drama. Writer-director Steve Zaillian 
also wrote the script for "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 "Car 54, Where Are You?" (Orion). The '50s TV comedy series about lovable, 
buffoonish New York cops was goofy fun but the movie, with David Johansen and 
John McGinley as Toody and Muldoon, has a silly plot about protecting a witness 
and is full of dumb jokes and bad performances. Fans of the series may dislike 
this movie, which is geared to those with high tolerance for lowbrow humor. 
Rosie O'Donnell, Fran Drescher and Daniel Baldwin co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Father the Hero" (Touchstone). Leering comedy about a bumbling dad (Gerard 
Depardieu), vacationing in the Bahamas with his bratty, teen-age daughter 
(Katherine Heigl). To impress a prospective boyfriend, she fabricates a tale 
that has everyone believing they're really lovers. Mostly unfunny and sometimes 
tasteless, with murky undercurrents of incest and the Lolita syndrome muddying 
the humor. FILMS ON VIDEO

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; A REVEALING 'SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT' ON LASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Sex and cinema may have gone together from the beginning, but few filmmakers 
have been able to deal honestly with women's sexuality. And until Spike Lee 
burst upon the scene some eight years ago with "She's Gotta Have It," none had 
even acknowledged African American sexuality, let alone the black female 
libido. 
</P>
<P>
 With the brashness, inventiveness and sheer determination of a young artist 
sure of his craft but short of cash, Lee put a personal stamp on his picture 
that announced the arrival of a filmmaker to be reckoned with. Criterion's 
valuable unrated director's cut ($50) of Lee's first commercial venture clearly 
shows why the film caused a sensation at Cannes' Directors Fortnight and the 
San Francisco Film Festival. The rich transfer of cinematographer Ernest 
Dickerson's black-and-white photography (and one color scene) was made from a 
35mm fine-grain master, the original 35mm magnetic audio master and a 35mm 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing about 'She's Gotta Have It' is that it put me on the map and 
enabled me to make other films," Lee says on a second audio track, which also 
includes commentary from Dickerson, sound designer Barry Brown and production 
supervisor Monty Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never go back and look at our films," Lee explains. "It's hard for me to 
look at them and see what I wanted to do and wasn't able to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 What he was able to achieve on an initial shooting budget of $18,000 is a 
lyrical, slightly raw slice of life in the Brooklyn neighborhood in which he 
grew up, shot on the fly in 12 days. He and Dickerson call it "guerrilla 
filmmaking." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like visual jazz," Dickerson says, "improvised within a structure. A 
style comes out of limitations. When you are doing it, you don't think about 
style, but the quickest, most efficient way to get a scene done. The style 
comes later." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Lee made good use of his talented family, starting with 
the evocative jazz score written and conducted by his father, Bill Lee, and 
framed by spare black-and-white stills "raided" from his brother David Lee's 
"blossoming art portfolio." Shelton J. Lee was producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Camilla Johns, who stars as the unashamedly sexual Nola Darling, was 
discovered after she sent a photo in the mail. Spike's sister Joie Lee played 
Clorinda Bradford; Bill Lee played Sonny Darling, and the piano on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 When another actor bailed out, Lee took on the role of Mars Blackmon ("I know 
him better than anyone else"), a character whose "Please, please, please baby, 
please baby baby, please" took on a life of its own, the rhythm of the words 
exploited in later Nike ads with Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensual, even shocking, bedroom material, deleted to avoid an X rating, is 
included here. "When the decision came down (to delete the offending material), 
I thought it was racist," Lee recalls. Since the film was being released by 
independent Island Pictures, "they didn't have the firepower that the major 
studios have. They can change an X into an R," he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which ultimately cost $175,000, including post-production, brought 
in an estimated$8 million, and Lee, at the helm of a new wave of adventurous, 
visionary black filmmakers, went on to make "School Daze," "Jungle Fever" and 
"Malcolm X," all stamped with his unique perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 But none have the freshness, even sweetness, of "She's Gotta Have It," raw 
filmmaking at its best, captured beautifully in this handsome laser disc 
produced by Donna Michele Edge and Mary G. Pratt and executive produced by 
Peter Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the package is the imaginative original theatrical trailer, 
the film's music video, a deleted scene ("Clorinda moves out"), David Lee's 
unit photography work with his audio commentary, plus those jumping Nike ads 
and other supplementary material. Laserbits

(MCA/Universal, $35); "Geronimo" (Columbia TriStar, $35).

THEATER BEAT: CORNERSTONE BOLDLY GOES WHERE FEW DARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the unique accomplishments of Cornerstone Theatre Company's "L.A. 
Building," which is traveling to various venues in the area, the traditional 
criteria of dramatic criticism prove largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the work fails to measure up -- far from it. But the usual yardsticks 
miss the real significance in this profoundly affecting theatrical experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerstone's mission is to venture where the pros dare not tread -- into 
communities lacking an established theater life, where through workshops, 
classes and volunteer efforts the company creates and performs original works 
integrating the skills of troupe regulars with the emerging talents of local 
non-professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Having successfully completed a round of three community-based projects 
incorporating primarily black, Latino, Arabic and elderly populations, 
Cornerstone has initiated the second phase of its program with "L.A. Building," 
which combines the three previous casts in a story centered on an ethnically 
diverse apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in the same place but sharing little else, the tenants' interwoven 
stories compose an allegory of life in L.A., bridging cultural divides in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 In one apartment, a white ESL teacher (Benajah Cobb) tries to care for his two 
children and mother-in-law after his wife's death. In another, the black 
apartment manager (Angelia Fowler) wrestles with conflicting loyalties to the 
husband (Shishir Kurup) who once deserted her and her present Latino boyfriend 
(Armando Molina, alternating with Richard Miro). A young actress (Pauline Guld) 
tries to extricate herself from her seedy porn flick manager (Christopher Liam 
Moore). Next door, a proud Lebanese couple (Tamadhur Al Aqeel and Ismael 
Kanater) conceal their poverty from the husband's visiting father (George 
Haddad). 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the backdrop of gunshots, aftershocks and scams (like the fruit vendor 
selling oranges in "L.A. dozens" -- 11 to a bag), these stories of hardship, 
struggle and undefeatable humanity resonate with the kind of authenticity 
beside which more conventionally polished staging seems pale and artificial. 
</P>
<P>
 * "L.A. Building," Today-Sunday , Druze Cultural Center, 2239 Merton Ave., 
Eagle Rock; July 28-31 at Stage 2, Culver Studios, 9336 W. Washington Blvd.,

THEATER BEAT: COMIC, TRAGIC LOOK AT 'BOYS NEXT DOOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Griffin's "The Boys Next Door" probably should not work as well as it 
does. In some ways, it's predictable, politically correct, movie-of-the-week 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a group called Neurotic Young Urbanites has tapped the most moving and 
sincere elements in Griffin's melodrama about four mentally impaired men 
sharing an apartment. The result, at the Zephyr Theatre, is a seamless and 
enormously entertaining journey into a world that's hard to capture 
convincingly onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's main point is that the labels we put on the mentally impaired rob 
them of humanity, hindering rather than helping their efforts to become 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Griffin shrewdly draws upon these very character types, caught in 
funny and sometimes tragic situations: a compulsive paranoid (Patrick 
Fischler), a mildly retarded doughnut shop worker (John Barba), a severely 
retarded man-child (Marcus Turner) and a schizophrenic golf pro (Paul 
Wittenburg). 
</P>
<P>
 Providing perspective and narration is the foursome's beleaguered social 
worker, Jack (the soulful Christopher Shea). "I don't know if this is the 
happiest place in the world or the saddest," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the script's success depends on the playwright's skill in moving 
between comedy and pathos. But this cast, under Darren Weatherford's direction, 
gives the effort an extra charge with honest, beautifully textured portrayals. 
A tender dance between one of the residents and his would-be girlfriend counts 
as one memorable moment among many. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: 'BREEZE OF SUMMER' BLOWS ITS LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT COLLINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leslie Lee's "The First Breeze of Summer" may be a good play, but one would 
never know it from the production at the Globe Playhouse in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a small northeastern city in 1975, Lee's drama looks at how racism has 
affected three generations of an African American family.The central conflict 
is between young Lou Edwards (Trevelyon Williams), a would-be medical student 
confronting his racial and sexual identity, and his ailing grandmother (Aloma 
Wright), whose painful past is recounted in flashback. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some unfortunate stereotypes of whites -- including an unscrupulous 
contractor who tries to cheat Lou's father (Daniel W. Williams) -- the play 
tries to warmly and honestly portray a close-knit family perpetually thwarted 
by a racist society. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that director Sam Nickens' production is really not ready for a 
paying audience. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent afternoon, several understudies were playing crucial parts, 
including one last-minute replacement who read his lines from the script. A 
number of scenes have been awkwardly staged. A deathbed finale emerges as a 
histrionic embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The First Breeze of Summer," Globe Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings Road, West 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends July 31. $15. (213)

TV REVIEWS; 'BODILY FUNCTIONS' SHOWCASES THREE FOREIGN ANIMATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bodily Functions," a program of three foreign animated shorts presented on 
"Alive TV" tonight, demonstrates the haunting power of genuine surrealism -- 
and the weakness of artsy posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Food," a three-part rumination on hunger and waste, the acclaimed Czech 
filmmaker Jan Svankmajer seamlessly blends pixilation, live-action and 
stop-motion animation.These eerie vignettes depict humans devolving into 
vending machines and cannibals with a calm logic that renders the scenarios all 
the more unsettling. Simultaneously realistic and dreamlike, "Food" 
demonstrates Svankmajer's extraordinary skill at manipulating visuals to touch 
deep inner chords. 
</P>
<P>
 Beriou uses computer techniques to simulate the metamorphosis of body parts, 
photographs and butterflies in "Ex-Memoriam" (France). With its pretentious 
sci-fi narrative, "Memoriam" remains an arid exercise in technique that never 
really connects with the viewer. As Beriou has observed, " 'Ex-Memoriam' cannot 
really be called a film; even less can it be called a story." Nor can it be 
called entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deadsy" (Scotland), by David Anderson, has screened locally in several 
programs of short films. Ostensibly an examination of "man's fascination with 
weaponry and the sexual power of military aggression," "Deadsy" combines a 
pseudo-Joycean soundtrack with a disorganized collage of multimedia imagery 
that rarely rises above the sophomoric. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bodily Functions" airs at 11:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28. It is 
preceded at 11 p.m. by another "Alive TV" installment featuring the 
Oscar-nominated live-action short "Down on the Waterfront," with Ed Asner and 
Jason Alexander.

TV REVIEWS; SHOWTIME'S 'REBEL HIGHWAY' RECYCLES AIP 'CLASSICS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they can remake "Angels in the Outfield" and "Lassie" for the '90s, by gum, 
they can remake "Confessions of a Sorority Girl" and "Runaway Daughters." Which 
is just the inevitable exercise that Showtime has undertaken with its new 
series of Friday night movies, collectively titled "Rebel Highway." The 10 
reconstituted titles in this "drive-in pictures" series mostly hail from the 
vaults of AIP -- American International Pictures, a.k.a. Always Irritating 
Prudes -- with well-known contemporary directors trying their hands at trash 
recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they veritably ripped from today's headlines, these stories, like "Reform 
School Girl" and "Motorcycle Gang"? Uh, no. But many hemlines will get ripped, 
at least, in the coming weeks, and the series' indomitable appeal proves 
nothing if not that juvenile delinquency knows no season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's premiere offering, "Roadracers," is the second feature-length effort 
from Robert Rodriguez -- who is uniquely qualified to direct one of these 
pictures, since his critically hailed debut, "El Mariachi," was micro-budgeted 
even by old AIP standards. Though each of these Showtime features costs a 
relatively robust $1.3 million, success hasn't spoiled Rodriguez: "Roadracers," 
too, looks and feels as if it were done on the fly, with adrenaline dripping 
into the editing bay. Sam Arkoff would be proud, or at least not ticked off. 
</P>
<P>
 A la several of the filmmakers involved, Rodriguez hasn't actually remade the 
original "Roadracers" but just borrowed the title and started from scratch. His 
version has a good -- or at least, er, soulful -- leather-bearing hood, Dude 
(David Arquette), battling a nasty one, Teddy (Jason Wiles), in diners and on 
extemporaneous drag strips all over town, while an almost nonstop rockabilly 
soundtrack eggs them on. 
</P>
<P>
 Dude also has a voluptuous Latino dreamgirl to alternately pout and cheer him 
along. When he comes to pick her up, he sticks his tongue down her throat in 
broad view of her aghast parental units and promises, "I'll be sure to get her 
back as late as I can." One of their dates is at the roller rink, where Dude 
and Teddy and their respective cliques will momentarily ditch dragsters for a 
rumble on skates. It ain't quite the "Ben-Hur" chariot race, but it suffices 
quite nicely; watching Dude derail his rival by literally greasing the track 
with his 'do has to count as one of the week's major TV pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roadracers" is a giddily shameless paean to misspent youth. By contrast, John 
Milius' taut suspenser "Motorcycle Gang," which airs in two weeks, takes just 
the opposite tack; there, Gerald McRaney plays an upright ex-Marine dad who 
must rescue his virgin daughter from the clutches of socially licentious 
beatniks and psychopathic bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 And in three weeks, in Joe Dante's very funny "Runaway Daughters," as a 
supporting character there's the James Dean-like iconoclast who answers his 
folks' every query with the tremulously voiced "Don't crowd me!" In the passion 
pit, it matters little whether the hood is misunderstood or murderous, menace 
to society or martyr; the odor of leather will do. Grease up the popcorn: The 
early, stupidly fun installments of "Rebel Highway" really do smell like teen 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Roadracers" airs on Showtime at 10 tonight and again on Thursday at 8 p.m.

JAZZ REVIEW; PIZZARELLI RECALLS NAT COLE TRIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Pizzarelli, who brought his trio to the Jazz Bakery on Wednesday for a 
two-day run, followed in a sense in the hand-steps of his father, Bucky 
Pizzarelli, by taking out a seven-string guitar. After playing and singing in a 
duo with the senior Pizzarelli, he began working with his own trio and has 
since built up a strong following. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 34, he has several popular albums to his credit. Though not in a class 
with Bucky instrumentally, he has acquired a measure of popularity for a vocal 
style that brings to mind the early years of Harry Connick Jr. His timbre lacks 
strength, but he appeals to an audience for whom his unconventional repertoire 
of old standards and imaginative originals are major plus factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly his main source of inspiration is Nat King Cole. He uses the 
piano-guitar-bass instrumentation first established by Cole and brings a 
relaxed sensitivity to such half-forgotten songs as "Beautiful Moons Ago" (by 
Oscar Moore, who was Cole's guitarist) and a medley of "Baby" tunes that 
includes Don Redman's "Gee Baby Ain't I Good to You" and Bobby Troup's "Baby, 
Baby All the Time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzarelli introduces his material with a wit and anecdotal charm that 
contributes significantly to his success; in fact, he is as much essentially an 
entertainer as a musician. His sidemen, brother Martin Pizzarelli on bass and 
Ray Kennedy on piano, are adequate performers but lack the swinging creativity 
that set such groups as Cole's and Oscar Peterson's on the road to fame.

FINDING A FILM'S ESSENCE; POSTER DESIGNER JOHN ALVIN HAS CREATED LASTING IMAGES 
FOR SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR MOVIES EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've seen John Alvin's work, and probably remember it, even if youdon't know 
his name. The poster for Disney's current animated smash, "The Lion King," is 
his. And it was the 45-year-old Alvin who did the one-sheet, or poster, for 
Steven Spielberg's "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" (1982). 
</P>
<P>
 That's the one in which the lovable alien's elongated finger reaches out in 
digital embrace to the extended finger of his human friend (actually Alvin's 
then-6-year-old daughter Farah). The "E.T." poster is classic Alvin, as 
memorable and schmaltzy as good chopped liver, the image infused with cosmic 
optimism and rigged to set off viewer emotions through visual references to 
everything from Michelangelo's "Creation" -- God reaches out to newly created 
man -- to the fetus- hurling- through- darkest- outer- space sequence in 
Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of more than 100 movie campaigns, Alvin has the distinction of 
having created posters for 10 of the most popular films of all time -- "E.T.," 
"Aladdin," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (the most recent re-release), 
"Rain Man," "Batman Returns," "Gremlins," "Beauty and the Beast," "City 
Slickers," "Hook" and "Blazing Saddles." Creating classic movie posters doesn't 
make you famous, obviously, or Alvin wouldn't be what he describes as "the 
best-kept secret in the movie business." But the artist, or "visual 
problem-solver" as he has described himself, has found a lucrative, albeit 
unheralded, niche in the film industry, one that is financially and 
artistically rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin has always had a knack for coming up with the iconic image that is the 
key to a successful poster. He was the kid everybody wanted to do the posters 
for the class plays at Pacific Grove High School in central California, where 
he grew up. Later, Alvin refined his posteresque sensibility and acquired a 
full panoply of artist's skills and techniques as a student at the Art Center 
College of Design, then in Downtown Los Angeles. It was there that he met his 
wife, Andrea, a painter as well as Alvin's partner in the design business they 
run out of their Northridge home.  
</P>
<P>
 Alvin broke into the movie poster business 20 years ago, when friends who 
worked at Warner Bros. told him Mel Brooks was unhappy with the marketing 
materials proposed for "Blazing Saddles." Alvin quickly produced a poster that 
was almost as unusual as the movie -- a serious, even formal composition using 
zany visual elements from the film. Alvin often refers to his wife as his 
secret weapon, and she made a small but critical contribution to Alvin's first 
hit poster by proposing that the headdress worn by Brooks as the 
Yiddish-speaking Indian chief bear the beaded inscription, "Kosher for 
Passover" -- in Hebrew, of course. The joke was just what was needed, Alvin 
says, "to take the edge off what was basically serious art." Brooks loved it, 
and the Alvins have worked with him on pictures ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Alvin, a poster is essentially a promise of a wonderful cinematic 
time to come. In designing the poster for "The Lion King," he recalls, "even 
before we knew the story, we were trying to capture the feeling you get when 
you see the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Alvin often has very little to guide him when he starts a 
project. He rarely has the luxury of screening a finished film before he must 
find a way to make its essence visible, although he did get to see director 
Ridley Scott's original cut of "Blade Runner" (1982) before creating that 
film's now highly collectible one-sheet. But the "E.T." poster evolved from 
nothing more than a hurried reading of the script in a borrowed office at 
Universal and Spielberg's idea of capturing a Michelangelo moment, conveyed to 
Alvin secondhand. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Alvin never sat down with the animators to discuss "The Lion King" 
before he did the poster. In fact, he's never met the Disney artists, although 
he says he'd love to. Instead, a Disney executive gave Alvin a fortune-cookie 
summary of the film, something along the lines of "It's like Hamlet meets King 
Arthur in Bambi-land, only without the forest." That, some discussion and 
Alvin's lifelong familiarity with the art of Disney was enough to inspire the 
final poster, with its powerful image of the ascended King of Beasts.  
</P>
<P>
 Alvin has been working regularly with Disney since "Arachnophobia" (1990). His 
forte is helping create campaigns that appeal to Disney's considerable adult 
audience, one of whom is Alvin himself ("Maybe I've always been close to the 
mouse," he muses). As Alvin explains, since 1989's "The Little Mermaid," Disney 
has typically developed two different posters, and indeed two full-fledged 
marketing campaigns, for each film -- an adult one and a juvenile one. "The 
juvenile image will typically show every character interacting -- a big, happy 
party," Alvin says. "The adult image will usually be more elegant, more 
symbolic." As Andrea Alvin observes, "people come to John when they want a 
mood, they want that magical aura." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The adult image is more of a tease, frankly," says Alvin. "Sometimes the less 
that's shown, the better it is." A perfect example is the adult poster for 
"Beauty and the Beast" in which the backlit figures of Belle and her monstrous 
suitor are shown slow dancing in an image that evokes the emotions of both 
fairy tale and senior prom. "In 'Beauty and the Beast,' " Alvin notes, "you 
never actually see them dancing that way, in that ethereal light, but you feel 
them that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin's ability to infuse his posters with feeling is one reason Disney 
executive Fred Tio wanted Alvin for "The Lion King." "His work inspires me," 
says Tio, Disney vice president of creative services. "He brings emotion into 
his artwork that a lot of times can only be captured in an illustration." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways Alvin achieves the moody look of so many of his posters is by 
using an airbrush. The airbrush has been one of his favorite tools since high 
school, when he realized it could be used for more than spray-painting pictures 
of fast cars on T-shirts. With an airbrush, he says, he is able to imply soft 
focus, to create atmosphere, to suggest mist and vapor. It also allows him to 
blend and overlay colors in original ways. "If you're clever, you can induce a 
nice, dreamlike image," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife says that Alvin uses whatever means necessary to achieve the desired 
effect. "He'd use Rice Krispies, if he thought they would work." And, 
increasingly, that means exploiting the design potential of an Apple computer. 
"If we've done anything wisely in the last five years," says Alvin, "it's to 
use technology as a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin is amazed how many traditionally trained artists approach the new 
technology with fear and loathing. But he believes both the pencil and the 
computer can be the artist's friend. "We've benefited enormously from 
contemporary technology," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he describes how the family Mac helped create the poster for 
"The Lion King." The final version began, Alvin says, as a 9-by-12-inch paint 
study of the heavenly lion's head. The original painting was "very orange, very 
hot, very African." 
</P>
<P>
 The paint study was scanned into their computer, and Alvin took it on disk to 
a meeting at Disney. The marketing people loved it but thought it should be 
blue, not orange. So instead of repainting the picture, Alvin recalibrated the 
color on the Macintosh to create a blue version. Later he added a frame from 
the film to the bottom of the image -- so that all the animals of the Serengeti 
now seem to be gathered beneath the paternal gaze of the Lion King. Finally, 
with the computer-altered image as a guide, he did a large painting, using his 
beloved airbrush, that became the haunting poster appearing now at a theater 
near you.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; AT 81, A LEGEND'S STILL CROONING; FRANKIE LAINE, A TOP 
RECORDING ARTIST IN THE '40S AND '50S WITH AT LEAST 20 GOLD RECORDS, WILL SING 
IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD.

<P>
 The baby boom generation remembers singer Frankie Laine mainly for his 
energetic vocal performance of the theme song to "Rawhide," television cowboy 
series from the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, millions tuned in for the oater, starring Clint Eastwood and Eric 
Fleming, about the trials and tribulations of cattle drivers. The show would 
begin with Laine rhapsodically beseeching the cowboys: "Rollin', rollin', 
rollin', though those streams are swollen, keep those dogies rollin'. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a lot more to Frankie Laine than just "Rawhide."  
</P>
<P>
 He was a top recording artist in the 1940s and '50s who had at least 20 gold 
records and sold more than 100 million records, including such hits as 
"Jezebel," "I Believe," "Mule Train," and "Moonlight Gambler." He was possibly 
even more popular in Great Britain, where in spite of Beatlemania, his 1953 
recording of "I Believe" still holds the record for most consecutive weeks (18) 
at the top of the British charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 81, he is still singing. On July 30, he's giving a concert at the Academy 
Plaza Theatre in North Hollywood. Laine, who lives in San Diego, said he would 
definitely miss being involved with the music if he ever completely retired.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music drives me. It's what keeps me going," he said. "I lost my wife a 
year ago. A lot of people thought I would become a recluse."  
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Laine will perform at 5 and 8 p.m. July 30 at the Academy Plaza 
Theatre, corner of Lankershim and Magnolia boulevards in North Hollywood. 
Fiddler/violinist Bob Ryman will guest - star. Tickets are $15.50 and $21.50.

 NEW FASHION: The Alex Theatre in Glendale has replaced "Sophisticated Ladies" 
as its summer/fall season opener Saturday with the musical comedy "Fashion." 
"Sophisticated Ladies" may be produced in the future at the Alex, a spokesman 
said, but no firm plans have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Theatre spokesman Michael Sande said "Fashion," a less familiar musical, 
represents a change in direction for the Alex. After reviewing its first season 
of "Mame," "Fame" and "Sayonara," the Alex management decided to try something 
different. The focus now will be on new works and the "rediscovery of old 
classics that aren't produced very often," Sande said. New, but not too new.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion," with book by Anthony Stimac, music by Don Pippin and lyrics by 
Steve Brown, was an off-Broadway hit in 1974. Stimac, the new artistic director 
at the Alex, adapted the musical from the first successful play written by an 
American woman, Anna Cora Mowatt's "Fashion: or Life in New York," written in 
1845. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical's sudden opening at the Alex came about because this was the only 
time all the cast members selected for "Fashion" were not busy with other 
projects, Sande said. The production will feature Elkin Antoniou, Mary Jo 
Catlett, Jenifer Chatfield, Diane Delano, Frank Ferrante, Marjory Graue, Dale 
Kristien, Lorna Patterson, Henrietta Valor and Marcia Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Valor and Catlett were in the original off-Broadway production in 1974, where 
they were singled out for praise in a review by Clive Barnes in the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original production of Mowatt's play in 1845, Edgar Allan Poe, in his 
capacity as a theater critic, pronounced it "theatrical, but not dramatic." In 
the first adaptation of the musical in 1974, Stimac made the play into a 
musical within a musical, setting it in a society matron's home on Long Island. 
That home was also the headquarters of "The Long Island Masque and Wig 
Society," an organization devoted to the preservation of early American drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimac has updated the musical for its Alex production, setting the action in 
1994, where a group of Beverly Hills women gather to stage the musical.  
</P>
<P>
 Sande emphasized the main reason for the switch was cast availability, and it 
had nothing to do with the financial problems of the Theatre Corp. of America. 
In June, Theatre Corp., which produces the seasons at the Pasadena Playhouse 
and the Alex, laid off 44 of its 130 employees and canceled tours of its shows 
to several of its satellite cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion" will open at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Alex Theatre, 216 N. Brand 
Blvd., Glendale. Performances will be 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays plus 
Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Ends Aug. 7. Tickets are $10 to $42. 
Call (800) 233-3123.

A VIEW THAT'S ASKEW; THE TWO-MAN MULTIMEDIA TEAM DAMAGED CALIFORNIANS THRIVES 
ON THE UNCONVENTIONAL. NOW THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH CABLE TV. 
</P>

 The shark was scoping out the five-man underwater camera crew cornered in a 
coral reef off the Belize coast. "It was definitely waiting for one of us to 
screw up," says Scott Hessels, who with his partner, James Keitel, and three 
buddies was on a shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 And, naturally, they were nearly out of oxygen. Inch by inch, they rose -- 
sans wet suits -- to the surface, trying to avoid the sharp coral along the 
way. The shark's meal of humans and 16-millimeter camera got away that day in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hessels says, however, that he and Keitel, were looking at their mirror image 
in the underwater creature. "We're like sharks," Hessels says, sitting in the 
cozy den of Keitel's Van Nuys home. "Both of us never stop moving. We always 
got to get onto the next project, the next film, the next video, the next 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 In film industry terms, this is definitely a new spin on shark . Hessels and 
Keitel constitute Damaged Californians, a two-headed, four-legged multimedia 
entity that refuses to be defined or stand still. They haven't a clue, they 
admit, how to deal with the Hollywood business type out for blood. "They take 
us out to lunch," says Hessels, "and lunch is three carrots and broccoli on a 
huge plate. They don't get what we do at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone, though, must be getting Damaged Californians' newest work, "Below 
30/Above 10,000" -- the pair's first feature and the first to be shot on film 
-- because it's on television. Specifically, this weekend on the 90s Channel 
(carried by United Artists Cable in the Valley), the freewheeling purveyor of 
independent and home video with a decidedly political bent.  
</P>
<P>
 But "Below 30" depicts the spontaneous camping trip of a trio of pals who 
arrive in the mountains only to overhear -- and become dominated by -- a 
running dialogue between (yes) the mountains and the neighboring lake. 
Underpinning it all is a sense of 20-ish dread, and soundtrack music supplied 
by such Los Angeles-based musicians as Anna Homler, Musclecar, Acorn, Kaoru and 
the recently disbanded Ethyl Meatplow. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the documentary-oriented 90s Channel air such a nutty, surreal 
movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a really hip combination of art film and ecological film," says 
90s Channel project manager Jodi Kimura, by telephone from the channel's 
offices in Boulder, Colo. "Our channel is about shattering the limits of 
conventional TV, and Damaged Californians definitely do that in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a listing of the titles of their video shorts gives an idea how 
potentially damaged these guys are: "Hillbilly Slid Loudly" (1988), "The Radar 
of Small Dogs" (1990), "Airline Safety Film 4A" (1991) and "Revolutionary War 
Filmstrip" (1992). (All, except "Hillbilly," are airing with "Below 30.") As a 
measure of the developing international cult following for the D-Cals, an 
Australian band took the name The Radar of Small Dogs in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Hessels is wont to remind, film and video are only two of the group's 
several media. They have produced radio projects with their constant music 
collaborator, Michael Whitmore, including one in which Hessels taped and edited 
into a montage several older women calling their cats. The D-Cals also like to 
go live, with performance art that has ranged from an elaborate show held on 
the opening day of the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach Blue Line commuter train to an 
act at Kelbo's Tiki Lounge featuring TV monitors as part of their costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be wrong, though, to assume that the prolific Hessels and Keitel 
(already busily preparing their next work, a feature film titled "Wanderlust") 
are joined at the hip. Keitel says, "We're really different, which is why we're 
friends" -- then Hessels finishes the thought -- "and why we work together so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Keitel, 30, is ruddy, dark-haired and quiet. Hessels, 36, is slender, 
light-haired and effortlessly glib. Keitel studied auto technology at Denver's 
Institute of Technology, "but I didn't want to work on cars the rest of my 
life, so I took a video editing course at the Denver Free University, the only 
one in my class who actually wanted to make videos for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Hessels majored in English at the University of Colorado, with a specialty in 
German literature -- "especially (Bertolt) Brecht, and Thomas Mann's fragmented 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
 The D-Cals whittle it down this way: "I like to experiment with story and 
language," says Hessels, with Keitel adding, "and I like to experiment with 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 They co-produce their works, with Hessels as writer and Keitel as director. 
Even a brief video like "Radar" typically becomes a months-long project. In 
that piece, Hessels' entire back yard was given over to "growing weird things, 
building lots of plastic tubing, so the whole area started looking like an 
alien planet colony."  
</P>
<P>
 They almost outdid themselves, though, filming "Below 30/Above 10,000" on a 
microscopic, $40,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A small crew ventured to the Belize coast for the underwater shooting, but its 
talented cameraman, Duane Manwiller, then left for paying work. 
</P>
<P>
 The group went through two more cameramen, and the cast of three helped 
everyone lug pounds of equipment every weekend to the second, primary location 
in the John Muir Wilderness in California's eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Keitel invented what he calls his "halo-cam," which allowed him to film 
360-degree camera moves on top of a moving car. As the title suggests, shooting 
was often at 10,000 feet or higher. Sleet storms came at inopportune times, as 
when actor Jeffrey Glickman was naked in a lake delivering a long speech, and 
"everybody got hit by altitude sickness," Hessels recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors, Keitel notes, kept asking him what Hessels' poeticized script 
meant, but Hessels explains it in abstract terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most film stories move horizontally. I wanted to write a film that moved 
vertically, from everyday to profound, from sea level to mountains, from prose 
to poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a metaphor movie, and it's probably a metaphor for both of us." WHERE 
AND WHEN 
</P>

 What: "Below 30/Above 10,000."

RENDERINGS FROM WITHIN; THE INTROSPECTIVE EXHIBITION 'STILLNESS' ENCOURAGES 
VIEWERS TO PONDER THEIR PERSONAL INNER WORLDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peace and quiet and time for reflection often elude us in our volatile urban 
environ ment. Artists, however, manage to remove themselves from the fray and 
contemplate the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that musing may come various artistic expressions, from angry, 
tumultuous commentaries on personal and social problems to introspective and 
metaphorical visions that take viewers away from the hubbub and cause them to 
pause in thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58 images by three artists at the Mythos gallery in Burbank are of the 
latter kind, meditative works that transport one into the emotional and 
intellectual as well as aesthetic realms of the artists. Additionally, they 
encourage viewers to ponder their own inner worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show, titled "A Stillness," Mythos presents watercolors by Elizabeth 
Ranelagh, pastels by Barbara Kolo and photography by Valerie Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stylistically, they are not the same, but each artist's (works) exhibit a 
quietness and stillness," said gallery director Glen Doll. "For me, there's a 
psychological depth to them. They have that in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Doll also said they demonstrate the artist's command of medium and technique. 
"I have a predilection for work that has some skill of hand, some mastery," 
Doll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranelagh's watercolor series presents mostly images of a nude male and female 
in richly colored, natural but stylized environments. Sometimes the figures 
languish on the green, reading a book or newspaper. They might share the rather 
idyllic landscapes with a dog, birds and sometimes fish. In some images, the 
woman is obviously pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable to me how expressive her faces are without much detail. I 
think it's a very neat trick," Doll said. He sees the "thoughtfulness of the 
people in her works. They seem to really have something on their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 That is especially true of the man and woman in "River Walk." They stand 
facing the viewer but are unconcerned with the outside world. Their lower 
torsos are submerged in deep blue, still water, the water a "metaphor for the 
unconscious," Doll said. 
</P>
<P>
 This couple appears almost to be in motion through the body of water, but the 
movement is not really physical, but psychological. He seems to want to lead 
and to be hesitant about doing that. She's not comfortable with the situation. 
Some viewers will consider this image a good example of the quandaries men and 
women grapple with in partnerships today. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kolo creates unusual, poignant images of flowers. Cut from their stems 
and vines, they are still beautiful but their beauty is of a less vibrant 
nature than the typical depictions of cut flowers. These are mature flowers. In 
fact, they embody feelings of aging, and death not far away. They've seen 
better days but they still appeal to us with their sensuous colors and 
textures, their complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, "White Rose Dark," the one flower image of Kolo's that conveys the 
more commonly depicted vitality of fresh flowers, is not of a real flower, but 
a flower pin -- a piece of costume jewelry that remains forever young. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Valerie Gates' black-and-white photographs recall the pictorial 
images of the early part of the 20th Century. But with her well-composed, slyly 
humorous tableaux, she strives to make them more than a rehash of previous 
techniques. As with Ranelagh and Kolo, one of her concerns is our relationship 
with nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "These works all have a life of their own," Doll said. And "they have the 
ability to elicit a wide range of ideas." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "A Stillness." 
</P>

OUT OF THE DARKNESS; JIM GEOGHAN'S PLAY, 'LIGHT SENSITIVE,' ILLUMINATES LIVES 
STUCK IN RUTS, AND THE ISSUES OF BLINDNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T. H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody's in a rut. At least, it seems that way. That's what playwright Jim 
Geoghan was looking at when he started writing "Light Sensitive," opening this 
weekend at Actors Alley's temporary quarters in a large green and white tent at 
North Hollywood's Academy Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But Geoghan wanted to go beyond the ordinary, beyond what most people complain 
about. He wanted three people in the deepest, bleakest rut possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's title refers to the blindness of its main character, ex-cabbie Tom, 
who's afraid of finding light in his dark world. His best friend, who was 
helping Tom jump-start his car when the battery exploded and blinded Tom, is 
riddled with a guilt that keeps him at Tom's beck and call. Seeking a way out, 
he brings in a woman -- a reader from the Lighthouse for the Blind -- to 
distract Tom. Even though she comes from a well-to-do family, the reader 
suffers from a family created lack of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoghan, best-known for his hit play "Only Kidding," which ran more than a 
year off-Broadway, found seeds for this play in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the female character's point of view," he says, "there's a phenomenon I 
saw in my neighborhood. There were a lot of large families, and there would 
always be in some of these families one kid who wasn't quite right. But nobody 
ever identified what it was, for sure. It was always softly spoken. So that as 
all these kids got married, this would be the one that stayed home. What it was 
was a sort of enforced insurance policy on the part of the parents to make sure 
one of the kids didn't leave home. The woman in the play is no exception to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of his blind ex-cabbie was more complex. Geoghan worked with the 
blind at New York's Lighthouse when he was in college. Among other things, he 
was intrigued by the sexuality of blind people, their romantic notions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found blind men," Geoghan remembers, "to be much more horny than anyone I'd 
ever met before. It took me about a year to figure it out. I put together my 
own 10-cent theory, which is that sighted people gratify themselves visually 
all day long in bits and pieces. You look, you look, you like, you look. But 
blind people don't get to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to wonder about the relationship between eyesight, sexuality, 
romance, and how one affects the other. Eventually, how a very active romance 
and falling in love is almost like a metaphorical picture-taking. The play grew 
out of those feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 The explicitness of Geoghan's descriptions of women for his blind friends 
reminded him that they were just like him. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Mullavey, who played Mary's husband on "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," is 
Tom. He learned to play a blind man by walking around his own house with his 
eyes closed. He says the role proved insightful.  
</P>
<P>
 "I discovered in the play," Mullavey says, "that this guy is not special. He 
lost his sight in an accident. He's angry. He has lots of feelings. He's as 
normal as you or I. Perhaps he has more heightened feelings because of his 
blindness, and he has as many romantic ideas as anyone else. We tend to assume 
that handicapped people are non-sexual. I have. The play has given me insight 
as an actor, and as a human being. They want exactly what I've always wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of its heavy subject matter, the play has humor. Director Everett 
Chambers, known as a producer of such TV films as "Beverly Hills Madam" and of 
such TV series as "Colombo," says: "The humor comes out of the relationships, 
the characters, how they behave with one another. They're in a situation that 
is a little black, and they are able to see the humor in it. All three of these 
characters are wounded birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoghan, whose background is in stand-up comedy, agrees that this play is no 
place for jokes. "They're in appalling circumstances, and they say appalling 
things. There's no way to monitor it. They're bound to be funny at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Geoghan thinks of his trio as heroes. "Anyone," he says, 
"who overcomes their own personal difficulties in any degree has got to have 
some heroism in them." 
</P>
<P>
 All three characters, to one degree or another, have heroic things to do in 
this volatile situation, things they didn't think they were capable of, making 
brave decisions and climbing out of their ruts, redefining themselves and their 
relationships. And Geoghan doesn't let them off easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go to the theater," he says with a wide grin, "and take the gloves off. 
Let's duke it up with bare knuckles. It's no time for nice. That's why we've 
got theater, isn't it, to work these things out?" WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Light Sensitive."

CHAOS AND FUN; EAGLES COFFEE PUB, A VENUE THAT RECALLS THE PUNK SCENE, OFFERS 
THE RANGE FROM JAZZ TO INDIE-ROCK. IT'S ALL OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM.

 Along today's post-Nirvana musical superhighway, no band's origins are too 
humble, no group is too unpolished, and no music is too offensive -- meaning a 
loud, young band from the San Fernando Valley has as much chance as any to 
reach the top of the hipsters' hit parade. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Hollywood mainstay clubs increasingly offer better-known fare, 
North Hollywood's Eagles Coffee Pub and NewsStand Gallery, with a new booker 
and a new lineup, is more than ready to showcase the newest local talent from 
the Valley and the rest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles started three years ago as a coffeehouse on a funky block of Lankershim 
Boulevard just north of Magnolia Boulevard. About seven months ago, noting a 
dearth of hot live-music spots in the Valley, Eagles expanded, adding a small 
(capacity 60), dark club. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days a week, Eagles' club side is taken over by outside groups. Monday 
nights are dedicated to storytelling; Tuesdays are for My Secret Place, a 
folksy-rock open microphone night with an older crowd and an opening set of 
featured guests; and starting this month, Wednesdays are set aside for the 
newly christened Caffinated Comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursdays through Sundays are for Joe Prignano's brand of 
outside-the-mainstream music. 
</P>
<P>
 Prignano, a 28-year-old NoHo resident, started at Eagles when the cafe opened 
and became the new club's main booker this month. His goal is to present 
garage-style, independent-label -- or "indie-rock," -- music on Thursdays and 
Fridays, leave Saturdays as a grab bag of different rock styles and use Sunday 
nights for a jazz showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musically, Eagles offers a place reminiscent of the kind of late-'70s punk 
scene, where clubs were more open to all types of music," Prignano said. 
"Everyone comes here, the whole spectrum. There's no real clique group." 
</P>
<P>
 Cover charges are rarely more than $4, and the no-alcohol coffee pub is open 
to all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the eclectic music that ensures a diverse crowd -- which, between 
sets, often spills out onto the sidewalks or next door to the cafe. When Eagles 
featured a band called Full Frontal Nudity, composed of five students from 
North Hollywood High School, the small club was packed with the under-18 set. 
Louder bands draw the nose-ring crowd, and the tamer alternative rock groups 
bring in the average Valley twentysomethings. Many nights, the club's crowd is 
a mixture of all of the above, with as many Eagles-goers sporting polo collars 
and button-down shirts as wearing goatees and Doc Martens combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night Digajiga headlined, 20-year-old Sandra Block of Tarzana tried 
Eagles for the first time. As many of the concert-goers popped into the cafe 
for a quick cup of coffee to go and then headed next door to the music 
venue/magazine stand, Block made her way toward the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of twos and threes walked with her past the long racks of magazines 
that separate the music space from the newsstand, eyeing titles that range from 
Off Our Backs, a feminist magazine, to Hustler and National Review. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the small back room that serves as the music area, Block hovered near 
the back, facing the counters and stools that run along two side walls and the 
few brown tables and chairs in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are deep yellow and the ceiling is burgundy, giving the room a dim 
glow. On one wall hang Kevin Christopher's paintings of contorted bodies 
floating next to seemingly meaningless prose; on the other are framed original 
comic strips by artist Dave It. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the atmosphere," concluded Block, a student at Brandeis University in 
Massachusetts. "It has its own style and attitude. People are really friendly 
-- I've already met a few people." 
</P>
<P>
 Digajiga, a Los Angeles-based band that calls its music "progressive beatnik 
acid-jazz," also had its own attitude. Prignano noted proudly that club-goers 
were unlikely to hear the band's type of satirical lyrics and pounding 
bongo-funk beat at many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 And though there are many in the Valley who would be glad to know where not to 
go, others have happily found a niche at Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here functions on the basis of chaos," Prignano said. "But it 
works. It makes it fun for everybody." WHERE AND WHEN

A FREE SPIRIT; LES HOOPER LIKES TO MIX THINGS UP WHEN HE COMPOSES. 'I DON'T 
WANT TO BORE MYSELF,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

for The Times.

<P>
 "Anything Goes" is Les Hooper's theme song. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just because he likes the Cole Porter tune (from the 1934 Broadway 
show of the same name), but because he bases his musical philosophy on the same 
libertine attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of doing songs weird. That leaves them open for all kinds of 
stuff," says Hooper, 54. "That's my personality. I tend to get bored easily, so 
when I write, I don't want to bore myself, so I try to find new ways to turn 
things upside down and make them wacky." 
</P>
<P>
 This might make the composer and arranger, who appears Tuesday with his Big 
Band at the Moonlight Tango Cafe, sound like a modern-day Spike Jones, but he's 
far from just a novelty writer. He's been composing Big Band pieces for more 
than 20 years, and has racked up seven Grammy nominations for his wares. Hooper 
has also crafted the music for hundreds of commercial jingles, and he's written 
for TV and film. 
</P>
<P>
 His Big Band pieces, while imbued with all manner of contemporary sounds -- 
from New Orleans R&B to today's funk -- are still jazz-based at their center, 
and there's a good, foot-tapping feeling to his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hip, and I like that," says Lenetta Kidd, the singer who books the 
Moonlight Tango. "He's just an individualist in terms of his interpretations of 
songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper's explanation of his version of the '70s pop tune, "Look What They've 
Done to My Song, Ma," gives an idea of the sense of fun, and creativity, at 
play in his music. 
</P>
<P>
 "First I made it a quasi-two-beat, then it went into straight-ahead jazz," he 
begins. "Then I took bars of music and stretched them, then I diminished some, 
trying to make things unexpected. I try to set people up for something, but 
then not deliver. It plays with their heads. Overall, I try to keep the music 
extremely human." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rooster Parade," a tune that mixes contemporary funk with more traditional 
straight-ahead sounds, is also unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band plays rounds," Hooper says. "It's supposed to be fun for the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Rooster Parade" is one of several tunes Hooper has composed with a reference 
to poultry in the title. "There's 'Chicken Yard Social,' 'Poultry Guest,' 
'Chicken Scratch' and 'Chicken Pollo,' " he says. "These tunes have gotten to 
be a running gag. Like, there's a section at the end of 'Chicken Yard Social' 
where there are some staccato figures that sounds like a bunch of chickens 
clucking." This all comes from Hooper's childhood. "Our house in Baton Rouge 
was right next to a chicken ranch, and I used to wake up every day to the 
sounds of the chickens." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a serious side to Hooper, he admits. He points out that on Tuesday 
he'll offer slow ballads, among them Johnny Mandel's "Emily," featuring Clay 
Jenkins on trumpet. In addition, Preston Smith -- who leads the band the 
Crocodiles -- will sing Hooper arrangements of the bluesy favorite, "I Want a 
Little Girl" and Ann Ronell's classic "Willow Weep for Me." "I wrote that in a 
Nelson Riddle vein," says Hooper, talking about the great arranger who wrote so 
many wonderful charts for Frank Sinatra in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper fell in love with music as a youth in Baton Rouge, La., and was soon 
playing piano in local rock bands. He became interested in jazz, and after 
attending Louisiana State University, led a Big Band in Chicago, where he lived 
in the '70s. He moved to Los Angeles soon thereafter, and established himself 
as a smart composer. He wrote soundtracks for such TV shows as "Rhoda" and 
"Charlie's Angels," then gradually moved into commercial work, where he still 
makes the bulk of his living. 
</P>
<P>
 The musician has also branched into film. He wrote incidental music for, and 
his Big Band appeared in, Robert Altman's "The Player," and he recently 
completed the score for "Road Flower," a Miramax film by Deran Sarafian, 
starring Christopher Lambert and Craig Sheffer and due for release this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands of writing have kept Hooper, a Sherman Oaks resident, away from 
public performance for the past year, but he says the Moonlight Tango 
engagement should begin a new phase. "I've missed that individual expression 
that comes from playing," he says. "Playing and writing, they need each other."

COVER STORY; BEATING THE HEAT; WITH PLANNING, YOUR GARDEN WILL THRIVE DURING 
THE VALLEY'S SEARING SUMMER. TRY BRANCHING TREES, SUCCULENTS AND SUN-LOVING 
HERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN HEEGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Susan Heeger writes regularly about 
gardening for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer in the San Fernando Valley might be ideal for pool hopping, mall 
crawling or frying an egg on the sidewalk, but it's murder on the average 
fuchsia. As the mercury ticks past 90 and the Santa Anas start ripping, local 
gardens can literally dry up and blow away if nobody's watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot-weather garden vigilance often means more watering and more mulching, as 
well as introducing shade where it's needed to cool things down. But the most 
critical action, says Agoura landscape architect Gary Krause, involves planning 
-- during the summer and year-round -- to create a garden that can take the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to start by choosing plants that require less moisture -- not just 
California natives but exotics compatible with our climate," advises Krause, a 
professor of landscape architecture at Pierce College. "If people want things 
that are lusher, they can have them, but they should reduce the size of these 
plantings." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Perrino, a Woodland Hills landscape designer, agrees, calling Valley 
temperatures and dry winds "a double whammy" for the gardener. He points out 
that in these conditions, a plant's heat tolerance is just as crucial as its 
drought tolerance, and both factors should be considered during the selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Among plants that do well on both counts, Perrino recommends succulents, such 
as flower-like echeverias and blue-gray Senecio mandraliscae, and sun-loving 
herbs: lavenders, society garlic and assorted sages. Rather than grouping these 
with their own kind, he advocates mixing them with other blooming greens to 
make colorful borders that not only hold up in heat waves but present an 
interesting blend of textures.  
</P>
<P>
 Other wise summer choices include bougainvillea (especially good, says 
Perrino, against a scorching wall), reblooming day lilies and dwarf pampas 
grass. Pampas grass, which needs a lot of growing room, can work well on a 
large hillside and looks striking, Perrino says, in combination with something 
low and spreading such as Mexican bush sage. 
</P>
<P>
 While these plants drink far less during the summer than thirsty alternatives 
such as lawns, even they need some watering, either by drip or spray 
irrigation. Karen Petersen, assistant manager of Chatsworth Nursery, advises 
gardeners to make sure sprinklers are working and check plants constantly for 
signs of wilting. "Don't wait till something droops before you notice it," she 
counsels.  
</P>
<P>
 Large trees, in addition to regular watering, need a slow, deep soak every 
week or two. This is particularly important, Petersen says, because trees and 
other tall plants create welcome shade for a garden's lower-growing varieties. 
And during the hottest months, even tough greens need relief from the 
relentless bake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Open, branching trees that let in filtered light are great for this," she 
reports. "Our whole nursery is located under old California pepper trees." 
</P>
<P>
 She also recommends jacarandas, mimosas, locusts, African sumacs and albizias, 
all of which can be planted now if they are well watered. 
</P>
<P>
 If space is tight, large shrubs can be used for shading, too. Petersen's 
personal favorites for the job include Pittosporum tobira, raphiolepis, 
heavenly bamboo and a wide variety of viburnums. Beneath the patchy cool these 
provide, she says, any number of sunny greens would thrive: fortnight lily, 
agapanthus, geraniums, day lilies and statice, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, humans as well as plants need protection from the sun if they are 
to get out and garden during the summer. But as Krause points out, deciduous 
trees, in addition to shading the outdoors, bring the added benefit of cooling 
the indoors too, thus helping control a property's overall climate. By the same 
token, when the trees lose their leaves during the winter, the sun can 
penetrate and heat the house, something that won't happen to the same degree if 
trees are evergreen. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciduous vines, when trained to cover a back-yard lattice or pergola 
structure, serve a similar function, providing summer shade and letting in 
winter sunlight. According to Perrino, solanum vines (evergreen in mild 
winters, deciduous in extreme cold) are a good choice, because their delicate 
leaves let in the dappled light that patio plants need.  
</P>
<P>
 For those whose gardens lack overhead shade structures, Krause recommends a 
trip to a home-and-garden center, where kits are available for building simple 
pergolas, trellises and even gazebos. "All you need," he says, "is a basic 
frame, which you can enhance with plant material. You can drape it, too, with 
shade cloth -- available at any nursery -- which comes in different grades, 
according to how much light it lets through." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts also sing the praises of ornamental water in summer 
gardens. "It's amazing how small an amount you need to cool down an area and 
get that pleasing, relaxing sound," says Krause. A basic fountain, he adds, can 
be made from a large clay pot and a simple pump from a local garden center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so rewarding," says Petersen, "to live outdoors and enjoy the summer. We 
can do that here, from early morning into the evening -- work, sit, use our 
gardens to the max." Summer Survival Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Water early in the day. Evening watering can cause fungus and mildew 
problems and leaves plants thirsty during the day's heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water potted and newly installed plants more often than established greens 
-- once a day if needed. In extreme heat, spray plants lightly with the hose in 
the afternoon. This cools them and helps prevent the spread of insects and 
diseases such as rust. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure lawn areas and flower borders are on separate irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't over-water. 
</P>
<P>
 * To help retain moisture, mulch planting beds with composted organic matter 
such as shredded bark. Avoid fungus problems by keeping the mulch away from 
root crowns and trunks.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cut back on fertilizer and use a low-nitrogen formula to reduce plant growth 
-- and water consumption -- in the hot season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid heavy pruning to reduce the risk of damaging plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant early in the morning or late in the day.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: GARDEN DELIGHTS; LUIGI'S OFFERS THE STAPLES OF BACK-YARD 
TRANQUILLITY -- STATUARY, FOUNTAINS AND BIRDBATHS -- ALL AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK, Geri Cook's Bargains column runs every Friday in Valley Life!

<P>
 Accessories enhance the beauty of a garden or patio so easily and 
inexpensively that it's no wonder they are so sought after. 
</P>
<P>
 Statuary is always popular, especially when you personalize with your own 
theme -- Oriental, religious, animal -- whatever increases your sense of 
tranquillity. Fauna is used most, whether it's frogs, birds, fish or 
alligators. And then there are angels, angels and more angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi's Pottery & Garden Ware stocks a broad range of concrete fauna, and has 
a heavy supply of cherubs of all sizes and manner, ranging from $8 to $150. A 
charming wall piece of two angel faces is about 10 inches wide and costs a 
reasonable $39.  
</P>
<P>
 Owned and operated by the same family for 60 years, Luigi's seems to be the 
favorite of many astute garden fanciers, despite having two garden supply 
competitors within a block or two of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of my visit, I checked out the other stores and found more customers 
at Luigi's than at either of its neighbors. There also was no identifying sign 
or visible entrance to Luigi's -- the in crowd just seems to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi's focuses on items the others don't, and their prices are better for the 
quality of products they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Bells -- the only chimes Luigi's sells -- proved the point. 
Prices range from $40 to $240, compared to $80 to $600 for the same products 
elsewhere and in many catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialty of the house is fountains. The small interior fountain created 
by owner Gary McAllister is delightful. It is 12 inches wide and 8 inches high 
with a small electric pump that keeps the water (and the accompanying sound) 
trickling over stones. Luigi's price of $89.95 is definitely a bargain -- a 
fountain similar to this would cost at least $125 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other fountains vary in size from 3 to 8 feet long and cost from $75 (retail 
$150) to $525 (retail $800). There are catalogues with hundreds of different 
fountains, and about 50 fountains, discounted about 35% to 40%, are in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-tier fountain, about 5 feet tall with a submersible pump, runs $300 
rather than $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people can install the fountains themselves and save on the installation 
fee, McAllister says. 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete pots in all sizes are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A large one, measuring 21 by 20 inches, is $60 instead of $80 elsewhere, and 
the ratio of savings in other sizes is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdbaths also abound. A medium-size concrete birdbath, measuring 25 by 20 
inches, is $40; expect to pay about $60 at most places.

<P>
 Luigi's was founded by Sebastian and Dominica D'Angelo in 1934 and has been 
operated by their son-in-law, Lynn McAllister, for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Great-grandson Gary, who has become somewhat of an expert on fountains, 
recently took over. 
</P>
<P>
 McAllister says the business has been buying terra-cotta pots from the same 
source in Mexico for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to carry what other garden shops don't carry," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The rare black pots are an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Handmade in Oaxaca, Mexico, of black clay, they are becoming hard to get, and 
the stock here is slim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the standard terra-cotta pots, there is plenty to choose from in some 
unusual shapes and sizes, priced well below the average market price. WHERE AND 
WHEN

ORGANIZATIONS; FOR THE LOVE OF TRAINS; AN ASSOCIATION OF VOLUNTEERS IS SPRUCING 
UP OLD RAILWAY CARS AND TRACK, AND OFFERING RIDES AT TRAVEL TOWN. 
</P>

<P>
 They've been work-ing  
</P>
<P>
 on the rail-road,  
</P>
<P>
 all their Sat-ur-days . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All aboard to Travel Town. On the dawn train. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the window seats, if you will, for these 20 or so volunteers now arriving 
with their sleeves rolled up, mallets in hand, sandblasters and elbow grease at 
the ready. 
</P>
<P>
 And please, Mr. Conductor, let them all ride free. These guys have paid their 
dues. They've unleashed enough energy, inspiration and affection for history 
these past 10 years to fill a boxcar or two. 
</P>
<P>
 As "associates" (not "members") of the nonprofit Southern California Scenic 
Railway Assn. Inc., they spruce up cars, drive spikes, lay track and -- on the 
first Saturday and Sunday of every even-numbered month -- operate a diesel 
locomotive that pulls visitors in two cabooses on 400 feet of rail at Griffith 
Park's city-owned Travel Town train exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you care to donate to our work," said C. R. (Chell) Hurdle, a 
railway association past president. He wears a Santa Fe Railway conductor's cap 
when he's not in mask and goggles on Saturdays, sandblasting nine layers of 
cracked paint and scum off the interior walls and ceiling of a 1929 Pullman 
motorcar. 
</P>
<P>
 A group with "Scenic Railway" in its name evokes excursions along California's 
coast, a breathtaking view from a trestle that crosses a gorge. But to these 
rail buffs, "scenic" means the underbelly of a diesel locomotive, a 650-gallon 
fuel tank, a radiator fan that blows the way it did in the heat of postwar 
summers, back when "factory air" was something you breathed alongside a 
boilerplate, inside a sweatshop. 
</P>
<P>
 They're so smitten by rail-mania, too, that they can tell you more than you 
need to know about their work-in-progress motorcar that they call by its 
number, the "M.177," for which they've raised about $72,000 (of $145,000 
needed) for parts, retrofitting and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 They point out, for instance, that when the old M.177 (also nicknamed "Little 
Ranger") long ago carried mail and freight on Santa Fe spurs through rural 
Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle in the dead of August, it was 100 degrees 
outside and 180 inside where the engineer sat. Or they will swear on a stack of 
timetables that its thirst for fuel measured 10 gallons per mile.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, it's not just anybody who gives up otherwise free Saturdays (and 
some Sundays) for a head-to-toe immersion in the grit and grime of railroading 
the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Their immediate destination is the 1930s and 1940s. Their passion is propping 
up rusted carcasses of rail cars and locomotives left for dead after 
railroading had built dynasties, shaped destinies and forged America's 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 Their next stop: the 21st Century, when Los Angeles officials hope that Travel 
Town's tracks will be extended so that its restored trains can carry passengers 
to the nearby Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum and the Los Angeles Zoo and 
back -- a ride of about two miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Railroading is such an integral part of American life -- and our city, too, 
was built on railroads. Too many people have forgotten that," said Linda J. 
Barth, a historian and city Department of Recreation and Parks manager in 
charge of planning for Travel Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just dispensing dry, historical facts here. We're bringing 
railroading back to life. But, frankly, we're a long way from being able to 
utilize this place fully." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it seems an interminable journey, an impossible dream -- but not 
enough to keep many from sweating every detail past dusk, stopping only to wolf 
down a midday feast of grilled hamburgers, Sloppy Joe sandwiches and potato 
salad served most Saturdays by one associate's wife, Yvonne Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched Travel Town fall apart in the 1960s -- and it was disheartening," 
said Steve DeVorkin, 40, an SCSRA associate from North Hollywood. "But when I 
saw those plumes of black smoke go up from the Charley Atkins (a diesel 
locomotive named for Travel Town's late founder), I said, 'Wow! That's 
exciting! This place now has a purpose!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the SCSRA -- formed in 1984 and commissioned to help the city of Los 
Angeles revitalize Travel Town and its 35 rail cars, locomotives and trolleys 
-- has a virtually all-male membership of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, their weekday pursuits scarcely hint at railroading: They are 
stockbrokers, TV technicians, students, retirees. Some "armchair" associates 
live as far away as Kansas, swapping tales about how the M.177 served their 
prairie towns of Chanute, Emporia, Pittsburg and El Dorado, among others, 
before Santa Fe retired it in 1956, donating it to Los Angeles two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Few seem to worry that work on the M.177 is so plodding, that the group's 
Orient Express appetite for restoration far outstrips its Wabash Cannonball 
budget, and that many may not live to see their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's simply a break from television work," said Ted McConville, 47, 
of Glendale, the SCSRA's treasurer and a TV production systems engineer who 
grew up in Australia, the child of a rail engineer. "My workdays can be high 
pressure -- but on weekends here, I'm with people who have a common interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's one thing just to work on a piece of metal. I'm also fascinated by 
the history -- to learn how so many people's lives were touched by the car 
we're working on, how it expanded their contact with the outside world. It's 
like unraveling a detective story." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jon Hathaway, at 17 one of the group's youngest associates and a junior at 
Village Christian High School in Sun Valley, it "seems odd at times being here, 
when so many of my friends are at the beach. But I can learn just about 
anything by studying railroading -- and it's entertaining, too." 
</P>
<P>
 And DeVorkin, who keeps adding track and performing other tasks, concedes that 
the mission "is sort of overwhelming, but I try not to think about it. I guess 
that by the time we finish the line, my 5-year-old daughter will be 17. Our 
progress is slow, but steady." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurdle, 58, is writing a book about the dear old M.177, but says he can't 
finish it until the car rumbles down Travel Town's track. 
</P>
<P>
 In one breath, he said: "I hope I live that long. I'm going to be in a 
wheelchair long before that." 
</P>
<P>
 In another, he said: "If somebody handed us $75,000 right now, we'd probably 
have it completed in 18 months. . . . This car is going to end up carrying 
millions of people again, on this line. It's got to be done right. We don't 
want it to come apart in a year or two. When it gets running, it's gonna run 
its little legs off." 
</P>
<P>
 And even as Hurdle and his railroading companions plod on and on -- grit and 
calluses on their hands, work ethic on their sleeves -- they sustain themselves 
with carloads of reminiscences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever eat in a Fred Harvey dining car?" Hurdle asked wistfully. "My 
wife and I did. Salt Lake City to Denver. Back in 1980. The Rio Grande Zephyr. 
Still had a live dining car, with real chefs, no microwave food, no frozen 
food! Everything prepared fresh! You ordered from their menu!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, his voice turns almost mournful, like an old locomotive's wail in the 
night. "I remember that," he said. "I remember those days." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Southern California Scenic Railway Assn. Inc., P.O. Box 11216, Glendale

CLUB SCENE; NO 'MOON RIVER' HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two decades ago, families in the San Fernando Valley stopped in at Mancini's 
restaurant at Roscoe Boulevard and De Soto Avenue for an old-fashioned Italian 
meal. Today, the restaurant's clientele at Mancini's Club M is decidedly 
different, with an emphasis on youth and live entertainment of the hard-rocking 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: Mancini's still has a full menu and a full bar, but little is 
visible of the club's middle-class, Italian origins after five years in its 
current format. The large club is decorated only with pictures of bands gone by 
and an occasional lighted beer logo. Club M's appeal is its large stage, which 
can hold up to 16 musicians, where live bands play nightly. The club has two 
dart machines, a few video games, a television and a pinball machine. Dozens of 
seats and tables frame a large dance floor that serves as a mosh pit when there 
is an under-20 crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Generally the club serves 18 and older, but on a recent Thursday it 
was opened to all ages. Casual dress translates to jeans, shorts and T-shirts. 
Among the under-20s, neo-grunge and ska were the choices. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Mancini's was awash in ska that night. The Skeletones got the 
audience dancing as headliners, and Ave. 120 helped heat up the crowd -- and 
pack it, since most of them were friends of the band. First up were the Poor 
Unfortunates, who were indeed unfortunate, being the lone punk band of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: It is a great place to hear up-and-coming local bands. The sound 
system is excellent, and the band quality impressive. "It's cool that they have 
young kids come in, there are not too many clubs like that," said Matt Coffman, 
24, of Calabasas. Said Josh Spincic, 17, of North Hollywood: "It's bigger than 
a lot of other clubs, and it has better bands."  
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Socializing isn't easy. The crowd is there to hear the band, not 
conversation. "I don't like it," said Amanda Harrison, 16, of Chatsworth. "It's 
overpriced, and these people (the owners) think they have a good thing going, 
and they don't."  
</P>
<P>
 FUTURE DAZE: The club plans to expand its game room and set up a room to 
highlight alternative bands with acoustic sets -- sort of a Club M Unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's Club M, 20923 Roscoe Blvd., Canoga Park . 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Cover 
charge is $3 to $8. (818) 341-8503. SYLVIA L. OLIANDE

RELUCTANT NOVICE: NO CUT ABOVE THE REST; A FORTIFIED FLOWBEE LETS YOU TRIM YOUR 
OWN HAIR. BUT THE GADGET ISN'T LIKELY TO THREATEN YOUR HAIRDRESSER'S BUSINESS.

 The Popeil Pocket Fisherman. The Vegematic. The Chia Pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Such absurdities flit across our television screens, rarae aves in the 
midnight air of the high-num bered channels. They are like quirky relatives, 
exacting a smile or perhaps a shrug of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 I had always reserved a warm spot in my heart for these freaks of free 
enterprise. But never had I considered dialing the toll-free number, not once 
had I felt the urge to place an order. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until I saw the Flowbee. 
</P>
<P>
 A whirring vision in yellow and black, a preposterous conglomeration of tubes 
and hoses, the Flowbee hit the market several years ago but had escaped my 
attention until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 It was love at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Precision Home Haircutting System," this contraption dared to call 
itself. More like the idiot king of tele-consumerism. The man in the commercial 
smiled confidently as he passed the handheld vacuum over his head, allowing his 
hair to be sucked into a clear-plastic tube and chopped by scissoring blades. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology this ludicrous earned both my admiration and my $79.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to Flowbee," I told Suzanne, the woman who cuts my hair. It was 
both a bold declaration and a means of putting her on emergency alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, that suck-cut thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my god." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when it finally arrived in the privacy of my home, the Flowbee proved 
more than a little daunting. I peered into the blue-and-yellow boxful of parts 
and found myself staring into the abyss of mankind's enduring fear: the truly 
bad haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relax and enjoy," the owner's manual urged me. 
</P>
<P>
 I pressed on, reading the directions twice and assembling the various parts. 
Only then did it become apparent that my upright vacuum did not provide enough 
suction, especially for someone whose hair hangs long and curly. Such 
inadequacy forced me to bring the Flowbee to work and attach it to a similarly 
curious and frightening machine that I borrowed from the janitor. It was called 
the Wap Turbo industrial vacuum and it shrieked like a Boeing 747 on approach. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that I embarked on my "precision haircutting" experience amid a 
cacophony, with a gaggle of co-workers huddled at safe distance. The Flowbee 
trembled in my hand. Taking a deep breath, employing the recommended 
up-and-down motion, I coaxed the first strands of my hair into its gnashing 
blades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My co-workers winced, all of them save for a woman named Susan who yelled: 
"Cut more." 
</P>
<P>
 Cool air swirled across my scalp. My hand grew steadier. My fears gave way to 
the contraption's gentle vibration. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as great shards of hair fell to the blade, sucked directly into the Wap 
Turbo by means of immaculate process, I found myself carried away by an 
unexpected surge of puissance. After years of visits to the hair salon, I had 
broken free from the grip of hair-care professionals. I was no longer a 
prisoner to the monthly $20 visit. I was taking responsibility for my own 
styling. 
</P>
<P>
 "More," Susan called out, as if sensing my triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 But if I had cut more, I would have left myself with a flattop. All too 
quickly, my Flowbee liberation had come to an end. My audience inched closer, 
offering a chorus of reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks better than I thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like you took a pair of scissors to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like you went to Supercuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan shrugged. "Too short." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these people were journalists and, by craft, cynical. The truth 
was, I looked well-kempt with a layered, bullet-shaped style reminiscent of 
"The Osmond Family Show." Or perhaps "The Hardy Boys Mysteries," either Shaun 
Cassidy or Parker Stevenson, take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne, my hairdresser, expressed a reserved bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," she said the next day, "it's not bad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had missed a few spots, but I do that when I'm vacuuming the house, too. And 
the Flowbee's predisposition for layering had created another minor problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wispy around the edges," Suzanne said, employing professional terminology for 
hair that looks, well, wispy around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 She cautiously asked if I planned to Flowbee again. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if I wore one of those straight and clean-cut styles, I might be 
better suited to the Flowbee system. Perhaps, even with my hair, practice would 
make perfect. But it seemed unreasonable to endure months, even years, of 
looking like a throwback to 197Os prime-time television. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what are you going to do with it?" a co-worker asked as I coiled the 
machine back into its box. "Are you going to put it in the garage and never 
touch it again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another one mused: "Maybe if you get a long-haired dog."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; GOING UPSCALE AT THE CLUB; WHILE THE SERVICE AND DECOR AT 
THE RELOCATED ST. MORITZ RESTAURANT JUSTIFY THE PRICES, THE FOOD DOESN'T.

<P>
 St. Moritz Restaurant, a stalwart of continental cuisine, has left the 
Boulevard for a snazzy new location at Toluca Lake Tennis Club. The kitchen, 
I'm afraid, needs an equally radical change. 
</P>
<P>
 How well I remember those meals of fondue, beef rouladen and Caesar salad when 
St. Moritz was in its heyday, 20 years or so ago. The original St. Moritz was a 
pretty restaurant full of red leather booths and proud of its lovely outdoor 
patio lushly landscaped with ferns and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat outside at the new location, though, and you get a different experience. 
This outdoor patio overlooks a tennis court, where there are sure to be players 
whacking the ball at each other amid the typically stiff breezes that prevail 
in the Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice: Ad in (that's tennis lingo for "sit inside"). The high-ceilinged 
dining room is painted a relaxing pastel green, the floor covered by a 
beautiful marine blue carpet. Elegant, mirrored French doors, leading nowhere, 
frame the south side of the room. A flowered tapestry adorns the upper 
perimeter of the wall, just under the ceiling. The chairs are comfortably 
upholstered, the tables dressed up with beautiful china and white linen. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, imagine an elegant ballroom, complete with cocktail pianist, and a 
bunch of hungry folks in tennis outfits. Somehow, the juxtaposition seems 
perfectly natural in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is a bit formal here too. Waiters scurry to minister to your every 
need, even preparing a dish or two -- notably Caesar salad -- on table-side 
carts, and that feels less natural. To a degree the decor and service justify 
St. Moritz's high prices; what you eat certainly doesn't. Many dishes are not 
nearly as flavorful as I remember in the old St. Moritz. There's little passion 
in this cooking, less imagination. They won't even do beef rouladen , though it 
remains on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundner teller , a plate of paper-thin slices of air-dried beef that tastes 
like smoky prosciutto, is still one of the best ways to begin a meal here. 
Sometimes free appetizers appear while you wait for your main course -- a nice 
thought, but nothing to get excited about. We got deep-fried cubes filled with 
a ham and spinach frittata . They reminded everyone of croquettes from 
Stouffer. Crab-filled mushrooms Diablo were also a disappointment. The stuffing 
was heavy and oily, again reminiscent of the frozen food case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first course was rescued by the restaurant's fine Caesar salad, still 
one of the best around: a garlicky, anchovy-rich model where each leaf of 
romaine comes out of the bowl coated with Worcestershire and mustard-flavored 
egg yolk. My one complaint is that the garlic in the dressing didn't have that 
freshly chopped bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The main courses are mostly holdovers from the old restaurant, but there are 
also occasional specials written up on a board that the waiters bring to your 
table. Go Swiss with cheese fondue. Get Mexican by ordering a fine white shrimp 
dish sauteed with tequila, cilantro, pico de gallo and artichoke. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't tried the Swiss fondue since the move, but I do know that it is 
based on Gruyere, six other cheeses and the cherry liqueur kirschwasser. It 
also carries a $20-per-person price tag (served for two or more, with soup and 
salad), which is a lot of money for any kind of cheese sauce. Wiener schnitzel 
a la Holstein is a terrific concept, a nice, breaded piece of veal topped with 
a fried egg, anchovies and capers. This veal scallop is just a shade tough, 
though. A great schnitzel is always pounded very tender. 
</P>
<P>
 A delicious, airy Godiva chocolate souffle awaits you for dessert, served 
simply and intelligently with whipped cream. There are also a few good, rich 
items that the restaurant buys from a commercial bakery called La Mousse. Among 
them are a smooth chocolate mousse pie and a Euro-style apple pie served hot -- 
ultra-fine cut apples piled high in a wedge of flaky crust. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand why owners Manny Slali and Steve Applegate moved to 
this location. It's near the studios and apparently a good spot for power 
lunching. The restaurant books its share of private parties, too -- meaning 
you'd do well to reserve in advance, especially on weekends.  
</P>
<P>
 Harder to understand is how a restaurant can lose its passion and still expect 
to charge these prices. Tennis, anyone? WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

HORSES FROM COLLEGE STABLE ARE MOVED TO OJAI RANCH; AUCTION: HANDLING OF 
ANIMALS FROM MOORPARK EQUINE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A SERIES OF MISSTEPS. 
</P>

 Sixteen horses owned by Moorpark College were taken to an Ojai Valley ranch 
Thursday after college district officials decided that they had botched 
arrangements to sell the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District decided Wednesday to 
move the animals from their Newbury Park stables -- which must be vacated by 
the end of July -- to make sure they are cared for while officials re-advertise 
a public sale. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of missteps since the district decided last year 
to shut down the Moorpark College equine program. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this month, officials discovered that retiring director Don Anderson had 
informally disposed of many of the publicly owned horses without following 
state guidelines. On July 5, the trustees ordered an auction and solicited 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
 But because only 12 of the 17 horses advertised were available for inspection 
by potential buyers and announcements of the sale did not meet state 
requirements, trustees decided Wednesday to reject all the bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five missing horses had been transported to the Foxfield Riding 
Academy in Newbury Park under an agreement with Anderson that the district has 
since rescinded. The fifth horse -- a 30-year-old stallion deemed worthless -- 
was donated to a former student who will be allowed to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials have discovered seven more college-owned horses at an 
Ojai stable, where Anderson had moved them early last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees were unaware of those horses until this week, when Jamie Skeeters, 
the Oxnard police commander who owns Ojai Valley Farms with his wife, Kay, 
alerted college President James Walker. Skeeters said he wanted to make sure he 
was legally boarding the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud of what we have on our property, and I don't like the shadow 
that's been cast over it," Skeeters told the college district trustees 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker told trustees that Anderson erroneously believed the horses were his 
personal property, not the college's. Anderson has since relinquished any claim 
to the animals, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the seven additional animals, 23 horses will now be for sale when college 
officials finalize plans for the next public auction. All will be housed at 
Ojai Valley Farms in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision to reject the original bids did not sit well with several 
would-be buyers who had followed stringent bidding guidelines requiring them to 
submit payment and show they had suitable facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fourteen bidders had acted in good faith to abide by the district's hasty and 
unreasonable demands," said John Eblen, a Newbury Park man who bid on one small 
pony. "I believe that the district has broken faith with these individuals in 
rejecting their bids." 
</P>
<P>
 Eblen was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hopes have been raised, and I would really like the opportunity to have my 
bid accepted," said Kevin Gasner, an engineer from Oxnard who is moving with 
his family to a small ranch in Camarillo. "We went through a lot of effort to 
get our bids in on time." 
</P>
<P>
 But governing board members voted to reject the 14 bids received in the first 
auction and start the process anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be invalidated," said Trustee Gregory Cole. "We rushed it and 
other information came to light in the meantime, and the process became 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators today are drawing up terms of the new auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can post (advertisements) as early as Monday, we could have the bids 
closed as early as two weeks from Monday," said Comptroller Sue Johnson, who 
will coordinate the auction.

3 FIRMS TO JOIN BIDDING FOR COUNTY'S TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While Ventura County grapples with the issue of a landfill at Weldon Canyon, 
at least three waste companies are talking to local officials about hauling 
west county garbage to dumps elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a representative of Chiquita Canyon Landfill asked Ventura County 
leaders to consider sending as much as 3,000 tons of trash a day to the site 
just over the county line off California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, two more firms will appear before the county Waste Commission to 
bid for the county's trash, offering to ship the waste by truck or rail to 
landfills in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are billions of dollars to be made here in the next decade," said Nina 
Shelley, the Ojai City Council member who sits on the commission. "I can't 
blame these people for fighting over it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals for exporting trash come as the commission, an advisory panel to 
the Board of Supervisors, prepares a 15-year plan for disposing of the county's 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has already drawn up criteria for landfill sites and Thursday 
viewed a map showing land suitable for the giant garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 But some commission members hope that exporting the waste to existing 
landfills could obviate the need for any future dumps, particularly the 
proposed Weldon Canyon project on November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at Chiquita Canyon, and we're looking at Sunshine Canyon (near 
Granada Hills)," Shelley said. "My feeling is that if we get right down to it, 
we're really going to look at the market." 
</P>
<P>
 But her east county colleagues on the commission were not as quick to embrace 
the idea. Saddled with the Simi Valley Landfill, many residents in the east 
county believe their western neighbors should develop a landfill of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live with it in our own back yard, and we live with it because it's our 
garbage," said Scott Montgomery, the Moorpark city councilman who heads the 
Waste Commission. "To the east county, that's the whole issue. We dispose of 
our trash in our own back yard. Why can't Ojai and Ventura dispose of their 
trash in their back yard?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the western communities send much of their trash to Bailard 
Landfill near Oxnard, but that site is set to close in 1997. Efforts to find 
alternatives stalled last year, after activists beat back a proposal for a new 
dump at Weldon Canyon between Ojai and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a San Diego County group called Taconic Resources is trying to revive the 
Weldon proposal, using a ballot initiative to circumvent a reluctant Board of 
Supervisors. That measure is the subject of a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Laidlaw Waste Systems is trying to double the capacity at 
its Chiquita Canyon Landfill, six miles east of the Ventura County border near 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 To justify the expansion, Laidlaw needs to prove it has the garbage to fill an 
extra 180 acres. That's where Ventura County comes in. Rodney W. Walter of 
Laidlaw asked the Waste Commission to send a letter to Los Angeles County 
officials, assuring them that Ventura is considering the landfill as an option 
for its trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the landfill receives 100 to 200 tons a day from Ventura County and 
could handle as much as 3,000 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is not without its problems, Walter acknowledged. Laidlaw is still 
working on its environmental studies, a process complicated by plans for the 
huge Newhall Ranch development across the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, any hint of importing Ventura County trash could inflame Los 
Angeles County environmental groups trying to block the project, not to mention 
the Ventura County communities along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want everything from Oxnard and Ventura and Ojai to be going through 
Santa Paula," said Al Urias, Santa Paula's representative on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed to send a letter to Los Angeles County officials, but 
made no firm commitments to use the Chiquita Canyon landfill.  
</P>
<P>
 In September, the panel will hear a similar proposal from Browning-Ferris 
Industries, which wants to ship Ventura County's trash to Sunshine Canyon and 
to its La Paz landfill in Arizona. A firm called ECDC Environmental from San 
Francisco wants to haul the county's waste by rail to out-of-state landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-distance hauling does not necessarily help the environment, 
Montgomery argued Thursday. "There comes a point in time where the 
environmental impact of the haul becomes more than the environmental impact of 
the landfill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery is supporting the ballot initiative clearing the way for a new 
landfill at Weldon Canyon. The map presented Thursday showed that the land 
around Weldon Canyon met all the panel's criteria for landfills. So did the 
area around the Bailard and Toland Road Landfill, serving Santa Paula and 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simi Valley Landfill, if proposed today, would not meet the panel's 
standards, based chiefly on ground water and zoning criteria.

TEAMSTERS CHIEF CALLS FOR OUSTER OF LOCAL LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Accusing local Teamster leaders of improperly handling expenses, locking 
members out of meetings and physically threatening a fellow board member, the 
president of International Brotherhood of Teamsters on Thursday called for 
their removal. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 6 in Ventura to determine whether Local 
186, which represents 2,400 Teamsters in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, 
should be handed over to an appointed trustee until new elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Teamsters from elsewhere in California will base their decision on 
testimony from local leaders and the rank and file about the union's troubles 
over the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The local's president, Scott Dennison, has accused other individuals on the 
seven-member executive board of preventing him from participating in any 
decisions, harassing him verbally, using obscenities to describe his wife and 
physically threatening him at a board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Shaw, who holds the local's chief administrative office of 
secretary-treasurer, immediately denied all charges, saying they were 
politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Teamsters General President Ron Carey is trying to oust him from 
office to further his own reputation as a reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has bragged about how many locals he has put into trusteeship," Shaw said. 
"The more he puts under trusteeship the more chance he has of getting 
reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 International Brotherhood of Teamsters spokesman Bernie Mulligan said the 
local has been under review for several months. In addition to Dennison's 
accusations, Mulligan said members were locked out of meetings based on their 
political alliances and monthly expense reports were not properly approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten pretty repulsive," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan said the Teamsters have put 35 locals around the country into 
trusteeship since Carey took over the union's presidency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the trademarks of the Carey administration is protecting members' 
rights to have a democratic meeting," Mulligan said. "There have been serious 
questions raised about the lack of democracy in that local and those questions 
need to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison was elected to the local's presidency in September, 1993, the sole 
member of the executive board to win office on a slate headed by Marty Fry. 
Fry, who was the local's top leader until being convicted and imprisoned for 
embezzlement, came within 33 votes of defeating Shaw for the top job last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw accused Fry of being behind Dennison's allegations. "Now Marty has to 
work the background. He's trying to come in the back door." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison denied that Fry prompted his complaints. He said he has been isolated 
from other board members since his first meeting as president. During that 
meeting, he said, he asked many questions and took notes and other board 
members then made snide remarks about his questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later meetings focused briefly on minor matters, he said, then dissolved into 
criticisms of him. Dennison said he generally left those meetings after 45 
minutes of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, somebody is taking care of union business when I'm not there," 
Dennison said. "They have their own agenda, which is usually nothing in my 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 At the June 7 executive board meeting, Dennison said he was physically 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several people said they were going to take me out and kick my backside," 
Dennison said. He said objects were thrown at him as he walked down a hallway 
to leave the building, but he did not turn back to see what they were or who 
was throwing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he never threatened Dennison and never saw other members of the 
board do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said union members have asked him to fight to keep the executive board in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the cards are stacked against me," Shaw said. "They never asked me about 
any of these things. They took Scott's word on everything. That sounds like a 
kangaroo court to me. Someday a labor historian will come down and say, boy, 
that labor purge never should have happened."

D.A. REPORTS HUGE JUMP IN SPOUSAL ABUSE CALLS; CRIME: A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
PROSECUTIONS SOUGHT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE SIMPSON CASE AND TO A MORE AGGRESSIVE 
STANCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Domestic violence complaints to the Ventura County district attorney's office 
have skyrocketed in recent months -- an increase attributed partly to the O.J. 
Simpson case but also to a more aggressive stance by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have received several calls from women since the O.J. Simpson case," said 
Deputy District Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth, who heads the unit that prosecutes 
domestic abuse cases. "But it started increasing before O.J. Simpson -- I think 
in part of because of our new domestic violence protocol." 
</P>
<P>
 From June 12, when Nicole Brown Simpson was killed, to July 17, prosecutors 
have received 275 complaints from police departments to review, Henke-Dobroth 
said. By contrast, prosecutors received only 140 complaints in December and the 
same number in January before police began looking more closely at such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, all police agencies in the county adopted a new protocol for 
handling complaints -- a set of procedures that call for more evidence 
gathering and follow-up on abuse calls. Since then, abuse cases referred for 
prosecution have steadily increased, reaching 192 in April and 240 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Henke-Dobroth said the majority of domestic abuse complaints are referred by 
police officers and filed by prosecutors as misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably file between 70% to 80% of the cases and . . . we win 
prosecutions on at least 70%," she said. Sentencing for misdemeanor convictions 
range from mandatory counseling to a maximum of one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to domestic violence hot lines have also soared, counselors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Duncan, a coordinator with Interface Children, Family Services of 
Ventura County, said the heightened publicity from the Simpson case has spurred 
more women to call Interface's hot line, one of two in the county taking 
domestic violence complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do four or five on the hot line, per day, on an average day," Duncan 
said. "After the O.J. thing, that doubled to tripled on some days." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Leigh executive director of the Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual 
Violence, said the Simpson case may have encouraged some women to get help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's raised awareness, where more women are saying, 'That could be 
me,' " Leigh said. "Women who have been reluctant in the past are now reaching 
out for assistance because they feel they've been given some permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Women who call police for help are also apt to get better service now because 
of the new protocol, said Oxnard Assistant Police Chief Tom Cady, who sits on 
the Ventura County Domestic Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The protocol encourages officers to take more time gathering evidence in abuse 
calls so that they have stronger cases for prosecution, even if the victim 
later decides not to cooperate. Police officers throughout Ventura County are 
being trained to get taped interviews, take photographs and talk to witnesses 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, when we didn't have that evidence, and the victim was prepared 
to change their story, we could not successfully prosecute the case," Cady 
said. "Because we do have more evidence, and more information, there are more 
cases we are able to submit." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies are also more reactive to domestic violence calls now 
because they see the political heat the Los Angeles Police Department has 
received from the Simpson case, Leigh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the police are very, very sensitive to this issue now because there 
have been a couple of homicides," Leigh said. "The police are naturally going 
to be putting more complaints in front of the D.A.'s office. It's better to be 
safe than sorry."

GREETINGS FROM MOORPARK; MAN DISPENSES FRIENDLY WAVES TO PASSERSBY FROM HIS 
SPOT ON DOWNTOWN CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be that just about everybody who drove through Moorpark got a tip 
of the hat or a wave from Chris Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago the former infantry soldier and retired postal worker 
appointed himself the unofficial greeter of downtown Moorpark. Standing on the 
corner of Spring Road and 2nd Street during the morning and afternoon rush 
hours, he'd give a friendly nod to the passersby -- sometimes as many as 500 in 
a single hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the go-go years before California 118 was diverted away from 
downtown and an interchange was built on the east side of town. Traffic isn't 
what it used to be, and neither is Sepulveda, who's now 67 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you don't see too many cars come by anymore," he said, tapping the 
artificial leg he got about a year ago after he lost his own to diabetes. "I 
guess I'm out here more for myself now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people wonder about Sepulveda, who has lived in Moorpark since 1935. He 
knows they wonder what his gimmick is, or if he's crazy. But there is no 
gimmick. He just likes waving to people, and he likes it when they wave back. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight years ago, just after his wife died, he got bored and fed up with 
sitting on the couch at home and watching TV. He'd much rather sit on the chair 
he has locked to a fence post on the street corner and watch the world drive 
by. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell me that I make their day, and I tell them that when they wave 
back, they make my day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, his little act of kindness is something to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's wonderful," Anne Briggs said from behind the wheel of her Volvo station 
wagon, stopped at the corner. Her three young children all nodded in agreement, 
while they waved to Sepulveda. "He's there almost every morning and every 
night. We really miss him when he's not around." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, worsening diabetes sent him to a veterans hospital. Doctors had to 
amputate his right leg below the knee. He said he'd finally lost the foot he 
almost lost to frostbite in World War II while fighting with Gen. George S. 
Patton's division in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just lost my toes then. This time they got my whole foot and some of the 
leg too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost a year and a half before he was able to walk to the street 
corner again and dispense his daily greetings. His new spot is much closer. He 
sits at the corner of Roberts Avenue and Spring Road, which is half a block 
from the house he shares with one of his middle-aged daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lifelong friends bought him a folding chair to sit on. It's permanently 
padlocked to a post next to a stop sign at the corner.  
</P>
<P>
 When he went into the hospital, people missed him, Briggs said. She never knew 
Sepulveda's name, but waved to him anyway. She said many townsfolk worried 
during his long absence that Sepulveda might never come back. They worried that 
maybe he had died or suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I didn't want to come out here with my wheelchair, it didn't look so 
good, you know," he said. "My gosh, they seemed to really miss me when I was 
gone though."  
</P>
<P>
 About six months ago, he toddled to his corner on a temporary prosthetic leg.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not too good, see," he said showing how the leg is a little too short 
and makes him unsteady on his feet. "The doctor said he was almost finished 
making another. I told him not to rush it, and just make sure it's good enough 
for me to dance on. I like dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People still worry about him. They come by and give him sodas or ice cream 
when the temperature climbs close to 100. Once he fell asleep, and a worried 
driver stopped to make sure he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't leave until she knew for sure that I was all right," he said. 
"She wanted to call an ambulance, but I was just a little sleepy." 
</P>
<P>
 He says now he's back, doing what he does best. He has it down to a science -- 
a gentle wave with a cupped hand, a slightly tilted head and open-mouth smile. 
He even throws in a wink now and again.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know him," he says waving to an elderly man riding in the passenger seat of 
a blue Continental. "Poor man. He's crippled. He doesn't get out much. I told 
his wife when I get my new leg, I'd take him out and push him around in his 
wheelchair. I know how that is, sitting around the house. It can drive you 
crazy."

 Hal Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at Moorpark College that is host to the 
Charles Temple Observatory, said the tiny facility drew its largest one-week 
turnout ever with people from throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been living here," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Don White, 49, of Somis, spent most of his week at Moorpark leaning over to 
fiddle with his $7,600, seven-inch Starfire refractor telescope, so others 
could look through the powerful lens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get a chance to look through my telescope very much anymore," he 
said. Instead, with the crowds of people surrounding him hoping for a turn 
peering through his six-foot-long scope, he said he gets near it "only to make 
adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 Jandorf estimates that about 300 county residents showed up at an 
instructional seminar on the history-making event Sunday evening, and that 
about a 100 people had come to the observatory each evening since. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Astronomical Society members and other fans of the night sky 
set up their telescopes on a hillside concrete pad just outside the 
observatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Others caught a glimpse of Jupiter's black scars through a camera hooked up to 
a Celestron 14-inch telescope that beamed pictures onto a television screen for 
everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Jandorf's astronomy Lab class met and several students stayed 
afterward for what was expected to be their first look at an actual impact 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked a great time to take the class, because this is once in 65 million 
years that this would happen," said sophomore Shannon Lovato, 18, of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dense cloud cover prevented dozens gathered around from seeing much of 
anything that night. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jim Sumstine, 50, of Ventura, who serves as historian for the 
Astronomical Society, had already seen the spectacle earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I could feel my heart beating," he said of seeing vast black impact 
spots on Jupiter. "It was a highly emotional thing for me. I was almost to the 
point of tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing real science in real time," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JUDGE TO RULE SOON ON BALLOT RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura accountant who failed by one vote to qualify for a runoff in the 
race for county auditor-controller will have to wait until at least Monday to 
find out whether a judge will order a manual recount of the ballots at county 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Melinda A. Johnson said she would probably make a 
decision in the case next week during a hearing on a civil complaint filed by 
Ventura accountant Scott Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' attorney, Daniel J. Schmidt, asked Johnson to order a full recount of 
the 113,000 ballots cast in the June 7 election. Short of that, Schmidt asked 
the judge to force county election officials to count 274 ballots cast by 
voters who punched chads for two or more candidates. Those ballots were 
considered spoiled and not counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss has contended that he would have edged out opponent Richard Morrisset 
had those ballots been counted. Morrisset will face appointed 
Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon in a runoff in November. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; TANDEM BIKE TREK PROVIDES DUEL GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura teacher Jim Sather remembers clearly what a bicycle salesman told him 
when he bought a tandem bicycle for a 1,700-mile trek with his sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," the salesman said, "will make or break your relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if Sather and his fiancee, Diane Shaw, had been trying to devise a 
survival test for their relationship, their bicycle trip from northwest 
Washington would have fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sather and Shaw, who stopped in Ventura on Thursday on their way to the 
Mexican border, said they embarked on the trip for fun rather than to test 
their compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple, who are both Ventura teachers, said their grueling ride that 
began June 28 has had an unforeseen benefit for their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 They are arguing less over trifles, said Shaw, a first- and second-grade 
teacher at Poinsettia School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't worry about day-to-day things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get back down to basics," agreed Sather, who teaches math at Anacapa 
Middle School, "food, water, shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who will be married Aug. 8, took their tandem by train and ferry 
to a port north of Seattle where they began their ride. 
</P>
<P>
 They have traveled 1,500 miles so far, riding up to 83 miles in one day, and 
plan to leave today on the last 200-mile stretch to the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for other cyclists the couple have met in campgrounds along the way, 
the two have spent all of their waking and sleeping hours only with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the tandem, they have conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have heard of other tandem-riding couples who have fought over 
who would sit in front and how fast to go, Shaw said these issues never 
presented a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She was happy to let Sather, who had made this same ride once before on a 
single-seat bicycle, take the front seat. And Sather was reasonable about 
slowing the pace when Shaw asked, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was Shaw's first long bicycle ride, she said she is already 
planning their next trip across the country to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they make another long ride or not, Shaw has preserved memories of 
this ride for future generations in a carefully kept diary. 
</P>
<P>
 The diary begins: "Dear kids:" MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; DNA TEST POINTS TO MOLESTATION SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators, using evidence derived from DNA testing, arrested an 
Ojai man Thursday on suspicion of kidnaping and molesting a 3-year-old Ojai 
girl in 1992, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Steven Sobonya, 44, was arrested by Ventura County sheriff's 
investigators after being delivered to county authorities from state prison 
where he was being held on a previous parole violation, said Sgt. John 
Fitzgerald of the sheriff's Major Crimes Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobonya's parole violation was in connection with his alleged molestation of a 
9-year-old Silver Strand boy in March, Fitzgerald said. Believing there may be 
a connection between that incident and the earlier Ojai kidnaping and 
molestation, Fitzgerald had DNA tests conducted on Sobonya and evidence linking 
him to the 1992 crime was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA, the genetic code considered the building blocks of life, is found in all 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals' DNA codes are considered by some experts to be unique, as are as 
fingerprints, and DNA tests have in recent years been admitted as evidence in 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobonya has been held in connection with the kidnaping and molestation of the 
Ojai girl. He has been additionally facing multiple counts of child 
molestation, child annoying and filming a minor performing a lewd act, 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobonya was booked in Ventura County jail late Thursday without bail. J.E.

WATERFRONT LEASES AT CENTER OF ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura voters will be asked to decide this November whether the city's 
charter should be changed to allow longer waterfront leases on city property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council voted earlier this week to put the issue to the 
electorate.The measure will call for extending waterfront leases to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose when developers hesitated to open a restaurant on the Ventura 
Pier because the city's charter only permits a 10-year lease on waterfront 
properties. When the lease is over, the city opens the lease for bidding again 
and the longtime renter has no legal advantage over other competitors.  
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateurs say 20- to 50-year leases are more common in the industry, and 
necessary to allow a business to recoup its investments.  
</P>
<P>
 Restaurateur Eric Wachter, who is negotiating with city officials to open a 
restaurant on the pier, has said if the ballot measure does not pass, he wants 
a guarantee that Ventura will either renew his contract in 10 years or buy out 
his business. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; RADINSKY HITS HOMERS DURING VISIT WITH 
KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a big grin on his face, Chicago White Sox pitcher Scott Radinsky stepped 
up to the mound and began firing balls over home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Comiskey Park? Not quite. Try Simi Valley's Houghton Schreiber Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A Simi Valley native, Radinsky visited Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District's youth baseball camp Thursday to toss a few pitches, sign autographs 
and mostly smile a lot as 40 thrilled baseball fiends -- ages 7 to 12 -- 
watched his every move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw from second base," his young friends urged. "Faster. Faster. Wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of Radinsky's pitching demonstration, about 20 kids were racing 
back and forth in the park's small outfield, chasing line drives, fly balls and 
even an occasional home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was fun," Radinsky said as he walked off the field with a horde of 
followers. "I'd much rather do this than stand up and make some sort of 
presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old relief pitcher was sidelined by Hodgkin's disease this spring 
and has been going through chemotherapy sessions at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has two treatments to go before he returns to Chicago and 
professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of getting the treatments," Radinsky said. "But I've been feeling 
good the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 As a favor to the baseball program he grew up with, Radinsky dropped by the 
camp to tell players about his own career and answer a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if I played with Babe Ruth," he said, shaking his head and 
adjusting his cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Kime, 7, stood nearby with his friend Robby Ehlers, also 7, blowing on a 
freshly autographed baseball card with Radinsky's picture on the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get a lot of money for it," Adam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devra Lane, 11, had a squiggled "Scott" autograph written in magic marker on 
her T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, she announced, was "nice." He had autographed her glove, hat and a 
baseball card as well. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Devra's second year at the three-week camp, which is sponsored by the 
park district and costs $55 per student. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Chris Johnson, 10, said she had already hit a home run in this 
summer's session. Looking at Radinsky, she wondered whether she could hit a 
pitch from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she concluded. "If he pitched it slow enough I could." MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MONTGOMERY'S TIES TO BUILDER CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery was harshly criticized at a City Council 
meeting this week for accepting campaign contributions from a Santa Monica 
developer whose project he wants to exempt from a future growth-control 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The president and owner of Carlsberg Financial Corp. donated $1,500 this 
spring to Montgomery's campaign for a seat on the Board of 
Supervisors.Montgomery has expressed his support for a proposed negotiated 
settlement with the company, which would exempt its plan to build 552 homes in 
Moorpark from a future growth-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company will have to comply with the city's existing slow-growth 
law, called Measure F, it would not have to comply with a new law that might 
have stricter limits on the number of building permits it could receive in a 
single year. 
</P>
<P>
 Former councilman and growth-control advocate Clint Harper had harsh words for 
Montgomery's support of the proposal, which would settle a lawsuit pending 
between the city and Carlsberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not be illegal, but I don't think it's ethical," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery did not respond during the meeting but said during a break that the 
donations did not influence his decision to support the settlement. He said his 
record showed that in many cases he has voted against developers that donated 
money to his political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that in the case of the Carlsberg development, he had initially 
recommended that the company get approval only for 405 homes, not the 552 that 
the firm wants to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that just because I get money from someone I should be excluded 
from voting on projects they have that come before the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the possible exemption and the Carlsberg development 
plan at a meeting scheduled for Aug. 3. SCOTT HADLY

 Simi Valley police arrested a Los Angeles man Thursday on suspicion of 
stealing a car and evading arrest after he led officers on a brief high-speed 
chase that started on the Simi Valley Freeway and ended in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Yepez, 20, was arrested about 6 a.m. after he lost control of the 1988 
Chevy Camaro and rolled onto the shoulder of the Simi Valley Freeway near 
Reseda Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepez had stolen the vehicle about a half-hour earlier from a Simi Valley 
resident, police said. The name of the resident was not available Thursday. A 
Simi Valley police officer spotted Yepez in the vehicle driving southbound on 
the Simi Valley Freeway near Kuehner Drive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer followed Yepez until he was joined by a second police cruiser on 
the freeway near Tampa Avenue in the San Fernando Valley. When the pair 
attempted to pull Yepez over, he sped off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After pursuing him at high speeds for about a mile, Yepez lost control of the 
vehicle, authorities said. He was taken into custody without injury, 
authorities said. KAY SAILLANT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complaining that inflatable dinosaurs, blimps and balloons make their city 
look like a circus, Simi Valley residents are urging city planners to tighten 
restrictions on the inflatable promotion items. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning commissioners agreed to propose lower limits on the height at 
which a balloon can fly and limit the number of clustered businesses that can 
fly balloons simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 And commissioners asked the city staff to formulate harsher penalties for 
businesses that fail to acquire permits prior to pumping up their displays. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commissioners also rejected several restrictions some residents 
wanted, including one requiring the balloons be tied to the ground instead of 
to rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did not move forward with harsher restrictions on how long balloons 
could be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two long-time residents attending the meeting stormed out, saying 
commissioners were ignoring serious issues about the city's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This used to be a beautiful town," said Marvin Banks. "We're going to turn it 
into a dump." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they were concerned about the way the city looks, but also 
had to refrain from becoming too restrictive to local business. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Michael Piper asked that the inflatable items not be lighted and 
should be no taller than 30 feet or than the building they sit upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will have the final vote on the issue later in the summer.

EX-SUPERINTENDENT SUES SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School District who resigned 
at the demand of the school board has sued the district for about $47,000 in 
lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian C. Kirkpatrick, who headed the 12,200-student district for only two years 
before his abrupt departure in May, 1992, claims in his suit that school 
officials owe him the difference between his former salary in Oxnard and that 
of his current, lesser-paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Kirkpatrick left the Oxnard district, his salary was $89,700. 
Although he had a three-year contract with the district, he agreed to resign 
with the board's written agreement to pay him $7,825 per month for one year or 
until he found a job with a comparable salary, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven months after leaving Oxnard, Kirkpatrick took another job as 
superintendent with the Windsor Unified School District in Northern California. 
Subsequently, the Oxnard district ceased its payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the job with the Windsor district, which is only about one-fifth the size 
of the Oxnard high school district, pays about $7,000 less per year than what 
Kirkpatrick had earned in his previous position. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkpatrick claims in the suit that the district owes him the $7,825 payments 
for each of the remaining six months from January to June of 1993 -- which 
amounts to $46,950. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard district Supt. Bill Studt declined to discuss the issue because it is 
under litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkpatrick could not be reached for comment. But his attorney said 
Kirkpatrick believes his cause is just. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks he's entitled to additional compensation because he didn't find 
comparable employment," attorney Bill Shaeffer said. MAIA DAVIS

<P>
 Police are searching for a gunman who fatally shot a 23-year-old Ventura man 
early Thursday morning in the bedroom of the suspect's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rowland died at Ventura County Medical Center about 45 minutes after he 
was shot in the stomach in an apartment on Kirk Avenue in Ventura, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police are continuing to hunt for Thomas Al Corral, 23, the suspected 
gunman. They are also looking for Ruben Viveros, 19, who accompanied Corral to 
the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, Corral forced his way at gunpoint into the apartment 
of his 18-year-old girlfriend, the mother of his infant child, police said. 
Corral threatened the woman's younger brother and entered a bedroom, where he 
fired several shots at Rowland, hitting him once in the abdomen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland ran from the apartment and collapsed in the building's entryway, 
police said. Authorities found him there and rushed him to the hospital. JASON

 Magazine Faults Airline Maintenance: Millions of passengers have departed 
American airports in planes unfit to leave the ground, Conde Nast Traveler said 
in a report to be published in the magazine's August issue. Leaky hydraulic 
pumps, tangled oxygen masks and other violations have not been enough to stop 
the planes from taking off, but they have cost U.S. airlines millions of 
dollars in fines in the past eight years, the magazine said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR SHOWS SOME LIFE; DOW HIGHER ON IBM SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar shot up against the German mark and rose against other major 
currencies Thursday as Treasury officials and German central bankers spoke out 
firmly in favor of a stronger dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bond yields were higher and the long bond was 
flat as investors anticipated that the Federal Reserve Board will raise 
interest rates again soon to contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, stocks were mixed, with blue chip shares pushed higher by 
IBM and other companies whose second-quarter profits beat predictions by Wall 
Street prognosticators. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most explicit dollar-supportive talk to come out of the government 
since the greenback's latest descent began a few weeks ago, Treasury 
Undersecretary Lawrence Summers said in Senate testimony that a stronger dollar 
"would have important economic benefits for the United States" and would 
restore confidence in financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers comments came on the heels of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's statements 
Wednesday that a weak dollar could ignite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the comments did for the dollar what two coordinated buying 
efforts have failed to do in recent months: prop up the beleaguered currency 
and change dealers' perception that the government prefers a weak dollar to 
counter the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's verbal intervention," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at 
Mellon Bank. "They're doing better with these comments than they did when they 
were buying dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said Summers' and Greenspan's comments, combined with 
dollar-supportive statements made earlier in the day by officials of Germany's 
central bank, reversed negative sentiment against the dollar among many market 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.S. currency jumped nearly three pfennigs to close at 1.593 
German marks from Wednesday. It was one of the largest single-day dollar-mark 
jumps in several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also rallied against the Japanese yen, fetching 99.20 yen, up from 
Wednesday's 98.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders suggested that the dollar's rally was not a one-day event, and 
suggested that the momentum achieved Thursday could last. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things came together at once," said Chris Igo, international 
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "There's been a fundamental change in market 
sentiment, and there's reason to think that we've built a higher base." 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit market, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed 
unchanged. Its price, which plunged 7/8 point Wednesday, ended 1/16 point 
higher, or about 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term maturities, meanwhile, dropped from 3/32 point to 5/32 
point and intermediate maturities lost as much as 3/16 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed the mixed performance to lingering reverberations from 
Greenspan's warning Wednesday that the Fed is prepared to push short-term rates 
higher if inflation reasserts itself. 
</P>
<P>
 While there wasn't much new in Greenspan's comments, the markets had started 
to assume that with the economy slowing, inflation was tame enough to delay any 
immediate rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.42% as the discount rose 0.04 
percentage point to 4.32%. Six-month yields rose to 4.90% as the discount rose 
0.04 point to 4.73%. One-year yields rose to 5.40% as the discount rose 0.05 
point to 5.14%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,732.45, up 5.18 
points, largely on the strength of IBM. Broader market averages were also up 
slightly. However, declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-7 margin on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume swelled to 290.80 million shares from 
268.04 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM gained 6 1/2 to 62 3/8. The computer giant reported second-quarter profit 
of $1.14 a share, about twice what analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market today is one stock -- IBM. That is the story of the day and the 
story of the week," said Lawrence Rice, chief market strategist at Josephthal 
Lyon & Ross in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's gain would have been even better had United Technologies not 
reported a profit of $1.25 per share. Although it was near consensus 
predictions, investors weren't satisfied and the defense and aerospace 
company's shares lost 3 7/8 to 62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other companies influenced by positive earnings reports, Sears was up 1 
3/8 to 47 3/8 and Kimberly Clark gained 1 1/4 to 55 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said this quarter's earnings reports have generally been 
favorable, but investors are skittish about those who fail to meet 
expectations. Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Other computer stocks rallied with IBM. Compaq advanced 5/8 to 32 1/8, Apple 
gained 1 3/8 to 28 and Dell climbed 7/8 to 26 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T ended up 5/8 to 53 3/4 after reporting a 8.7% jump in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Integrated Device Technology, a maker of high-performance semiconductors, 
lost 7 3/16 to 18 3/4 after it reported a rise in quarterly profit but said it 
was cautious about its future business. Alex. Brown & Sons downgraded the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnson & Johnson rose 1 5/8 to 46 3/8. Merrill Lynch upgraded its rating on 
the health care products company on Wednesday after J&J posted strong results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cerner surged 6 7/8 to 32. The clinical information systems company posted a 
strong second-quarter profit, prompting upgrades from several brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. German stock prices fell, with the DAX 30-share 
average closing down 25.35 points at 2,113.30, while Tokyo's 30-share Nikkei 
average ended off 157.84 points at 20,622.92. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Financial Times 100-share average ended up 17.9 points at 
3,095.1, while in Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 21.86 points to close at 
2223.88.

 Pearl Jam delivered its new album to gleeful Epic Records executives last week 
amid speculation that the label could have the album, tentatively titled 
"Vitalogy," in stores sometime in August. However, some insiders are saying not 
to expect the album until September.According to sources close to the project, 
the uncertainty over the release date revolves around package artwork, which is 
being supervised personally by Pearl Jam leader Eddie Vedder. Pearl Jam's last 
album, "Vs.," sold close to a million copies in its first week on the street.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: BMW'S M3 LEAVES THE REST IN THE DUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most automobile upgrades are a tickle and a tightening that improve middling 
performance to slightly better than normal. Or usually to what the vehicle 
should have been in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 With BMW's 1995 M3, the conversion is alchemy; an enormous transformation 
elevating an excellent car into a superb sports coupe with performance once 
thought to belong only to exotic two-seaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Be warned. Dispassionate prose will never surround this well-fed, 
exhilarating, sophisticated subspecies that went into BMW's mechanical 
make-over room as a showroom stock 325i. 
</P>
<P>
 It emerged as an enthusiast's fancy that would make Faust out of a preacher. 
Here is a five-seat, rear-drive gazelle in a tiger suit that exhausts most 
adjectives, superlatives, hyperbole, grandiloquence and all action hero 
exclamations. 
</P>
<P>
 That's before you've driven it. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so there isn't a cup holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Its competition seats may be a squeeze for those broad of kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Some body colors -- including a lemon chrome that in people usage would be 
good for 30 days in quarantine -- will definitely intrigue those fun guys who 
wear gold helmets and ride motorcycles in short-sleeved shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 But you'll have to poke hard and deep and reeeallly like Buicks to find 
anything else worth dissing on the M3. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1988 when BMW decided to work its Motorsport division on weekends and 
stuff Formula 1 technology into its street cars. Hence the M3 with a tweaked 
four-cylinder engine that never quite delivered the fury its sound promised. An 
unyielding suspension also posed an enormous threat to loose dentures. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cult formed faster than lines at traffic court. Performance tuning was 
expanded to Bimmer's more expensive coupes. And the discreet 
magenta-purple-and-blue striping of M-car badging and upholstery -- even 
stitching on the leather steering wheel -- was adopted as overt colors of the 
rascal enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with most of BMW's 3-Series powered by a 2.5-liter, six-cylinder engine, 
comes a faster, far more serious, much more exciting second generation M3. It's 
also more car at its 1991 price of $35,800. Would that the cost of ground round 
remained as stable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake, however, to measure the appeal of this five-seat sports 
car by its smoking clutch and trail of digits-per-mile. Actually, the M3's 
electronically limited top speed of 137 m.p.h. is slower than an Acura Legend 
LS or a Toyota Supra. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the getting there. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The joy is in maneuvering a machine engineered for our choking freeways and 
over-policed interstates, not the freer pace of motoring across Europe where 
160 m.p.h is legal in some parts and the Jungrau becomes a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 325 engine has been bored and stroked to 3.0 liters, which provides an 
impressive 240 horsepower -- but with its pulling power concentrated in the low 
to mid ranges. That translates to a 0-60 m.p.h. time of 6 seconds. Or a freeway 
entrance time quicker than a V-8 powered Ford Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the handling. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A system of electronic valve timing -- similar to the process that adds so 
much muscle to Honda's relatively small engines -- optimizes power in the upper 
range of engine effort. So passing at freeway and highway speeds becomes a 
quick, safe, split-second blast through the clutter of those who never move 
over. Then you can be gone at a really humiliating rate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the stopping. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The M3's brakes are 12-inch ventilated discs front and rear -- one-inch larger 
than the BMW 325 -- and adapted from BMW's 5-series of heavier, faster cars. 
They certainly are good for long, hard, hot, downhill, fade-free braking while 
having fun and games on Angeles Crest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the platform. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The suspension has been lowered by one inch, which allows the car to corner 
flat and firm. Springs and anti-roll bars have been stiffened so that whatever 
information chassis components are gleaning from the road and wheels is loyally 
translated to the seat of a driver's pants. Or skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And with low-profile tires set flat on 17-inch wheels peculiar to the M3, this 
is a vehicle sliding nowhere until pushed within a whisper of its limits. 
Which, we must add, are many measures beyond the limits of even intermediate 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very organic car, which has nothing to do with growing tomatoes in 
the wheel wells. It has everything to do with systematically interrelated parts 
-- brakes, steering, chassis, suspension and engine -- built to perform 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other vehicles, the M3 is not assembled with fingers crossed in the 
hope that only a minority of its parts turn out to be strangers. All pieces 
form the concert. That way, the whole is elevated from user friendly to driver 
loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no mistaking an M3 at rest or on the run. Its front wears a deep 
apron with a mesh-covered intake for engine breathing and flanking nostrils for 
cooling the front brakes. The rocker panels are aerodynamic, channeled and 
notched. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, again, smacks of most uncivilized behavior and raw handling. But it 
certainly isn't the final manner of the M3. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dual personality car. 
</P>
<P>
 You can take it anywhere, thrash it hard, and it will outperform most pure 
sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But in calmer, softer hands it prowls around town with a presence that if not 
demure, is certainly relaxed. The M3 crawls from rest without revs held high as 
a straining preamble to a noisy launch. None of its systems require ferocity of 
operation, nor will 300-mile trips require Advil and acupressure to restore 
mobility to limbs and back. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, a Chevrolet Corvette is much rougher on the bod. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes the M3 a machine for hot shoes, a motor car for those who 
drive in their slippers, and definitely a vehicle that by multiplicity of 
purpose could be the only car you will ever want to own. 
</P>
<P>
 There are sad tidings: Only 2,000 M3s will be shipped to the United States 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is worse news: That probably means BMW dealers will be charging above 
sticker for M3s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet good times could be gleaming: BMW is toying with applying its M magic to 
325i sedans and cabriolets, which should satisfy demand and settle prices. 1995 
BMW M3 
</P>
<P>
 Price: $35,800

THE GOODS; ECONOTES; NOW IT'LL BE EASIER TO BE GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to make your house green without painting it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Eco-Renovation," a new handbook from Chelsea Green Publishing Co., details 
roof-to-basement green options from such small touches as built-in recycling 
bins to changes as sweeping as inside-and-out insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of ecological thinking is to learn as much as possible from 
nature," says author Edward Harland, a British architect and builder who 
specializes in ecological renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 His book shows how to reduce heating and utility bills, select building 
materials that are resource efficient and environmentally safe, maximize 
existing living space and protect the family from toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Each chapter offers a "Priorities for Action" guide. The final chapter 
includes a checklist for assessing your home, references for products and 
services, and a bibliography. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chelsea Green, in White River Junction, Vt., has published a number 
of books on building environmental houses, including the use of solar energy, 
and a new book on straw-bale houses, this is the publisher's first retrofit 
book, Managing Editor Jim Schley says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people can't build a new house," he says. "They are living in a 
structure that's going to stay there. So renovation is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Just Too Much: The Environmental Media Assn. brought in heavy-hitter speakers 
for its recent breakfast/press briefing on "Population and Consumption." More 
than 200 industry writers, producers and executives heard sober statistics on 
the world population explosion from Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth and bad 
news on the environmental effect of America's consumption from Alan Durning, 
executive director of Northwest Environmental Watch. "It really boiled down to 
six words," EMA President Andy Goodman said. "Too many people. Too much stuff."

INK: CONDE NAST CATCHES SPY MAGAZINE'S EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Spy magazine rises from the grave with a summer issue that reprises some of 
its greatest hits about Hollywood, the New York Times and other media 
institutions, it also features a new mediacentric department, "Magazine 
Heaven," to chronicle the fab, clubby and ruthless ways of New York's mag 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Spy starts with four pages about Conde Nast. And is it any wonder? Conde Nast 
Publications Inc. -- which publishes Vanity Fair, Mademoiselle, Glamour, 
Details, Vogue, Self, GQ and six other books -- continues to be the turbulent 
glamorland of magazines, a Madison Avenue kingdom where princes and princesses 
(editors and publishers) come and go at the bidding of the impetuous king 
(chairman), S.I. (Si) Newhouse Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss in the New Yorker, which Newhouse owns but publishes separately from the 
Conde Nast group, and among the lot there have been eight new publishers since 
January and six new editors since 1990. Media Industry Newsletter ran a score 
card this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular corridors of magazine publishing, the more provocative Vanity 
Fair cover stories probably command less interest than the latest beheading or 
elevation at Conde Nast. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's episode, Alexandra Penney, editor in chief of Self since 1989, 
was leaving the beauty and fitness magazine for a newly created upstairs job in 
"media development." In this week's episode, Penney is staying at Self after 
all. 
</P>

 "A lady can change her mind," she says. "I thought, why not make a challenge 
out of keeping something that is already on top and making it bigger and more 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Penney's job had been offered to -- and rejected by -- at least 
one other colleague, her curious about-face only accelerated the well-oiled 
gossip machine. What did it all mean? Had Alexander Liberman, who recently 
stepped down as Conde Nast editorial director after three decades, somehow 
reversed what may have been the first major decision made by his young 
successor, James Truman?  
</P>
<P>
 And is it true, palace courtiers (and ink-smudged outsiders) asked with 
interest, that the enigmatic Anna Wintour is leaving as editor in chief of 
Vogue for a Conde Nast post in Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not, will not, nor will it ever be true," says Paul Wilmot, Conde 
Nast's director of corporate public relations. "She's staying in her role, as 
far as we know, forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just gotten to the point of being crazy," says Roberta Garfinkle, vice 
president and director of print media at the McCann-Erickson advertising 
agency. "The readers, with few exceptions, probably have no idea who the 
editors are at any of these magazines. We in the business are the only ones who 
care -- and we're starting to care less." 
</P>
<P>
 However, only media pundits might disagree that the palace intrigue at Conde 
Nast is a fascinating, if bizarre element of the country's third-largest 
magazine group. Conde Nast last year took in an estimated $661.3 million in ad 
revenue, a 13.7% increase over the 1992 haul. Moreover, despite the upheavals 
in management and the profitability of only a few of the Conde Nast magazines, 
they continue to exceed the circulation numbers guaranteed to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conde Nast universe will be explored in an upcoming unauthorized biography 
of Newhouse written by Thomas Maier, a reporter with Newsday, and in a second 
such bio being prepared by Carol Felsenthal, author of "Power, Privilege and 
the Post," the unauthorized story of Washington Post owner Katharine Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could we not be interested?" Spy Editor James Mauro says. "There's so 
much stuff there. All we have to do is collect it." 
</P>
<P>
 High Yield: Stephen W. Frey's big score of recent days would prompt many 
mortals to ease off, maybe head to the beach for a month or two, but the vice 
president of corporate finance at Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York says he 
will definitely keep his day job. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half after Frey started scratching out a story about a sinister 
corporate takeover, the 34-year-old money man has obtained a contract for this 
first novel and a second book from Dutton/Signet, which pre-empted a planned 
auction by offering what the publisher calls "a substantial six-figure" amount. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Mace Neufeld and Bob Rehme, who produced the upcoming film of Tom 
Clancy's "A Clear and Present Danger," nailed down screen rights to Frey's "The 
Takeover" for a sum in the mid-six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding a bit bewildered after his impressive dive into the book biz, Frey 
says his thriller draws on lessons he learned while working in mergers and 
acquisitions at J. P. Morgan & Co. In the story, a mergers-and-acquisitions 
expert discovers a takeover is driven by a group of right-wing Republicans who 
are bent on bringing down a Democratic administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutton plans to publish "The Takeover" in the fall of 1995. Frey was 
represented by Cynthia Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: "Reading Rainbow" -- the PBS television series that presents 
good books to young readers -- has rounded up 101 of the titles featured on the 
show in the new "Reading Rainbow Guide to Children's Books," published by 
Citadel Press. The trade paperback also presents an off-camera look at the 
broadcast, which is hosted by actor LeVar Burton.

SEEKING TRUTH FROM LINCOLN MYTHS; LINCOLN IN AMERICAN MEMORY BY MERRILL D. 
PETERSON ; OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS $30, 482 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a remarkable list, and for the most part blue-chip: William Dean Howells, 
Edgar Lee Masters, Ida Tarbell, Carl Sandburg, Dale Carnegie, Horatio Alger and 
politician Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one figure in U.S. history -- with the possible exception of John F. 
Kennedy -- could move such a varied group of writers to publish books about 
him, but of course Abraham Lincoln has been in a class by himself since April 
15, 1865, when he died of a bullet wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, Good Friday, he became the Martyred President, and subject to 
more commentary than any other historical figure besides Jesus Christ -- to 
whom, naturally, he has on occasion been compared.  
</P>
<P>
 Merrill D. Peterson, emeritus professor of history at the University of 
Virginia, undertook a daunting task with "Lincoln in American Memory" -- poring 
through, and making sense of, the enormous amount of material written about the 
16th President. Peterson, fortunately, was well prepared for the job, having 
published more than 30 years ago "The Jefferson Image in the American Mind," a 
Bancroft prize-winning book with a similar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 And once again he has triumphed, for the Lincoln book is a fascinating 
exploration of the evolution of legend, the ways in which mortal men -- for 
good and ill, and regardless of historical fact -- become mythical. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson doesn't set the record straight here but traces others' attempts to 
do so . . . or more often their attempts not to do so, for the major lesson of 
"Lincoln in American Memory" is that although history may be written by the 
victors, it's glossed by everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal battle waged in this book -- the Civil War aside -- is the 
three-way conflict among those who promoted, respectively, the "folklore," 
"dunghill," and "historical" Lincolns. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern scholarship (though not post-modern) favors the historical category, 
but for many decades virtual hagiographies -- exemplified by Sandburg's 
massive, six-volume biography -- duked it out with hatchet jobs (such as 
Masters' screed, "Lincoln the Man"), frequently of Southern parentage. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth-makers like Sandburg, Carnegie and Alger won, of course, portraying 
Lincoln as a model for future generations (Alger's biography was in fact a 
children's book, and Sandburg's was commissioned as one). 
</P>
<P>
 Masters, the author of "Spoon River Anthology," believed that such myth-making 
was damaging to the nation, but the invective he used -- describing Lincoln as 
selfish, ignorant and having "a lazy mind" -- hardly helped his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people were upset by the books that claimed Lincoln had deliberately 
instigated the War Between the States, but Masters' volume was universally 
reviled, to the point that a bill was introduced before Congress attempting to 
ban its delivery through the U.S. mail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln associates, diligent amateur scholars and professional historians also 
produced biographies, and they were often more accurate, if also more plodding, 
than the better-known works. They inevitably carried their own agendas, 
however, as Peterson makes clear, which brings us to the much more ephemeral 
Lincoln interpretations that used the President, sometimes naively but more 
often cynically, for the authors' particular ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, it was maintained at one time or another, wanted to deport blacks; 
contracted syphilis; was driven mad for the lost love of Ann Rutledge; intended 
to follow the abolition of slavery with the abolition of alcohol; was killed by 
papists; was killed by Jews; was in fact a Jew; was really a Christian, despite 
never going to church. Lincoln, in short, has been invoked by just about every 
cause imaginable -- even by communism, the U.S. party producing a document in 
1936 arguing that "Today it is left to the Communist Party to revive the words 
of Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln has lent himself to such usage because his myth, so quick to appear 
and so massive in reach, has constantly exerted a gravitational pull over the 
facts. Many of those facts are now beyond dispute, and perhaps the biggest is 
the one illustrated so well by Merrill Peterson -- that Lincoln is "an 
inexhaustible subject." 
</P>
<P>
 (Peterson quotes the old publishing joke -- that a book entitled "Lincoln's 
Doctor's Dog" would be a can't-miss best-seller because those topics were, at 
one time, dependable reader favorites.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln in American Memory" won't fix Lincoln in American memory, and of 
course isn't intended to, but if there's anything approaching a balanced 
description of the Great Emancipator to be found in this volume, it's the one 
provided by W.E.B. DuBois: 
</P>
<P>
 "I love him," DuBois declared, "not because he was perfect but because he was 
not and yet triumphed. . . . at the crisis he was big enough to be inconsistent 
-- cruel, merciful, peace-loving, a fighter, despising Negroes and letting them 
fight and vote, protecting slavery, and freeing slaves. He was a man -- a big, 
inconsistent brave man." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mixed epitaph, to be sure, but one to be proud of nonetheless.

O.C. THEATER; 'PHANTOM' FLEXES ITS MUSCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the show that opens Sunday for a six-week stand at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center as "The Phantom of the Opera." But the troupe for this 
national touring production thinks of itself as "The Music Box Company." 
</P>
<P>
 The name, chosen by producer Cameron Macintosh, suggests a delicate object 
tinged with nostalgia and romance. It refers to one of the most evocative 
elements in Andrew Lloyd Webber's pop opera: the Phantom's papier-mache music 
box with its little monkey on top and "Masquerade," its haunting little tune, 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The box becomes a poignant symbol of the disfigured Phantom's obsessive love 
for the beautiful young opera singer Christine, who is torn between him and the 
handsome Viscount Raoul de Chagny. The reason for the company name, however, is 
more practical than poetic. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bill Miller, a spokesman for the show, Macintosh wanted to 
distinguish this production from his two other road versions now playing in the 
United States. The "Phantom" in San Francisco, which opened last Christmas 
after running for 4 1/2 years at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, is called 
"The Christine Company." The "Phantom" in Boston, on a 19-city tour that began 
4 1/2 years ago in Chicago, is "The Raoul Company." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the huge size of the Music Box troupe -- 36 performers on stage, 18 
orchestra players in the pit and 60 crew members behind the scenes -- Macintosh 
could have dubbed it the "Slavemaster Company" (for the brawny slavemaster in 
the Hannibal opera scene) and come closer to describing what is, after all, a 
very muscular tour.  
</P>
<P>
 Every time this $10-million production travels between venues on its 26-city 
journey, which began 19 months ago in Seattle, the move costs roughly $1 
million. A minimum of 22 tractor-trailers is needed to haul some 700 tons of 
scenery and equipment. Lined up end to end, the gondolas for the costume racks 
are two-thirds the length of a football field. So how does it all look on 
stage, in comparison with the other tours and with the original production that 
transferred from London's West End to Broadway in 1988? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw the New York show or the London show, which are probably the 
benchmarks, you would be hard-pressed to tell what the differences are without 
a little coaching," answers John Paull, the production supervisor for all three 
U.S. touring companies. "Scenically, what the audience sees out front is almost 
exactly the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from Boston, Paull noted that some changes had to be made in the 
production design of the road versions to accommodate variable theater sizes as 
well as the vicissitudes of touring. One of the large props originally made to 
come up through the floor -- a candelabrum -- moves onto the stage from the 
wings.  
</P>
<P>
 "In New York we took off the entire stage floor and excavated the basement for 
greater depth to get a lot of the tricks to come up from the basement," he 
said. "We did it because that is basically what happened in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "The London theater had a Victorian stage with tricks already built in. On the 
road we can't go around taking off stage floors. So we've come up with a way to 
create most of the tricks from a nine-inch-high show deck we carry with us and 
install in each theater." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized, however, that all the traveling "Phantoms" are essentially 
full-scale replicas of the original, including the show's most famous prop -- 
the chandelier that hangs above the audience in front of the ornate Paris Opera 
House proscenium and, in a moment of spectacular melodrama, comes crashing to 
the stage floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cameron Macintosh does not believe in sending out cut-down versions of the 
show," Paull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McCorkle, part of whose job it is to attend every "Phantom" premiere in 
every city and report back to both Macintosh and director Harold Prince, 
confirmed that and explained why. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road is big business," he said from New York. "People want to see 
first-class productions. Cameron can afford to make the investment because 
'Phantom' has had such enormous success. He knows he is building and 
maintaining an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the road is so big for this show that it easily dwarfs Broadway. The 
four "Phantom" productions in this country alone (including the one still on 
Broadway) have done $641 million at the box office, Miller says. Of that 
amount, $435 million came from the road companies, more than double the $206 
million taken in by the Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christine Company did $155 million in Los Angeles from May, 1989, to 
August, 1993, and has done $21 million in San Francisco since December, 1993. 
The Raoul Company, touring large cities for engagements of several months to a 
year each, has done $186 million since May, 1990. The Music Box Company, 
touring small cities for engagements of five to six weeks each, has done $72 
million since December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The worldwide gross for "Phantom," according to Miller, "exceeds $1.5 
billion." Besides London, there have been eight past or current productions in 
Toronto, Montreal, Melbourne, Tokyo, Stockholm, Hamburg and Vienna. Only 
"Cats," which has been around longer, has earned more: roughly $2 billion. But 
"Phantom" is catching up fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attendance on the Music Box tour has been well over 90% in every city it has 
played," Miller says. "That is mind-boggling. We've gone into cities like 
Nashville, Tenn., which historically has been a one-week market, and pulled off 
a six-week engagement with no trouble at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever anybody thinks of 'Phantom' -- merits or flaws -- it brings in 
people who have never walked into a legitimate theater before." 
</P>
<P>
 With so many productions running simultaneously, "Phantom" has created an 
apparently interchangeable corps of talented if little-known performers, even 
for the lead roles. The show does not depend on high-profile stars to attract 
theatergoers, as it did when Michael Crawford played the Phantom and Sarah 
Brightman played Christine. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Grant Norman, who understudied but never played the Phantom role 
on Broadway, is playing it with the Music Box company. He will star in Costa 
Mesa opposite Adrienne McEwan as Christine. She understudied the role for the 
Raoul company and made her debut as Christine on that tour last June in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Shane, the original Christine for the Music Box, went to Broadway. Davis 
Gaines, who played the Phantom for the Christine company when it was in Los 
Angeles, has just taken over the role on Broadway. And Frank D'Ambrosio, who 
used to play the Phantom for the Music Box, has gone to the Christine Company 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any difference in the talent of the different 
companies," said McCorkle who in addition to his other duties helps find cast 
replacements and rehearses and directs them. "We have auditioned thousands and 
thousands of people. To form the company in San Francisco we saw 800 people, 
just in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Music Box was in Houston (in June), we put an ad in the paper 
because we'd never been there before. The city has a terrific opera community, 
and we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity. A hundred people showed up 
to sing for us. I think we found a future Christine in Houston, if there's an 
opening." 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the bottom line? Will "The Phantom of the Opera" be the sort of 
theatrical phenomenon in Costa Mesa that it has been everywhere else? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope so," McCorkle said. "I'm always amazed at how well-maintained and 
good-looking the show is on the road. But I'm particularly proud of this 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Phantom of the Opera" opens Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, where it will 
continue through Sept. 3 (Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 2 
and 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 and 7:30 p.m., with extra performances Monday, Aug. 
29 at 8 p.m. and Thursday, Sept. 1 at 2 p.m.). $16.25 to $61.25. (714)

EMMYS TAKE ON A 'BLUE' SHADE; 26 NODS FOR 'NYPD'; BREAK PREVIOUS NOMINATION 
TOTALS FOR A TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC's gritty police drama "NYPD Blue," the target of criticism for its rough 
language and bits of nudity even before it debuted, on Thursday earned a 
record-setting 26 Emmy Award nominations from the Academy of Television Arts & 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 But academy voters again snubbed "Roseanne" as a contender for best comedy 
series. It has never been nominated in that category in its six seasons on ABC, 
although the show has won increasing praise and its title star earned her first 
Emmy as best actress in a comedy series last year.  
</P>
<P>
 This year, at her request, she was nominated simply under the name Roseanne 
because of her split with her husband, Tom Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26 nominations for "NYPD Blue" in its first season was the highest total 
ever for a weekly series in one year. The miniseries "Roots," however, got 37 
nominations in the 1976-77 competition. The amount for "NYPD Blue" surpassed 
the previous series record of 21, earned by another drama from producer and 
co-creator Steven Bochco, "Hill Street Blues," also in its first year, 1980-81. 
A third Bochco drama, "L.A. Law," was next with 20 nominations in its freshman 
season, 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco's co-creators on the three landmark television series were Michael 
Kozoll on "Hill Street Blues," Terry Louise Fisher on "L.A. Law" and David 
Milch on "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" swept all five nominations for best writing in a drama series, and 
four of the five for best directing. 
</P>
<P>
 When "NYPD Blue" was launched, the TV industry was intensely under fire for 
prime-time violence. The series, which still is not cleared by all ABC 
affiliates -- but could profit in that area from the Emmy nominations -- became 
a target for its rough-and-tumble action, in addition to its language and 
nudity, relatively strong for network TV but mild compared to other show 
business forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco argued that network TV, with its declining audience, had to assume some 
of the same liberties as cable -- which was drawing off audiences -- if it 
hoped to remain competitive in the new age of alternative viewing. The audience 
responded favorably. "NYPD Blue" ranked a strong 22nd among 128 prime-time 
network series this past season, attracting on average 23% of the available 
viewers each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roseanne," which tied with "Seinfeld" as the season's second-ranked 
entertainment series -- "Home Improvement" was No. 1 -- earned five Emmy 
nominations. The other "Roseanne" nominees included lead actor John Goodman and 
supporting players Laurie Metcalf and Sara Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers of "Roseanne" issued a statement almost identical to the one 
they released after last year's nominations: "Though we are obviously happy 
about the nominations we did receive, we are also very disappointed that the 
show was not nominated." 
</P>
<P>
 Academy sentiment toward the "Roseanne" program was clear as "Seinfeld" was 
nominated for best comedy series, along with "Frasier," "Home Improvement," 
"Mad About You" and "The Larry Sanders Show." Asked about "Roseanne," John 
Leverence, awards director of the television academy, said simply: "It didn't 
get the votes." 
</P>
<P>
 In another oddity of the nominations, television's top star, Tim Allen of 
"Home Improvement," was not nominated because, academy spokesman Mark Rosch 
said, "He was not entered prior to the entry deadline. There was a request 
after the deadline to enter him, but the deadline had passed. It was a slip on 
his representatives' part. It was certainly an unfortunate omission." 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Awards will be televised by ABC Sept. 11 from the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Network TV, which rebounded slightly in audience tune-in last season, made a 
comeback Thursday in the prestigious Emmy category of made-for-television 
movies. Last year, the traditional Big Three networks were shut out and highly 
embarrassed as HBO grabbed four of the nominations and PBS the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest nominations of made-for-TV movies included not only HBO's drama 
about AIDS, "And the Band Played On," but three productions from CBS -- 
"Gypsy," "To Dance With the White Dog" and "Breathing Lessons" -- and ABC's "A 
Place for Annie." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-rated CBS led in overall Emmy nominations with 91, while ABC had 73 -- 
nearly one-third from "NYPD Blue" -- and NBC earned 66. Fox, despite expanding 
to seven nights a week, could manage only nine nominations. Pay-cable 
nominations totaled 63, more than half going to HBO, which had 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Distant runners-up to "NYPD Blue" for most nominations were "And the Band 
Played On," which had 13; "Gypsy," with Bette Midler, and "Seinfeld," which 
tied with 12 each; "Frasier," with 11, and, with 10, "Picket Fences," the 
low-rated but critically praised CBS show that was a surprise winner as best 
drama series at last year's Emmy Awards. It ranked 66th in the ratings this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's "Frasier" stars former "Cheers" regular Kelsey Grammer in his previous 
role as a pompous psychiatrist who, following a divorce, moves to Seattle, 
where he becomes host of a radio advice program. He was among the nominees for 
best actor in a comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high-profile late-night competition, the series of both David Letterman 
and Jay Leno were nominated in the category of best variety, music or comedy 
shows. But "Late Night With David Letterman," in its first season on CBS, 
picked up seven nominations overall, while NBC's "The Tonight Show with Jay 
Leno" got only three. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' "Northern Exposure," which led last year's nominations with 16 but was 
trounced at the Emmy Awards ceremony, clearly fell out of favor with academy 
voters this season. It earned only four nominations: for best drama series, 
supporting actor (Barry Corbin), sound editing and sound mixing. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented total of 26 nominations for "NYPD Blue" included -- in 
addition to the five writing and four directing honors -- nine for acting, 
including nods to both of the show's stars, David Caruso and Dennis Franz. 
Regular supporting actors also nominated were Gail O'Grady, Sharon Lawrence, 
Amy Brenneman, Nick Turturro and Gordon Clapp. Guest performers nominated for 
"NYPD Blue" were Penny Fuller and Dan Heday. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the Band Played On" also picked up a fistful of acting nominations -- six 
-- as Matthew Modine was honored for his lead performance, along with 
supporting players Richard Gere, Ian McKellen, Alan Alda, Lily Tomlin and 
Swoosie Kurtz. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sidelight, Faye Dunaway, recently dropped from the stage production of 
"Sunset Boulevard" amid heated exchanges, was nominated for a guest performance 
in ABC's "Columbo." 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco said that he was "thrilled" by the recognition given "NYPD Blue" -- 
"for everything we went through and the battles we fought against the 
reactionary forces who had negative responses without even seeing the show. And 
I'm pleased for ABC. They stuck by us." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing his reaction to past honors, he said "Hill Street Blues" was 
satisfying because, at the time of the nominations, it "was almost dead in the 
water (in the ratings)." The "L.A. Law" nominations were "personally satisfying 
after being fired by MTM off 'Hill Street.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As for "NYPD Blue," the "most significant thing is that we got all the writing 
nominations, and to me that is the heart and soul of the show." 
</P>

 Some highly competitive races shaped up in the Emmy nominations. Besides the 
shootout for top weekly comedy, the candidates for best drama series are "NYPD 
Blue," "Picket Fences," "Northern Exposure," "Star Trek: The Next Generation" 
and the quietly powerful "Law & Order." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing against Roseanne for the award as best lead actress in a comedy 
series are Helen Hunt of "Mad About You," former winner Candice Bergen of 
"Murphy Brown," Patricia Richardson of "Home Improvement" and Annie Potts, the 
onetime "Designing Women" star who replaced Susan Dey in "Love & War" last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another strong competition, the contenders for best lead actress in a 
miniseries or special include Midler for "Gypsy," Kirstie Alley for "David's 
Mother," Joanne Woodward for "Breathing Lessons," Helen Mirren for "Prime 
Suspect 3" and Jessica Tandy for "To Dance With the White Dog," in which she 
co-starred with her husband, Hume Cronyn, another nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 And Angela Lansbury, who has never won an acting Emmy for "Murder, She Wrote" 
since the series debuted in 1984, will give it yet another try as a drama 
series nominee. Top Nominees

'NIGHT' STILL COLORED BY CONTROVERSY; MOVIES: FIRST, NUDITY FROM THE EROTIC 
THRILLER IS TRIMMED TO EARN AN R RATING. NOW 'TOMBSTONE' DIRECTOR GEORGE 
COSMATOS IS BROUGHT IN TO SHOOT SCENES FOR THE FILM STARRING BRUCE WILLIS. 
</P>

 Although its ratings problems have apparently been resolved with an R rating 
awarded earlier this week, Disney's upcoming erotic thriller "Color of Night" 
is still mired in controversy: Another director has been brought aboard at the 
last minute, and new scenes for the film, which is scheduled to be released 
Aug. 19, were being shot Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tombstone" director George Cosmatos was picked to shoot a new scene with the 
film's stars Bruce Willis and Ruben Blades that sources say may alter the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmatos' appearance has caused quite a stir, since the film's director, 
Richard Rush, had been embroiled in a heated arbitration with producer and 
Cinergi chairman Andy Vajna this spring over the final cut of the picture. Amid 
problems with that dispute, Rush suffered a heart attack April 25 and is still 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 But Geoffrey Ammer, Cinergi's president of worldwide marketing, said that the 
arbitration has been resolved and that Rush, who is working on the final mix of 
the film, is fully aware of Cosmatos' involvement. Ammer said Cinergi brought 
Cosmatos aboard to supervise shooting of the new scenes since it didn't want 
Rush to lose dubbing time so close to the release date. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did ask me if I wanted to shoot (the additional scenes). But frankly, I 
don't think the scene will be used," Rush says. "Cosmatos called and asked if 
it was OK with me to do it, and I was glad that they picked him instead of some 
TV guy. I feel my time should be spent finishing this." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the key new scene as sort of a sting between the co-stars at the 
end "which is meant as a little joke." Blades plays a cop and Willis is a New 
York analyst who moves to California after the suicide of one of his patients. 
After he arrives, his therapist buddy is killed and he takes over his friend's 
therapy group, hoping to find the murderer. It is the graphic sex scenes 
between Willis and co-star Jane March ("The Lover") that have kept the picture 
in the headlines. Those scenes, which showed plenty of full frontal nudity of 
both, apparently have been trimmed significantly, because the picture was 
awarded an R rating from the MPAA on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-minute cut had been shown at the Cannes Film Festival that included some 
of those explicit scenes. "Those scenes," joked a Disney source, "could have 
re-launched Willis' career." 
</P>
<P>
 While the sex scenes have been clipped from the Aug. 19 release, expect them 
to crop up in the videocassette version, which Rush says could surface as early 
as three weeks after the film opens. "This will be my version of the film. What 
you are seeing on the screen is Andy's. This video, which really is the 
director's cut, is an agreement I have with Andy," Rush says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush's heart attack occurred one week after the dispute between Rush and Vajna 
over the final cut began. "Andy and I are friends, but we had a severe 
difference of opinion," Rush says. "I thought I had final cut on this. But the 
contract was a bit vague. It turned out I didn't." Rush returned to the project 
two weeks ago to put on finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had more of, shall we say, a perverse and darker version than Andy's. My 
pictures are dense and strange. Andy's version is more commercial. Now it's not 
as graphic as it was, but it's still pretty daring. Of course, I still feel it 
was better darker." 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney sources say the picture did not test well in about five early 
screenings, so the original April 29 release date was pushed back for editing. 
Those sources also say that Vajna tapped Cosmatos -- a friend who has brought 
him Cinergi's biggest hit to date, "Tombstone" -- because of the dispute he had 
with Rush over final cut. They say Rush is perceived by some as being pretty 
rusty since this is the first film he's directed in 14 years since the 1980 
Oscar nominee "The Stunt Man" starring Peter O'Toole, a project he reportedly 
worked on for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush says he's delved into other projects since that film, although they 
failed to hit the screen. And as for the test screenings on "Color of Night," 
he said they showed mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone now are scenes with Willis' character talking to the camera as if he were 
talking directly to the audience, which Disney sources say just didn't work. 
They also say another problem with the film was a leading character's 
distinctive features, which hindered a key plot twist. Rush said "prosthetics" 
and makeup have fixed any problems.

CBS CHIEF TO REPORTERS: 'DON'T WRITE US OFF TOO EASILY'; TELEVISION: HOWARD 
STRINGER DEFENDS NETWORK, POINTING OUT THAT REVENUES ARE UP, AS IS ADVERTISING 
SOLD FOR THE FALL SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When CBS Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer stood before an annual 
gathering of TV reporters in Universal City on Thursday, he might as well have 
been facing a firing line. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-mighty CBS, last season's No. 1 network, has been pushed around in 
the past six months by the upstart Fox network, which stole CBS' broadcast 
rights to NFL football and a handful of powerful CBS station affiliates, 
forcing the older network to sign up some weaker stations. Furthermore, 
advertisers don't seem impressed with any of CBS' new programs for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll miss the NFL, but we'll wait and see how the football bounces," 
Stringer said. He expressed hope that CBS' strategy to counter football games 
on Sundays with movies for women, based on Harlequin romance novels, will earn 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer vigorously defended his network, pointing out that CBS revenues are 
up, as is the amount of advertising the network has already sold for the fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall sitcom "The Boys Are Back," starring Suzanne Pleshette and Hal Linden 
as parents who can't quite get their adult children to leave the nest, is the 
highest-testing pilot in network history, he said. And no drama since "Dr. 
Quinn, Medicine Woman" has tested as well as the upcoming "Touched by an 
Angel," about an angel dispatched from heaven to offer people advice at turning 
points in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Stringer maintained, CBS will retain its prime-time ratings crown for 
the fourth straight year next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take it at all lightly, but I think we will be able to harness our 
dismay over what happened into competitive anger," he said. "I have no fear 
that I can harness this group and attack in the fall and win the season. Don't 
write us off too easily." 
</P>
<P>
 One positive for Stringer is the possible addition of Tom Snyder to host a 
late-night talk show produced by David Letterman's company, following Letterman 
at 12:35 a.m. Letterman has been the biggest proponent of Snyder, a talk-show 
fixture from the 1970s who has been hosting his own program on cable's CNBC 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like each other. They are amused by each other. They are impressed by 
each other," Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although negotiations with Snyder are not concluded, Stringer was talking 
about the show as a done deal. CBS executives at one point expressed concern 
that Snyder might not be the best fit with Letterman's flip humor, but Stringer 
has come around, comparing the sort of nostalgic resurgence of Snyder with 
crooner Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to top Letterman with another comic is virtually impossible," Stringer 
said. "Tom Snyder cuts across generations very effectively. He can talk to 
almost everybody. I like the idea of a dramatic contrast to comedy. (Snyder) 
has the kind of range that Larry King has developed, and the intelligence and 
sensitivity to capture the center of that late-night audience." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS also wants a known commodity in that time period to draw an audience and 
act as a sort of bridge for people into the network's morning news show. "I 
don't think a brand-new comedian would have lasted 10 seconds in that time 
period," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stringer would not say when Snyder would debut on CBS. One of the problems in 
negotiations with Snyder has been that many CBS stations would likely choose to 
push his show back into the wee hours of the morning. At the urging of the 
network, 80% of CBS stations are currently airing Letterman at 11:35 p.m. But 
now they want to save the post-Letterman time slot for valuable syndicated 
programming, with which they make more money.

THEATER REVIEW; HIGH CONCEPT SINKS OPERATIC 'FIRE UNDER WATER'; THE AMBITIOUS 
FULLERTON PRODUCTION READS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A PUT-ON, BUT IN ITS SERIOUSNESS 
IT JUST GETS SILLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an earlier era, Joe Noone, the ostensible hero of Michael Mollo's new play, 
"Fire Under Water," at the Tribune Theatre, wouldn't have been on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have been on vinyl, the emotional center of a concept album by Pink 
Floyd or Yes or the Moody Blues. The lonely figure with his head in the clouds 
whom no one, not even his wife, understands. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, in the great old days of the late '60s-early '70s, the Christ motif 
would crown him for good measure. He would probably die, a visionary for his 
people, whose eyes are now opened to The Light. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, on the Tribune's starkly bare, black stage, it's all a bit 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 That's until Act II, when it's all very ridiculous, and very clear that Mollo 
hasn't written a play at all, but verse for a concept album without backup 
band. The concept might be taken from Robert Bly's men's liberation tome, "Iron 
John," but an "Iron John" that has been left out in the sun to spoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on -- hearing Michael Zittel's arch reading of Joe, watching the 
cavorting of the lesbian lovers (Lynnae Hitchcock and Shannon McDuff), who 
seemingly live with Joe and wife Sara (Erica Dewey), checking out the goofy 
fable play performed for the local men's-lib group by Joe's extremely 
libidinous and semi-clothed mom, Maggi (Jennifer Bishton, at least 15 years too 
young for the role) -- it's easy to wonder if "Fire Under Water" isn't some 
kind of put-on of New Age silliness in general and terminally serious 
spiritualists in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Maggi's ribald act as an androgynous creature in Eden has some of 
the cute charm (with help from Bishton) of Shakespeare's plays-within-plays. 
Joe is instantly a silly character, announcing to one and all that he wants to 
die and "return, pure," that he wants "to dismantle the Evil System," and that 
sugar addiction is bad for you (all this is one speech). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How could he not be the butt of a playwright's joke? If the playwright takes 
him seriously, that's how. 
</P>
<P>
 The few mitigating moments of humor in "Fire Under Water" blow away like ash, 
leaving a tortuously sincere study of a young man who, at best, has a major 
Christ complex, and at worst is a megalomaniac in deep need of professional 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 The nadir of Joe's dark night (no, months ) of the soul is when he thrashes 
about on stage like a man-sized polliwog on angel dust, wrestling, it seems, 
with the ghost of his father. Zittel comes close to resembling a World 
Wrestling Federation freak, alone in the ring without pads. 
</P>
<P>
 No one -- not Sara, not Joe's supposed best friend Sam (Bradley A. Whitfield) 
-- has a clue how to put Joe in his place. Joe's method of conversation is like 
a blockhead shaman dude, saying to Sara that "I don't expect you to understand 
my purpose." Nor, it seems, does Mollo expect us to understand his. 
</P>
<P>
 His writing is too in love with a kind of ersatz Beat poet lingo, like a guy 
who's just dropped acid to Kerouac for the very first time and wants to tell 
everyone about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the New Hippie Theater, substituting meaningful human interaction and 
perception with on-stage rites (accented by Gina Karaba's masks and Joaquin 
Rodas' spooky lights) that might be led by witch priestess Starhawk. And all of 
it is topped off with opaquely versified dialogue that no actor -- and 
certainly not these actors -- could ever get their mouths around. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Mollo stages playwright Mollo, which definitively suffocates this 
play. Another directorial point of view -- any other -- would have challenged 
the playwright to think through what he was trying to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors seem to obey Mollo's wishes, which include Zittel daring to make a 
public embarrassment of himself. He has the sinewy body of a deep-sea diver 
(Joe's profession) but speaks almost robot-like. Only Whitfield and Bishton 
have any real stage presence or honest emotional grounding. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to admire any American playwright, and any American theater, for 
going after a mythic style -- especially a young theater like the Tribune, 
which is surrounded by a host of safe, fuddy-duddy, user-friendly theaters 
hooked on nothing but revivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The great danger is that without disciplined consideration of the ideas behind 
myths and how they're dramatized, and without actors trained in the mythic 
approach invented by the Greeks, you'll get mythic egg on your face. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for the Tribune folks: "The Tempest." O brave new world . . .  
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TIM MCGRAW: STEADY DIET OF COUNTRY CORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim McGraw fit right in as an attraction at the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly minted country star's show Wednesday night at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre offered a midway's worth of musical junk food, but dang if the 
flash, the barker-blarney and the swirl of enthusiasm didn't make you want to 
swallow at least some of it. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw's 95-minute show included enough sugary fluff and drippy molasses to 
start his own cotton-candy and candy-apple franchises. Fortunately, his sharp, 
sturdy, and delightfully motley-looking backup band, the Dance Hall Doctors, 
made sure that there was some healthy protein in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest hits on the menu, "Don't Take the Girl," was a 
treacle-coated corn dog of a ballad that the overflow crowd of about 9,000 
swallowed in a gulp. McGraw sang this mechanical, bathetic potboiler about 
young love and young death in a stricken, fervent voice, and many of the fans 
sang along. 
</P>
<P>
 Another remarkably awful ballad was "Not a Moment Too Soon," the title track 
from McGraw's breakthrough album, of which millions (two, anyway) have been 
sold, just like cheeseburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be instructive to quote the entire chorus of this marvel of 
song-craft. Like certain fair delicacies, it consists of almost 100% 
unadulterated fat -- the cliche being the verbal equivalent of the fattiest 
junk food. 
</P>
<P>
 For hack songwriters concocting commercial confections, cliches are a main 
ingredient, like so much butter and cream. For critics, they are sheer heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a moment too soon (cliche No. 1) 
</P>
<P>
 Without a minute to spare (2) 
</P>
<P>
 You touched my heart (3) 
</P>
<P>
 When I didn't have a prayer (4) 
</P>
<P>
 In my darkest hour (5) 
</P>
<P>
 With my world filled with gloom (not quite a cliche; OK, so they put in half 
an ounce of lean) 
</P>
<P>
 Your sweet love saved me (6) 
</P>
<P>
 Not a moment too soon (I think I'm having chest pains) 
</P>
<P>
 If the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) won't put warning labels on this 
stuff, maybe the MLA (Modern Language Assn.) will. The crowd sang along on this 
one, too. Cheeseburger, cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to McGraw's breakthrough hit, "Indian Outlaw." This buffoonish 
ditty, a pointless, incoherent jumble of ridiculous cliches about Native 
Americans is the musical equivalent of "F Troop." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Native American groups have taken offense and called it bigoted (the 
Cherokees of Southern California and the American Indian Movement sponsored a 
small protest outside the fair's main entrance Wednesday evening before the 
show). 
</P>
<P>
 But "Indian Outlaw" is too dim and scattered a work to qualify as 
mean-spirited. A bigot would have an opinion about Indians. To have an opinion, 
you have to be able to think. There is no evidence that the two Nashville 
songsmiths who wrote "Indian Outlaw" put any thought into it at all. 
Mindlessly, unintentionally insulting? Yes. Bigoted? Doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to the protesters, though. Maybe the next songwriter will 
remember the fuss they made and pause to think. As historical dues go, Native 
Americans have paid in full and earned the right to be taken seriously, without 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty-seeking wags should look elsewhere for ethnic flavor. McGraw is of 
Irish-Italian extraction. If he wants to stay on the same level with his next 
album, perhaps he can give us drunken leprechauns or a spaghetti-twirling fat 
man exclaiming, "Mama mia!" 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw served up "Indian Outlaw" at the end of his set, without commenting on 
the controversy. It lifted a delighted house out of its seats. And, in fact, 
the live version was boisterous enough to elevate the song into the "Achy 
Breaky" category of idiocy that is kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The band threw in some riffing from the Eagles' "Witchy Woman," as if to point 
out that McGraw isn't the first paleface to capitalize on musical cliches 
culled from Hollywood oaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As if to set the record straight, McGraw had Paul Revere & the Raiders' 1971 
pro-Indian hit, "Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation 
Indian)," played over the sound system just before the show started. The song 
is briefly quoted at the end of "Indian Outlaw," but for no discernible reason. 
</P>
<P>
 In other PC news, McGraw had an interpreter on stage to translate his show 
into sign language. But since she was a long-tressed, tight-jeaned, 
hip-shimmying lovely who also functioned as a go-go girl, he only gets 
half-credit in the political-correctness department. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw gets full credit for effort: One had to admire his eagerness to get 
across and stir up the crowd in any way he could. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered rump first, turning and waggling his fanny at the crowd before he'd 
sung a note. But he avoided the Billy Ray Cyrus trap and kept that kind of 
excess in check. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a rise, the chatty McGraw did coyote howls, led the crowd in 
back-and-forth yells, even trotted out the rappers' exhortation, "Somebody 
scream." He didn't need to do all that extraneous stuff: Keeping up a 
high-energy performance is enough, and the wiry, fundamentally likable singer 
in the too-big cowboy hat managed that consistently -- except for a dawdling 
band-intro segment that temporarily stalled the show. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw involved the band in some of the showmanship, and an interesting cast 
they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Balding, bespectacled fiddler-guitarist Bob Minner turned up in a white shirt 
and a tie, looking as if he'd just come from an office day job and hadn't had 
time to change for the gig. Opposite him was keyboards player Jeff McMahon, 
trailing long blond hair of Afghan hound proportions and looking like a refugee 
from a late-'80s Sunset Strip glam-metal band (actually, McGraw introduced him 
as an ex-member of Prince & the Revolution). 
</P>
<P>
 Lead guitarist Darran Smith had the stocky, stubbly, seedy look of a character 
actor in a crime drama, the sort of fellow the cops haul in for interrogation, 
trying to get him to turn informer. 
</P>
<P>
 All were capable players, allowing McGraw to incorporate honky-tonk, Western 
swing, country-rock anthems and a good, authoritatively rocking version of Earl 
Thomas Conley's 1982 hit, "Somewhere Between Right and Wrong" into the mix. 
Smith and drummer Denny Hemingson (introduced as an Orange County resident) 
leaned a bit too much toward the rock side, but their forcefulness was on 
balance a help. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, who hails from Louisiana (and is the son of one of baseball's biggest 
hams, colorful former relief pitcher Tug McGraw), sang in a thin if pleasant 
voice with a pronounced nasal twang. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a bit of John Anderson in some of his sliding phrases, but he lacked 
the easy playfulness and depth of passion mustered by that exemplary country 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw sang a couple of new songs, one a sappy lovelorn ballad called "I 
Didn't Ask And She Didn't Say" that the audience instantly loved. Sounds like 
radio-ready fodder from here. 
</P>
<P>
 The truly disheartening thing about McGraw isn't that he became a star by 
finding the lowest common denominator of line-danceable beats and 
schmaltz-laden balladry. It's that his 1993 debut album, "Tim McGraw" (from 
which he drew four of the set's 20 songs) offered far more substantial and 
tasteful stuff, and flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 It featured lots of fine picking (often acoustic), and if the songs weren't 
exactly daring and poetic, most of them made believable emotional points with a 
measure of grace. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Not a Moment Too Soon," McGraw returned with the same producers but a far 
different menu of songs. Cheeseburger, cheeseburger -- more than 2 million 
sold. Don't think he'll be serving that health food again soon.

COMPANY TOWN; NEW ELEKTRA CHIEF BREAKS MALE BASTION; MUSIC: AFRICAN AMERICAN 
SYLVIA RHONE CALLS HER PROMOTION BY WARNER MUSIC GROUP A 'SYMBOLIC MOMENT.' 
</P>

 The music industry's good ol' boys club finally opened its doors this week 
when Warner Music Group promoted Sylvia Rhone to head its mammoth 
Elektra/EastWest division -- the latest twist in a dramatic shake-up at the 
world's largest record corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We smashed right through the glass ceiling this time," said Rhone, 42, 
referring to her status as the most powerful woman in the music industry. "This 
is an important symbolic moment not only for me, but for every African American 
and woman in our business. I know I have some very big shoes to fill, and I 
look forward to the challenges ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The "glass ceiling" that prevents the rise of minorities to power is 
especially prevalent in the music business, where only 3% of the most senior 
positions are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With her promotion, Rhone joins an elite circle previously reserved for white 
male executives such as Warner Bros. Records Chairman Mo Ostin and Atlantic 
Group Co-Chairman Ahmet Ertegun. All three executives report to Doug Morris, 
president and chief operating officer of Time Warner Inc.'s new domestic music 
sector. The realignment was orchestrated by Warner Music Group Chairman Robert 
Morgado, who is trying to stimulate business at the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Elektra -- home to 125 acts, including Metallica, Natalie Cole and Anita Baker 
-- has long been considered one of the most prestigious labels in the business. 
As chief of the firm, Rhone follows in the footsteps of four top industry 
figures: founder Jac Holzman, entertainment impresario David Geffen, veteran 
executive Joe Smith and talent guru Bob Krasnow, who resigned last week, citing 
objections to the new chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Rhone, a Wharton School graduate and single mother, was chosen for 
the position because of her achievements at EastWest, where as chair and chief 
executive since 1991 she masterminded the multimillion-dollar success of acts 
such as En Vogue, Pantera, Snow and Das EFX. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new position, Rhone will oversee operations at Elektra, Asylum, 
Nonesuch and EastWest Records, with each label maintaining its moniker. 
According to Rhone, the albums scheduled for release this year by those firms 
will hit the stores as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 No significant reorganization is expected to occur under the merger before 
1995 -- at which point cuts in staff and artist rosters at both companies are 
likely to begin, sources at Warner said. Rhone denied rumors that she has been 
given a mandate to clean house immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to do anything whatsoever to disrupt the continuity of 
either business," said Rhone, who held meetings in New York this week with 
employees at Elektra and EastWest to calm the waters. "I intend to preserve the 
artistic identity of each company and consider this opportunity the most 
exciting challenge of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhone, a Harlem native who grew up listening to Aretha Franklin and Marvin 
Gaye, entered the music industry in 1974 as a secretary at Buddah Records. She 
worked in a variety of record company promotion departments -- including at 
Elektra -- before being named the head of national promotion for Warner-owned 
Atlantic Records in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop on the corporate elevator was head of Atlantic's black-music 
department, followed by vice president and then senior vice president of 
EastWest Records in 1988. Since taking over as chief executive of that company 
three years later, she helped drive annual revenue at the firm from $50 million 
to past the $80 million mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't argue with success, and Sylvia Rhone is one of the great success 
stories of our business," said Charles Koppelman, chairman and chief executive 
of EMI Records Group in North America. "This isn't about somebody cashing in on 
five minutes' worth of glory here. Sylvia Rhone is a winner who worked her way 
up to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhone's 20-year ascent from secretary to record label chief was no cakewalk, 
but rather a hard-won victory rife with racist and sexist encounters, she says. 
Even now, Rhone's promotion has prompted grumbling in the industry's good ol' 
boys network, where her rock music credentials are privately being challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some guys in the old guard who find it difficult to accept an 
African American woman taking over the reins of a giant pop company, but Sylvia 
will wake them up," said Joe Smith, a former Elektra chief who was Rhone's boss 
during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a bright and aggressive executive who has proven 
herself repeatedly over the past 20 years," he said. "The way I see it, 
Sylvia's promotion isn't just a great move for her. It's a huge step forward 
for the entire music business."

COMCAST GAINS PARTNER, LOSES RIVAL, IN QVC BID; TELEVISION: LIBERTY MEDIA WILL 
PARTICIPATE IN THE $2.2-BILLION OFFER FOR THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Comcast Corp. on Thursday bolstered its $2.2-billion bid for cable home 
shopping network QVC Inc. by enlisting a potential rival, Liberty Media Corp., 
as a minority partner. 
</P>
<P>
 With a single stroke, Comcast reduced its own financial exposure and ensured 
that the shopping network will retain its largest customer, because Liberty 
Media is in the process of merging with Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's 
largest cable TV operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street sources speculated that a rival QVC offer may yet surface from a 
telephone company or retail firm. But those odds lengthened with Liberty's 
decision to join the Comcast bid. QVC's stock sank $1.75 in Nasdaq trading to 
close at $44.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's going to take on both these guys, because they're very formidable," 
said one entertainment industry executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast and QVC said they will jointly offer $44 in cash for the QVC shares 
they don't already own. If all the outstanding shares are tendered, Comcast 
will emerge owning 57% of QVC, while Liberty Media will own 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 In its initial offer last week, Comcast offered $44 a share, but it had 
planned to issue convertible preferred stock for $7 of that amount. The Comcast 
bid torpedoed plans by QVC Chairman Barry Diller to merge the company with CBS 
Inc., where he would have become chief executive. CBS Chairman Laurence A. 
Tisch abandoned the deal, saying he wouldn't be drawn into a bidding contest 
for QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller would be welcome to stay on at QVC, according to Comcast executives. 
But Diller -- who quit Fox Inc. two years ago to run his own company -- has 
made it clear to friends that he won't settle for running a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone in New York, Diller declined to comment beyond the 
company's formal promise to review the latest offer "and continue to explore 
alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
 With their announcement, Comcast and Liberty laid to rest rumors that 
Liberty's controlling shareholder, TCI Chief Executive John C. Malone, was 
"furious" over Comcast's disruption of the QVC-CBS deal. The deal was hammered 
out in just four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed about that CBS deal going off track," Liberty President 
and Chief Executive Peter R. Barton conceded in a telephone interview. "But I'm 
not grumpy. People have to do what they have to do. We came out of this big, 
big fans of both Barry and Comcast." 
</P>
<P>
 Barton said his company has previously cleared an antitrust agency's review 
for owning between 25% and 49% of QVC's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts predicted that Liberty will be forced to leave QVC's management 
to Comcast in order to not rile antitrust regulators. Liberty already controls 
Home Shopping Network, QVC's major competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast, founded 31 years ago by Philadelphia businessman Ralph J. Roberts, is 
the nation's third-largest cable TV operator and has holdings in the wireless 
and cellular telephone businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast was a founding shareholder of QVC and hoped to push more aggressively 
into cable TV programming by recruiting Diller to run the network in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast backed Diller's unsuccessful bid for Paramount Communications but was 
upset by the QVC decision to merge with CBS. Federal rules severely restrict 
cross ownership of broadcast and cable properties, so Comcast would have had 
little voting power in a merged CBS-QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its reported displeasure, Comcast's bold move last week stunned Wall 
Street -- and initially worried Comcast investors who thought the company might 
incur too much debt with the QVC bid. 
</P>
<P>
 But Comcast explained that banks had already promised to loan $1 billion 
because QVC is virtually debt-free, and QVC could bear an additional $200 
million in debt securities. Comcast said it could raise an additional $300 
million by selling a 20% stake in Heritage Media, and it said it would sell 
some assets if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Liberty's participation in the bid, Comcast President Brian L. 
Roberts said the company won't need to sell convertible preferred shares or 
other assets because it already has more than enough cash to cover its outlay. 
By Roberts' calculation, Comcast will spend just $225 million of its own money 
for the acquisition, since it already owns 8.6 million QVC shares and Liberty 
controls 10.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted favorably to the news that Comcast and Liberty won't go 
head-to-head in a bidding contest. Comcast shares gained 87.5 cents to close at 
$16.75, while Liberty rose 81 cents to close at $21.06. TCI rose $1.125 to 
close at $22.

FEAST AND FAMINE IN MINI-MALLS; QUAKE HAUNTS MANY; OTHERS ENJOY A BOOM

 There's an easy way to tell how the small businesses along one block in 
Northridge are faring six months after the Jan. 17 earthquake ravaged the area. 
Just look at the shopkeepers' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Angelo is the owner of the Kids at Heart gift shop in the Northridge 
Garden Center strip mall on Reseda Boulevard, just north of the infamous 
Northridge Meadows apartments where 16 people died. But the usually upbeat 
D'Angelo -- who has done everything from hosting art fairs to adding trendy 
items to her carefully honed line of gifts -- is showing signs of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm knocking myself out trying to survive," said D'Angelo, whose sales are 
still 20% off her previous normal levels. "I'm in a burnout period." 
</P>
<P>
 At a strip mall down the street, dry cleaner owner Gianni Fontana di Trevi 
looks grim. In the last few months, his daily gross receipts have averaged just 
$100 a day, not enough to cover his expenses. Fontana di Trevi has not applied 
for a Small Business Administration loan because he sees no way to make 
repayment.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking I'll stay another month or two to see what happens," he said. In 
the meantime, his wife's salary from an outside job pays the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Coco's Restaurant & Bakery, next to Kids at Heart, general manager 
Nancy Hazelzet flashes a somewhat embarrassed smile as she says that business 
is booming, with sales up $1,000 to $2,000 a week over last year. Many regular 
customers have returned, she said, along with construction workers, geologists 
and architects working on earthquake repairs in the area. "This has become a 
gathering place," Hazelzet said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For these small business owners in three strip malls about a mile from the 
epicenter, the six-month mark after the earthquake holds widely diverse 
meanings.  
</P>
<P>
 To some, it commemorates their will to endure as their sales slowly rebound; 
for others, it's a glaring reminder of how arduous their recovery has been, 
making them wonder how much longer they can hold on when sales, for some, are 
still down by half. Yet others find themselves in the surprising position of 
seeing more business than before the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The businesses suffering the most tend to be those that rely on clientele from 
the immediate neighborhood. Roya Saberzadeh, owner of Rochie's Greek Row, which 
specializes in clothing and memorabilia for Cal State Northridge students, is 
struggling to stay afloat as sales are off by 50%. Not only is enrollment down 
at the quake-damaged university, she said, but many students have moved away 
while apartment houses are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberzadeh is still waiting for word on her SBA loan application, so she 
borrows money from her father to get by. Staring down into a glass cabinet, she 
said quietly, "I'm going to owe him into the next lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Jones, owner of the Jones Coffee Co. boutique, just received word that 
her SBA loan application has been approved. She doesn't know how much she'll 
get, but she hopes it will go a long way toward replenishing the $64,000 she 
spent from her savings to replace broken porcelain plates, glasses and 
coffee-grinding equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gamble for Jones, whose sales are also off 50%. Her clientele consists 
mostly of area homeowners, many of whom are just now starting to receive 
insurance money and begin repairs on their homes. Jones is betting that her 
customers will be settled back into their houses and ready to buy dishes and 
decorative items during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentist Alexander Bondar and Intrigue hair salon owner Walter Zipusch, tenants 
of Northridge Garden Center, were denied SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipusch says he was turned down because the SBA believed he couldn't repay the 
money, since his business is off 70%. Much of the neighborhood's damaged or 
destroyed housing hasn't been rebuilt, depriving him of his customer base. 
</P>
<P>
 Bondar has the same problem. After a failed attempt to sell his practice, he 
says he pays his bills from savings and spends his time calling former 
patients. "They moved to a different area," he said. "They say they're scared 
of this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Zipusch says the only way he can survive is if his $2,700-a-month rent is 
drastically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co. said structural repairs at the mall 
have been completed and that it will begin charging tenants rent this month for 
the first time since the quake. But rents will not be lowered, spokeswoman 
Jo-Anne Leventhal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartford, Conn.-based insurer, which was the lender to the mall's former 
owner, assumed ownership in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Matthews, who manages the other two strip malls on the block, has reduced 
the rent for many of his tenants, despite paying an extra $900 a month in 
interest for loans he took out to cover repairs and lost income. Matthews 
worries about securing a new mortgage when $2 million in mortgage loans on the 
properties comes due in December. Roger Olson, chairman of Dwyer-Curlett Inc., 
the Los Angeles mortgage banking firm that represents the lenders on Matthews' 
strip malls, said the lenders have "every incentive to work things out. They 
don't want to foreclose."

IBM POSTS STRONG QUARTERLY PROFIT; SHARE PRICE SOARS; COMPUTERS: BIG BLUE 
SURPRISES ANALYSTS BY EARNING $668 MILLION IN THE PERIOD. COST CUTTING GETS 
MOST OF THE CREDIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. surprised Wall Street on Thursday by 
reporting a $668-million profit for the second quarter, sending its stock 
soaring and temporarily quieting critics who say the long-suffering computer 
giant still doesn't have its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM shares leaped $6.50 to $62.375 in heavy trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. The earnings, which amounted to $1.14 a share, contrast with a 
mammoth loss of $8.9 billion, or $14.10 a share, for the comparable period a 
year ago. Revenue was $15.35 billion, up from $14.95 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still far from where we need to be, but we are showing steady 
improvement," Chief Executive Louis V. Gerstner Jr. said. It was the third 
consecutive quarterly profit for the world's largest computer company after two 
years of steep losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that the improved financial performance came from cost cutting 
-- including large-scale layoffs -- rather than growth in sales. Last year, IBM 
announced plans to cut $7 billion in expenses by 1996, a program that included 
the elimination of 35,000 more jobs by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even IBM appears to have been surprised by the results. "Frankly, the earnings 
improvements have come a bit faster than we thought they were even four or five 
months ago," Jerry York, IBM's chief financial officer, told analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 But IBM still has a long way to go in adjusting to a market where computer 
buyers are turning away from mainframes and mini-computers -- long the source 
of massive profits for IBM -- and toward low-margin personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales of large machines are going to keep declining, so they have to focus on 
the smaller machines if they are going to increase sales," said David Wu, 
computer analyst at S.G. Warburg. "They need to be faster on their feet, 
introduce products faster and reduce costs. It's humanly possible. If Compaq 
can do it, (IBM) can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq announced earlier this week that its second-quarter sales climbed 53% 
to $1.6 billion. At that pace, analysts say, Compaq could surpass IBM's 
personal computer business by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say they are mystified by IBM's plans in the personal computer 
area. In a controversial move earlier this year, Gerstner removed the executive 
who had built up the company's PC business and replaced him with an executive 
brought along by Gerstner from his old company, RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
 To do more than improve short-term profit through cost cutting, IBM must find 
a way to increase revenue, and a good performance in PCs is vital. But the 
company's PC sales have flattened after a strong performance last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to see if they can create a demand situation for their products, 
rather than running the company on a strictly financial basis," said Barry 
Bosak, an analyst with Smith Barney, who described the company's performance as 
sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost cutting seems to be having its intended effect. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in reducing costs, IBM must perform a delicate balancing act. The 
growth area is personal computers, but the bulk of the company's profit still 
comes from large mainframes. And it is in that area that Gerstner has pointed 
his knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corporate customers who continue to pay millions of dollars for IBM's 
large mainframes say they are being shortchanged as IBM reduces the number of 
workers it offers to service such accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 While IBM is cutting support, it is also sharply cutting prices of the big 
machines. IBM has seen a recovery in sales of mainframes, shipping more last 
year than the year before and stretching capacity, but actual revenue fell 
because of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, hardware sales climbed a meager 3% for the quarter to $7.7 billion, 
with most of the increase in sales coming from growth in PCs overseas. IBM's 
strongest performance came in the services area, where revenue grew a solid 
24%. IBM's Comeback

 Litton Gets Contract for More Destroyers: Litton Industries Inc. said it was 
given an $836.7-million contract from the Navy to build three additional Aegis 
class destroyers at Litton's Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss. The award is 
part of the Navy's recently announced plan to temporarily abandon competitive 
bids and divide construction awards for destroyers between Beverly Hills-based 
Litton and Bath Iron Works Corp. in order to maintain an industrial base for 
ships. The Navy has already ordered 32 of the destroyers, including 14 from 
Ingalls.

SILICON GRAPHICS INC. TO START NEW SUBSIDIARY; COMPUTERS: THE FIRM SAYS ITS 
SILICON STUDIOS WILL FOCUS ON ENTERTAINMENT APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Silicon Graphics Inc., whose computer technology drives the digital special 
effects in "Forrest Gump," "True Lies" and nearly every other big summer movie, 
said Thursday that it is launching a subsidiary focusing on the entertainment 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 SGI Chairman Edward McCracken said the new division, Silicon Studios, is 
expected to double the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm's entertainment 
industry revenue to $400 million over the next year. The unit will sell 
computer equipment for creating movie special effects, sophisticated video 
games and high-tech theme park attractions. The move marks the first time a 
computer company has established a subsidiary specifically to target the 
entertainment business, where the production of film, TV, books and games is 
becoming increasingly computerized. 
</P>
<P>
 It also signals a shift for SGI, whose business has traditionally been rooted 
in military and industrial applications. As interactive television takes off 
over the next decade, SGI -- which Thursday reported record earnings of $141 
million on revenue of $1.5 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30 -- expects 
the entertainment market to grow to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, we did most of our high-end graphics work for the military 
simulation market, training pilots how to fly, and then used the same 
technology in entertainment," McCracken said. "Now, working with Disney is even 
more demanding than most of the military applications we work on." 
</P>
<P>
 McCracken was referring to the new Aladdin ride at Epcot Center in Florida 
that SGI developed with Disney. SGI computers create a three-dimensional 
illusion that riders are flying through space on a magic carpet. Such "virtual 
reality" attractions are thought to represent a growing market in theme parks 
and high-tech arcades nationwide, and Silicon Studios hopes to cash in on the 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SGI already has alliances with Time Warner to create an interactive TV system 
in Orlando, Fla., and with Nintendo to build a next-generation video game 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Another mission for the new subsidiary is to find a mass market for SGI's 
notoriously expensive computer graphics workstations. As computer prices 
plummet and the performance of inexpensive workstations and PCs zooms, SGI is 
no longer able to charge a large premium and thus must make up in volume what 
it is losing in falling prices. There are more than 110 million personal 
computers in homes and offices worldwide, compared to a mere 123,000 SGI 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main competitor in the entertainment world is Apple Computer, whose 
Macintosh systems have been widely embraced by multimedia developers. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the San Jose consulting firm Dataquest late last year found that 
Macintoshes were preferred by 62% of multimedia developers. One reason is 
price. An average Indio -- SGI's least-expensive workstation -- costs about 
$15,000, nearly twice as much as a high-end Macintosh that can do the same 
work, albeit more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is to take our success at the high end of the product line and drive 
it down to low-end, low-cost delivery platforms as fast as possible," said Mike 
Ramsay, senior vice president of Silicon Graphics' visual systems division who 
will become the president of the new subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 SGI stock fell $1.125 to $22.50 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange 
because earnings, though strong, did not meet analysts' expectations.

EARNINGS; TIMES MIRROR NET DIPS 5%, BUT OPERATING INCOME RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Times Mirror Co. on Thursday reported a 5% decline in second-quarter profit 
but posted higher operating income from its publishing and information 
businesses, as cost-cutting programs improved profit margins and newspaper 
earnings soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based media company, which publishes the Los Angeles Times and 
other newspapers, posted net income of $45.4 million, or 35 cents a share, for 
the three months ended June 26. That compares to $47.9 million, or 37 cents a 
share, in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly figures include financial results from what the company is 
reporting as discontinued operations. Those operations include the company's 
cable television systems, which will be merged with those of Cox Cable 
Communications under an agreement announced in June, and its broadcast 
television segment, which was sold last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly operating profit from Times Mirror's continuing operations, which 
include newspapers as well as book and magazine publishing, climbed to $32.1 
million from $20.4 million during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our financial performance in the second quarter showed continued upward 
momentum in newspaper publishing, with revenue growth and margin expansion 
through continued cost containment," Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror's chairman, 
chief executive and president, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, Times Mirror shares rose 75 cents 
to close at $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's operating units reported mixed second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers, which include The Times, the Baltimore Sun and Newsday, saw 
operating profit jump 30.5% to $52.9 million, from $40.5 million in the 
year-ago quarter. At the Los Angeles Times, quarterly ad revenue rose about 4% 
to $198.5 million, from $190.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional information, which consists of professional book publishing and 
training operations, posted an operating profit of $30.1 million, a 23.4% 
decline from $39.3 million in the year-ago period. The company blamed much of 
the decline on price reductions at its Matthew Bender publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer multimedia, which includes magazine and consumer book publishing 
companies as well as new consumer multimedia software and television 
programming ventures, cut quarterly losses to $1.3 million from $2.3 million. 
The improved performance of magazine publishing offset start-up costs in new 
multimedia products, the company said.

 Amoco to Trim Staff by 4,500: The Chicago-based oil company is restructuring 
to pare its bureaucracy. The reduction of nearly 10% of its work force will 
make Amoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest oil company, a leaner competitor 
in an era of stable oil prices and computer-driven cost efficiency, Chairman H. 
Laurance Fuller said. Amoco said it will eliminate 3,800 jobs in the next 12 
months and another 700 by the end of 1996 through early retirement, attrition 
and layoffs.

 American Home Products to Cut 2,000 Jobs: The Madison, N.J., company said the 
restructuring will take place in its U.S. pharmaceutical and consumer health 
care business this year and next, with most cuts coming when its Hammonton, 
N.J., facility is closed.Further cuts will be made based on the results of an 
organizational study of its U.S. pharmaceutical division, the company said. The 
company took a second-quarter charge of $174 million for the restructuring but 
said earnings rose to $300 million, or 98 cents a share, from $287.5 million, 
or 93 cents a share, for the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose to $1.97 billion 
from $1.9 billion.

 Navy Hires D.C. Law Firm in A-12 Dispute: The service has awarded a 
$7.8-million contract to Arnold & Porter, a large Washington law firm, for 
legal work in the A-12 attack-jet lawsuit filed against the government by 
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics.The contract indicates that the Navy is 
getting ready to capitulate in the legal fight but must first obtain a second 
opinion before going to Congress with a settlement, which could be as much as 
$3.5 billion. Attorneys at the firm did not return calls. By some estimates, 
the defense companies and the government are collectively spending $80 million 
annually litigating the charge that the Navy improperly canceled the firms' 
A-12 contract.

 U.S. Checking MTV Competition Plan: The Justice Department's antitrust 
division has begun an inquiry into the plan of five powerful record companies 
to form a channel to compete with MTV. The music divisions of Time Warner Inc., 
Sony Corp., Thorn EMI, PolyGram Holdings NV and Bertelsmann Music Group -- 
which together control about 80% of the worldwide trade in recorded music -- 
plan to challenge MTV with their own 24-hour channel by the end of the year. 
That project has raised concerns at the Justice Department about whether MTV or 
other companies could be deprived of videos they need.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; NO EASY FIX FOR AUTO BODY REPAIR 
FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fraud is rampant in the auto body repair industry. Relying on its own 
investigations and those of insurers, the Bureau of Automotive Repair said last 
week that body shops cheat on about 30% of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked members of the state's Auto Body Repair Advisory Committee, a 
12-member panel that assists the bureau, why fraud is so widespread. We got 
plenty of answers. 
</P>
<P>
 One law enforcement representative said insurance companies should take more 
responsibility. Insurance company representatives said regulators are 
indifferent. Collision technicians said a poor economy is tempting shop owners 
and consumers to fudge their invoices. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all right -- an indication of how complicated the problem is. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Ruth Kwan, a committee member, said insurers too 
often don't reinspect autos to make sure the repairs are proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies pay these claims based on estimates," she said. "Very few 
go out and double-check the work when it is done to see, yes, indeed, it was 
done per contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers acknowledge that they do few reinspections. At State Farm, the 
state's largest auto insurer, auditors in the Central California region -- 
which includes most of Los Angeles County -- reinspect 1% of completed repairs. 
Auditors review paperwork before choosing which cars to reinspect, and they 
uncover evidence of fraud in 70% of reinspections, said Stephen Booth, property 
claims superintendent.  
</P>
<P>
 Peter Bezeck, an Allstate claims manager and advisory committee member, said 
that although fraud is widespread, reinspecting large numbers of cars is not 
cost-effective for insurance companies. "The number of people it would take to 
do that, you just couldn't do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "we're not in the business of enforcing laws." Bezeck 
complained that until recently, the Bureau of Automotive Repair seemed 
unconcerned -- it refused to accept tips about cheating from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's true, a bureau representative said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude was: They're big corporations and we're a consumer protection 
agency. We don't take complaints from big companies and do their dirty work for 
them," said Dan Povey, the bureau's liaison to auto insurers. But "we've 
changed," he added. "Fraud raises premiums . . . and we realized insurance 
companies have as much if not more information about the shops than we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Povey said that in the 12 months ended June 30, the bureau took disciplinary 
action against 29 auto body shops, compared to five for the previous fiscal 
year. Many of those investigations were prompted by insurance companies. The 
bureau is making auto body repair fraud a priority, Povey said. Still, 
regulators lack the staff to investigate many cases, so there's plenty of 
opportunity for cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 What about motive? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County shop owner Rick Reiss, a committee member, said repair 
technicians are having a rough time financially because, in a slow economy, 
fewer cars get fixed. Desperation can push some technicians to, for instance, 
bang out a dented side panel but bill an insurance company for a new part. 
</P>
<P>
 Another committee member, San Bernardino shop owner Darrell Malott, said fraud 
also occurs when policyholders ask technicians to overstate repair costs in 
order to cover deductibles so the policyholders won't have to pay them. Some 
technicians do it, he said, because they are afraid of losing the work: "It's 
pretty hard to turn down a $5,000 job for a $100 deductible." 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? The committee has called for legislation that would establish 
licensing and training standards for technicians as a first step toward solving 
the problem. It is far from certain that the Legislature would approve such a 
measure, however, since it would call for additional spending for 
administration at a time when lawmakers are under pressure to reduce state 
spending.

 Running rings around the competition: An analysis of California arbitration 
filings released Thursday says General Motors' Saturn unit appears to have the 
best record in resolving disputes over defects or repairs under warranty with 
new car owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, done by two consumer organizations, looked at the number of 
arbitration filings as a percentage of new car purchases in California last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of Saturn owners seeking arbitration was about 0.04%. The 
highest percentage, nearly 3%, belonged to Volkswagen owners.  
</P>
<P>
 Motor Voters and the California Public Interest Research Group, which released 
the survey, said the results indicate that Saturn is best at resolving disputes 
before they escalate into arbitration cases. Arbitration programs are monitored 
by the state Department of Consumer Affairs and are intended to resolve 
disputes without the expense of a lawsuit.

YOUR MONEY: MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO; FOGGY VISION MAY DISTORT VALUES IN STOCK 
MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's corporate executives evidently see incredible value in stock 
prices at current levels, because they're buying like crazy. But some Wall 
Streeters worry that this corporate group-think about stocks constitutes a 
delusion of dangerously grand proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Put it this way: If we're in the early stages of a bear market, the same 
executives who think stocks are cheap now will be stunned to realize later that 
they overpaid. So, too, will their shareholders be stunned -- and it's their 
money, mostly, that the executives are using to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Three trends show how undervalued Corporate America believes the stock market 
is today: 
</P>
<P>
 * Not only are takeovers booming again, but they're mostly being funded with 
cash -- a sign that the corporate buyers believe their own shares aren't being 
valued highly enough by Wall Street to justify using them as "currency." 
</P>
<P>
 Deals tracker Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J., says $64 billion in 
all-cash takeovers were announced between Jan. 1 and July 14. In contrast, 
takeovers funded mostly through exchanges of stock totaled $33 billion in that 
period. Compared to the same period of 1993, announced all-cash deals are up 
64% this year, while announced stock swaps are up just 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Companies are authorizing buybacks of their own shares at a pace not seen in 
five years, Securities Data says. So far this year, 479 companies have 
announced plans to buy back up to $29.5 billion worth of their stock on the 
open market. That's an annualized pace of $53.3 billion, which would make 1994 
the biggest buyback year since $61.9 billion worth were announced in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement of a buyback, of course, doesn't necessarily mean a company 
will follow through; in any case, buybacks usually are executed over long 
periods, not all at once. Still, the message of a buyback declaration is that 
management believes its own shares may be the best investment the company can 
make with its cash -- over and above other potential uses, such as plant 
expansion or product development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Open-market stock purchases by corporate insiders -- of their own companies' 
shares -- have recently been running at the highest level in two years, says 
the Insiders newsletter of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy insider buying at the same share prices the public would pay (versus 
below-market-price options buying) is considered a sure sign that execs believe 
their stocks are dirt cheap. And in theory, they should know best how to value 
their own shares, because they should know their companies' earnings prospects 
better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe. But some experts caution that just because Corporate America sees 
value all over Wall Street doesn't necessarily mean it's so. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some analysts believe bruised egos loom large in this equation. After 
three years of steadily rising stock prices, this year's "correction" in the 
market has been greeted with as much disbelief by executives as by novice 
investors. Business is good, and corporate earnings are the best since the late 
1980s for many firms. So why should stocks be going down? Just because of an 
arguably minor rise in interest rates? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every executive scratches himself and thinks, 'My stock is cheap,' " 
says David Shulman, strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Shulman notes that after a long bull market in any given asset, there is 
always widespread disbelief when prices begin to decline. Think of commercial 
real estate in the late 1980s, just before that market crashed, he says. 
"Everybody thought their buildings were worth so much" -- and certainly no 
less, if not necessarily more. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Hensel, strategist at Lehman Bros. in New York, notes that 
executives' insistence that their stocks are cheap flies in the face of a 
powerful indicator of stock value: the so-called Q-ratio, which is companies' 
gross market value divided by the estimated replacement cost of their assets. 
When that ratio is over 1.0, Hensel notes, the smart decision generally is to 
build assets, not buy them on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The current market Q-ratio is 1.2, Hensel says -- the highest since 1968. 
Caveat emptor? Buyback Mania 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate stock buyback announcements have surged this year, and the dollar 
value of announced buybacks us the highest since 1989, if the year-to-date pace 
is annualized. Full-year and 1994 annualized figures, in billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 (Year-to-date pace, annualized): $53.3

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SONY'S SUMMER PLANS: TRIM SOME FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the heat of summer, Sony Pictures Entertainment is getting ready to shed a 
few layers of fat. The company is investigating ways to consolidate some 
operations to cut costs and increase efficiency, sources confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's video and international divisions are among the targets of the 
downsizing move, but the broader goal is to eliminate duplication throughout 
the company. Sources say the consolidation could eventually reach as high as 
the marketing and distribution divisions at its two studios, Columbia Pictures 
and TriStar Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sony has come under criticism recently for its slim movie output and 
slacking financial performance, people close to the company say the upcoming 
moves do not represent a retrenchment of any kind.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's good business to do things like this," said one executive who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "We're minding the store, but we won't change the 
fundamental way we do things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of possible changes at Sony's Culver City lot have circulated for 
weeks, largely based on reports of a cost-cutting mandate from Sony Pictures 
Chairman Peter Guber. Guber and Sony President Alan J. Levine, who's looking 
into the cuts, declined to comment. But sources stressed that there is no plan 
to merge Columbia and TriStar or to sell TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures has been publicly seeking a 25% investor for several months, 
with no takers. Asked about a merger of the studios, which are already under a 
single management team, one executive said: "That's not even being considered. 
We still feel they are more valuable to the company separately. Nor is there a 
'For Sale' sign on any of these assets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Downsizing" has emerged as the corporate mantra of the '90s, so Sony's moves 
are not unique. But the mere suggestion of upheaval has still managed to rattle 
some employees. One executive on the Sony lot said many people fear that a 
sweeping overhaul will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's way too much paralysis, fear and inertia for this to only be about 
small changes," one complained. "And all of the buzz is coming from the 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the company is focusing for now on offices scattered around the 
globe where two or three people are doing similar jobs. For instance, Columbia, 
TriStar and their sister company, Triumph Releasing, have overlapping 
executives in several areas. Said one executive: "The idea is to cut down on 
duplication and get better up to speed in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources added that Sony's plans could take up to a year to unfold. The company 
has already started consolidating some less visible operations, such as the 
physical distribution facilities for Columbia and TriStar. The two studios have 
also been put under a single management team of Motion Picture Chairman Mark 
Canton and President Fred Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 That's intensified speculation that more downsizing will follow. In 
particular, company sources say, TriStar marketing chiefs Buffy Shutt and Kathy 
Jones could be handed more authority. But another studio source denied Thursday 
that there will be any broad consolidation of domestic marketing and 
distribution, which each studio handles independently. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is finally in really sharp shape," the source said. "There could 
always be a redesign over time, but only because it makes sense within the 
existing structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sony is nothing if not flexible. Even with recent efforts to project an 
image of stability, sources within the company concede that it is in continuing 
exit discussions with Amy Pascal, an executive vice president of production at 
Columbia, who is interested in a top job at Turner Pictures. Sony formally 
declined to comment, but sources say Pascal may still be released. Said one: 
"Amy's still under contract. But her options are being explored." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unburying treasure: Speaking of options, sources say Columbia is anxious to 
move full steam ahead with its pirate movie, "Mistress of the Seas," now that 
"Cutthroat Island" has hit stormy waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistress" has been in dry dock for months, getting script revisions. But with 
reported delays in "Cutthroat," Carolco Pictures' female pirate epic, sources 
say Columbia is "very bullish about moving forward." Jon Peters, who developed 
"Mistress" for the studio before taking his production company to Warner Bros., 
is also said to be pushing to get the project launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistress" was originally set to star Geena Davis, who, ironically, jumped 
ship to "Cutthroat Island." Since then "Cutthroat" has run into problems of its 
own. Michael Douglas recently pulled out of the co-starring role, and Keanu 
Reeves ("Speed") and Liam Neeson ("Schindler's List") have reportedly turned 
down offers to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia has some problems of its own, however. Sources say that, while the 
script is essentially ready, the studio still hasn't found the right actress or 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 At Carolco, meanwhile, sources are denying speculation that delays in 
"Cutthroat" could help sink the troubled independent production company. A 
Carolco spokesman said Thursday: "It is likely, though not certain, that there 
will be a new actor (hired for 'Cutthroat') by the middle of next week. Nothing 
has slowed down in terms of the pre-production, and Carolco considers it 
extremely likely we will make this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives who do business with Carolco generally agreed that the 
company should survive its latest setback, though they said it's imperative 
that Carolco get something into production soon. The company lost a movie in 
May, when "Crusade," which was set to star Arnold Schwarzenegger, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one deal maker: "Nothing in the Carolco business plan necessitates 
(movies) being made at all costs. But obviously, they have to get something in 
the works, but there a lot of things they could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco's development projects include "Spiderman" and "Showgirls," though 
sources said neither is even close to ready.

THE SCENE: SINGING PRAISE OF SOCIAL HOUR; KARAOKE CAFES IN GARDEN GROVE, 
WESTMINSTER SERVE AS COMMUNAL HANGOUTS FOR VIETNAMESE TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santiago High freshman Tracy Tran clenches the microphone with her right hand 
and stares intently at the small television monitor a few feet above. 
</P>
<P>
 A video is playing out the Good Life, Miami style: a limousine drives past 
white high-rises, a cigarette-smoking executive in a glitzy club looks 
despondent, his stylish lady friend stands behind him at the bar. The couple's 
pantomime hails out of a B-movie with all the forced expression of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a graceful yet tentative voice, Tracy sings the lyrics at the bottom of the 
screen. Her friends sit silently and listen, as do most of the teens hanging 
out this evening at Che Men, located in a mini-mall across from Bolsa High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Che Men, like about a dozen karaoke cafes in Westminster and nearby Garden 
Grove, caters to patrons too young for bars and nightclubs, but who still 
hanker for grown-up style entertainment. The only "cocktails" here, however, 
are sweet, nonalcoholic fruit shakes and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 High-schoolers pile in about 9 or 10 p.m. every Friday and Saturday evening, 
recognizable by their oversize jeans and other hip-hop gear. Beepers, in every 
color but black, are standard accessories. By contrast, the earlier, 
college-aged crowd dresses more conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
 These younger patrons also turn the place into more of a communal scene. They 
bring the tiny tables together, forming banquet-style seating, and raise the 
noise level significantly between songs by chatting and laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Older customers leave earlier, Che Men owner Chan Dang notes, because they 
have to get up the next day for work. Then the high-schoolers invade the place 
and hang out until 1 a.m., when the cafe closes and their curfew is up.  
</P>
<P>
 My reporter-friend, Thuan Le, whom I dragged along to help with interpreting, 
whispers her surprise over Tracy's song selection. It's a traditional number 
about missing the homeland called "Xin Goi Nhau La Co Nhan" ("Let's Call Each 
Other"). 
</P>
<P>
 Thuan says it's curious that a 14-year-old, especially one who's been living 
in California most of her life, would choose this golden oldie. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy later says she knows the piece from her brother's home karaoke machine. 
But much of the song's significance is lost on the teen, who can read 
Vietnamese, but doesn't understand the meaning of all the words. 
</P>
<P>
 That's better than her pals Duong Dang, 16, and Katie Tran, 17. Both can speak 
their native language "pretty good." But don't ask them to tell you what's 
flashing on the screen. They read only English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer to sing 'American' songs," says Katie, a senior at La Quinta High 
School, who frequents a cafe almost every weekend. Perusing the booklet of more 
than 1,000 songs available, I can only make out about two dozen in English. 
</P>
<P>
 This might explain why the photographer and I are the only ones here who are 
not Vietnamese. Katie and others say they have encouraged their non-Vietnamese 
friends to join them, "but they're not interested in coming. They probably just 
feel weird coming to a Vietnamese place." 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad, she adds, because kids of any ethnicity could enjoy the ambience 
of a karaoke cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great place to kick back and eat and listen to music," says Duong, a 
Saddleback High sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the selections sung this evening, it seems that most every song in 
Vietnamese is a love ballad, except, of course, for the occasional patriotic 
number. Thuan confirms this. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie and her friends say they wish karaoke cafes would offer snappier tunes, 
in Vietnamese or English.  
</P>
<P>
 At least some of the English selections have an upbeat tempo. But when it 
comes to choosing between "Like a Virgin" or "Hopelessly Devoted to You" from 
the Grease soundtrack, Madonna loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's just tough to get into the pop diva mood sitting down. Karaoke in 
Vietnamese establishments is an armchair experience, unlike in other bars, 
where aspiring song birds get up in front of everyone and perform. No offspring 
of Ethel Merman here. "Vietnamese people are too shy to get up in front of 
everyone," Thuan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that sounds like a cultural generalization, at times it's tough to 
tell who's got the microphone, because some patrons hold it so low and close to 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the presentation of lyrics is different. Asian-language karaoke usually 
comes with videos, but not in MTV style. "Some of them look real nice," says 
Tracy, "but a lot of them look kind of funny. They make us laugh. The people in 
them don't look natural at all." 
</P>
<P>
 These teens are certainly bolder than yours truly. Here they are, revealing 
their talent -- or lack of it -- by just signing up for a song. Katie usually 
applies for two or three chances through the night. "You can't be embarrassed," 
she says. "Everybody has to sing. Just like no one can make you sing and no one 
can stop you." 
</P>
<P>
 As for those crooning in a key other than the music, Katie says it's a matter 
of silent knowledge. "It's terrible when someone can't sing. We know they're 
awful, but we never say anything. That's rude." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Che Men owner Dang seats his customers quickly as they walk into the small 
cafe. A pot of tea and cups are delivered as speedily. Their desserts soon 
follow.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirtyish Dang is considered tops among his young clientele. Like other cafe 
owners and their employees, Dang and his adult staff serve as chaperons -- but 
cool enough to let everyone feel at ease. They treat the crowd with a respect 
usually reserved for their parents. In turn, this rather hip group of teens 
responds with a maturity most adults would be surprised to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened this (cafe) because there are no nightclubs for younger people," 
says Dang. "Teen-agers like to go out, too, just like everyone else."

THE REAL 'WEST SIDE STORY'; RACIAL STRIFE AND MURDERS IN VENICE MAKE HEADLINES. 
BUT BENEATH THE SURFACE STUDIES OF GANGS AND DRUGS, CROSS-CULTURAL ALLIANCES 
BLOOM THERE--AND EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kochitlmilco Santos stops mid-step. She squats to scoop up yellowed newspaper 
wedged into the mesh of a chain-link fence on the Venice leg of Rose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the problem," she says, her long black hair slicing the wind like an 
angry whip. She points to a photo of two bloody victims of the June 10 shooting 
outside Venice High School -- a retaliation widely attributed to the mercurial 
nature of local black and Latino gang violence. The killings pushed the number 
of violent deaths in Venice this year to 17. And although Santos' voice is 
soft, there is fury in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the rumors. The photos, the headlines, the television. The problem is 
that all that harsh light removes the shadows, the shades of gray. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it, Santos says, just makes building cultural and racial bridges that 
much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever a shot goes up in the middle of the night, it is that shot -- and 
what lies in its wake -- that arrests full media attention. Not the strides 
that Santos, or any number of community organizers, teachers, parents or 
students have diligently taken for years to keep tempers calm and build 
coalitions across racial and ethnic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In this complicated community, beneath the media's quick-gloss surface studies 
of gangs and drugs and angry battles between blacks and browns, cross-cultural 
alliances bloom -- even flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these much more remarkable tales, despite their against-many-odds 
successes, too often go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not happen on the first try, maybe not even the second, but in Venice 
-- and all over the city -- Angelenos are working to nurture understanding, 
hope and a sense of common ground. And many, even to their own surprise, are 
quietly succeeding.  
</P>
<P>
 The violence and the tension erupting in this community, and others like it 
across the Southland, have tangled roots beyond a neat "West Side Story" 
premise of hate based on the difference of skin color.  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly some of the conflict is based on difference, admits Santos, who has 
lived in Venice for 12 years and in troubled Oakwood for 2 1/2. But there is so 
much more that tips the very sensitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice isn't the only corner of the city at a difficult-to-read signpost at 
the crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 As demographics dramatically shift, the largely black and Latino enclaves such 
as Watts, Compton, and Venice's Oakwood neighborhood have taken turns finding 
themselves in an undesirable spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 From "mysterious" instances of arson to drive-by shootings clipping innocent 
bystanders, residents ponder a chilling string of fatalities and ultimately 
even a longer string of questions about that community's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad brush paints interracial tensions as the sole reason for the unrest 
and the ultimate decline of a once unified, well-tended neighborhood. But many 
who view it from the inside believe that said race tensions are not as heated 
as what plays out on the rumor circuit or over the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftentimes, they say, typical -- and not-so-typical -- neighborhood disputes 
are unfairly tagged as racially motivated, while gang activities are folded 
into the larger realm of racial disharmony statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sidelines, however, several grass-roots community organizers, like 
Santos, attempt to elucidate the deep-seated problems. Problems that have 
sapped their neighborhoods' resources and strengths for some time -- lack of 
jobs, substandard housing, limited access to education, absent youth programs 
-- the dilemmas, they say, that breed competition, ignite the tensions and 
sometimes kindle the hatred into violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all the "negative stuff" says Venice-based community organizer Melvyn 
Hayward Sr., there have been opportunities to do miracle work. Even without an 
organization, Hayward, who is African American, was able to do everything from 
scaring up odd jobs and providing social service relief, to involving black and 
Latino youths swept up in gangs in video projects that -- in 1978 at least -- 
helped calm the tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, Santos stresses, "do not hate the blacks and the blacks do not hate 
the browns." Santos, who, like Hayward, isn't tied to any one community 
organization, sees her role as more of a minister of information, stressing 
education and opening communication channels along racial as well as 
generational lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, multiethnic organizations such as the MultiCultural Collaborative, 
Watts Community Bridges Project, and the Venice-based Oakwood United work to 
demolish walls by dismantling the stereotypes many have grown up with. 
</P>
<P>
 The chasm narrowed, this environment provides a space where two sides can 
speak out loud, face to face, rather than in whispers behind closed doors. It 
is within this context that many African Americans and Latinos discover that 
their struggles have historically been quite similar, that there are more 
commonalities than differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, they hope to communicate that with unity comes strength and with 
strength comes change. 
</P>
<P>
 The hurdles of one are those of all. And Santos gives voice to a universal 
community vexation: "One of the problems we have here in Oakwood is longtime 
residents have a small-town mentality. They have this attitude about outsiders. 
. . . There's no such thing as an outsider when you have the same things in 
common -- poverty, hunger and no jobs and children committing self-destruction. 
You're not an outsider if you share the same problems. . . . You can't work 
that way." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Arturo Ybarra watches with a smile as little Latinas in frothy dresses are 
escorted by young black men in baggy shorts, long white tube socks and backward 
baseball caps through the noisy cobblestone plaza at Olvera Street. It's a 
scene that prompts more than stares from those in passing, but also bewildered 
smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra, who heads the Watts Community Bridges Project, a component of the 
Watts/Century Latino Organization, recently loaded a group of 80 black and 
Latino students, parents and ex-gang members onto a bus, then shepherded them 
on a citywide tour that began at the California Afro-American Museum and ended 
up amid the strolling mariachis and kiosks outfitted with Mexican flags on 
Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Fred Williams, founder of the Watts-based organization Common 
Ground, Ybarra hopes to uncover lost histories of the black and Latino 
pobladores who settled the pueblo now called Los Angeles, and to remind that 
these roots have been long intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 This joining of forces should be looked at as a model, Ybarra hopes, not as a 
dusty anomaly. Envisioned initially as a group to organize around a 
redevelopment project, Watts/Century's focus shifted early. The issues were 
much larger than just those of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came alive as an organization in 1989, we saw a lot of tensions among 
Latinos and African Americans," Ybarra says. "So instead of fighting against 
African-American residents, our neighbors, we decided to call them into 
partnership to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual joint Latino/African American Cinco de Mayo parade as its 
celebratory centerpiece, at present the priority rests in neutralizing campus 
tensions between blacks and Latinos at neighborhood junior high schools. The 
ultimate hope, however, is that these gains will trickle down to communication 
within the home. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, black and brown, negative perceptions about "the Other" stem 
primarily from lack of exposure, Ybarra has noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much ignorance among our Latino and African American parents that 
sometimes probably without thinking over the consequences they might use a 
racial slur with their children. And the children have fresh minds, they don't 
forget, and sometimes they use it. And this can create tensions, problems, 
misunderstandings and incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra is careful not to make the offerings too complex or overwhelming. Field 
trips like the Afro-American Museum/Olvera Street excursion provide a firsthand 
look at cultural contributions, while conflict-resolution and mediation 
workshops, Ybarra suggests, will give parents tools to deal with cross-cultural 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The tougher challenge is to dismantle the negative images that have already 
firmly taken hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the average citizen doesn't have enough education, or doesn't 
have enough time to get real information," Ybarra says. "It (gets) to a point 
in which they accept any information given by the news media as the only means 
for them to educate themselves, which is a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing close quarters amid rapid change, the tensions are inevitable, says 
Williams, who founded the Common Ground drop-out retrieval program in 1985. 
"These are natural tensions. The tensions of unemployment that affect all of 
us. . . . They aren't as lingering as people make them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sugarcoat anything, but we live together pretty well every 
day," he assures. "The Venice . . . stuff gets blown up and then other issues 
arise out of that, but all in all we get along pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' group shifted gears to act as a buffer between two communities after 
a race-based incident shook apart Jordan Downs housing project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years back, a Hispanic family was burned out. A council was formed by 
some of the residents but failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, Williams recalls, "a lot of Hispanic families were being 
robbed and killed. We decided to step in simply because it was turning out to 
be a high-profile struggle between black and Hispanics. So, we started bridging 
a relationship with these families that were being assaulted." 
</P>
<P>
 A faulty-rumor cycle was to blame for the drama, Williams learned in a 
communitywide closed-to-media meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors had Hispanic families believing that black gangs were stealing 
their car batteries in the middle of the night. "Those weren't gang members," 
Williams says they learned. "Those were crack heads." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "The (Latino) families complained about rocks being thrown through 
windows -- those were just the kids in the neighborhood -- black and brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were very important pieces, Williams recalls: "Somebody had created this 
deep division and fear that was stalling the exchange process." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robert Almanzan of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
believes that one of the biggest barriers in the struggle toward access is 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times it is solely the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a Latino community group in Compton, Almanzan has learned that 
from schools to employment services, getting one's concerns heard is more 
difficult if those concerns are voiced in Spanish. The language barrier creates 
another level of community tension, especially if the service providers are 
African American. It becomes yet another skirmish for power. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to fuel or direct a small organization like the one Almanzan is 
guiding is the goal of the L.A.-based MultiCultural Collaborative. Founded last 
November, and with a staff in place since April, the MCC works to remove some 
of the guesswork and build coalitions between fledgling organizations with more 
established institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was the feeling," MCC co-director Ruben Lizardo recalls, "that there 
wasn't a resource to help people to understand the problems in this deeper 
strategic way." 
</P>
<P>
 As MCC research found, "Most of those groups tend not to be served as well (as 
whites) by the major institutions in the city, and so you have a situation that 
could be either inter-ethnic competition or conflict . . . based upon the fact 
some of these communities are in such desperate economic straits." 
</P>
<P>
 All of these things, Lizardo says, are exacerbated in communities of color. 
"Some of the inner-ethnic violence . . . is maybe less a function of people's 
dislike or antagonism for each other (than about) not having avenues to begin 
to actually tackle the underlying social and economic problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking strong leadership, Lizardo says, these issues have been left to 
fester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you begin to have a lot of scapegoating and a lot of (people) 
essentially turning on each other, fighting with each other for the crumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 At this early stage, MCC is focusing on three major institutional areas: 
economic development, education and media. In time it hopes to act as a 
multiethnic resource, legal advocacy service and support community organizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell," Lizardo says, "the strategy is for resolving racial conflict 
in L.A., is that you can't really improve human relations without improving 
social conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Many organizers have found an understandable hesitancy to work collectively, 
"and we think that that is natural," Lizardo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is an unfair expectation put on us by mainstream community folks 
that somehow we're supposed to be able to work together -- all of the time. And 
if we don't, we're somehow separatists or we are trying to Balkanize the city, 
when the city's (already) Balkanized based on racial segregation and housing 
and economic development practices." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of it all is fear, desperation, as people grab for crumbs. And 
what has exploded in Venice is not very different than what simmers in Watts or 
Compton or what recently blew in full force in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern for the kids," says Lindsey Haley, program manager for the 
Venice-based Social and Public Art Resource Center's (SPARC) Neighborhood Pride 
mural program, "but not too many people can agree on how to get from point A to 
point B. There's trouble deciding how to do it. Not just in Venice, but in 
other communities as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Haley, who grew up in Venice, is astonished by the dramatic violent turn, and 
sees yet another element trumping up the tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I'd admired about Venice was its eccentric nature . . . but 
now with wealth coming into the community you have these mansion-ettes and 
tall, gated walls and you feel like you're being pushed out. . . . And I think 
that both groups (black and Latino) feel that. We're living in a real different 
environment . . . it's becoming increasingly harder to live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Baca, the founder and artistic director of SPARC, says she hasn't seen it 
worse. "We're right at the heart of this battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Baca, a Latina who was born in Watts 58 years ago, says she's always lived in 
relationship to African Americans and their culture. That relationship has 
informed the philosophy behind SPARC, and she looks at the institution as a 
creative way to work across racial lines through arts, support groups, weekly 
community empowering sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to provide a diversion as well as a more textured context, Baca 
dreamed up an extensive mural project she dubbed the Neighborhood Pride 
Program. The project's centerpiece, the "Great Wall" an inter-ethnic, 
inter-cultural tableau, details the biographies or histories of various racial 
ethnic communities within the context of the city and its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened now with the absence of leadership and development, the 
youth have found leadership other places . . . from those in gangs, or those in 
the prisons . . . who send their mandates down to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 From the home to the schools to City Hall and beyond, Baca says, "It begins 
with leadership, failure to communicate in substantive ways, the battle for 
scarce resources. The African-American community feels as if they are losing 
ground because of the growing presence of Latinos, and the Latinos feel that 
the City Council (does not represent) the community it serves." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although progress might be slow and not readily noticeable, Pastor Marvis L. 
Davis Jr. believes relations between blacks and Latinos have improved in his 
Venice neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're neighbors. We go to the same markets, the same churches, community 
meetings," says Davis, founder of Oakwood United. "It's not hard to get a 
friendly 'Hi' and 'Hello' from people in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But after random violence made even Bible study too risky some evenings, "We 
decided that it was time for us to do something ourselves. We must start on a 
grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting once a month since February of last year, Oakwood United draws its 
membership from a mix of various service providers, churches, law enforcement 
and city, county, state and federal agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 Its larger plan is to try to make everyone more responsible in their reporting 
of internal skirmishes turned violent -- from neighborhood scuttlebutt to 
police reports to media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's hurting the community," Davis says, "is if a black is shot it is 
assumed that it is done by a Latino, or vice versa. They retaliate based on 
what's read. . . . Everything is not gang-related." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Kochitlmilco Santos, the root of community unrest, persistently voiced yet 
seldom truly heard, "is lack of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no jobs here. There is nothing. They are trying to close the Teen 
Post. You know what they want to do with the library? They want to open a 
mini-mall. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There are great organizations here in Venice," she admits, "but they are not 
doing any good if they don't get together and work together. How the hell are 
we going to expect our kids to do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her hopes for a more unified future lie in illuminating community strengths, 
playing down divisions -- picking up the community threads and creating a vivid 
quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blacks and the browns are the largest group of minorities here," Santos 
says. "What if we got together and started helping each other out? What if we 
started sharing what we have? What if we started looking out for each other? 
You just think about it. . . . That's a lot of people to be united."

AROUND TOWN: LADIES AND GENTEEL-MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dance cards dangling from dainty wrists, the ladies flirted from behind their 
fans with gentlemen in spats, cravats and cutaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, every woman could be a demure romance novel heroine, every man a 
dashing swain. 
</P>
<P>
 They waltzed to "The Blue Danube" and bowed and curtsied through a quadrille. 
To "Yellow Rose of Texas," they rollicked through a Virginia Reel. 
</P>
<P>
 Come Monday, it would be back to the future. In their dress-for-success 
clothes, they'd return to their 9-to-5s. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was Saturday and the Social Daunce Irregulars, whose sole raison 
d'etre is to preserve the music, dance and customs of the Victorian Era, were 
having their thrice-yearly Grande Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, "The men treat the women with respect and the women treat the men with 
respect, which is something you don't get out on the street anymore," said Gail 
Selinger of Van Nuys, an office temp and regular Irregular. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompting the dances was silver-haired dance master Professor Desmond. Just 
Desmond. "It's like Mickey Mouse. You don't know what his last name is," 
Desmond said. The prof, who lives in a Civil War-era house in Golina, Ill., is 
a dance historian who taught a "terrified" Matthew Broderick to waltz in 
"Glory." 
</P>
<P>
 The man in the red tartan kilt was Jason Evans, 23, a Pasadena graduate 
student. The kilt, he explained, "was the rage of Great Britain" in the 
mid-1860s. "Queen Victoria loved her Highlands." His wasn't off the rack at 
Harrods. He made it and "there's not a machine stitch in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irregulars take their Victoriana seriously. As Carolyn Kinkead of 
Pasadena, an MTA marketing secretary, said: "You know you're in trouble when 
you look in your closet Monday morning and there are five ball gowns hanging 
there but you don't have anything to wear to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinkead wore her gold velvet and brocade copy of a design by Charles Worth, an 
Englishman who was the father of haute couture . Her escort, Fred Louaillier, 
was less authentic. His striped pants were the ones he'd worn to wed his 
ex-wife; his cravat hid the turned-under collar of his modern shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many are sticklers for authenticity, the Irregulars won't faint if 
you show up in a converted prom gown that zips rather than laces. "There's not 
an attitude," said Studio City psychologist Pat Roush. "If you don't know the 
steps, you can still stay on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 And, should a lady trod upon a gent's toe, Louaillier said, "By definition, 
it's his fault. This is the Victorian era -- but remember, it means she can't 
vote, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rebs and Yanks were among the revelers. The Philadelphia Quadrille Band 
(of L.A.) played "Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "Dixie." 
</P>
<P>
 "There go the candystripers," someone said wryly. This octet was hard to miss, 
the ladies in hoop-skirted awning-striped gowns -- a red, a yellow, a blue, a 
green -- the men in striped waistcoats. A bit of a "side show," acknowledged 
Kate Morgenstern(green stripes), an office manager from La Mirada. Morgenstern 
was corseted, but not boned: "That's like wearing armor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Herbeck of Hacienda Heights danced by, dashing in the blue and red of the 
Battalion of St. Patrick, a regiment of Irish who deserted the Army during the 
Mexican-American War and fought for Mexico "in exchange for 300 Mexican acres. 
We were mercenaries." A writer/producer, he's doing a film on the battalion. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife Ruth's lace bonnet labeled her as a married lady, circa 1840s. "Of 
course," Herbeck said, "she's about to become a widow because most of us who 
fought in St. Patrick's were hung." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena architect Jeffrey Bissiri, president of the Irregulars and one of its 
founding fathers six years ago, was a turn-of-the-century British infantry 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only exist to do this," he said. There are no regular meetings, thus the 
name. And daunce ? "That's just an affectation." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did 300 people, mostly youngish, turn out for this event at the Pasadena 
Masonic Hall? In this black-tie-optional world, Bissiri said, "We're afraid to 
say, 'You have to wear your tux, damn it.' People need that once in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one man was heard to say that the ball was "the most fun I've had 
dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Portly David Springhorn came as W.C. Fields. Actually, he is W.C. Fields -- at 
Universal Studios, where he goes about "insulting you and kicking children." 
</P>
<P>
 Springhorn -- seen waltzing with daughter Emily, 8, a vision in crinolines and 
Keds -- is a devoted Irregular. In the real world, he said, "People have sort 
of lost the capacity to be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said Professor Desmond, "Charming as all this stuff is, I think we all 
would have hated to have lived in those years." His high, stiff collar was 
killing him: "You can cut your throat if you take a quick look around." The 
Poet and Charmer of Hollenbeck Home 
</P>
<P>
 Cupping a hand to his ear, John Davis, poet laureate of Hollenbeck Home, 
leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word. 
</P>
<P>
 W.G. Heideman, executive director of the retirement home -- and himself a bit 
of a poet -- was lauding Davis as a writer whose poetry "flows over the paper 
like soft butter on warm toast." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Boyle Heights home had come to its library to honor Davis 
who, at 103, has become a published poet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your life!" said activity director Dennis Hiebert. Off came a drape 
veiling a permanent exhibit honoring Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, is that us? Wonderful!" said a stunned Davis. Stepping to the podium, he 
read, in a strong voice and without glasses, "The Romance of the Sun and Sea." 
</P>
<P>
 The poem, penned when he was 95, was a third-place winner in an international 
contest held by the Maryland-based National Library of Poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, That's amazing," said the library's Cynthia Stevens when told his age. 
His was among 3,000 entries chosen from 19,000 submitted for its new anthology, 
"Tears of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a former county roads department employee who never went to high 
school, is self-taught. He never sought to be published, until urged by 
Hiebert. 
</P>
<P>
 He no longer writes -- "I can't put my head together." But he wheels himself 
around the grounds, cheering on the shuffleboarders, chatting up the ladies. 
</P>
<P>
 As guests filed into a post-reading reception, the dapper Davis asked, "Are we 
going to another party?" 
</P>

 THE ROMANCE OF THE SUN AND SEA 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the sun caress the sea,  
</P>
<P>
 At twilight's trysting place,  
</P>
<P>
 And faithful as in ages past,  
</P>
<P>
 They met in Love's embrace.  
</P>
<P>
 Enwrapped within the ocean's arms,  
</P>
<P>
 The sun had found its rest,  
</P>
<P>
 And slept, with rosy-tinted smile,  
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the ocean's breast.  
</P>
<P>
 And while the sun slept through the night,  
</P>
<P>
 In dreams of yesterday,  
</P>
<P>
 The moon looked down with face aglow,  
</P>
<P>
 Where sunbeams used to play.  
</P>
<P>
 And far above the moon's fair face,  
</P>
<P>
 The stars their silence break,  
</P>
<P>
 To keep their vigil through the night,  
</P>
<P>
 Until the sun doth wake.  
</P>
<P>
 Now full of glory as before,  
</P>
<P>
 The sun shines from above,  
</P>
<P>
 And casts its smile upon the sea,  
</P>
<P>
 Where first they fell in love. -- JOHN DAVIS

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; DOUGH-GETTERS; AMBITIOUS STUDENTS AT KENNEDY 
HIGH DON'T JUST ASPIRE TO COLLEGE; THEY CASH IN ON THEIR DREAMS. MEMBERS OF THE 
CLASS OF '94 WERE OFFERED $2.5 MILLION IN FINANCIAL AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WU, William Wu is a member of the Class of 1994 at Kennedy High 
School in La Palma, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, 
the Shamrock. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bringing together deserving students and college scholarship money is not an 
automatic process. As Kennedy High School in La Palma learned this past year, a 
determined effort on the part of students, parents and school officials can 
dramatically increase the success of the matchmaking process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Class of 1994 at Kennedy received offers of $2.5 million in financial aid, 
a school record and a sevenfold increase over the previous year. The total 
includes multiple offers received by some students from different institutions. 
Aid varied from small grants to full-ride scholarships. For example, an 
appointment to West Point, secured by one student, is valued over four years at 
$220,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an exceptional senior class. I'm very proud of the many admissions 
to prestigious schools and the dozens of scholarships received by this 
deserving group," academic counselor April Pflug said.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those receiving major awards were standout athletes and top academic 
students, some getting the premier financial aid package: full-ride 
scholarships that cover all the costs of a college education, including room 
and board, tuition, meal passes, fees and books. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of the school principal, Pflug said she and the other 
academic counselor at the 1,700-student school decided early in the school year 
to help students realize college ambitions by encouraging them to seek 
financial aid.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we thought a student might be eligible for a certain scholarship, we 
encouraged that student to apply, apply, apply," Pflug said. Many scholarships 
go unclaimed, she said, because students think they won't qualify and don't 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Pflug says she wrote countless student recommendations and worked extensively 
with several students one-on-one to ensure they received the aid they deserved. 
And she kept the class up to date on new scholarship opportunities throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pflug also solicited student grants from businesses in La Palma and Cypress. 
The businesses responded, providing a new source of funds for many students who 
will attend community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents got in on the act by participating in the school's PLUS (Parents 
Learning University Strategies) program, which was started several years ago. 
The four-night course helps parents understand the college application and 
financial aid process. It's recommended that parents take the course when their 
children enter high school to help a college-bound student stay on track.

 Here's a look at some of Kennedy's scholarship recipients: 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Morris will attend Utah State on a full-ride football scholarship. At 
Utah, he will play cornerback and special teams. Morris was an all-league wide 
receiver on the league champion football team. He also lettered in basketball 
and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great to get a scholarship. Utah's pretty far, so it will be harder 
to adjust, but I know in the long run it will be for the best," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Martin will be swimming for UC Berkeley next year, also on a full-ride 
scholarship. Her list of accomplishments includes league records in the 50-yard 
and 500-yard freestyle. She was a competitor in the Senior Nationals Swimming 
Championships and was selected girls' academic athlete of the year at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought all my hard work and training would result in my attending 
such a high-ranked university," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members from the softball team captured full-ride scholarships: Laurie 
Fritz will attend UCLA, and Joy Hannifin is heading to the University of New 
Mexico. Both were previous all-league selections on Kennedy's powerhouse team, 
which has been ranked in the top three in the county for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to see that all of my hard work and dedication has paid off," 
Fritz said. Hannifin said she was glad her skills attracted attention. "When I 
made my decision about attending UNM, I felt relieved to know that I'm one step 
closer to my goals in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Several top academic students also garnered major awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Tsai and Lavonne Sheng each won USC Trustee Scholarships. Trustee 
scholarships, worth $70,000 over four years, are awarded to 100 incoming USC 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsai has a 1450 SAT score and a 4.44 GPA, but he said he thought his chances 
for an award were slim. "Getting the scholarship was surprising because the 
competition was incredibly stiff," Tsai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheng, who has a 1460 SAT score and a 4.48 GPA, recently appeared on the NBC 
morning talk show "Leeza" to speak about her accomplishment. "I'm very honored 
at having won a trustee scholarship, and I'm looking forward to attending USC 
in the fall," Sheng said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintak Joo received a $20,000 scholarship from Southern California Edison. His 
outstanding academic record (1540 SAT, 4.51 GPA) and service as president for 
two years of Kennedy's Future Business Leaders of America chapter elevated him 
to the top of the 1,100 candidates. He will attend Stanford University but was 
also offered admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great honor to be selected not only because it's worth so much, but 
because so many students were involved," Joo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence Montoya was offered five different school scholarships, including 
ones from Princeton and Stanford, but he decided on Yale. He received about 
$15,000 in grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Three aspiring pre-medicine students -- Jerome Espinoza, Milli Kim and Sanda 
Lee -- will receive $1,500-a-year scholarships from Los Alamitos Medical 
Center.

 Fingernails are important to teen-age girls, judging by how much nail polish 
they use.Simmons Market Research Bureau surveyed 3,000 teen-agers and found 
nail polish was their favorite cosmetic, with 71.6% of the young women saying 
they used it. Lipstick was a close second, used by 66.9%, followed by mascara 
at 59.9%, eye shadow at 54.5% and blush at 49.9%. The survey found working 
teens are more likely to use mascara, blush and foundation makeup than those 
who don't work.

 Getting your life under control just got easier. Voice Powered Technology in 
Canoga Park, the firm that introduced the VCR Voice programmer in 1992, has 
come out with Voice Organizer, a portable electronic personal organizer 
operated entirely by voice. No key pad. No writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Users can easily record and retrieve information by pushing the proper button 
and speaking into the pocket-sized unit. Up to 99 memos can be activated at any 
time, and up to 99 reminders individually recalled up to a year later. 
Appointments are automatically scheduled in chronological order by date, day, 
hour and minute. When it is time for a meeting you've programmed in, Voice 
Organizer will beep. It also functions as a calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 The device can also hold 400 phone numbers for up to 100 names. 
</P>
<P>
 The device can be programmed in any language and has a one-year warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Voice Organizer ($199.95) is designed to operate for 168 hours between 
rechargings, and has back-up power for memory of up to 336 hours. The compact 
unit comes with its own recharger. To order, call Voice Powered Technology at 
(800) 743-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 So Who Needs a Remote?: Casio's Wrist Controller watch line can do everything 
but turn on the oven. Its models CMD-10B and CMD-30B not only tell time and 
date, but operate a TV, VCR or cable box as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Either watch can be programmed for remote control access to turn the 
television on or off, select channels and control volume. In the VCR mode, it 
can turn the unit on or off and activate fast forward, rewind, play, stop and 
channel selection. With a cable box, it controls power and channel selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others in Casio's newest watch line, CMD-20B and CMD-40B, are capable of 
television or cable box remote control and also have 8-digit arithmetic 
functions. CMD-10B and CMD-30B cost $99.95 and $79.95, respectively; CMD-20B 
and CMD-40B, $99.95 and $129.95. They're available nationwide at Wal-Mart, 
Mervyn's, Kmart and Service Merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture Phones: The new Photo Phone makes it easy for seniors or youngsters to 
call for help -- or pizza -- with one touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the phone are six designated spaces for direct-access memory 
dialing. The phone comes with a set of 20 icons: a badge for police, a flame 
for fire department, 911 for emergency and, yes, a guy in a chef's hat holding 
a pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 To program in family members or neighbors pictorially, just substitute a 
snapshot in the designated space for one-touch memory dialing. 
</P>
<P>
 Photo Phone (under $40) is available in Los Angeles from BBC Electronics at 
(213) 622-9701. Or it may be ordered from its manufacturer, Starlight Randix 
Corp., 337 Turnpike Road, Southborough, Mass. 01772; (508) 460-1100. LYNN

 Pencil erasers are made from synthetic rubber and pumice, a volcanic glass, 
plus a soybean-based filler. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the rubber that erases errors, as is commonly thought, but pumice 
that actually scratches out mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pencil-makers also note that the "lead" in a pencil is not lead at all. It is 
a mixture of graphite and clay. As for why most pencils are yellow, no one 
seems to know.

 Wondering what financial aid opportunities are available? Your high school 
counselor or college center is one of the best, free sources. 
</P>
<P>
 A book might be of help to some."Fund Your Way Through College" (Visible Ink, 
$19.95) is a directory of 1,700 sources for undergraduate financial aid. From 
awards to scholarships, loans to internships, the 731-page book is a mammoth 
guide to help students find the "millions" of funding dollars the book says go 
unclaimed every year. 
</P>
<P>
 The compendium, compiled by Debra M. Kirby, is indexed to make searches quick 
and easy. Readers can look for money according to vocational path, geography, 
demographics and organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Each entry gives essential details such as selection criteria, funds 
available, deadlines and contacts to facilitate finding the funding resources.

L.A.'S QUAKE AID PLAN FOR FIRMS STALLS; ASSISTANCE TEAMS, HOT LINE EXPECTED BY 
SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after the Northridge quake hobbled hundreds of businesses, the city 
of Los Angeles has yet to deploy business assistance teams and begin a hot line 
for quake information, measures promised in a disaster recovery plan adopted 
five days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But advisers to Mayor Richard Riordan, who is also the head of the emergency 
operations panel that adopted the plan, say the city has taken steps to fulfill 
the promise by getting federal funding for the teams and the hot line. Both 
should be in place by September, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gearing up to hire eight to 10 staff people for two years to provide 
business and technical assistance to businesses affected by the earthquake," 
said Mary Leslie, deputy mayor for economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some City Hall officials and business owners say that will be too 
late and blame Riordan for allowing the initially strong momentum of the 
recovery effort to wane. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle said a September starting date for the assistance 
measures may be too late, noting that the deadline for businesses to submit 
Small Business Administration loan applications is Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all needs to move faster," he said. "It seems that a process that 
doesn't start until September is too late." 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical help the city can offer, Tuttle said, is to contact and 
provide help to those quake-damaged businesses that have not turned in loan 
applications or have been denied a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle has been doggedly pressing Riordan to take stronger action on the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 9 letter to the mayor, Tuttle stressed the need for the business 
assistance teams. And in a June 29 letter to Riordan and City Council President 
John Ferraro, he suggested they invite President Clinton, Gov. Pete Wilson and 
other top officials to a "summit meeting" in Los Angeles to discuss the next 
steps in the quake recovery process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles cannot afford to continue losing businesses, watch homes and 
multifamily housing units disappear and not see recovery from this natural 
disaster," Tuttle said in the June 29 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle and others say the need for assistance is apparent in the gap between 
the number of SBA loan applications issued to business owners and the far lower 
number actually filled out and turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 About 135,000 applications for business loans were distributed by the SBA as 
of July 17 but only about 43,600 were filled out. So far, the overall approval 
rate is at about 50%, lower than the approval rate after Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ferraro spokesperson said the councilman is trying to arrange a meeting with 
the mayor and Tuttle to plan a summit meeting with federal and state officials. 
But Ferraro stopped short of criticizing the mayor's efforts, saying only that 
he would "like to see this whole process expedited," the spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's disaster recovery plan, which was being drafted months before the 
quake but was approved Jan. 22, calls for the mayor to establish assistance 
teams and a hot line to provide quake-damaged businesses easy access to 
information on loans, permit applications and engineering work, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ourieff, owner of Michael J's pizza in Sherman Oaks, said he could use 
such help in his effort to relocate his business after it suffered about 
$20,000 in quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he spent about a month getting an SBA loan approved to pay for the 
repairs and is now frustrated because he can't persuade the SBA to let him use 
the money to relocate instead of rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't get some help or if I don't get lucky, I'm going to put 30 people 
out of work," he said. "I wish there was some place I could go where I can 
explain my situation and get some help." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Young said he needs help now that the SBA has rejected his loan 
application to pay for about $700,000 in damages to two Valley-based clinics 
and an apartment complex he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old physician said SBA told him he did not have the income to pay 
off such a loan, an assessment Young called "ludicrous." He said he tried to 
get help through a Valley business group but was simply "shuffled around and 
pushed through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials and business leaders praise the city's quake recovery 
efforts and say the business assistance called for by Tuttle has been offered 
by other groups and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Curry, president of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando 
Valley, said his group and other Valley business organizations have been 
providing business owners with assistance for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think the city needed to do that because it was essentially being 
done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, whose Northridge-based district sustained the most 
severe quake damage, said Riordan "has been on the stick from the beginning" 
and called Tuttle's criticism "political posturing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city already has a task force that is looking for untapped funds 
for business and home owners who did not qualify for SBA funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson added that the city's ad hoc recovery committee, which he chairs, has 
already invited state lawmakers representing Los Angeles to meet Aug. 1 in City 
Hall to discuss possible legislation to help the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody has done everything they can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, a former administrator for the Small Business Administration, defended 
the city's recovery efforts, saying assistance to businesses is provided 
through four "business assistance centers," partially funded by the city, and 
seven state-funded "small business development centers." 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance centers give business owners information and technical help in 
getting recovery loans or grants, either through the SBA or some other agency, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistance teams that were promised in the recovery plan will be hired by 
Sept. 1 and will be funded through a $1.8-million grant approved last week by 
the federal Economic Development Agency, Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team members will contact those businesses that either did not submit an 
SBA application or were denied a loan. The teams will attempt to give the help 
businesses need to get back on their feet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key effort by the city, Leslie said, will be to provide matching funds 
to those businesses interested in taking advantage of the $30 million in 
additional quake aid that the Clinton Administration released last month for 
small businesses.

YOU READ IT HERE: LITERACY PAYS AT THE WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Employees who take company literacy classes to improve their reading and 
writing skills can expect to fatten their paychecks anywhere from 10% to 17%, a 
workplace authority says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can expect to have increased wages and more job security because you will 
be more productive and a more valued employee," said Kevin Hollenbeck, a senior 
economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute For Employment Research in Kalamazoo, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a factory worker earning $6 on an assembly line likely would get 
a pay boost to $7 an hour after completing literacy instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, said Miriam Ben-Nathan, literacy spokeswoman for The Olsten 
Corp., of Westbury, N.Y., "People are afraid to come forward because they fear 
their employers will learn about their deficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers, she said, are spending $30 billion to train employees "but not 
enough of this goes to help people write and communicate effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Olsten Corp., about 29 million adult Americans are considered 
to be functionally illiterate -- only able to read or write at or below a 
fourth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 In studying about 250 Michigan companies having fewer than 500 workers each, 
Hollenbeck found "only 3% to 5% are actively doing something about the 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet 25% to 30% of those employed by these firms "have some sort of basic 
skills deficiency," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for firms having fewer than 100 workers, "there are just no workplace 
programs set up for (basic) education," Hollenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some companies feel, 'I'm not a big company. We don't have time or personnel 
to attend a workshop,' " Olsten's Ben-Nathan said. "But these can form a 
coalition in a particular community to act about workplace literacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some small firms, Hollenbeck said, "are finding they must upgrade the skills 
of their workers because large corporations are imposing higher quality 
standards on them as suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of small firms he spoke with told him that once their employees 
gained basic literacy skills, productivity would jump by about 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told of seeing evidence of lower scrap (waste) rates and higher quality 
products coming off their assembly line. Literacy was leading to more flexible 
workers who could adapt more easily," Hollenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to an employer for basic literacy training is about $1,000 per 
student when workers are educated in classes of 10 to 20, Hollenbeck said. A 
typical program on average cost employers $14,525. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the benefits of literacy training: 
</P>
<P>
 * After spending $40,000, management at a paperboard container firm in 
Kalamazoo found "reduced error rates" by workers who also experienced "great 
improvements in self- confidence and self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Kalamazoo furniture-maker found "significant improvement in company 
loyalty and morale," error rate reduction and heightened ability to use new 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 * One Grand Rapids, Mich., furniture-maker did not see much skills improvement 
but said employee attitudes improved. Workers also were no longer "scared to 
admit" illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Grand Rapids plastics-maker said employee problem-solving ability jumped 
41% after the courses. Employees were better able to work as teams and produce 
quality work more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 * A suburban Detroit plastics-maker noted "less turnover and more worker 
promotions." 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Flint, Mich., plastics-maker, supervisors say workers "are more open 
and more inclined to ask questions about their work." 
</P>
<P>
 * A payroll clerk noted time card errors dropped and supervisors said 
employees "seem better able to handle new technology."

 Independence One Bank of California: The Mission Viejo-based thrift with five 
branch offices reported a second-quarter profit of $931,000, down 57% from 
earnings of $2.2 million for the same period a year earlier.The company blamed 
the decline on rising home mortgage rates, which have resulted in fewer home 
sales and less refinancing activity. Six-month earnings were $1.9 million, down 
52% from $3.9 million for the first six months of last year. Total assets were 
$645.7 million as of June 30, down 34% from $981.1 million a year earlier.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: RAINBOW TECHNOLOGIES STOCK DROPS ON WORD OF 40% PROFIT 
DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of Rainbow Technologies Inc. fell sharply Thursday after the company 
reported a drop in second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock closed at $10.87 a share, down $2.50, in heavy Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow reported that its second-quarter profit was $1.1 million , or 20 cents 
a share, a 40% decline from earnings of $1.82 million, or 33 cents a share, for 
the same period a year earlier. That came on sales of $9.3 million, a 6.2% 
reduction from $9.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based company, which makes software protection products, blamed 
competition for the lower earnings. The falling value of the U.S. dollar in 
some overseas market also resulted in a $270,000 deficit, compared to a $65,000 
gain for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notwithstanding an increase in the number of software protection units 
shipped during the second quarter, revenues were lower due in part to continued 
competitive pricing pressures," said Patrick Fevery, vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the year, Rainbow said it earned $2.5 million, or 44 
cents a share, down 29% from a profit of $3.5 million, or 62 cents a share, for 
the same period last year. Six-month revenue was $18.3 million, down 1% from 
$18.5 million a year earlier.

IT'S NOT ALWAYS A LEAN ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite their reputation as a healthier alternative to burgers, "chicken or 
fish won't always help" to reduce fat content in a fast-food meal, Consumer 
Reports states in its August issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fat and calorie content of chicken varies dramatically depending on how it 
is prepared, the New York-based magazine reported."In fact, the skin and dark 
meat of KFC's Rotisserie Gold chicken helps make it one of the fattiest foods 
we tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Nutritional data provided by restaurant chains shows that chicken served 
without the skin is lower in calories and total fat than that with the skin 
still on. But nutritionists note that skinning chicken before cooking further 
reduces fat content. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports' new study did not include fast-food meals at El Pollo Loco, 
Boston Chicken or Kenny Rogers Roasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine reported last year that consumers can find poultry products that 
are "especially low in fat." The bottom line, Consumer Reports says, is that 
"if, like most Americans, you prefer the standard foods, you'll probably 
sacrifice nutrition to taste." GREG JOHNSON

 Fluor Daniel was chosen by Arizona Public Service Co. for the work on the

employ as many as 150 workers, the company said. The Irvine-based Fluor Daniel 
has done maintenance and modification for 15 nuclear generating plants over the 
years.

ROTISSERIE CHICKEN IS SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERE; FOOD: KFC, EL POLLO LOCO, KENNY 
ROGERS ROASTERS AND BOSTON ARE VYING FOR A PIECE OF THE GROWING MARKET IN O.C.

 No chicken in its right mind would cross Brookhurst Street here to get to the 
other side -- not with Boston Chicken, Kenny Rogers Roasters, Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and El Pollo Loco all perched there and crowing about their menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden proliferation of roasted chicken restaurants at Brookhurst and 
Garfield Avenue in Fountain Valley -- the newest, a Boston Chicken outlet, 
opens on Monday -- is indicative of a boom nationwide as competitors race for a 
share in one of the restaurant industry's most rapidly growing segments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rotisserie chicken is probably the hottest food category in restaurants and 
supermarkets," said Steve Provost, a vice president at Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
which controls about half of the $7-billion market for fried chicken. The 
PepsiCo subsidiary recently spent more than $100 million to introduce its 
Rotisserie Gold line at 5,000 stores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But the competition is strong. Kenny Rogers Roasters, which takes its name 
from the country singer, is run by John Y. Brown Jr., a businessman and former 
Kentucky governor who three decades ago turned Kentucky Fried Chicken into a 
nationwide chain. And Boston Chicken, which set a Wall Street record when its 
stock began trading in 1992, boasts a management team top-heavy with executives 
who helped Blockbuster climb to the top of the video rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-stakes game of chicken also has a strong West Coast connection. 
Irvine-based El Pollo Loco holds a good part of the Southern California market. 
And Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants Inc., which owns the Carl's Jr. hamburger 
chain, plans to open as many as 300 Boston Chicken franchise restaurants in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those, a host of other eateries also are clucking about their chicken 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great, healthy alternative," said Curtis Creek, marketing 
director at Polly's Tasty Foods & Pies, a Santa Fe Springs-based chain that 
serves rotisserie-style chicken from a restaurant at Adams Avenue and 
Brookhurst Street in Huntington Beach. "The high heat defats the meat but keeps 
the juice, which gives you great taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Great taste and the promise of less fat are an appealing combination. 
According to the National Restaurant Assn. in Washington, U.S. consumption per 
capita of chicken and turkey in 1990 for the first time matched those of beef. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers still love finger-licking good fried chicken. But while restaurant 
orders for fried chicken grew at an annual rate of 2% from 1989 to 1993, orders 
for non-fried chicken grew at a whopping 13% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to be seen, KFC's Provost said, is "whether it's a fad or an enduring 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
 The chains don't pitch their chicken as health food. But they are responding 
to consumer demand by providing details about the nutritional makeup of their 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken offers easy-to-read charts that describe the nutritional value 
of its entrees. El Pollo Loco reports that one of its meals "contains 30% less 
fat and 20% less sodium than a comparable fried chicken meal." And menu boards 
at Kenny Rogers Roasters note that several entrees meet the fat, cholesterol 
and sodium guidelines of an independent company that rates restaurant food. 
</P>
<P>
 Fad or not, roasted chicken is definitely in favor now. KFC expects first-year 
sales of Rotisserie Gold to reach $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken, which now has 340 restaurants in 23 states, hopes to have 525 
by year's end. The company, which reported $154 million in fiscal 1993 sales, 
hopes to open as many as 300 locations in Southern California through its 
franchise arrangement with the Carl's Jr. chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited because this is good, wholesome food -- food that's relatively 
easy to replicate at many locations," said Kerry Coin, general manager of 
Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants' Boston Pacific Inc. subsidiary. "And it's almost 
the reverse of Carl's (traffic flow) because we do most of our business at 
dinner, while Carl's is heaviest at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away from Boston Chicken's new restaurant is the first Orange 
County location for Kenny Rogers Roasters. The company, based in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., plans to have 165 stores open in 31 states and five foreign 
markets by the end of this year, including locations in Corona, Northridge and 
Palm Desert. It is now readying stores in Santa Ana, Lakewood, Anaheim, Brea, 
Hemet, Simi Valley, Santa Barbara and Vallejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the competition is El Pollo Loco, which offers flame-broiled 
chicken and Mexican-style food at 200 locations in California, Nevada, Arizona 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to compete head-to-head with Boston Chicken," said Ray Perry, El 
Pollo Loco's chief operating officer. "Our objective is to continue to grow in 
Southern California through company and franchise development." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry veterans El Pollo Loco and KFC are betting that their lower prices 
will prevail over those of newcomers Boston Chicken and Kenny Rogers Roasters, 
which offer costlier meals and a wider variety of side dishes. Perry argues 
that consumers at Boston Chicken will pay more than $3 for "exactly the same 
size piece of chicken that we sell for $1.99. That's what makes me feel we'll 
be able to compete very strongly." 
</P>
<P>
 Provost of KFC is also betting that KFC will benefit if roasted chicken proves 
to be more than a fad. "Boston Chicken will get Biff and Buffy Yuppie, the 
couple with the Mercedes that thinks alfalfa is a neat veggie to go with their 
meal," Provost said. "We want Joe and Jane in middle-class America. . . . And 
there's awful lot more Joes and Janes out there." 
</P>
<P>
 While chicken's popularity is growing in part simply because it tastes good, 
outlets are also benefiting from consumer demand for more variety in take-home 
fare. Increasingly, Perry said, consumers are learning that "chicken travels 
best of all the quick-service restaurants, including pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures provided by KFC, Americans purchased $346 billion in food 
during 1988 at regular grocery stores and about $155 billion in food that was 
prepared elsewhere but eaten at home. Grocery store purchases rose at a healthy 
pace to $399 billion by 1992, Provost said, but prepared-food sales zoomed to 
$265 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend means the chicken restaurants are competing in the broader category 
of "what the industry is calling the 'meal replacement segment' than just 
against each other," Boston Pacific's Coin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis increasingly is on whole meals. Boston Chicken offers a wide 
array of hot and cold side orders -- including rice pilaf, fresh steamed 
vegetables and real mashed potatoes -- that are made fresh daily. "We're 
definitely not fast food," Coin said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the market is growing, however, observers suggest that the chicken 
chains may be due to have their wings clipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors question whether high-flying Boston Chicken, whose stock soared 
from $20 to $48.50 when it went public on Nov. 9, 1993, can hit projected 
double-digit profit margins. They also question whether KFC, which recently 
shuffled its top management in a bid to stimulate flat overall sales, can 
regain its focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry acknowledged that El Pollo Loco, a subsidiary of Spartanburg, S.C.-based 
Flagstar Corp., has had to scramble in the face of new competition. "A year 
ago, I would have said that El Pollo was a dying chain," Perry said. "But we're 
up and running. We'll continue to work this year and next. We now look like a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the roasted chicken rage, some chains are sticking with fried food. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based America's Favorite Chicken is renovating its 2,000 Popeyes 
Chicken & Biscuits and Churchs Chicken restaurants and adding menu items. It 
dramatically expanded its Southern California presence in recent months as 65 
Pioneer chicken takeout stores converted to Popeyes locations. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Favorite declares that it isn't going the rotisserie route yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the jury is still out on roasted chicken," said Mike Whitten, senior 
vice president of America's Favorite Chicken. "But we know that there's a 
tremendous opportunity on the fried chicken segment." Hold the Grease

TOP KIDDER BROKER WILL RETIRE AMID CLIENT, REGULATOR PRESSURE; SECURITIES: NYSE 
IS INVESTIGATING GREGORY WILBUR IN ONE MORE EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few stockbrokers have received as many accolades as Gregory F. Wilbur of 
Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of a Stanford University president, Wilbur in 1992 was featured 
in a New York Institute of Finance book on "How 10 Stockbrokers Became the Best 
in the Business." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 cover story, Town & Country magazine chose him as one of the 
nation's Top 10 brokers. Local newspapers wrote glowing profiles. He was named 
Kidder's "Man of the Year" in 1987 and was a regular member of Kidder 
Associates, an elite group formed to honor the firm's top 25 brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, The Times has learned, Wilbur -- under investigation by the New 
York Stock Exchange -- is being forced to retire from Kidder, the Wall Street 
brokerage firm owned by General Electric Co. that has suffered a series of 
recent embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that Wilbur, 59, and Kidder so far have paid out more than $3.2 
million in settlements and arbitration judgments in response to complaints from 
10 of his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients accused Wilbur, who works in Kidder's Palo Alto office, of causing big 
losses by loading up their accounts with highly speculative, thinly traded 
stocks -- especially Silicon Valley technology issues, in which Wilbur's 
clients held enormous stakes. Some clients also accused him of making trades 
they never authorized and excessively buying and selling securities in an 
apparent effort to boost his commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, records from the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the 
state of Maryland show that when several of the customers complained, Wilbur 
reimbursed them out of his own pocket, a violation of securities rules. In one 
instance, the records show, he paid a complaining customer $981,000. Maryland 
regulators fined him for failing to report the complaints to Kidder or to 
regulators, as required. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the customer complaints, Kidder spokesman Anthony Zehnder said, 
"We're not going to deny any of those allegations." Although he said Wilbur had 
been "a highly valued employee of the Palo Alto office," Zehnder disclosed that 
he had been suspended by Kidder for 60 days last year and confirmed that the 
company had required him to give up the accounts of individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Literally hundreds of retail accounts were in fact taken away from him," 
Zehnder said. He would not comment on the reasons for Wilbur's early 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur did not respond to numerous telephone requests to both his office and 
home seeking comment, nor to a faxed request for an interview. His secretary 
confirmed late Thursday that Wilbur had received the messages and the fax, but 
said he had left for the day; a woman who identified herself as his wife said 
she believed he did not wish to comment. Kidder in recent months has been beset 
by misfortunes that led GE in June to oust the unit's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm dismissed the head of its government bond trading desk, Joseph Jett, 
in April, accusing him of booking $350 million in profits that didn't exist. 
(Jett has denied wrongdoing.) Kidder suffered heavy losses this spring on its 
huge portfolio of mortgage bonds. More recently, Kidder disclosed that it had 
dismissed a trader in its London office, contending that he had hidden $6 
million in losses on European bonds. That trader has also denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Wilbur's business was based on his vaunted expertise in technology 
stocks. He was quoted as saying that he went to great lengths to do research on 
tech companies, visiting their headquarters and interviewing top executives, 
many of whom became his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pride myself on being an expert on Silicon Valley-based companies," Wilbur 
told the authors of the New York Institute of Finance "Best in the Business" 
book. "In general, I rarely invest in companies that I can't drive to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in arbitration proceedings, customers accused him of putting much of their 
money in these stocks, often without permission, and charged that the stocks 
were so narrowly traded that there was often little market for them besides 
Wilbur's other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Horowitz, an expert witness against Wilbur at arbitration hearings, said he 
had testified that the broker seemed so enamored of several thinly traded 
companies that his customers at times held most of their outstanding stock -- 
"so much that he lost the ability to ever change his mind on those securities," 
Horovitz said in an interview. "He created risks that were astounding for 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Wilbur was accused of selling blue chip stocks that had long been 
held by a client in his 90s and putting most of the man's funds into thinly 
traded Silicon Valley stocks. Kidder and Wilbur agreed to pay $1.65 million to 
settle the man's complaint, according to NASD records. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stocks Wilbur bought heavily was Silvar-Lisco, a software 
manufacturer that has since changed its name and which over the last five years 
has had erratic swings in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was Delphi Information Systems, a company now based in Illinois. 
Daniel F. Dunne, Delphi's chief financial officer, said in a telephone 
interview that the firm regards Wilbur as its "market maker." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is a very thinly traded stock," Dunne said, explaining that anyone who 
wants to buy or sell the company's shares usually ends up dealing with Wilbur. 
The stock, which traded as high as $8 a share in 1990, currently is trading at 
about $3.25 a share on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 Zehnder said Kidder had no comment on why Kidder managers did not supervise 
Wilbur's accounts more closely. A Times series published in 1992 found that 
Wall Street firms often seemed reluctant to discipline big producers. 
</P>
<P>
 In published interviews, Wilbur emphasized his connections with Stanford, from 
which he graduated in 1956 and later obtained a business degree. A spokeswoman 
for the university confirmed that he has been a prominent fund-raiser for the 
school. His grandfather, Ray Lyman Wilbur, was the university's third 
president, serving from 1915 to 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the New York Stock Exchange investigation focuses at least in 
part on Wilbur's failure to report customer complaints. A stock exchange 
spokesman said that, as a matter of policy, the exchange will not confirm the 
existence of pending investigations. NYSE investigations can lead to censure, 
fines or bans prohibiting brokers from working for member firms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unreported complaints came to light as a result of an investigation by the 
Maryland Securities Division, which suspended Wilbur's license in the state for 
about 10 weeks beginning in April, 1993, and fined him $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In a document filed with the state, Wilbur's lawyer in that case, Charles P. 
Scheeler, confirmed that "Mr. Wilbur privately settled complaints with four 
clients" between 1985 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not report the matters internally to Kidder because he concluded the 
desire of his clients and himself for confidentiality took precedence," 
Scheeler stated.
