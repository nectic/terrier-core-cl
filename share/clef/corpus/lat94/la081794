SETTLEMENT REPORTED BETWEEN UCLA, SHOTPUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-time NCAA shotput champion Brent Noon of Georgia reached a settlement 
with UCLA in a $10-million defamation suit, the school confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon's father, Jim Noon, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution the newspaper 
on Monday that the settlement reached the "high six figures."With legal fees, 
the suit will cost UCLA morethan $1 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in March of 1993, alleged that assistant Bruin coach Art 
Venegas spread rumors for several years that Noon used anabolic steroids. The 
suit also alleged that officials of USA Track & Field, the sport's governing 
body, spread similar rumors and illegally banned Noon for several weeks in 1992 
because he did not submit to a random drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at USA Track said Monday night that they will not settle with Noon. 
Jury selection in USA Track's portion of the suit is scheduled to begin Friday 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Venegas was unavailable for comment, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said Noon has passed more than 20 drug tests performed by USA Track, 
the NCAA and the University of Georgia over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money was never an issue with us," Jim Noon said. "If I had my way, I'd 
still take UCLA to court."

MORNING BRIEFING: BOXER'S COMMEMORATION IDEA TORCHED BY FLICKERING FLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For his Aug. 11 retirement at the Amateur Athletic Foundation, boxer Paul 
Gonzales had requested that a symbolic Olympic torch the AAF keeps lighted be 
turned off for the day to commemorate the end of his 10-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, 1984, Gonzales won the Olympic gold medal in the flyweight 
division at the Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAF, however, denied Gonzales' request to have the flame extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a hard enough time getting someone to turn off the lights here at 
night," quipped Barry Zepel, a foundation publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Zepel acknowledged that the symbolic helix has been anything but an 
eternal flame. He said it is given to periodic blackouts because of mechanical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of turning it off intentionally, the nonprofit foundation presented 
Gonzales with the AAF's 10-year anniversary flag.

 Trivia time: Who is the only player to have been the No. 1 pick in the 
baseball draft twice? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 We like it: Gene Sapakoff in the Charleston Post and Courier discussing that 
South Carolina city's new 7,100-seat baseball stadium, which is scheduled to 
open next spring: 
</P>
<P>
 "How about considering Charleston's long association with the South Atlantic 
League (commonly known as the Sally League) when naming our new ballpark? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sally Field." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicious minds: So Elvis Grbac makes only $140,000. So he saves the San 
Francisco 49ers money under the salary cap. How dare some cynics suggest that's 
why he is the backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few young quarterbacks in the league who have the potential to 
one day take a team to the championship level, and Elvis Grbac is one of them," 
49er offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan said. "He has excellent arm strength. 
He can make all the throws that are necessary in the NFL. And he can do it with 
the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Which of course explains why Grbac was drafted in the eighth round last year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Getting carded: The owner of the Hot Card Connection in Wheeling, W. Va., 
angry over the baseball strike, filed his protest by dumping about 2,000 cards 
and, at least for a few days, choosing not to sell any major league 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled out all my baseball cards, and replaced them with minor league 
cards," Dennis Prochaska said. "I'm not selling anything endorsed by the Major 
League Baseball Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did this because they're getting so much money, even while they're on 
strike, from royalties on team merchandise. They're still getting paid even 
when they don't play." 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen or so youngsters didn't exactly share his sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly scooped up the major league cards. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Danny Goodwin. In 1971, when he was a high school senior, the 
Chicago White Sox took him with the first pick. Then in 1975, when he was a 
college senior, the Angels took him first.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is one exhibition game the Rams should care about. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Beating the Raiders on Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium would do something 
for their self-esteem. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A lopsided loss and ticket sales might come to a complete halt for the lame 
ducks, not to be confused with the Mighty Ducks next door. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't been counting, the Rams have scored only one touchdown in 
two games this summer and have extended their exhibition losing streak since 
1992 to seven. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look for quarterback Chris Miller to get more work. The offensive line was a 
sieve last week against New England, but, even at the risk of injury, the 
quarterback has to become more familiar with a new system and new teammates 
before the Sept. 4 opener against Arizona. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Certain to be playing hard will be Joe Kelly, who was released by the Raiders 
and has become a starting linebacker for the Rams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will return to Anaheim Stadium Nov. 13 for what could be the last 
all-L.A. game in the NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 An appealing Ram rookie free agent is Beno Bryant, the former Washington and 
Dorsey High tailback who has caught four passes for 30 yards and gained 16 
yards in three rushes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Travel time would make NFL expansion to Mexico, Canada or both more feasible 
than to Europe. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Could the Mexican economy support a team? Tickets for the Dallas-Houston 
exhibition game that drew a record crowd of 112,376 to Azteca Stadium in Mexico 
City Monday night weren't cheap -- $60, $54, $44, $20 and $7.And it wasn't as 
though most of them were $7. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kickers feel they got two-timed when the NFL went to both a smaller tee and a 
30-yard-line kickoff the same year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Meola, the U.S. soccer goalkeeper trying out with the New York Jets, is 
one of the few who has had a kickoff reach the end zone for a touchback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I thought Chuck Cecil, the hard-hitting safety cut by the Arizona Cardinals, 
would have been Buddy Ryan's kind of ballplayer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Jeff Kopp climbed the fence at the USC pool a couple of nights this 
summer and dived off the 10-meter board in the dark. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When I get bored, I need something to pick me up," Kopp said. "The adrenaline 
really flows when I play football. Diving was the closest thing to it." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure John Robinson will be thrilled to hear about that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Professional baseball will be played in Southern California the rest of the 
week -- California League style. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight and Thursday: Lake Elsinore at Rancho Cucamonga and San Jose at San 
Bernardino. Friday through Sunday: Rancho Cucamonga at San Bernardino. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Cucamonga Quakes broke their California League attendance record 
Tuesday when they exceeded the 331,005 mark. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Any unused Dodger or Angel tickets for games canceled by the strike can be 
exchanged free of charge for tickets to the Roller Hockey International playoff 
game between the Blades and the San Diego Barracudas Friday night at the Forum. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The RHI playoff system is unusual. Each series consists of only two games. If 
the teams split the games, they play overtime the second night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Blade star Nick Vachon, son of Rogie, has signed a two-year contract with the 
Kings' Phoenix Roadrunner farm club. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buster Mathis Jr. is better at comedy than boxing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker will have the home-ring advantage, which he really doesn't 
need, on Oct. 1 when he gives Buddy McGirt a rematch in Norfolk, Va., on HBO. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Hall of Fame trainer Jack Van Berg for saving the match race 
Sunday at Del Mar when he volunteered to substitute his Mamselle Bebette for 
the ill Cool Air against Soviet Problem. Too many people are looking for ways 
to keep their horses out of races. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best race of the year could be the 125th Travers Stakes Saturday at Saratoga 
that matches Holy Bull against Tabasco Cat. Remember, Holy Bull wasn't 
nominated for the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs and owner-trainer 
Jimmy Croll says he won't put up the $360,000 supplemental fee. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 TV commentator Doug Collins suggested that the Orlando Magic would have the 
best starting lineup in the NBA next season. But the Phoenix Suns can put 
together an even more formidable five -- Charles Barkley, Danny Manning, Kevin 
Johnson, Dan Majerle and Oliver Miller. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There were no baseball negotiations Tuesday and none are scheduled, but, after 
all, what's the rush?

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: FOURSOME BEATS FEARSOME IN LION ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians have had their share of encounters with wild animals this year, 
but few have been as bizarre as the one involving a mountain lion and a group 
of vacationers Tuesday morning in a remote section of Mendocino County. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation still was under way Tuesday afternoon, but the following was 
released by officials with the California Department of Fish and Game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At about 4:30 a.m., four adults staying in an isolated cabin near the small 
town of Dos Rios were awakened by their dog, a collie, outside fighting a lion. 
When the humans appeared, the lion hid under the cabin and the dog took off 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The two couples gathered what weapons they could find -- a shovel, a 
hatchet and a kitchen knife -- and tried to scare the lion off. They were 
unsuccessful and decided to build a fire, outside, for warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They were standing by the fire when the lion charged from beneath the 
cabin, running past one woman and attacking the other. Her companions jumped on 
the cat and killed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had this variety of implements and they whomped on this poor cat," said 
Brian Hunter, a spokesman for the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cat didn't die without inflicting some damage. It apparently bit off 
one man's thumb and, before the humans got involved, had bitten the dog on the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The two couples and the dog hiked a mile and crossed a river to get to 
their 4-wheel-drive vehicle and, four hours after the attack, reached a 
hospital in Dos Rios. It was too late to reattach the man's thumb, but none of 
the other injuries was serious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The lion was a sub-adult, between 50 and 60 pounds and apparently healthy 
at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendocino County has one of the highest densities of mountain lions in the 
state, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Business is anything but brisk these days at Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it's chubasco , or hurricane season. It's too hot, too humid and 
people generally don't want to risk being blown out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 These people are wrong, according to some. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, August is absolutely the best month to go fishing down here," 
said Tracy Ehrenberg, owner of the Pisces Fleet at Land's End. "People think 
October and January are the good months, but in August you can catch a blue 
marlin, 100-pound tuna and 50-pound dorado all in the same day." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, they're also catching yellowfin tuna close to 200 pounds. Some of 
the battles are so long that the sharks are catching up with the tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several come in with their tails bitten off by sharks," Ehrenberg 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenberg said she hasn't seen a tuna bite this consistent in a few years, 
with 10- to 60-pound fish outside the harbor and the larger ones cruising with 
the marlin and sharks 10-20 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 And so far, she added, the tropical storms and hurricanes have generated large 
swells, wind and some rain, but have yet to put a damper on the fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland is sweltering under an unbearably hot August sun, but there 
seems to be some good coming from it. The sun and lack of westerly winds have 
been warming the water and it could be only a matter of time before 
sub-tropical fish start appearing locally as they did during El Nino last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The First String out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing on Monday found a school of 
yellowfin at the outer banks, landing four before running out of bait. And a 
24-pound dorado was weighed in at Catalina Island on Saturday, another 
indication of better things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The marlin count at Avalon is up to nine and the broadbill swordfish count is 
at two, with most billfish being taken at the 277-fathom spot off the east end 
of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The State Wildlife Conservation Board has approved the purchase by the state 
-- at a cost of $1.7 million -- of 1,300 acres along seven miles of the East 
Walker River in Mono County. The action will preserve habitat and access along 
a section of river from Bridgeport Reservoir to within two miles of the Nevada 
border.  
</P>
<P>
 The East Walker was once a famed brown trout fishery and still is recovering 
from a massive water discharge and fish kill in 1988. Canada geese, bald and 
golden eagles, prairie falcons, beavers, minks, bears and other animals also 
utilize the habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will come from the Habitat Conservation Fund, created by the 1990 
passage of Prop. 117. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With hunting season getting under way, the DFG is offering hunter-safety 
courses on Saturday and on Aug. 27 & 28 at Raahague's Pheasant Hunting Club in 
Norco. The classes -- mandatory for obtaining hunting licenses -- last 10 hours 
and cost $30. Details: (800) 773-4868.

 Defensive end Steve Emtman, the top pick of the 1992 draft, but out most of 
the past two years with separate knee injuries, passed a physical exam and was 
cleared to begin practice with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not mean that he is ready to play by any means," Colts vice president 
of operations Bill Tobin said. "We have taken the rehabilitation and 
conditioning as far as we can and now it is on to more strenuous activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Emtman tore two ligaments and the patellar tendon in his right knee last Oct. 
10 in a game against Dallas. He had surgery in October and again in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts also said rookie linebacker Trev Alberts, the fifth player picked in 
this year's draft, is seeking a third opinion on his injured elbow. Alberts 
suffered a dislocated right elbow Aug. 5 in a game against Seattle.

 Rodney Hampton returned to camp a little poorer due to his unexcused absence 
the previous day. The New York Giants running back explained his absence by 
saying he had to take care of a personal family matter in Baton Rouge, La. It 
was not known if Dan Reeves levied the maximum $4,000 fine. . . . Carlton 
Haselrig, healing from a dislocated wrist, was missing from the Pittsburgh 
Steelers' training camp again for personal reasons. The Steelers have declined 
to comment about the former Pro Bowl guard's whereabouts. "We should have some 
further update in a couple of days," Coach Bill Cowher said. . . . Arizona's 
No. 2 quarterback, Jim McMahon, missed his third consecutive practice because 
of a left ankle sprain and might not play when the Cardinals visit Detroit on 
Friday. . . . Seattle lost backup wide receiver Reggie Barrett for the season. 
Barrett underwent surgery to repair ligament damage in his right knee. He was 
injured in Seattle's 29-6 exhibition victory over Tampa Bay, a game in which he 
caught passes of 52 and 15 yards. . . . Denver cut veteran safety Michael Ball, 
a six-year pro who signed with the Broncos as a free agent last spring.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; TRAVELING CIRCUS IS COMING HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to fold the tents at Camp Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 After 5 1/2 weeks of work and three exhibition games, the Raiders are 
abandoning their summer training base in Oxnard tonight and returning to their 
year-around headquarters in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a travel-filled summer, featuring one intercontinental trip to 
Barcelona, one cross-continent journey to Pittsburgh and one additional trek to 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has hardly been one long vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell has kept his squad in full gear for most of the two-a-day 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," said quarterback Jeff Hostetler. "He's come back and 
he's all work. He's not going to put up with any screwing around and I think 
that's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Tom Rathman, who played eight years for the San Francisco 49ers, says 
this is the hardest he has worked in a camp but that he loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Hostetler think Shell is cracking the whip harder than ever because he 
feels this team, performing at a peak level, can get farther than any of its 
recent predecessors? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, I think so," the quarterback said. "I think he realizes we've got a 
lot of pieces to the puzzle. . . . I notice a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 No argument from the taskmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a chance to be pretty good," Shell said. "But we've got to work at 
it. If they just listen to (reporters) they could become fat and lazy. . . . I 
tell them, 'I love you all. It's nothing personal, but we've got a job to do.' 
. . . Players are like kids. They adapt." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell says he has also adapted. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you grow older and get in your job more, you find things to do to make the 
team better," he said. "I've grown in that sense as a coach. I better 
understand how to get the team better." STEVE SPRINGER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; FORD PROVES ADEPT AT BOOMING KICKOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cole Ford hasn't proved himself as a field goal kicker, USC coaches say, but 
no one questions his kickoff capabilities.  
</P>
<P>
 A kickoff hang time of 4.2 seconds is considered good. Ford has had 4.3s on 
some of his kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anyone in football who can put it up there longer than Cole can," 
kicking coach Jeff Kearin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ford, a 6-foot-2, 195-pound senior, was sidelined because of a back injury for 
seven games last season. A senior, he's 20 for 40 on field goals but went only 
two for six last season. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Ford trained with Ray Pelfrey, who operates camps for pro, 
college and high school kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cole has a great leg, he just needs work on control," Pelfrey said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At the recent Pac-10 rules meeting for coaches, Verle Sorgen, chief of 
officials, was explaining the new rule on player fights, which calls for 
ejection of any player or coach who leaves the sideline and runs toward a 
fight.  
</P>
<P>
 This dialogue ensued between Sorgen and Stanford's Bill Walsh: 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh: If a coach is ejected, does he have to leave the field? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorgen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh: Could he go to Carmel? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorgen: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh: Could he go on a recruiting trip? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorgen: No.

 Antoine Simpson, the high school All-American defensive end from Houston who 
signed a letter of intent to enroll at USC, has instead decided to enroll at 
Minnesota, according to his attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson did not meet USC academic requirements, but told USC coaches he 
intended to enroll in junior college this semester and hopefully transfer to 
USC in January.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to go to Colorado when USC turned him down, but Colorado had no 
scholarships to give," said Kent Schaeffer, Simpson's Houston attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minnesota then brought him in, and he's decided to go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was accused of sexual assault in May by a 15-year-old girl, but was 
cleared by a LaPorte, Tex., grand jury. EARL GUSTKEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; SEEKING MANN WITH PASS-RUSH ABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to improve their pass rush, the Rams on Tuesday worked out four-time 
Pro Bowl defensive end Charles Mann, who has had two arthroscopic knee 
operations in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Vice President Jay Zygmunt is awaiting final results of Mann's physical 
and plans to begin negotiations with Mann's agent, Jack Wirth of Chicago, soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, an 11-year pro who played in three Super Bowls with the Washington 
Redskins, has worked out for Philadelphia, Houston, San Francisco and the New 
York Jets, with the Oilers and 49ers showing the most interest. A source said 
that if Mann can't strike a deal soon, he plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have viewed their defensive line -- featuring Pro Bowl tackle Sean 
Gilbert and free-agent acquisition Jimmie Jones -- as one of the strengths of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, 6-feet-6 and 270 pounds, would be an insurance policy for Rams' starting 
defensive end Fred Stokes, who is recovering from a strained knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have tight ends Troy Drayton and Travis McNeal become the forgotten men in the 
Rams' offense? Nope, says offensive coordinator Chick Harris, even though they 
have yet to catch a pass in exhibition play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, they haven't caught a ball, but there have been plays designed to go to 
them," Harris said. "Sometimes the reads have taken them someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Harris been disappointed in the play of Drayton, a second-round draft pick 
last year who had complained of being ignored in Ernie Zampese's system last 
year?  
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been disappointed at all," Harris said. "All last week, Troy caught 
more balls in practice than he has ever caught here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant head coach Joe Vitt said the Rams will continue looking at veteran 
free agents, but the team is not interested in Chuck Cecil, the hard-hitting 
safety who was released Monday by the Arizona Cardinals. "One of the things we 
feel very, very good about right now is the safety position," he said. "We have 
five safeties who are improving and making plays." . . . Left guard Bill 
Schultz practiced with the first string Tuesday, a day after Chuck Belin had 
replaced longtime starter Tom Newberry at the position. . . . Sitting out 
practice with injuries Tuesday were tailbacks David Lang and Johnny Bailey, 
safety Deral Boykin and receiver Jermaine Ross. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; LINEBACKER-FULLBACK GOES ON DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Ruckman figures he's come home after a yearlong visit to the UCLA 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruckman, a sophomore, is looking forward to playing at one of the two inside 
linebacker spots, where he had anticipated playing when he was recruited from 
Porterville High. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he was a freshman fullback by necessity. There weren't enough of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, they asked me if I would help out the team as a blocking 
fullback, and told me I could return to linebacker next season," Ruckman said. 
"I said sure, and I think it was good for me to have game experience and 
experience at the tempo of the college game. Seeing things at game speed helped 
me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a tendency to hear Ruckman before seeing him on the practice field 
last season. Whenever there was a loud crash, he was generally there, enhancing 
his reputation as a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(On the field) you just block everything out of your mind, just go full speed 
and hope you hit your target," he said. "You just don't think too much. That's 
the football mentality, I guess. People don't think we think too much." 
</P>
<P>
 But the adjustment to college linebacker is much more than a physical one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would be as technical as it is," he said. "I thought it 
would be, 'Fill the gap, go out and hit somebody,' just like in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, there are a lot more things to learn. Things are going on all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The last part of every play is the same, though. It's why he enjoys playing 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a designed play, but there's more free will," he said. "And you get 
to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strongest of the Bruins? No question, says Phil Frye, the strength and 
conditioning coach. It's offensive guard Matt Soenksen, who bench-pressed 502 
pounds in tests before practice began. Fastest? "I'd say it's between Bryan 
Adams, Skip Hicks and Andy Colbert," said Frye, who isn't certain because the 
Bruins do not test speed alone, but rather combine it with endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Teddy Lawrence was in for 758 plays last season, most of any 
defensive player. . . . The Bruins had 29 players on the Director's Honor Roll 
(3.0 grade-point average or higher) last season, with two of them, George Kase 
and Brian Stewart, making it all three quarters. Kase carried a 3.45 GPA, 
majoring in economics. . . . UCLA broke the two-a-day practice regimen on 
Tuesday, working out on the field only in the afternoon. Practice in pads with 
contact begins today. JIM HODGES

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ANDRE': A SEAL THAT WINS APPROVAL; BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF A 
PERFORMING SEA LION, THIS UNCONTRIVED OFFERING IS A QUINTESSENTIAL FAMILY FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Andre" is as irresistible as the adorable baby seal from which it takes its 
title -- and could prove a worthy successor to "Free Willy." It is the 
quintessential family film: appealing to all ages, insulting to the 
intelligence of none, and going out of its way to avoid an aura of contrivance. 
Like all good straightforward movies, everything that happens grows out of the 
character and nature of the people involved. What's more, these people seem 
unusually real for the genre -- even the good guys aren't perfect. That 
"Andre," which begins in the summer of 1962, is based on a real story surely 
has to help. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harry Whitney (Keith Carradine), harbor master for picturesque Rockport, 
Me., and his younger daughter, Toni (Tina Majorino), encounter a freshly 
orphaned baby seal with great big dark eyes and a perplexed, scared expression, 
what can they do but try to nurse it back to health? Through trial and error 
they succeed. In no time Andre, as he is named by Toni, becomes part of the 
family. But the father and daughter's relationship with Andre does not stop 
there, for Andre becomes a performer of remarkable intelligence and skill, and 
finally such a tourist attraction, he's invited to appear on "The Ed Sullivan 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre's vibrant, larger-than-life presence has to have an impact on the 
Whitneys in particular and Rockport in general, and that's the heart of the 
matter. Adapted by Dana Baratta from a book by Lew Dietz and the late Harry 
Goodridge -- the Goodridges are the real-life family who took in the actual 
Andre -- the film counterpoints Andre's eerily anthropomorphic high jinks with 
a serious consideration of the possibilities and limitations of relationships 
between humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 On an everyday level, the Whitneys discover that if Andre brings joy, he has 
plenty of potential for generating grief as well. One suspects that Baratta has 
dabbled in a bit of dramatic license, but if so, it's all to the good, for the 
film's moments of adventure and danger develop from credible situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Right away the family dog is put off by Andre, who exerts his territorial 
imperative with as much ease as he wins most hearts. Harry's older, teen-age 
daughter, Paula (Aidan Pendleton), probably already chafing at the close bond 
between Toni and their father, eventually comes to feel, not without some 
justification, that he cares more for the seal than for her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Harry's a laid-back guy to start with, his growing fascination with 
studying Andre's intellectual capacity not only jeopardizes his family life but 
finally his job. In particular, Harry incites the rapidly escalating enmity of 
Billy (Keith Szarabajka), a hard-drinking, struggling fisherman and a single 
father barely able to provide for his son (Joshua Jackson), who is fast 
becoming Paula's boyfriend. An honest Yankee, Billy admits forthrightly that he 
envies Harry for his decent-paying job; his inviting, mellow old home; his 
attractive wife (Chelsea Field), as strong as she is good-humored, and, to top 
it off, the newfound celebrity Andre has brought Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals and children, especially one as beguiling as 9-year-old Majorino, are 
notorious scene-stealers, but Carradine really does hold his own. That's thanks 
to George Miller's astute direction (he's the "Man From Snowy River" Miller, 
not the "Mad Max" one, though both are Australian), Carradine's own charisma 
and talent, and a very well-written role. Indeed, the linchpin of the entire 
film is Harry's rock-solid marriage with Field's Thalice, whose capacity for 
understanding is matched by her forthrightness with her husband and children, 
which include Shane Meier as her lively son Steve. 
</P>
<P>
 Tory, a 10-year-old sea lion that performs at a California theme park, and his 
trainer Suzanne Fortier, deserve no end of credit for making Andre such a 
charmer. Although the film ends on a note of finality, it's hard to believe 
that we've seen the last of Andre. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild teen mischief, mild violence and language. Times 
guidelines: Its language is very mild; the film is suitable for all ages.

invested $2.5 million and became a partner in Jon Voight Productions, which 
then entered into a deal with Crystal Sky Communications Inc. to make films of 
two Hans Christian Andersen stories. The deal later fell apart, Voight alleges, 
because Pels did not fulfill financial obligations. Voight's suit is the latest 
in the ensuing legal battle over the broken deal. Crystal Sky has since filed a 
breach of contract lawsuit against Jon Voight Productions, and Pels in May 
filed her own racketeering suit against Crystal Sky, claiming individuals at 
the company embezzled $4 million from her. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; A 'PLACE' TO CELEBRATE FRIENDSHIP AND IDEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adolfo Aristarain's superb "A Place in the World" is at once a memory film, an 
exceptionally intelligent coming-of-age story, a commentary on Argentina's 
turbulent, harrowing, recent political history and a consideration of just how 
much an individual can hope to accomplish with his or her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond all this, it is a warm and good-humored celebration of adult friendship 
and strong family ties. In short, it is remarkable how much Aristarain's film 
encompasses while involving us with the kind of density and detail we associate 
with the most inviting novels. Intriguingly, he has stated that his film was 
inspired by "Shane" and "How Green Was My Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 (What a shame that this beautiful, rueful yet inspiriting picture, an 
Argentina-Uruguay co-production, was nominated for a best foreign film Oscar 
for the awards ceremony held in 1993, only to be disqualified over a conflict 
in regard to its country of origin.) 
</P>
<P>
 The film unfolds as a flashback when a young man visits a small remote town 
(which could easily pass as a desert outpost in the American Southwest) for the 
first time in nine years. With the same effortless grace that Aristarain uses 
to introduce his various themes, he swiftly acquaints us with that man as an 
adolescent, Ernesto (Gaston Batyi), and a host of others who will impact upon 
his life. The key figures are Ernesto's parents, Mario (Federico Luppi) and Ana 
(Cecilia Roth); their friend, a nun named Nelda (Leonor Benedetto); and a 
newcomer named Hans (Jose Sacristan), a Madrid geologist hired by the local 
landowner to investigate the possibility of oil reserves in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 All in good time we learn that Mario and Ana were driven into exile during 
Argentina's military dictatorship. Upon returning, they struck out for Bermejo 
Valley, where they formed a cooperative with the local peasants, mainly 
sheepherders. Mario teaches school while Ana, a physician, runs a clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 They are in perfect sync with Nelda, a witty, devout but free-thinking 
activist who refuses to wear traditional nun's garb. The sheer, down-to-earth 
goodness of these three dedicated but embracing people will have a crucial 
effect upon the cynical, lonely Hans, a peripatetic two-time divorce. Meantime, 
Ernesto is experiencing first love with Luciana, a local girl (Lorena Del Rio) 
whom he teaches how to read, despite her father's disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 These people are truly charismatic, and the emotional heart of the film really 
is in mealtime gatherings, marked by amusing, passionate and intellectual 
conversation of a level heard rarely outside an Eric Rohmer film. Because 
Aristarain in his prologue has introduced a sense of the transitory quality of 
life, we soon experience that familiar feeling of the overwhelming obstacles 
facing those who try to make a difference, or merely to live a decent life.  
</P>
<P>
 Aristarain touches upon that universal, highly contemporary sense that we are 
powerless to control our destinies. Yet in the face of such feelings, Mario 
realizes that he has discovered his "place in the world," and with it the 
belief that it's worth standing his ground -- even if that ground seems to be 
crumbling beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
 How refreshing it is to be in the company of such talented actors bringing to 
life people who are worth caring about. The film, which has an especially 
evocative score, is in particular another triumph for the handsome, 
silver-haired Luppi, who makes Mario a figure of unpretentious nobility. Most 
recently seen in the darkly humorous horror picture "Cronos," both he and 
Aristarain achieved international renown in 1981 with the scathing, compelling 
political allegory, "Time for Revenge."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; THE CUTTING EDGE IS GONE FROM BRAND NEW HEAVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brand New Heavies, very old grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the English band flirted with the cutting edge a couple of years ago 
on its second album, a round-robin collaboration with a host of rappers, the 
Brand New Heavies are partisans of natural, organic R&B.At the House of Blues 
on Monday they took the stage in classic deployment, the core group's bass and 
drums supported by keyboards and a live horn section. 
</P>
<P>
 They went on to demonstrate that while purity is fine, it's not enough. The 
Brand New Heavies have all the parts in place, from Sly to James Brown, but 
there's no inspiration or inner fire. The band doesn't bring much songwriting 
flair to the table, mainly coming up with pleasant, digestible product along 
the lines of the R&B hit "Never Stop." There are no evident efforts to expand 
the traditions they re-enact. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer N'Dea Davenport's vocals on record have some supple expressiveness, but 
in Monday's spotty sound mix she sounded anonymous on all but the softest 
ballads. The formless show kept stalling out whenever it got some momentum 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 The best moments were the more relaxed ones, where the music was able to 
stretch and breathe. When the band powered on all cylinders, it over-syncopated 
until the beats were minced beyond recognition.RICHARD CROMELIN

TV RATINGS; TWO ABC SERIES, FILM PROVE COMPETITION-BUSTERS

 ABC won the network ratings battle in prime time last week, thanks to the 
one-two punch of "Home Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire" and a strong showing 
by the theatrical film "Ghostbusters II," which drew the largest audience of 
any non-series. The 1989 comedy, with Bill Murray, attracted 20% of the 
available audience Sunday night, according to figures released Tuesday by the 
A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The first NFL game on Fox last Friday, an exhibition contest pitting the 
Denver Broncos against the San Francisco 49ers, was seen in about 6.1 million 
homes, compared to the 9.2 million that tuned in ABC's "Monday Night Football" 
earlier in the week between the Washington Redskins and Buffalo Bills. But Fox 
said its rating for the game was higher "than any NFL telecast this early in 
the season on either CBS or NBC over the past five years (1990-94)." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, meanwhile, saw viewership wane for the two summer series it had 
introduced the previous week. In its second outing, "One West Waikiki" drew 
about 76% of the audience that had watched the premiere, while "Hotel Malibu's" 
ratings were down about 18%.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
OFFICIALS ISSUE WARNING ON RATTLESNAKE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hikers and residents of hillside or canyon areas are being advised to take 
precautions because summer and fall are the height of rattlesnake season.  
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the weather is warm, the rattlesnakes get more active," said Bob 
Ballenger, spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has compiled a few suggestions for residents and hikers:  
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate food sources that are likely to attract snakes and clean up piles 
of grass clippings where mice could live.  
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce places where snakes can seek shelter by clearing shrubs and bushes 
and sealing any openings in or under structures.  
</P>
<P>
 * Build a snake-proof fence using heavy galvanized screening.  
</P>
<P>
 * Bury the screening at least three inches below the surface and have the 
fence at least three feet tall to seal off entry points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear loose trousers, not shorts, over hiking boots or high-topped shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 * Be able to identify the rattlesnake by its broad, triangular head, narrow 
neck and rattle on the tail. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy in Palmdale got bitten in the neck when he was going into his attic. 
That was a little freakish, but things like that happen," Ballenger said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to remind people to take precautions and to keep an eye out in 
general," he said.

WHERE IS THAT SUPER SCOOPER?; EXHAUSTED FIREFIGHTERS NEAR SAN LUIS OBISPO COULD 
HAVE USED THE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two days now almost 2,000 firefighters have struggled to contain a 
fast-moving brush fire that has burned more than 65 square miles along 
California's Central Coast, between Atascadero and San Luis Obispo. The second 
big blaze of California's 1994 fire season has also destroyed at least two 
dozen homes and other structures, a loss made even more painful by the fact it 
was started by arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Many factors in wildfires, like dry and windy weather, of course cannot be 
controlled, but government is far from powerless: It can improve firefighters' 
response time and equipment. The foremost tool for such improvement in 
California, experts say, would be the CL-415 "Super Scooper" -- an airplane 
designed to complement water-dropping helicopters. The amphibious craft can 
pick up 1,600 gallons of water at a time from an ocean or a lake and then dump 
it, often within minutes, on a wildfire. Many state legislators and others 
maintain that, at the least, California should test the CL-415. Gov. Pete 
Wilson, facing a huge budget deficit, has held back because of the cost: nearly 
$1 million to lease a single plane. To get around this financial roadblock, we 
have proposed that the state cooperate with the federal government so that the 
cost could be split among several Western states, all of which could use planes 
from a small fleet of Super Scoopers to fight forest or brush fires at one time 
or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the deployment of Super Scoopers have slowed, or even halted, a major 
blaze such as this latest one? We'll never know until the craft is given a full 
test in the rigors of a Western fire season -- like the one we now face.

AIDS WATCH; CLINICAL DEPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It speaks volumes about the world AIDS epidemic that the annual International 
Conference on AIDS will henceforth be held only every two years. There is 
simply not enough medical progress to warrant annual meetings.And that indeed 
was the depressing bottom line of the 10th conference, which ended last week in 
Yokohama, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants confronted the sobering reality that there is no vaccine, no 
cure, no effective treatment -- and that the epidemic is just reaching its 
explosive phase in Asia and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some glimmers of hope in Yokohama -- discussion of promising new 
antiviral drugs, of possible gene therapies to combat the AIDS-causing virus 
and of recent success in using the drug AZT to prevent the virus from passing 
to the fetuses of infected pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 And the new director of the American Office of AIDS Research, Dr. William E. 
Paul, announced that the U.S. government would boost its allocation for basic 
research on AIDS by 20% next year by diverting money from unpromising clinical 
tests of drugs and vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul also promised new AIDS research, an area shamefully neglected for 
political reasons by the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Still there was little hope any of this could soon help millions of infected 
people worldwide. As one blunt Canadian AIDS worker put it last week, "We're 
doing elegant molecular biology and nice clinical studies, and what we're doing 
is irrelevant for 95% of the infected population."

THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS NO TO DENIAL; MURAYAMA FACES THE WAR GUILT QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty-nine years after its surrender in World War II, Japan remains steeped in 
denial, torment and revisionism regarding its true role in that conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama became the latest official to express 
regret for Japan's war actions, seven of his Cabinet members ignored his 
suggestion that they forgo the annual -- and controversial -- visit to the 
Yasukuni Shrine to the war dead. There they heard the usual declarations that 
Japan's wartime aggression was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's inability to truly come to terms with its militaristic past continues 
to haunt the nation and disappoint its neighbors and allies. However, Murayama, 
should he survive in a time of revolving-door changes of Japanese prime 
ministers, plans to make 1995, the 50th anniversary of the war's end, a year 
for self-reflection and apology to Japan's victims. The task will be 
formidable; already debates and reflections have begun in newspapers and 
television broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama began his consciousness-raising on Monday by refusing to go to 
Yasukuni. At a separate, government-sponsored ceremony at Budokan Hall to honor 
Japan's war dead -- an event attended by the emperor -- Murayama declared that 
Japan had "inflicted tragic sacrifices beyond description upon large numbers of 
people in Asia and other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed grief and deep self-reflection and added, "We must repent for our 
own history and tell younger generations about the wretchedness of war and 
numerous precious sacrifices caused by the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Educating the Japanese public is itself a monumental task. Generations of 
postwar Japanese have virtually no objective knowledge about Japan's aggression 
in Asia because government-sanctioned textbooks simply ignore much of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse are the politicians who persist in whitewashing Japan's brutal 
past. Just last Sunday Environment Minister Shin Sakurai was forced to resign 
from the Cabinet for declaring that Japan did not go to war with the idea of 
committing aggression in Asia. In May another Cabinet member, Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano, was forced to resign for saying that Japan went to war to free 
Asian nations from Western colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the government failed to pass a resolution of remorse to mark 
the 50th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. Murayama, the first 
Socialist prime minister in 46 years, wants Parliament to pass such a 
resolution to mark the 50th year of Japan's surrender. A year of 
self-reflection should lead at the very least to objective evaluation in Japan 
of its war guilt.

HOUSE DEFEAT OF CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The failure of the House of Representatives to take a meaningful vote on the 
crime bill is not a blow to President Clinton, as stated in your headline "Vote 
on Crime Bill Is Blocked; Major Setback for Clinton" (Aug. 12). He is 
guaranteed personal security for life. It's a blow to the American public and 
is another knock against the credibility of the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it incredible that the most important issue to the American public, 
crime prevention, gets mired in special-interest scare tactics and procedural 
ploys to not take a vote on this critical issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the bill perfect? Certainly not. But at least it would put more officers 
on the street and increase prison capacity while we try and address the root 
societal causes of rampant crime. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE GERHARDT 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * It's time for President Clinton to stop whining about the National Rifle 
Assn. and the Republicans and tell the truth. The crime bill fizzled because 
the President lost 58 votes in his own party. The Democrats control the Senate 
and the House. The Republicans don't have enough votes to block anything the 
Democrats want to pass. Perhaps the Democrats also saw the folly in supporting 
a bill with $9 billion in new social spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Write a more simple bill that adds police, is tough on criminals, builds 
prisons and does not seek to make villains of 70 million law-abiding gun 
owners. Then we may yet see strong bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL COONEY 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 * The majority of Americans wanted Clinton's new tough crime bill to pass. 
Living here in Orange County, the likes of Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), and egotists who try to explain their no votes on the bill as being for 
the taxpaying public's benefit need their heads and their wallets examined. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is special-interest groups like the National Rifle Assn. 
lining the pockets of Republican and Democratic politicians' campaign funds at 
election time. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is nonpartisan and I believe we'll be seeing a lot of replaced and 
shocked politicians at voting time -- one thing special interests won't be 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 JOAN L. WILDER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Hooray! To all the Republicans and some of the Democrats who had the courage 
to stand up and defeat the crime bill. It is reflective of the typical 
lard-laden legislation for which the Democrats are famous. We don't need 
midnight basketball, ballet lessons, or Rep. Jack Brooks' (D-Tex.) alma mater 
to solve our crime problems -- just a tough crime bill with no pork or election 
year goodies. This fiasco is but another example of Bill Clinton's weak, 
ineffectual leadership, and the Democratic Party's attempt to cash in on an 
issue which the public considers important. Happy filibustering on the 
health-care issue! 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN PALAZZINI 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Let the record reflect that when it comes to fighting crime, only 11 House 
Republicans were for the crime bill and 167 were against it. In the perverse 
culture of Washington politics and pack journalism, this will undoubtedly be 
portrayed as a defeat for Clinton and the Democrats! It is a sad commentary 
when the defeated party that supported the crime bill is heaped with scorn and 
ridicule in the press, while the party that opposed it is ignored in "victory." 
On an issue that most Americans say is their No. 1 priority, the press coverage 
has been shoddy and shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE GORDON 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 * I would like to thank and commend Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) for 
voting against the huge, unconstitutional, excessive, pork-laden anti-crime 
bill. The bill itself was a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I found that there were many things in the bill that I opposed, the 
pork-barrel spending, the Draconian use of the death penalty, the assault rifle 
ban and overall the increased practice of federalizing law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few years since the 1960s the federal government has taken more and more 
control over local law enforcement, while at the same time attacking the 
Constitution in the name of public order. In spite of massive increases in 
federal involvement in law enforcement, we have seen no improvement in public 
safety. In fact, we have seen our streets get more dangerous, and our local law 
enforcement becoming unaccountable to the people it is supposed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 I thank Rep. Waters for putting common sense, constitutional rights and we the 
people before party loyalty, political correctness and special-interest 
politics.

 Rabin's efforts for peace will depend more on the people of Israel than what 
we American Jews feel or wish. Living as we do in a democratic society, pledged 
to equal opportunity and treatment for all who live in our land, our commitment 
has to be toward a society in Israel and elsewhere that allows greater freedom 
from tyrants who rule by force, and use terror to quell opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 On the same day as Baldwin's letter, the Commentary page featured George 
McGovern's piece on ways and means to make Israel's "full-flowering peace . . . 
bud." He called for means to "(bolster) moderates and (undercut) extremists" by 
"promot(ing) peace, economic development and political participation in the 
region." McGovern underscores the "root causes (for extremism): poverty, 
corruption and repression." 
</P>
<P>
 An acceptable peace is the best answer for an end to wars, and hopefully, in 
that peace, causes of conflict can be removed, and an era of peace come to all 
the inhabitants.

KOREAN SECURITY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish to clarify some misperceptions presented in a July 27 editorial, "Seoul 
Needs to Lighten Up." The Korean Peninsula has been the recipient of intense 
and occasionally sensationalistic coverage over the last 18 months regarding 
the North Korean nuclear issue, the recent death of North Korean President Kim 
Il Sung and the succession of Kim Jong Il.However, an important element was 
often missing in this coverage -- that being the perceptions and policies of 
the South Korean people and their government. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Security Law, enacted by the South Korean government and clearly 
understood by dissidents, publishers and leftist students alike, was still in 
effect at the time of Kim Il Sung's death. Certain individuals and radical 
students influenced and/or directed by North Korea choose to deliberately defy 
these regulations. Their efforts, whether they be violent or nonviolent, are 
designed to destabilize our democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea is engaged in ongoing dialogues with North Korea on many important 
issues. Korean citizens at home and abroad are regularly granted permission by 
South Korea to make personal trips to North Korea to visit relatives. Only 
those few who intentionally violate the law are subject to arrest and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 We must enforce laws passed by our democratic institutions that are designed 
to preserve a stable and democratic society.

TRUST, RESPECT LOYALTY -- FOR FANS AS WELL AS FOR ART; TELEVISION: AN ACTOR WHO 
MAKES IT BIG IN ONE SEASON FEELS FREE TO FOLLOW BIGGER BUCKS. SOUNDS LIKE 
BASEBALL, DOESN'T IT? 
</P>

<P>
 Foolish as it is to confuse great characters with the actors who play them, I 
was shocked and angered by news reports that David Caruso wants out from his 
co-starring role as Detective John Kelly in "NYPD Blue." Kelly wouldn't do a 
thing like that, I caught myself thinking; he would never betray a trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust? Why bring such exalted language to bear on commercial television, where 
cop shows come and go and contracts are routinely broken? Because "NYPD Blue" 
is a show apart. After only one season on the air, this complex and often 
stirring series has set new standards of excellence for the medium; all those 
recent Emmy nominations, including Caruso's, were richly deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Caruso never signed up for standard-setting. Maybe he was only looking 
for a good part that would put his face on the screen, a fat paycheck in his 
pocket and residuals in his mailbox down the road. What he got, though, was 
something that American performers rarely dream of any more: a starring role, 
as a Chandleresque knight of honor, in a show that trusts its actors -- along 
with its writers and directors -- to work as the artists they once set out to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not, evidently, enough. Caruso's eye, or so we're told, is on the 
richer prize of feature films. Having already earned $1 million for his efforts 
in the upcoming movie "Kiss of Death," he sees more where that came from. Thus 
Caruso has begun to make the noises that TV stars often make when they feel 
constrained by contracts they once signed, before stardom, with great eagerness 
and gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gossip columns have it right -- and when, in the era of O.J. Simpson, 
have they gotten anything wrong? -- Detective John Kelly will be history 
shortly after "NYPD Blue" starts its second season. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be used to such behavior. Last week, after all, baseball fans were 
disabused of sentimental notions about any debts of loyalty that players and 
owners might owe to the game. It's just a business like any other, the fans 
have been told, one that operates according to business rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I can't get it through my head that loyalty has been canceled, in our 
culture, like a TV dud that fails to pull in the ratings. I don't want to get 
it through my head that an actor like David Caruso owes no more than a single 
season to the show, and to the audience, that made him famous. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of trust extends to people like me, loyal members of that audience. 
I know that actors aren't the characters they play -- I was a movie critic for 
many years -- and I'm not denying Caruso's right to move on, once he's given 
two or three seasons to his character. But thanks to scores of wonderful scenes 
that he's been a part of, I've come to believe in the quirky probity of John 
Kelly, just as I believe in the importance of rare triumphs like "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of those scenes, which happened to turn up in last week's rerun, Kelly 
commends a murder witness who has come forward at great risk to his own career. 
"And you know what?" he says. "It's the right thing to do. Somebody has to 
represent the dead here." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Caruso's reading is restrained and entirely believable. But leaving 
the show at this point is the wrong thing to do. Somebody has to represent the 
public here.

A 'FAIR' VOTE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 100% PURE; MEXICO: IF THE OVERALL CONDUCT OF 
SUNDAY'S ELECTION IS HONEST, AND IF ALL PARTIES RESPECT THE LAW, THE OUTCOME 
SHOULD SATISFY DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEODORE C. SORENSEN, Theodore C. Sorensen practices international law in 
New York City. This article is based on a study he conducted for Mexico's 
Business Coordinating Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recognizing that another tainted and suspect election would undermine hopes 
for domestic harmony and international investment, Mexico has installed a new 
unmatched system of electoral safeguards. Measured against the generally 
accepted international standards endorsed by international bodies and election 
observer teams, the long-overdue reforms provide solid hope for a free, fair 
and honest election on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 No system on the books is better than its actual implementation on election 
day; but Mexico's nonpartisan election administrators now have the tools to 
assure compliance, under the watchful eyes of the first international observers 
in the country's history. No doubt, cries of fraud or coercion will still 
emanate from the losing side, whatever the outcome and integrity of the 
election. But the double, triple and quadruple checks and balances built into 
the new system at great expense -- such as photo identity cards, thumb stains, 
computerized voter rolls and other guards against multiple voting -- appear 
likely to prevent most attempts at manipulating the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Mexican electoral system is not perfect. The inherent advantages 
enjoyed by incumbent political parties everywhere have been limited but not 
eliminated. Equal and impartial media coverage of all nine parties -- in terms 
of quality as well as quantity -- has been unrealistically mandated and, not 
surprisingly, unachieved. Sharply reduced caps on campaign spending are neither 
low enough to equalize the strong and the weak nor subject to timely audit. 
Scattered reports of voter and poll watcher harassment continue. 
</P>
<P>
 But perfection is not required. Irregularities, inadequacies and isolated 
incidents that could not offset enough votes to alter the outcome do not 
invalidate an election under international standards. In the United States, 
courts have been reluctant to overturn election results in the absence of 
systemic fraud or intimidation so flagrant as to cast doubt on the electorate's 
true choice. In South Africa, widespread abuses were deemed insufficient to 
challenge the finding of a "substantially" free and fair election. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuses should not be tolerated. Mexico now has an independent special 
prosecutor and a new list of electoral criminal statutes to enforce, an appeals 
tribunal empowered to annul victories and a multilevel election administration 
controlled for the first time by unaffiliated private citizens. For Sunday's 
election to be accepted as legitimate, all of these agencies must evenhandedly 
apply the law. 
</P>
<P>
 A good-faith effort to pursue wrongdoers and correct the system's remaining 
flaws, even if only partially successful, goes a long way toward satisfying the 
world community. (International observers were impressed when South Africa, for 
example, seeing certain constituencies face disenfranchisement because of 
voting station inadequacies, promptly extended the voting period in those 
areas.) Under the customary international observer guidelines, shortcomings are 
measured not in isolated and absolute terms but in the light of the entire 
system's overall design and efficacy and in comparison with past practices. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep cynicism regarding Mexico's past practices will keep some skeptics 
unconvinced unless and until the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
loses. The PRI's 65 years in power do in fact give its fund-raisers and 
canvassers a competitive advantage. But a string of successes is no more proof 
of an unfair election in Mexico than in, for example, the state of Georgia, 
which has known only Democratic governors for more than 100 years. The 
legitimacy of any election is determined not by history, good or bad, but by 
the will of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics in Mexico today remains a culture of mistrust. Despite their 
extraordinary collaboration in formulating the new electoral reforms, Mexico's 
major parties and concerned non-governmental organizations remain suspicious of 
each other's intentions. All agreed in recent conversations with me, however, 
that Sunday presents a critical test. If the conduct of this election enables a 
consensus of voters, observers and party leaders, winners and losers alike, to 
promptly and responsibly accept the outcome as a credible reflection of the 
true will of the people, then Mexico can look forward to democratic 
tranquillity and prosperity. But if the new reforms fail to produce that 
consensus, the outlook for America's most populous neighbor would be 
justifiably gloomy. The United States will be watching with hope and concern. 
Fortunately, with the safeguards now in place, there is every reason for hope.

ON HEALTH CARE, A MATTER OF TRUST; THE CANADIAN-STYLE PLAN PROPOSED FOR 
CALIFORNIA PROMISES HEALTH SECURITY, BUT INCLUDES JOB LOSSES AND MORE TAXATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADELA de la TORRE, Adela de la Torre is an economist at Cal State Long 
Beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Congress hammers out its final version of health-care reform, the 
bipartisan compromise legislation is moving away from radical changes to the 
current system. As Congress pushes incremental approaches, the focus is on 
meaningful reform and phase-in strategies to meet President Clinton's goal of 
universal coverage. The moderate view in Congress may reflect the general shift 
noted in the recent Times Mirror poll that shows public support for employer 
mandates waning even though the desire for universal coverage remains strong. 
Oddly, as the pendulum swings to the right in Congress, Californians are 
swinging left as they open their debate on the single-payer model for health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that the state has looked at Canadian-style 
health-care financing. Since 1990, consumer and physician advocate groups have 
supported state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) in his attempt to get a 
single-payer system through the Legislature. But even though supporters of the 
single-payer system were able to muster a majority in both the Senate and the 
Assembly, they were not able to get the required two-thirds vote to pass the 
legislation. So, Glen Schneider, campaign manager for Californians for Health 
Security, said, "It was time to place the single-payer model directly in front 
of the California voters in November." 
</P>
<P>
 Comprehensive benefits are proposed under the California Health Security 
initiative: preventive services, including dental and psychological care, 
prescription drugs and long-term care. It will keep the familiar private 
fee-for-service system intact, giving physicians greater control in the 
delivery of services as well as maintaining existing health-maintenance 
organizations such as the Kaiser Foundation. Ultimately, whether a 
fee-for-service provider or an HMO will survive in this new financing scheme 
will be determined by consumer assessment of quality of care. In addition, the 
new system promises to eliminate insurance forms. Advocates of the single-payer 
system believe that if government can efficiently process millions of tax 
returns, it certainly should be able to pay health providers with equal 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 As ideal as these benefits sound, they come with costs. The costs do not 
exceed the present costs that we pay for our private and public system, but do 
require everyone to contribute their fair share toward universal and 
comprehensive coverage. The cost of providing universal coverage for all 
Californians will be about $100 billion. More than half of the revenue would 
come directly from government programs such as Medicare and Medi-Cal. The rest 
would be generated by eliminating employer-based premiums and using a payroll 
tax on employers, a flat 2.5% income tax, a 2.5% surtax on those who make 
incomes above $250,000 for individual returns and $500,000 for joint returns 
and a $1-per-pack tobacco tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes alone may frighten many voters away from supporting the initiative 
unless they realize that the risk of no coverage or inadequate coverage is 
potentially more devastating. Other issues will be the windfall savings large 
employers will receive when they no longer pay health-insurance premiums and 
whether they will use it to create more jobs. For small and medium employers 
who have never provided health insurance, the new payroll-tax requirement will 
create fertile ground for opponents to argue that layoffs are inevitable. 
Proponents of the initiative agree that there will be an employment impact on 
the 50,000-plus private health-insurance employees who will be displaced by the 
new public system.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that the campaign faces an uphill battle in persuading 
voters to accept higher taxes as well as potential job loss. Yet dwarfing these 
issues is persuading the public that government can be trusted to provide these 
services. Thus far, supporters have built their government efficiency argument 
on scapegoating the private health-insurance industry. Fraud and waste 
certainly exist in the private sector, but government-run agencies are 
definitely not immune from such practices. Furthermore, Americans do not share 
the Canadians' history of trusting government or placing individual rights 
subordinate to the collective good. Unless voters can be persuaded that 
government really works for them, the single-payer initiative will face the 
same fate of any other tax-and-spend proposal come November.

PERSPECTIVE ON PERSECUTION; NASRIN: A POLITICAL WOMAN-HUNT; A BANGLADESHI 
WRITER, DEMONIZED BY ISLAMIC FANATICS, IS CHARGED WITH 'BLASPHEMY' IN ORDER TO 
DIVERT THE OPPRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SONTAG, Susan Sontag's most recent book is The Volcano Lover (Farrar, 
Straus & Giroux, 1992). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taslima Nasrin, a Bangladeshi author threatened with assassination by zealots 
for comments perceived to be anti-Islamic, fled to Sweden last week after being 
officially charged in Bangladesh with offending Muslims. Novelist and critic 
Susan Sontag addresses a letter to Nasrin in exile. Your case, if that's the 
right word, has often been cited as a new example of the far-reaching, 
implacable judgment that has obliged Salman Rushdie to live in Britain under 
armed guard, constantly moving from one clandestine residence to another, for 
the past five years. Salman Rushdie wrote a novel, "The Satanic Verses," and 
one of the reviews was a death sentence. Last year you wrote a novel, "Lajja" 
("Shame"), which was first published in your country, then swiftly banned; and 
after the banning came the calls to prosecute you for blasphemy, the penalty 
for which is death. 
</P>
<P>
 There is of course the difference that you have been persecuted and menaced by 
political forces in the country of which you are a citizen, while the British 
citizen Salman Rushdie was first sentenced to death in a country with which he 
had no connection, Iran. But it is the same charge: "blasphemy" or, in more 
secular language, that a writer has "offended" the feelings of believers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another element in your situation that I can't help being 
sensitive to, since I am not only a fellow writer but belong to the same half 
of the human race as you. You are not only being judged as a writer. You are 
being judged as a woman. You are part of a noble tradition of women in the 
Islamic world of the 20th Century. Perhaps the senior figure is the Egyptian 
writer (and, like yourself, physician), Nawal El Saadawi, who for decades has 
been writing books that denounce the exploitation and oppression of women. 
There is, if I may put it this way, nothing original in the demands you are 
making. And this is all to your credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, your ordeal is not about reactions to a book. It is not even about 
religion. What has happened to Salman Rushdie and to you -- and to other 
less-well-publicized instances of the persecution and murder of writers and 
journalists in Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Iraq and many other countries -- is 
about politics. Your persecution is an instrument of concrete political 
struggles taking place now in Bangladesh, where so many forms of oppression and 
economic misery are rife. But the political factions that have put your life at 
risk are indeed similar to the political factions in various countries that 
continue to send hit teams to Britain to kill Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
 In modern mass politics, masses need to be "mobilized," and the way this is 
done is with easy, obfuscating slogans. The demonization of individuals, in 
witch hunts and show trials, is a cheap way to encapsulate the power and appeal 
of repressive activism. And the signature element of a repressive society (or 
the degree of oppression in a society) is the oppression of women. Those who 
persecute you are political opportunists -- manipulating an idea of "blasphemy" 
to distract oppressed people, men and women both, from understanding what is 
persecuting and exploiting them. 
</P>
<P>
 You did not ask for a revision of the Koran -- as you were charged with doing. 
(The charge is grotesque, of course. What could it mean to "revise" the 
founding book of a great religion?) What you did was to recommend certain 
revisions in the Sharia, a body of laws codifying custom and practice that have 
developed over centuries, and like all bodies of law, is subject to revision 
and reform. As it happens, the charge of blasphemy brought against you is 
absurd -- though I would want to defend you even if you could be correctly 
described as a blasphemer. Needless to say, I support your cause for a reform 
of the Sharia. That is, I support your demands for freedom for the half of the 
human race to which we both belong. Bangladesh cannot begin to be a just 
society, for both women and men, until the situation of women there improves. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened to you is not just another instance of highly developed 
20th-Century tradition of persecuting dissident writers. It is as well a 
woman-hunt. As in the witch hunts that took place for centuries in Europe, the 
target in many Islamic countries has become, above all, women -- women who are 
not meek and servile, women who dare speak out, women who are (or seem) 
different. In your name, all women, as well as all writers who dare to think 
independently, are being persecuted.

 Krimsky, deputy secretary general and chief fund-raiser who has been with the 
USOC since 1986, was picked for the interim post in a conference call of the 
committee's executive board. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Oct. 1, he takes over for Harvey Schiller, who is leaving the USOC's 
top operating post to become president of Turner Sports in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel to find a permanent successor for Schiller will be appointed by Sept. 
16, but there is no deadline for filling the job, according to USOC President 
LeRoy Walker.

FAMILY; BRUM TAKES VIEWERS ON A FEEL-GOOD TOUR

 If your TV-watching tyke can't get enough "Barney" or "Thomas the Tank 
Engine"-type feel-good fare, don't miss a sunny new series of live-action home 
videos from Random House about the adventures of an adorable miniature '20s 
touring car named Brum. (As in "brum, brum," universal kid language for car 
sounds.) 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four videos in the series -- "Brum to the Rescue," "Brum and the 
Little Girl Lost," "Brum and the Bank Robbers" and "Brum and the Baby Carriage" 
-- includes three stories and an accompanying paper model of Brum to punch out 
and put together. (Mom or Dad will probably be volunteered for this job.) 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of these British imports are their charm: The only voice heard 
is a narrator's as the child-sized Brum toodles off from its home in an antique 
automobile museum to explore the "big town" and meets and helps various friends 
along the way, rescuing dollies and lost puppies and thwarting thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentle, sweet videos have a storybook feel and all the endings are, of 
course, happily-ever-after.

 Positive Thinking: OK. Let's forget about what's wrong with Los Angeles and 
concentrate on what's right. Friends of the Junior Arts Center, a nonprofit 
arts education organization, is inviting children ages 5 through 17 to "Imagine 
a Great City . . . What I Love About L.A." through original drawings, 
paintings, photography, collage, ceramics, film or video for the center's 
second annual "Billboard Project" competition.

 Four finalists will have their artwork reproduced into full-color billboards

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; LEA CHOOSES TO STEER CAREER ON ANOTHER COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Lea felt his dream slipping away, so last year he went sliding after it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea was an aerospace engineer who wished he could make his living on the golf 
course. That didn't exactly make him unique, but his next move did. 
</P>
<P>
 He quit his job at Loral Aeronutronic in Newport Beach in May 1993 and 
dedicated himself full time to a career in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea had picked up the game relatively late in life -- he started playing as a 
freshman at UC San Diego and by the time he was a senior was an honorable 
mention NCAA Division III All-American in 1985 -- and he wondered how far his 
talent could carry him. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought up the topic often, until finally his wife, Darla, forced his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day she turned to me and said, 'You're getting old, either you do it 
right now or you'll never get another chance,' " Lea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lea jumped at the chance. A few months later he quit his job of 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making pretty decent money," Lea said. "I just wasn't happy, that was 
the bottom line. I'm a lot happier now but we're not as liquid -- I guess 
that's a good word for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leas get by on Darla's salary from her job at Ford Motor Co. in Anaheim. 
Lea works part time at the Tustin Ranch Golf Course near the couple's home and 
at a local golf shop, but most of his time is spent practicing and playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a living by playing golf is a daunting task. The purses offered by the 
Golden State Tour are less than hefty and the competition is fierce. Lea plans 
to remain an amateur -- currently he is the top-ranked amateur on the Golden 
State Tour -- until that status is costing him money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where it's going from here," he said. "You can't really plan 
ahead. You can't say I'm going to turn pro and go to tour school. You never 
know what might happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lea, 31, has had some encouraging results recently. He has won four Golden 
State Tour amateur events, finished fourth in the Los Angeles City Amateur and 
fifth in the Long Beach Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 But those pale in comparison to the opportunity he'll have next week: the U.S. 
Amateur in Ponte Vedra, Fla. Lea qualified for the U.S. Amateur by shooting 
one-over-par 145 in two rounds at Western Hills earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other local players also qualified: Tiger Woods of Cypress, Kevin 
Claborn of Brea and Scott Gibson of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob May's rookie season on the PGA Tour has been a rough one. He has made only 
three cuts in 23 tournaments and has won slightly over $21,000, putting him 
near the bottom of the Tour's money-winner list. 
</P>
<P>
 But May says his results aren't as bad as they seem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year really hasn't gone as bad as it appears because I've missed 12 cuts 
by one shot," said May, who grew up in La Habra. "It's not like I'm playing 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 May entered the Tour with high expectations. He finished fourth on the Nike 
Tour money list with $132,656. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd play very well this year," said May, 25. "Things just haven't 
turned out the way I've planned. But if you look at it, there are few players 
that have come right out of college or another tour and played really well in 
their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of golf. You have to take the good with the bad. Last year I had a 
year that was very good. This might be a setback that will be a good learning 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't want to have to learn things the way I'm learning them, but 
it's just a part of life on the Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 May made the cut in his second tournament, the Northern Telecom Open in 
January in Tucson, Ariz., and finished in a tie for 63rd. 
</P>
<P>
 He then he went 0 for February, March, April and May, missing the cut in 12 
consecutive tournaments. He broke through in June, finishing in a tie for 18th 
in the Kemper Open in Maryland and a tie for 65th at the Buick Classic in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then May hasn't made a cut in eight tournaments, including a Nike Tour 
event last week in Springfield, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his struggles, May says he has maintained faith in his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you can do is learn from it," said May, who lives in Las Vegas 
with his wife, Brenda. "In golf you have to turn negatives into positives 
because if you dwell on negatives too much, it will kill you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows you that things won't always go your way."

LITTLE LEAGUE WESTERN REGIONAL; DUNLAP POWERS NORTHRIDGE, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Power scored a big victory over finesse Tuesday night at the Little League 
Western Regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap outdueled Schafer Magana to give Northridge a 3-1 victory 
over Taylorsville, Utah, before 8,200 and a berth in the final of the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (16-0, 4-0 in regional play), the only unbeaten team left, will 
play the team that emerges from the loser's bracket Friday at 5:30 p.m. A 
victory will send Northridge to the World Series in Williamsport, Pa. A defeat 
would force a second game 30 minutes after the end of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, a 5-foot-11 right-hander, used a dominant fastball to hold Utah (9-1, 
3-1) to two hits. He struck out eight and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Magana, a 4-10 right-hander, relied on a slow curve that baffled Northridge. 
He struck out seven and allowed five hits, all singles. 
</P>
<P>
 But constantly throwing a curve in Little League has more than the obvious 
drawback of placing undue strain on a 12-year-old arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't depend on his curve with runners on base because anything in the 
dirt allows the runners to move up," said Matt Cunningham, the Northridge 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet depend on the curve Magana did, throwing 67 curves among 91 total pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of them rolled past catcher Paul Buck with runners on base, and two 
Northridge runs scored on wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Frost scored the first Northridge run in the third inning on a wild 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The run appeared to be all Dunlap might need as he allowed only one baserunner 
through 4 1/3 innings. However, an error, a single and two walks tied the score 
and left the bases loaded with one out in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap pitched out of it, jamming Cody Gray with a fastball that was popped up 
to second baseman Justin Gentile, who fired to Gregg Wallis at third to double 
off Mike Lewis and end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored twice in the bottom of the inning to put the game away.  
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tuber walked, and pinch-runner Michael Nesbit advanced to second and 
third on wild pitches. Nesbit scored when Gentile reached first on a throwing 
error by third baseman Chris Mower. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile eventually scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good the whole way," Dunlap said. "The umpire squeezed the strike zone 
in the fifth, but I never lost confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge undoubtedly will be oozing confidence Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling real good," Frost said. "This was supposed to be the toughest 
game."

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; THESE FANS GO ALL OUT TO EARN A PERMANENT 
SPOT NEAR TRACK

 Horse tales: 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of Harry Tendler, the 85-year-old press box steward at Gulfstream 
Park, died earlier this year. Janice Tendler's ashes were scattered in the 
track winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to go out a winner, because that's what she was," Tendler said. 
"She left the instructions in her will. I've got the same instructions in my 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that uncommon for horsemen and racing fans to request that their 
ashes be spread over a racetrack. The ashes of Eric Guerin, the Hall of Fame 
jockey, were scattered at Calder Race Course, not far from Gulfstream, last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 At one track in the Midwest, there have been numerous requests for funeral 
services accompanied by a scattering of the deceased's ashes. So many requests, 
in fact, that the track superintendent noticed that some of the ashes were 
blowing onto the turf course, killing the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still do the services, but there's been one change," the superintendent 
said. "We simulate the ashes with regular dirt, so we can protect the turf 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked where the real ashes go, he said: "We dump them about a mile from here, 
on the highway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, jockey Sammy Renick became one of the first racing 
telecasters, and in the late 1950s he came to California to play a small part 
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was called "Wind Across the Everglades," and there could hardly have 
been a more diverse cast. Besides Renick there were Burl Ives, Christopher 
Plummer, Gypsy Rose Lee, Two Ton Tony Galento, Emmett Kelly, MacKinlay Kantor 
and Peter Falk, making his film debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before production started, Budd Schulberg, who wrote and directed 
the film, happened across Renick in the studio barber shop, about to get his 
goatee shaved off. Schulberg believed that the short beard fit Renick 
perfectly, and argued that Renick should keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left it on," Renick said. "They paid me an extra $200 a day not to get it 
shaved off." 
</P>
<P>
 Renick's big scene was a mud-bath fight with Galento, the former heavyweight 
who outweighed him by more than 2 to 1. At the end of the fight, Galento was 
supposed to pick up Renick and throw him to the left of the camera. Off camera, 
a 6-foot-5 weightlifter-type would catch Renick. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Galento lifted Renick and heaved him to the right by mistake. Renick 
bounced off of a fence, crumpled to the ground and came up cursing. "You . . 
.," he said to Galento. "Why the hell didn't you throw me where you were 
supposed to?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeez," Galento stammered. "I never could tell my left from my right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well you sure knew the difference when you were getting hit by Joe Louis," 
Renick said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1987, Bet Twice and No More Flowers, a couple of 3-year-olds 
who had been battling in Florida, were being flown to Lexington, Ky., for their 
final Kentucky Derby prep races. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Alter, the trainer of No More Flowers, was unaccountably tardy. Tex 
Sutton, whose company had arranged the charter, fumed as two hours passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a van pulled up with No More Flowers, a second Alter horse, a 14-foot 
sofa, a table and chair and 21 large sacks of feed. But no Alter. The 
instructions were to load all of this on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy could buy the same stuff in Kentucky," said one of the loaders of the 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton concluded that the plane was too crowded and too heavy. Out came the 
furniture and the plane left with Alter's things sitting on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when Chick Lang was general manager of Pimlico, trainer Bryan Webb 
and a female friend visited Lang in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman had one of those big draw-string purses," Lang said. "She turned it 
upside down on my desk and money kept falling out." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb asked Lang if he would keep the cash in the track's safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't trust myself (betting) with all that money," Webb said. "No matter 
what, don't give it to me until the meet's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang was reluctant to be Webb's private banker, but finally agreed to secure 
the money. They counted it, about $27,000, mostly in small denominations, and 
packaged it in envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got this to get me through," said Webb, pulling a small bankroll from 
his pants pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days later, Webb came back to Lang, asking for the money in the 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not giving it to you," Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I need it, Chick," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care," Lang said. "We made a deal, and I'm not giving it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, Chick." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing doing, Bryan." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chick. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir. It stays in the safe." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's where it stayed until the meet ended. Webb never used Lang as a 
banker again.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; SEEKING MANN WITH PASS-RUSH ABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to upgrade their pass rush, the Rams on Tuesday worked out four-time 
Pro Bowl defensive end Charles Mann, who is coming off two arthroscopic knee 
surgeries in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Vice President Jay Zygmunt is awaiting final results of Mann's physical 
and plans to begin negotiations with Mann's agent, Jack Wirth of Chicago, 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, an 11-year pro who played in three Super Bowls with the Washington 
Redskins, has worked out for Philadelphia, Houston, San Francisco and the New 
York Jets, with the Oilers and 49ers showing the most interest. A source close 
to the situation said if Mann could not strike a deal soon, he planned to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Mann rejected a one-year deal worth the league-minimum 
$162,000 from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was ridiculous," he said. "I want to play every down, and I should be 
compensated accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have viewed their defensive line -- featuring Pro Bowl tackle Sean 
Gilbert and free-agent acquisition Jimmie Jones -- as one of the strengths of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, 6 feet 6 and 270 pounds, would be an insurance policy for Rams' starting 
defensive end Fred Stokes, who is rehabilitating a knee ligament he strained in 
training camp 2 1/2 weeks ago. Signing Mann would give the Rams six defensive 
ends -- starters Robert Young and Gerald Robinson, rookie Brad Ottis, Kevin 
Patrick and Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann has undergone nine knee operations in his career, including arthroscopic 
surgery on his left knee early last season. He re-injured it after trying to 
come back three weeks after surgery, and it was operated on again in February.  
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins released Mann in April after the injuries had reduced his 
productivity. He had only four sacks in the past two seasons after 78 in his 
first nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My knee is about 95% right now," Mann said. "But after a couple practices, 
I'll be at 100%. I'm here showing them I have the p-word -- potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann also suffered another injury over the weekend, having burned a portion of 
his face while using a gas grill over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is getting tired of having me home," Mann said. "And maybe if I 
wasn't home, I wouldn't burn myself on the grill." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Have tight ends Troy Drayton and Travis McNeal become forgotten men in the 
Rams' offense? Not so, says offensive coordinator Chick Harris, despite the 
fact that through two exhibition games, the top two tight ends have yet to 
catch a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, they haven't caught a ball, but there have been plays designed to go to 
them," Harris said. "Sometimes the reads have taken them someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all intentions in the world to get the ball to the tight end. 
We've even said, 'Zero in on the tight end.' But if a (defender) is standing 
between him and the quarterback, I'm not going to throw him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Harris been disappointed in the play of Drayton, a second-round draft pick 
last year who complained of being ignored in Ernie Zampese's system last year?  
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been disappointed at all," Harris said. "All last week, Troy caught 
more balls in practice than he has ever caught here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In games, we've been knocked off schedule numerous times so far, whether it 
has been a penalty or something malfunctioned where we haven't been able to 
stay on schedule on first downs." 
</P>
<P>

 Assistant head coach Joe Vitt said the Rams will continue looking at veteran 
free agents, but the team is not interested in Chuck Cecil, the hard-hitting 
safety who was released Monday by the Arizona Cardinals. "One of the things we 
feel very, very good about right now is the safety position," he said. "We have 
five safeties who are improving and making plays." . . . Left guard Bill 
Schultz practiced with the first-string Tuesday, a day after Chuck Belin 
replaced longtime starter Tom Newberry at the position. . . . Starting strong 
safety Deral Boykin, who hurt his neck in a one-car accident early Monday 
morning in Anaheim Hills, was seen wearing a neck brace after Tuesday's 
practice. Boykin sat out practice but is expected to return today, Coach Chuck 
Knox said. Also sitting out practice were tailback David Lang (knee, 
hamstring), tailback Johnny Bailey (ankle) and receiver Jermaine Ross 
(hamstring). MIKE REILLEY

 SCAMS: Con games have been around forever, but the January earthquake seems to 
have attracted a whole new generation of scam artists. . . . The elderly, who 
may be isolated and often have large savings accounts, are among the most 
vulnerable, officials say. Today's Valley Briefing (B14) examines common 
rip-offs and how to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
 HE'LL OVERCOME: A local NAACP official doubts that Executive Director Benjamin 
F. Chavis Jr. is on the verge of losing his job. . . . Chavis used NAACP money 
to settle a sex discrimination suit against him. But the Rev. Zedar E. 
Broadous, head of the NAACP's Valley branch, says Chavis won't be ousted 
because "as far as I know, there has been no intent to defraud the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 HEAT: With five adults at home, one baby and zero air conditioners, no wonder 
Jackie Ford (above) prayed for rain Tuesday. Wouldn't you? Ford, like so many 
others, went to a Valley mall to escape triple-digit temperatures (A1, B2). . . 
. "There were hordes of people," said Fallbrook Mall manager Eric Knudson. 
Another concern: electric bills and people who might be unable to pay them 
(D1). 
</P>
<P>
 STATUS QUO: Valley housing prices are so low these days that even though the 
Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point Tuesday (A1), 
only first-time home buyers should be affected. . . . Jim Link, executive vice 
president of the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors, says "housing prices 
are still fairly soft." In fact, the July median sales price of a single-family 
house was down 5% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 AUCTION: Speaking of real estate, here's your chance to own a little chunk of 
Valley history. Make that a big chunk. It's the 7,170-square-foot Calabasas 
property that once belonged to Kitty and Jose Menendez. Next month, it goes up 
for auction. . . . Realtor Bernie Uechtritz says he was tired of low offers. He 
expects it will sell for at least $1.5 million. Michael Arkush

 TITLED FRESHMAN: Charlotte Anne Lopez of Vermont has become one of the most 
celebrated teens ever to hold the title of Miss Teen USA. A foster child who 
grew up in six different families, she's spent her reign this past year 
speaking out about problems foster children face. Now Lopez, who handed over 
her crown Tuesday at this year's pageant, is college bound -- to UC Irvine. . . 
. A spokesman says Lopez will study performance arts and psychology this fall.

 CHINA CLIPPER: Irvine's AST Research is already the largest seller of personal 
computers in China and a PC maker there as well. Next week, AST Chairman Safi 
Qureshey joins Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and others on a trade mission to 
China. . . . Qureshey's people are promoting it as a chance not just to boost 
sales, but human rights as well. With PCs, "people have more access to 
information and therefore are more likely to promote change," says a 
spokeswoman.

 PAST LEGEND: Maybe Gary Davidson of Newport Beach, who now builds retirement 
homes, doesn't come to mind for your own list of sports legends. But Sports 
Illustrated has devoted six pages to him in its 40th anniversary issue out this 
month. . . . It calls Davidson, the businessman who founded the old American 
Basketball Assn., the World Hockey Assn., and the World Football League, "one 
of the most influential figures in the history of professional sports." 
Davidson says about the piece: "They over-recognized me. But that's OK."

 NO HOLDS BARRED: Lawyers love competition, even outside the courtroom. At a 
major Orange County bar luncheon today at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Irvine, 
huge bins will be set up by the local Food Distribution Center as part of the 
second annual food drive by lawyers here. . . . Who collected the most last 
year? The 55-lawyer Newport Beach branch of O'Melveny & Myers pretty much 
lapped the field. Its lawyers collected 1,487 pounds.

CLAUDIA H. HAMPTON; FIRST WOMAN TO HEAD CSU TRUSTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claudia H. Hampton, the first African American named to the Cal State 
University Board of Trustees and the first woman to head it, has died of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Hampton, who did not like to disclose her age but was believed to be in 
her 70s, died Saturday in a Los Angeles hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has been more instrumental in shaping the course of higher education 
in this state," CSU Chairman Jim Considine said. "She was never afraid to fight 
for what she believed in, and she always seemed to win because, in the end, she 
was always on the moral high ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miss Hampton was a Democrat and best known for her work with the 
NAACP, she was first appointed to the board by conservative Republican Gov. 
Ronald Reagan. She was reappointed by one Democrat and two Republicans, Govs. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., George Deukmejian and, earlier this year, Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Hampton was elected board chairman in 1979, becoming the first African 
American as well as the first woman to head the trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently received the Distinguished Service Award as the most outstanding 
trustee in the United States from the Assn. of Governing Boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she was recognized by former CSU trustee William D. Campbell and 
his wife, who established the Claudia H. Hampton Scholarships to assist 
inner-city youths who want to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miss Hampton said she was overwhelmed by the honor, she took great 
pleasure in helping to select the winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "One little girl, a high school student who worked 35 hours a week, maintained 
a 3.5 grade-point average, was so anxious and motivated to go to college, but 
didn't have the means," she told The Times. "Can you imagine what a thrill it 
was to say to that kid, 'OK, now you can go to college?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Hampton began her career as a teacher in Chicago after graduating from 
Central YMCA College there. Moving west, she taught in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and earned her master's degree and doctorate at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong advocate for minorities, Miss Hampton soon moved into administration 
at Los Angeles city schools and became the district's director of urban 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday at the Park Hills Community 
Church, 5247 Overdale Drive, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial contributions may be made to the Claudia H. Hampton Scholarship Fund, 
payable to the CSU Foundation, CSU Chancellor's Office, 400 Golden Shore, Long 
Beach, Calif. 90802.

DANA PARSONS: IF HE'S STILL HERE FOR THE BIG ONE, IT'LL BE HIS OWN FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've become a full-fledged Californian -- and without even getting tattooed, 
pierced or liposucked. The proof is that whatever Midwestern common sense I 
once had -- and few were blessed with as much -- has disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a bona fide Californian would study a local map, see that a major fault 
line with the potential to kill thousands runs through his neighborhood and 
still say, "What a great place to live! I think I'll stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving out here eight years ago, I was no stranger to natural 
disasters. While living in Nebraska, I had survived in one calendar year both a 
blizzard and a tornado -- the former while holed up at a friend's house and the 
latter while cowering in the basement of the newspaper I worked at. Later, 
during nine years in Colorado, I held up marvelously well in the face of flash 
floods and hailstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when California beckoned, the prospect of earthquakes didn't faze me. 
Besides, I had heard of the San Andreas fault and came to learn that it ran 
well away from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap in my knowledge was in not knowing there were other fault lines in 
Southern California. I had especially not heard, nor been informed, of 
something called the Newport-Inglewood fault. Imagine my surprise, then, to be 
leafing through my newspaper one day and see a artist's two-page rendering of 
Orange County, highlighted by the Newport-Inglewood fault line. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsheathing my compass and T square, I plotted my humble home at virtually 
dead center on the fault line. Indeed, the artist's rendering included 
everything but a skull and crossbones over my intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispiriting, to say the least. Worse yet was the experts' pronouncement that 
the Newport-Inglewood (stylishly named, isn't it?) had the potential to do even 
more damage than the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
 But now comes the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stanford University study has reduced the anticipated death count if and 
when the Newport-Inglewood fault slips. The latest figures indicate that a 
magnitude 7 earthquake along the fault would cause 2,000 to 5,000 deaths. The 
study also estimated that 15,000 could be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip, hip! Drinks all around! 
</P>
<P>
 I know Southern California has taken some hits in recent years, but is it now 
considered a "good news" story to learn that fewer of us will die in a 
cataclysmic earthquake than previously thought? 
</P>
<P>
 You take your good news where you find it, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question of the day is, why stay? When you know the train is rolling 
down the track directly at you, why not jump off? 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are unlike other natural disasters. For starters, the experts tell 
us for a certainty a major Newport-Inglewood quake will occur in our lifetime. 
Maybe as long as 50 years; maybe next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the same as predicting a tornado or a flood. Yes, you know they 
probably will occur, but they may not. And if they do, they can be so localized 
that only the most fretful person would lie awake nights worrying about them. 
For example, the major tornado I lived through killed three people, including 
one person who went up on the roof for a closer look at it (that person 
couldn't have been a native Midwesterner). 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, there's no reason to leave town because of a possible tornado. 
And that doesn't even take into account that you have adequate time to hide 
yourself when other disasters come calling. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's the rationale for living on a fault line? Especially when you know 
it's coming someday and isn't going to give you two seconds notice? 
</P>
<P>
 Why am I not loading up my pots and pans in my jalopy and heading for Oregon 
(actually, I can't take credit for that; a reader recently suggested it for 
totally unrelated reasons). 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a point well taken. Have I somehow deluded myself into thinking 
they're wrong about the Newport-Inglewood? Do I somehow think I'll survive a 
timber striking me on the old coconut? 
</P>
<P>
 I should move. Even if only a few blocks, just so I wouldn't be sitting right 
in the middle of that damn fault line. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandma used to say that some people "don't have the sense God gave a 
goose." 
</P>
<P>
 Her words come back to me while sitting here reading about the 
Newport-Inglewood fault and looking again at my cross-streets. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear her words while remembering I have no quake insurance and that every 
time a quake has hit since I've lived here I've frozen in place. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear her words and feel much like a gosling. 
</P>

SMOG ALERTS IN '94 TOP PAST 2 YEARS' TOTALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities have already issued more health advisories for smoggy days so far 
this year in Ventura County than they have in the past two years combined, with 
the hot weather spell bringing promise of more polluted days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has had six health advisories this year, in which children and 
athletes are cautioned to curtail outdoor exercise and the elderly and infirm 
are advised to stay indoors. During the previous two years, there were only 
four such advisories. 
</P>
<P>
 And the hot, stagnant air in recent days is just one factor contributing to 
the problem, experts say. The county's atmospheric conditions from this point 
in August through September typically bring the smoggiest period of the year in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just now getting into the season where we have the highest air 
pollution," said Kent Field, meteorologist with the Ventura County Air 
Pollution Control District. "We've already had more unhealthful days than we 
had to this point last year and we haven't even hit September yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Smog levels, which peaked in Simi Valley on Friday with the highest ozone 
reading of the year at 155 on the Pollutant Standard Index, were not expected 
to exceed the unhealthful level of 100 for the rest of the week as temperatures 
continue to drop slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pollution levels in the inland valleys were expected to hover near the 
unhealthful level before climbing again in the early part of next week along 
with returning high temperatures. Field could not say this far ahead whether 
more health advisories are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast, where temperatures have cooled several degrees since Sunday, 
smog levels were expected to remain moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent smoggy period has caused an increase in calls to area allergists, 
who say that people with already impaired lung capacity suffer more acutely 
during smoggy days. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the smog times, we see a substantial increase in hospital admissions, 
emergency room admissions and outpatient visits," said Dr. Lewis Kanter, an 
allergist with practices in Camarillo and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smog is a non-specific irritant, like little drops of acid that irritate the 
lungs," he said. "So the lungs think there is something in there and they close 
down the air tubes so whatever the irritant is can't get farther down into the 
lungs." 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, Kanter said, that episode can last a few minutes, but for 
asthmatics, the seizing of the lungs can be sustained much longer, developing 
into a full asthmatic attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Lung Assn. has made clean air the focus of its campaign this 
year, said William Michael Reynolds, chairman of the board for the Ventura 
County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since breathing is a necessity of life, all things that control the quality 
of air we breathe are important," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Field said he and others at the air pollution district who analyze 
meteorological patterns had remarked in June that the conditions were right for 
a year of high ozone pollution concentrations. Ozone, the primary component of 
smog, is formed when chemicals produced by cars and industry mix in sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of May and the first few days of June, we were seeing a weather 
pattern similar to what we have now," Field said. "But the pattern is much 
stronger now." 
</P>
<P>
 The smog and heat are the result of a thick high-pressure zone that has 
hovered over the county for the past week. The mass is a large pool of stagnant 
warm air that is without winds or clouds. That allows sunlight to penetrate and 
warm up the ground below, but does not allow much mixing of the air, Field 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conditions were absent during much of the last two years, when air 
quality was exceptionally good. 
</P>
<P>
 But Field said that without the stringent air pollution controls that have 
dramatically reduced the production of the chemicals that cause ozone, the air 
quality would be much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be twice as bad right now without the controls," he said. "Now, to 
get a first-stage alert here (at a level of 200 on the index) we would have to 
have air brought in from outside the county. We just don't produce enough of 
the components here to make the pollution levels that high." 
</P>
<P>
 With each year, he said, the possibility that Ventura County will have a 
first-stage smog alert becomes more remote.

ROCKETDYNE PROMISES TO STIFFEN SAFETY MEASURES; INQUIRY: FIRM SAYS STATIC 
ELECTRICITY, SPARK OR HOT PAN MAY HAVE IGNITED CONTAINER OF EXPLOSIVES IN FATAL 
BLAST. 
</P>

<P>
 Promising tighter safety controls after an explosion at their Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory, Rocketdyne officials said Tuesday they believe two test 
engineers died and a third was injured because something ignited the small, 
half-full container of explosives one worker was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 Static electricity, a spark or a hot pan from an earlier test-burn could have 
touched off the highly volatile nitrocellulose the unidentified worker had been 
holding, said Rocketdyne President Paul Smith. But he added, "I really don't 
want to speculate on what caused this explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the theory is not conclusive, it was as close as a three-week 
internal investigation could come to the cause of a July 26 blast at the 
facility near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the California office of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration is continuing its own investigation of the explosion that killed 
Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks and Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park, and 
injured Lee Wells, 62, of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be two to four weeks before the state safety agency decides whether to 
cite Rocketdyne for any safety violations, said Rick Rice, a Cal/OSHA 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the privacy of the victims' families, Smith refused to say at a news 
conference at Rocketdyne's Canoga Park headquarters whether it was Pugh or 
Heiney who carried the 6-by-6 1/2-inch plastic container of nitrocellulose that 
Rocketdyne investigators say they believe exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business we're in -- and in fact in any business -- accidents 
shouldn't happen," Smith told reporters. "This accident has only heightened our 
belief that we can't pay too much attention to safety."  
</P>
<P>
 From now on, Rocketdyne health and safety inspectors will scrutinize safety 
procedures in every test involving high-energy chemicals beforehand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And until fail-safe test methods are in place, Rocketdyne has suspended tests 
involving nitrocellulose and glycidal azide polymer, the rocket fuel ingredient 
that was being tested on July 26, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, people get comfortable" in laboratory work, Smith said. Safeguards 
must be in place "no matter how comfortable the employees are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Michael McHale, Rocketdyne's vice president of advanced programs, 
said this is what their investigation found: 
</P>
<P>
 The workers had laid out one aluminum test pan that morning, surrounding it 
with a square, bottomless, 2-foot-high box-like shield made of 3/8-inch-thick 
aluminum sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they covered the pan with a layer of sawdust and spread about three or 
four pounds of nitrocellulose atop that, capping the mixture with three to four 
pounds of glycidal azide polymer. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker assigned to ignite the mixture inserted an electrical device known 
as a "match" into the mixture. He alone carried a key to switch the device on, 
so the chemicals could not be sparked accidentally while other workers were 
nearby, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then that worker and his four colleagues retreated to the safety of a nearby 
block house. There, he used the key to trigger the match, which heated in 
microseconds to about 450 degrees Fahrenheit and set the sawdust and chemicals 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief, intense fireball about 15 to 20 feet across bloomed out of the top of 
the shield enclosure while acoustic probes nearby recorded the shock waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers noticed some flames lingering in the residue afterward, indicating not 
all the chemicals had burned. But they dumped dirt and water into the pan, then 
shoved it toward the northern end of the test enclosure and set up another 
shield and pan directly to the south of the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 After laying chemicals out in the southern pan, the workers retreated to the 
blockhouse and ignited them, causing another fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went normally, and at this point they returned to the area," dumped dirt 
into the southern test pan and cleaned out the northern test pan, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question it had cooled off," he said. "They put in the sawdust, 
they put in the chemicals and started to withdraw from the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the workers saw either Pugh or Heiney -- Rocketdyne declines to say which 
-- walk to a storage area and retrieve an open, five-pound plastic container of 
nitrocellulose. 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving test workers told investigators the container seemed to hold about 
two pounds of the material, a highly volatile nitrated wood pulp. 
Nitrocellulose is used in testing to accelerate the burning of other chemicals, 
said Rocketdyne spokesman Paul Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The inch-thick layer of nitrocellulose spread out on the test pan could never 
explode, but several inches of it in the plastic container could, said McHale. 
</P>
<P>
 As the worker carried the container back toward the test pans, his co-workers 
"were all looking at other things, and none of them saw what happened to that 
container of nitrocellulose," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 It blew apart the southern test shield -- which had held only residue from the 
second test -- splitting its seams and flinging the aluminum shield walls in 
all directions. The explosion also threw the northern shield against a hillside 
some 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County coroner's officials said the blast killed Pugh and Heiney 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It also caused severe burns to the arms of Lee Wells, the only one of the 
other three employees at the site who has been identified by Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Wells said his memories of the moments before the blast were 
"pretty doggone foggy." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could remember was I was over at the sidelines and I felt the impact, 
and I was on the ground," Wells said. "I didn't watch them put the stuff in to 
any degree. . . . All I felt was the big rush, and that was it." Blast Theory 
Twice that day, Rocketdyne employees had laid out chemicals in aluminum pans 
surrounded by square shields of 2-foot-high, 3/8-inch thick sheet aluminum. 
Then they had retreated to the blockhouse,ignited the chemicals remotely and 
recorded the resulting fire with acoustic probes.After two successful tests, 
workers cleaned out the northern pan and filled it with chemicals for a third 
test. As heiney or Pugh walked toward the area carrying a small container of 
nitrocellulose, something ignited the chemical and triggered the explosion. The 
blast blew apart the southern shield and flung the northern shield against a 
hillside 50 feet away. 1. Otto K. Helney, an engineer, was killed. Responsible 
for the pans housing the chemicals, he was only about two feet away from the 
explosion. 2. Larry A. Pugh, a physicist, was about six feet away and was 
killed instantly. 3. Lee Wells, on site to assist, was farther away and blown 
against hills behind test site, suffering second-and third-degree burns on 20% 
of his body. 4. Site manager / chemist, farther away, escaped without injury. 
5. Engineer, also unharmed. Source: Rockwell International's Rocketdyne

WORKERS TOLD NOT TO PANIC OVER CLOSURES; MILITARY: COMMANDER SAYS IT'S UNKNOWN 
WHETHER BASES IN THE COUNTY WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE NEXT ROUND OF FEDERAL 
CUTBACKS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Navy's top brass in Ventura County on Tuesday told about 200 defense and 
engineering company employees to hold off panicking over next year's round of 
federal military base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. Dana B. McKinney, commander of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station and its sister base at China Lake, said it's too soon to assume that 
either the Navy bases at Point Mugu or Port Hueneme could end up on next year's 
list of bases scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, 'We don't know' is the best answer we can provide," McKinney 
told the capacity crowd. "Even if we could speculate, we're not going to do so. 
I think it would only be a disservice to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The admiral was joined by Capt. James Delker, commander of the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme, and Capt. John Scott Beachy, 
commander of the Port Hueneme division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon marked the first time that the top brass of Ventura County's 
major naval facilities jointly attended a public forum to discuss the future of 
the Navy in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was some shock value in getting these three officers together, then 
so much the better," said Bob Warnagieris, president of the Ventura County 
chapter of the International Test and Evaluation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't bring these people together to raise memberships," said 
Warnagieris, who helped organize the public forum. "We brought them together to 
let them know what's on the line should one of these bases close." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was co-sponsored by the Channel Islands chapter of the American 
Society of Naval Engineers, the Defense Service Industry Executives Assn. and 
the Ventura County BRAC '95 Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The top naval officers declined to answer questions from the workers who are 
concerned about their jobs. McKinney said that if they knew anything about next 
year's Base Realignment and Closure process, they are barred from discussing 
the issue by order of the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, McKinney said he agreed to appear before the group because 
it gave him a chance to try to lower public anxiety over the base-closing 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I initially had some apprehension (about coming), but I decided to speak in 
the end because it offered me a chance to calm some of these folks down," 
McKinney said. "And, it gave me the chance to warn them about all the rumors 
and idle speculation that have been going around." 
</P>
<P>
 During the forum, the officers were asked to describe the strengths and 
weaknesses of each base. While skirting the question about weaknesses, they 
pointed out that the bases' strengths would make them less vulnerable to 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Delker said that the Port Hueneme Seabee base is one of the nation's two 
Seabee bases and that its sprawling 1,600 acres have become home to a large 
number of tenant commands whose missions are unrelated to the work of the 
Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
 Beachy said the surface warfare facility, which is primarily responsible for 
the testing and engineering of fleet weapons systems, is unique because of its 
proximity to a sea test range, a deep-water harbor and a close-by naval air 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Beachy also said the Navy continues to move toward sophisticated weapons 
systems, which need his staff's expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Point Mugu, McKinney said the base is a launching pad to the Navy's 
36,000-square-mile sea test range -- a stretch of ocean needed to fire missiles 
and test other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about a facility that cannot likely be duplicated and most 
likely could not be reacquired," McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the federal base closure commission will be appointed by President 
Clinton in January and the Defense Department will hand the commission its 
recommended hit list in March. The commission is scheduled to make its decision 
in July.

CUSTODY OF BOY, 3, AWARDED TO GRANDPARENTS; COURTS: COMMISSIONER REJECTS 
MOTHER'S BID FOR A DELAY PENDING AN APPEAL. HER POVERTY WAS FACTOR IN THE 
RULING, ADVOCATES CONTEND. 
</P>

<P>
 In a rare decision, a Ventura County court commissioner in a divorce case has 
awarded custody of a 3-year-old Simi Valley boy to the child's paternal 
grandparents instead of either biological parent. 
</P>
<P>
 And Commissioner John R. Pattie on Tuesday refused the mother's request to 
delay his order until the decision could be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattie based his decision in part on a psychological profile that described 
the mother in the case -- Julie Gilmore, 20 -- as a woman who has exhibited 
"exclusively manipulative and sociopathic" behavior in the past, possibly 
related to a troubled childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for Gilmore said the portrayal of her as sociopathic was not 
backed up by any evidence. They said they believe that she has been stripped of 
primary custody of Dillon Gilmore, 3, for one reason: She is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 They compare the case to another family law decision last month by a Michigan 
judge that drew national attention. That case outraged feminists after the 
judge awarded custody of a 3-year-old girl to her father because the college 
student-mother had enrolled the child in day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jill Hatfield, who represents Gilmore, said the Ventura County 
decision is more unusual than even the Michigan one because neither biological 
parent ended up with custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Others supporters of the mother agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about this girl being poor, young and unmarried," said Charlene 
Pizzadili, a representative of the National Organization for Women's Ventura 
County chapter. "And when you're poor, young and unmarried and come into the 
(judicial) system, this is what happens to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pattie said in court Tuesday that money had nothing to do with his decision. 
He simply believed that the grandparents could provide the child with a more 
stable home than either the mother or father, Pattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattie added that his decision is based on a court-ordered report by Camarillo 
psychologist Leonard Diamond, who examined both Gilmore and Dillon's father, 
Michael Murphy, 21. It recommends against giving custody to either biological 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The report praises Gilmore for being a logical, competitive and self-confident 
person. "Julie Gilmore is bright, competent and very motivated to be a good 
parent to her child," it says at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also says she experimented with marijuana and cocaine prior to giving 
birth to Dillon and is the product of an unstable home life. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has, in fact, been exclusively manipulative and sociopathic," the report 
concludes. "This may have grown out of her negative and poor childhood or it 
may have grown out of the current circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gilmore admitted that she "experimented" with drugs two years 
before her child was born, but points out that she has never been in any kind 
of trouble with the law. She denies using any drugs today and says she rarely 
drinks alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's hot and maybe I'm laying by the pool or something, I will have a 
beer," she said. "And, usually, it's not when my son is here. I don't think I'm 
immature because I have an occasional beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore said she was adopted and ran away from home when she was 13 because of 
an unstable family life. She is now a full-time student at American River 
College in Sacramento, studying early childhood development and hoping for a 
career working with children. Gilmore said she supports herself with monthly 
welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pattie declined to comment on his decision for this story, but stressed in 
court that the fact that Gilmore is poor and the paternal grandparents are 
middle-class played no role in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on family law said it is highly unusual for a court to award custody 
to grandparents in cases in which there are no allegations that the child has 
been put in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awards of custody to grandparents are exceedingly rare," said Scott A. 
Altman, a family law professor at the USC law school, "particularly in the 
absence of allegations of (current) drug abuse or criminal activity or child 
abuse or neglect." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore and Murphy became romantically involved while attending Simi Valley 
High School in 1990. She became pregnant, but the two split up before their 
child was born March 29, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 18 months of Dillon's life, Julie said she raised her son alone 
in an apartment she shared with a roommate. Dillon's paternal grandparents did 
not play a significant role until after she got a job when the child was 6 
months old, Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore said she would drop her child off with the grandmother early in the 
morning and not pick him up until 10 at night, after work and adult basic 
learning classes in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Dillon's home virtually," the grandmother, Jean Murphy, said in an 
interview. "He has spent most of his time here, on and off. This is his home 
base and where he feels secure." 
</P>
<P>
 By August, 1992, when the child was about 18 months old, Gilmore and the boy's 
father reunited and married. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage didn't work out, though. The couple sought a divorce within six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is when the custody issue became sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ordered them to split custody of the child from June, 1993, until 
July, 1994. In that arrangement, Dillon would spend two weeks with Gilmore, who 
by then had moved to Sacramento to be closer to a relative. Dillon's other two 
weeks would be spent with his father -- most of the time with his father's 
parents, Jean Murphy said -- in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But both sides felt that those arrangements put an unnecessary burden on such 
a young child and the court reconsidered the setup. 
</P>
<P>
 On July, 29, Pattie reached a decision: Primary custody would go to Jean 
Murphy and her husband, Dennis -- and not to either of the biological parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore said she believes that Pattie made his decision based on her age and 
lack of life experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was because I was young. If I was their age, in my late 40s, I would have 
had a home for 23 years and a job for 23 years," she said. "But that is what he 
looks at and says, 'You (the grandparents) are suitable to raise my child.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Under Pattie's order, Gilmore essentially is allowed to visit her son during 
her breaks from college and the boy's father gets to visit him on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatfield asked Pattie on Tuesday to delay his order until she could file an 
appeal for Gilmore. But the attorney hired by the Murphys, Bruce G. Jones, 
applauded the commissioner for not giving in to Hatfield. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Jones cited the psychological report as calling Gilmore 
"sociopathic." He said Gilmore "uses and abuses others." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not look at this situation as this lady being a victim of anything," he 
said. "She is a person who I do think loves her child. But love is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Murphy could not be reached Tuesday. But his mother said both her son 
and Gilmore "are too immature and not effective parents." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our ultimate goal to take away custody from either of the 
(parents)," said Jean Murphy, who refers to her son and Gilmore as children. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point," she added, "this is where the stability is for Dillon." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilmore strongly disagrees. She said she raised her son the first three 
years of his life without any problems and wants to continue doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the only family I have," she said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN GETS 10 YEARS FOR RAPING COUNSELOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Ventura man who pleaded guilty last month to raping a counselor 
who was trying to help him find a job was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 James Michael Martinez showed little emotion as Superior Court Judge Charles 
W. Campbell Jr. sentenced him to six years for the rape and another four years 
for using a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Martinez was a chronic drug user who was earning a paycheck 
and receiving praise from his boss at a retail warehouse after the 46-year-old 
counselor helped him find the temporary job. 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 6, Martinez raped the jobs counselor at knifepoint at her 
Camarillo home, tying her hands together with a curling iron cord and muffling 
her cries with a washcloth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant told her 'Don't scream or I'll hurt you,' " said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Bob Calvert, adding that any sentence less than 10 years would be an 
injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Bryant Villagran said his client is remorseful. He 
blamed the incident on Martinez's drug addiction. And the attorney said the 
judge should give Martinez credit for not using the knife to harm the victim. 
"It could have been a lot worse, and it wasn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age, Martinez will be referred to the California Youth 
Authority to serve his time, Campbell ruled. DWAYNE BRAY

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; HIT-AND-RUN CASES 
TURN UP NO GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One horrific week in May, hit-and-run drivers in the east San Fernando Valley 
struck and killed three pedestrians -- two of them children -- in two accidents 
within five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The first victims were 12-year-old Amalia Godoy and her mother, Maria, 48, 
killed crossing a busy Pacoima intersection where neighbors had long pleaded 
for a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second accident, 7-year-old Skyy Nelson was killed as he ran across a 
Panorama City street to an ice cream truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver accused of killing Amalia and Maria Godoy surrendered to police 
about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man who hit young Skyy Nelson so hard the boy was knocked out of his 
shoes -- and then sped away laughing -- is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 That's typical for hit-and-run killers, who police say are caught only about 
half the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not good news because the number of hit-run deaths is rising in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, 46 people have died in hit-and-run accidents on Valley 
surface streets, compared to 35 in the same period last year, a 31% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one seems to have an explanation for it," said Detective John Miller of 
the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division. "We had a lot right around the earthquake, 
like one every other day in January." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department does not keep records on how many hit-run 
cases are solved. But the commanders of its four traffic divisions estimated 
earlier this year that detectives catch the drivers in only about 50% of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries are also up. Nearly 300 more people were hurt by hit-and-run drivers 
in the first six months of 1994 than in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hit-and-run drivers who turn themselves in do so out of remorse, or the 
hope police will go easier on them. 
</P>
<P>
 These drivers are usually "just ordinary people" who fled because "they panic 
or they don't have a driver's license or insurance or maybe it's a borrowed 
car," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 And, detectives sometimes get lucky, even when a hit-and-run driver is a 
habitual criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened about two weeks ago, when police were able to nab a suspected 
drunk driver charged with hitting and seriously injuring a family of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 In a car left at the scene was a membership card for the North Hollywood YMCA 
belonging to Ronald Lee Gerton, 55. When he showed up there a few days later, 
Miller and his partner, Detective Gregg Pfeifle , collared him.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's relatively rare that we get such good information we can just go out and 
arrest somebody," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the trail often cools quickly, as it has in the case of young Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is continuing, but the clues are few and far between," said 
Miller. "We had some real good clues in the beginning, but witnesses were not 
able to identify the suspect or the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a common car, a black Volkswagen Jetta or that type," he said. "When 
we showed them Ford Escorts or Toyotas, which are similar, they said it could 
be that too." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's grandmother calls Miller every couple of weeks hoping her grandson's 
killer has been found. So far, no news, even though the Los Angeles City 
Council has offered a $10,000 reward for the killer. An artist's rendering of a 
suspect, described by witnesses as a Latino about 26 years old, is shown above. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the boy's 3-year-old sister was also in the street when Skyy was 
run down in the 900 block of Tobias Avenue in Van Nuys, but luckily she was not 
injured. The family had moved to the crowded neighborhood just one day before 
the tragic incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In another unsolved hit-and-run case, the City Council offered a $25,000 
reward Friday for information leading to the arrest of a motorist who killed an 
80-year-old Sherman Oaks woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Selma Labovitz was struck by a beige or tan Chevy Nova on July 5 as she walked 
to her car from the 99 Cents Only Store on Laurel Canyon Boulevard in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with information about either killing can call San Fernando Valley 
traffic detectives at (818) 756-8391.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA/OXNARD; BROWN GREETED WITH INTEREST ON STATE 
TOUR 
</P>

<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown stopped in Ventura County on 
Tuesday to speak to a group of residents and visit an Oxnard school as part of 
her bus tour of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people attended a breakfast at the Colony Harbortown Hotel in 
Ventura where Brown discussed her views on health, education and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing an enthusiastic audience, Brown said her campaign "is about 
restoring the promises to California families, to rebuild the new California so 
families can get the opportunity to buy new homes. . . .This state cannot grow, 
cannot be prosperous, if our kids cannot get a good education." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the breakfast, which was organized by Ventura County 
Democrats United and the National Women's Political Caucus, were labor union 
members, nurses, students and local elected officials, including Oxnard Mayor 
Manuel Lopez and Oxnard School District Trustee Mary Barreto. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will help the labor movement a lot more than Pete Wilson," said David C. 
Valenzuela, president of the Ventura County Laborers' International Union, 
Local 585. "It's time for a change and she is the best candidate to lead the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most in the audience were Brown supporters, some paid the $10 fee for 
the breakfast just for the opportunity to meet the Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to hear Kathleen Brown speaking. I want to learn more about her," said 
Paula Thompson, a Ventura business owner. "She is a woman and that intrigues 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakfast, Brown stopped by Emilie Ritchen Elementary School in 
Oxnard, where she spoke to fifth- and sixth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 From Ventura County, Brown went to Santa Barbara, where she was scheduled to 
speak to the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. CHRISTINA LIMA

<P>
 Four people were treated and 12 others were temporarily overcome when 
hazardous fumes filled the Ventura Sav-On Drugs store Tuesday morning, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fumes, which spread when an employee poured incompatible chemicals into a 
bathroom sink at the same time, spread throughout the store on Telegraph Road, 
forcing employees and customers to evacuate, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous-materials experts from the Ventura Fire Department wore protective 
suits into the store and diluted the chemical combination of sodium 
hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid, officials said. Firefighters then set up 
fans to dissipate the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee who poured the chemicals into the sink was treated for chemical 
exposure at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and released. The condition of the 
three other victims is not known, fire officials said, and Sav-On officials 
refused to comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The store reopened after three hours, when fire officials determined the fumes 
were sufficiently dispersed, officials said. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL OPPOSES IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After listening to a torrent of testimony from opponents of Proposition 187, 
the Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to formally oppose the "Save 
Our State" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, would deny schooling, 
non-emergency health care and other public benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Frank of Simi Valley, a lobbyist who is coordinating the Ventura County 
campaign in support of the initiative, described illegal immigrants as 
lawbreakers who are depriving U. S. citizens of opportunity and a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about people who are stealing prenatal care, welfare, jobs and 
other services from our rightful citizens, those are the bigots, and those are 
the people who are mean-spirited," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 But everyone else who spoke before the council condemned the measure, which 
they said was racist and impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the initiative is blatant immigrant- and Latino-bashing," said 
Michael Rodriguez, president of the Ventura County chapter of the Mexican 
American Political Assn. "It comes at a time when we need to come together more 
than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Melgoza of Oxnard said the measure was an attempt to make Latinos 
scapegoats for the state's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Latinos come to this country to work, not to sit in front of the welfare 
office," Melgoza said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Harris of the Good Democratic Club of Oxnard said his group also opposes 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can a school turn away the active mind of a child, and how could a doctor 
turn away someone who is ill? That is in effect what we would be doing," Harris 
said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez will run unopposed on the November ballot after his 
only challenger failed to submit the required 20 signatures of registered 
Oxnard voters with his nomination papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio De La Cerda, a 24-year-old television producer, submitted 22 
signatures with his election papers, but only 14 turned out to be of registered 
Oxnard voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The other signatures were of people who are not registered to vote or of 
voters who live outside of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cerda acknowledged that he procrastinated, trying to gather signatures 
at the last minute before Friday's 5 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started gathering signatures at 1 (p.m.), and I got them in there around 
4:30 (p.m.)," he said. "I thought I had enough. I asked everyone if they were 
registered, but I guess they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cerda said he is considering entering the race as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is running for his second consecutive term as mayor. He served on the 
Oxnard City Council for 14 years before becoming mayor. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FEES WILL INCREASE AT LIBRARY, BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning Sept. 1, the Thousand Oaks Library and the Newbury Park Branch will 
increase fees for the replacement of library cards, inter-library requests and 
microfilm copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries will also provide a new service so that borrowers can reserve 
nonfiction videos for a $2 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a way of helping to recoup our costs," library Deputy Director 
Steve Brogden said of the increases. "These fees are not out of line. They are 
to bring us in line with other libraries." 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable change will be the increased cost for inter-library requests. 
If neither the Thousand Oaks Library nor the Newbury Park Branch owns a 
requested book, it will cost $2 to borrow that book from another library. 
Previously, the fee for that service was only 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee for a microfilm copy will increase from 15 cents to 25 cents Sept. 1, 
and the fee to order microfilm of a census will increase from $3.50 to $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement fee for library cards, which is now $1 for the first 
replacement and $5 for the second, will be $2. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 A Simi Valley man suspected of assaulting a child was arrested after 
struggling with a police dog that found him hiding in his bedroom closet, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police went to the home of Daniel Sean Casey, 40, about 8 p.m. Monday to 
investigate a report by the parent of a 14-year-old Simi Valley boy that Casey 
had allegedly assaulted the boy earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrived at Casey's home on the 1700 block of Mayfair Street to 
interview him regarding the report, but he refused to come out of the house, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 After several warnings, investigators unleashed a police dog to search the 
premises. Within minutes, the dog discovered Casey crouched in a closet, but 
police said Casey refused to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey hit and choked the dog several times before officers were able to 
handcuff him, police said. He was arrested on suspicion of injuring a child and 
assaulting a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey suffered several dog bites and was treated at Simi Valley Hospital and 
released to the custody of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.  
</P>
<P>
 He is in custody at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail and is 
scheduled to be arraigned today, a jail commander said. JEFF McDONALD

 Nearly 50 construction workers walked off a Thousand Oaks building site early 
Tuesday to show solidarity for local Teamsters truck drivers striking against 
CalMat Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the Calleguas Municipal Water District water treatment plant under 
construction on Olsen Road was all but shut down Tuesday morning after workers 
representing several local unions walked away from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Union workers said they were angry to learn that the general contractor, 
Amoroso Development Co., had returned to using CalMat concrete after 
temporarily switching to another company because of the strike, which is in its 
fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters have refused to accept a new contract with CalMat that includes 
a $2.20-an-hour pay cut and a reduction in health insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions participating in the walkout included Carpenters Local Union 150, the 
Plumbers and Steamfitters Local No. 484, Ironworkers Local No. 416 and 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 952, said Bob Guillen, 
secretary of the Ventura County Building and Construction Trades Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers said they will continue to show support for the Teamsters as long as 
the contractor uses materials supplied by CalMat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they bring those concrete trucks back in Wednesday, then we'll walk out 
again," said one who declined to be identified.  
</P>
<P>
 CalMat officials mailed letters to all the striking drivers last week telling 
them they would be replaced permanently if they do not return to work today. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Shaw, secretary treasurer and chief executive for the Teamsters Local 
186, said he hoped the show of solidarity would help push CalMat into 
reconsidering the pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they have interruptions in work like that, it costs them money and 
hopefully it will encourage them to negotiate," Shaw said.  
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between Teamsters and the construction materials company have 
been stalled since July 26, and Shaw said they are not expected to resume until 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 CalMat officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday. MARY F. POLS

SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL AGREES TO BOOST BUS FARES TO $1; TRANSIT: THE INCREASE 
TAKES EFFECT SEPT. 6. A PLAN TO SELL ADVERTISING SPACE AT STOPS IS APPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blaming the rising cost of providing city bus service, the Simi Valley City 
Council has unanimously agreed to raise bus fares from 75 cents to $1. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the fare increase, the council approved Monday night a 
plan to sell space at bus stops to advertisers and to expand service on 
successful routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare hike, which will take effect Sept. 6, is expected to bring the city 
more than $63,000 a year, providing a needed revenue boost for the 22-year-old 
bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though city buses carried more riders than ever last year, fare revenues 
have dropped as much as 5% on some routes, while costs have jumped nearly 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run the four Simi Valley Transit bus lines, which carried 400,000 
riders last year, will be an estimated $1.6 million next year. Operating 
expenses are expected to increase by $83,000 this year, the result of rising 
maintenance, fuel and salary costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one resident showed up for the Monday night hearing to debate the fare 
hikes, but at bus stops around the city Tuesday riders expressed their 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just too expensive for a city this small," said Alex Valtierra, who 
waited at a bus stop Tuesday for more than 45 minutes. "We don't mind the long 
wait right now, but if we're going to have to pay that much it doesn't seem 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sequoia Junior High School student Amanda Perego said she and her friends take 
the bus to school every day and had not heard about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," the 15-year-old said. "It's not like we're made of money. I think 
a lot of people are going to say, 'Forget it,' and find another way to get to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 But city transit officials said most people do not realize their fares cover 
only 20% of the cost to run the bus lines. The rest is paid with federal grant 
money and city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of costs involved in running these buses, and the city is 
already picking up a good portion of that," said city transit administrator Ray 
Turpin. "We've simply corrected our fares to be in line with others in Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Area Transit, which provides service to west Ventura County cities 
and Ventura Intercity Service Transit Authority, or VISTA, each charge $1. In 
Los Angeles County, the Metropolitan Transit Authority recently raised fares 
from $1.10 to $1.35, effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Turpin also noted that this is the first fare increase since 1989, when the 
cost of a single trip rose from 50 cents to 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to find other sources of revenue, the council approved several 
measures aimed at raising money for the bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a fare increase for Dial-A-Ride vans, which shuttle 
disabled and elderly residents around the city, from a suggested donation of 75 
cents to a suggested donation of $1. For riders who require the service as part 
of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, the fee will be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the city's most profitable bus line, which runs between Simi Valley 
Hospital and Wood Ranch, will be extended to run to the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library and Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to lure tourists who may be able to connect the route from other county 
bus lines, city officials said the extension could earn the transit authority 
an extra $2,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will begin looking for potential advertisers interested 
in constructing bus stop shelters that can support billboard-type 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 That idea, which could raise a projected $15,300 a year, received the most 
support from council members, who stressed the importance of exhausting all 
potential revenue sources before increasing fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need it to be clear we're not out to make money," said 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels. "As much as we can, I think we need to try to place 
the burden on the private sector -- like the advertisers -- rather than rely 
solely on the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The council at first considered raising bus fares to 90 cents instead of $1, 
but decided it would be easier for passengers to find a dollar bill than 
scrounge for 90 cents in change. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we went with 90 cents we'd just be back here a year or two from now to 
change it again," added Councilwoman Barbara Williamson. "We might as well just 
get this done now." 
</P>
<P>
 Fares for seniors, student passes and bus passes will also increase. The 
senior fare will increase from 25 cents to 35 cents. Student passes will 
increase from $25 to $33.25. Regular bus passes will increase from $33.75 to 
$45.

OCEAN CONTAMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The news media and the government warn us of the danger of nuclear-powered 
and unstable nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest danger that faces us today is the contamination from sewage 
spilling into our oceans.The great "digester" (ocean) can no longer continue to 
absorb the raw sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 A partial list of the deadly water-borne diseases resulting from the above 
(includes) cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, polio, hepatitis and salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people depend on the oceans for their food and livelihood. Many 
people will no longer eat fish, scallops, clams and other shellfish. They are 
concerned about contamination, and rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
 We are slowly but surely destroying our oceans for the lack of leadership from 
local, state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 We have spent billions of dollars on wars, S & Ls (and) HUD when we should be 
building sewerage plants that are more than adequate to accommodate the sewage 
that we generate daily. We also need backup diesel generators in case of 
electrical outages -- plus larger pipelines.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS, BONDS RALLY ON FED ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board gave Wall Street what it expected on Tuesday, and 
investors responded with a collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's central bank raised short-term interest rates by a 
half-percentage-point, but also said that this fifth credit-tightening move of 
1994 will be the last, "at least for a time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's mid-day announcement sparked a steep decline in long-term bond 
yields, while sending the Dow Jones industrial stock average up 24.28 points to 
3,784.57 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, Asian stock markets also responded positively to the Fed's move. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 133.78 points to 9,500.40 in mid-morning, 
while Tokyo's Nikkei-225 index added 47.41 points to 20,833.77. 
</P>
<P>
 In Australia, Sydney stocks also were higher as that country's central bank 
followed the Fed today, raising short-term rates for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. bond market, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield tumbled to 
a two-month low of 7.36% Tuesday from Monday's 7.50%. Shorter-term yields 
either were sharply lower or barely changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders noted that the Fed's decision to raise two key short-term interest 
rates satisfied several different groups of investors, thus prompting buying. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, investors who want the economy to slow believe the Fed was 
aggressive enough with its half-point boost to do the job. So inflation 
expectations were lessened, thus encouraging buyers of long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in shorter-term bonds, meanwhile, were happy that the Fed signaled 
that this rate boost may be the last for a time, which implies stability in 
shorter-term yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors were encouraged by bonds' rally and also by the potential for 
tighter credit to guarantee a longer, albeit slower, U.S. economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people have concluded is that what the Fed has done is positive for 
bonds and stocks," said Abby Cohen, market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a bond investor, I'm pretty pleased," said Dave Rose, chief executive at 
Alaska Permanent Capital Management, an Anchorage-based firm with $500 million 
in bonds. The Fed's action is "a strong enough dose to calm (investors) down," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said long-term T-bond yields could drop to 6.75% by year's end, as 
investors lose their inflation jitters and re-enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors also were enthused Tuesday as crude oil prices fell to a 
two-month low, on news of ample supplies in inventory. Energy prices are key 
determinants of inflation trends. 
</P>
<P>
 September crude futures on the New York Merc slumped 47 cents to $17.73 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow was hovering nearly unchanged at about 1:15 p.m., when 
the much-anticipated message came: the Fed raised its discount rate from 3.5% 
to 4% and the federal funds rate -- the overnight loan rate among banks -- from 
4.25% to 4.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sent the Dow shooting up 20 points, but it quickly fell back as 
computerized "sell" programs kicked in. As trading wore on the programs ceased 
and buyers returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, winners topped losers by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was 305 million shares, the highest since mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 While stocks were reasonably strong, some traders noted that the markets' 
reaction was less pronounced this time than on May 17 -- the last time the Fed 
raised rates. That rate hike, also a half-point, was greeted with a 49.11-point 
Dow surge and a 0.18-percentage point decline in 30-year T-bond yields, to 
7.26%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the May 17 announcement, the Fed also suggested it was finished tightening 
credit, at least temporarily. But within a month healthy statistics on the 
economy began to focus investors on the potential for another rate boost, and 
stocks tumbled while long-term bond yields shot up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Acuff, strategist at brokerage Smith Barney in New York, warned that 
despite Tuesday's rally stocks may have a hard time in the months ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 Acuff said that by October or November the stock and bond markets could again 
be wrestling with the potential for another Fed rate hike, unless the economy 
slows appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks continued to lead the market. Merck jumped 3/4 to 33 7/8 after 
saying it will sell its chemical divisions to focus on its main drug business. 
</P>
<P>
 Other drug stocks gained on new takeover talk. Bristol-Myers surged 1 7/8 to 
57 1/4, Lilly rose 1 1/2 to 54 1/2, Pfizer leaped 1 3/8 to 66 3/4 and 
Schering-Plough rose 1 3/8 to 71 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other classic growth stocks also rallied. Investors often turn to these 
predictable-growth shares when they expect the economy to slow, jeopardizing 
earnings growth of industrial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among retailers, Home Depot jumped 2 3/8 to 44 3/8 after posting strong 
second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings reports also boosted Dayton-Hudson 1 3/4 to 85 1/4, Toys R Us 2 to 35 
3/4 and Wal-Mart 1/2 to 24 1/4. But J.C. Penney dropped 1 3/4 to 47 1/8 on its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other growth issues, Pepsico gained 1 1/4 to 32 3/8 after saying it 
will resume its share-buyback program. Rival Coca-Cola jumped 1 3/8 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among technology shares, Hewlett-Packard rocketed 8 1/2 to 87 5/8 after 
posting sharply higher earnings. Other tech issues gaining included Texas 
Instruments, up 1 3/8 to 84 5/8, Autodesk, up 1 3/4 to 51 1/2, and Compaq, up 1 
1/2 to 36 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial issues rose despite concerns about a slower economy. GM 
gained 1 1/8 to 51, Cummins Engine added 1 to 39 3/4 and Scott Paper was up 1 
1/4 to 63 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index jumped again, helped by a 
bullish report on second-quarter economic growth. The Bolsa rose 43.10 points 
to 2,694.60, highest since Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo on Tuesday, the Nikkei rose 160.03 points to 20,786.36. Frankfurt's 
DAX average added 4.30 points to 2,143.14 and London's FTSE-100 index was up 
5.2 points to 3,147.4.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; A PLACE IN HIS HEART FOR COMPAQ'S AERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, I broke my collar bone and suddenly found myself in need of a 
computer that I could use from bed. Help arrived in the form of a Compaq 
Contura Aero 4/25, a sub-notebook computer that's small and light enough to 
plop down on my midsection as I work from a reclining position. I'm up and 
around now, but the machine still comes in handy. At 3 1/2 pounds, it's light 
enough to carry with my one good arm. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to have an arm in a sling to appreciate this machine. With a 
retail price as low as $899 for the basic unit, the Contura Aero represents an 
excellent value for anyone who needs a second computer to take on the road. 
It's also a good primary unit for a college or high school student, who could 
carry it to class to take notes and then use it with a keyboard, mouse and 
color monitor at home or in the dorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub-notebook computers generally weigh 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds. They typically 
have undersized keyboards and lack some features that are standard on larger 
notebook and laptop computers. The Contura is one of several fine sub-notebook 
lines. The Toshiba Portege machines and the IBM ThinkPad 500s are particularly 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic Compaq Contura comes with four megabytes of memory, an 84-megabyte 
hard disk drive and an excellent monochrome display. Its 25-megahertz 486SX 
central processor is fast enough for most Windows and DOS programs. 
</P>
<P>
 By today's standards, an 84-megabyte hard disk is pretty small, but you can, 
in effect, double the capacity by using the disk-compression program that comes 
with MS-DOS 6.2. If you plan to install a lot of software, you'd be better off 
spending $1,199 for the 170-megabyte version. Compaq also offers a version with 
color display, a faster (33-megahertz) CPU and a 170-megabyte hard drive for 
$1,799. (Keep in mind that the basic configuration is almost never enough; by 
the time you've added a modem, external floppy drive and the near-essentials, 
the machine is going to cost at least several hundred dollars more than the 
base price.) 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq's own mail-order division ((800) 888-5858) is out of the 84-megabyte 
version, but you can get it from retailers such as LA Tronics and some other 
mail-order sources. Compaq is likely to discontinue this model in a few weeks, 
in favor of the 170-megabyte version. 
</P>
<P>
 Four megabytes of memory is fine if you're using DOS software or an integrated 
Windows word-processing, spreadsheet and database program such as Microsoft 
Works. My word-processing program (Word for Windows 6.0) is a bit slow with 
four megabytes of RAM, but it runs great now that I've upgraded to eight 
megabytes by plugging in a $245 memory module. 
</P>
<P>
 An external floppy disk drive costs $99. If you plan to connect an external 
monitor or keyboard, you'll need to spend $39 more for a Mobile Port Extendor. 
These options are built into most full-size notebook computers, so if size and 
weight aren't important, you may be better off with a notebook PC that weighs 
between five and seven pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other sub-notebooks, the Contura Aero has a smaller keyboard than regular 
notebook machines. Compaq reduced the size of each key and the distance between 
keys to 95% of standard. The keys on sub-notebooks from Toshiba, IBM and most 
other companies are 90% of standard, and that extra 5% can make a difference to 
touch typists. I find myself making relatively few typing mistakes on the Aero 
compared to other sub-notebooks. As with the Apple PowerBooks, the keyboard is 
recessed behind a palm rest, which makes the machine comfortable to use even 
when you don't have a tray or table to rest it on. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine's track ball is in the lower right corner, which would ordinarily 
be inconvenient for me since I'm left-handed. With my left arm in a sling, 
though, it's working out just fine. All track balls and mice start to 
malfunction if dirt gets under them, and the track ball that comes with this 
machine collects dirt very quickly. Compaq will mail owners a free replacement 
track ball that requires less maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The floppy drive plugs into the machine's one PCMCIA slot. Don't worry about 
what PCMCIA stands for -- it's a slot on the computer that lets you plug in a 
credit card-size peripheral such as a modem, network adapter or even another 
hard disk drive. I use the slot for a modem, which I have to remove every time 
I use the floppy drive, but it's not necessary to turn off the machine to 
change PCMCIA cards. The machine comes with software and a serial cable that 
allows you to transfer files with your desktop machine without having to use 
the floppy drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The machine comes with a three-year warranty and toll-free access to technical 
advice. The technical support department is great if you can reach them -- I 
wound up on hold for between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on when I called. If 
you need warranty repair, Compaq sends out a courier who picks up the machine 
and returns it two days later. The warranty makes this machine especially 
attractive. Even if the basic machine died the day after the warranty expired, 
your cost of ownership would have been only about $1 a day. Besides, three 
years is a very long time when it comes to portable computers.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; GULLIBILITY NOT REQUIRED: 'BARNUM' IS A BORN CHARMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world of Phineas Taylor Barnum was a world created for the child in all of 
us. Whether they admit it or not, people love to be fooled, to believe in 
humbug. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So if the musical "Barnum" is in large portions humbug, that's just fine, and 
probably is one of the reasons the play is becoming so popular with youth 
theaters. It offers the colors and shapes of the very sort of magic with which 
P.T. would awe his circus audiences a century ago. It was the era of the 
lovable scamp, "Peck's Bad Boy" and the Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford stories, of 
scams that turned out well. It was America in its teen years, and it was fun. 
Kids understand it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Children's Theatre is presenting "Barnum" at the Westminster 
Cultural Arts Center, and though none of the cast is over 18, the very adult 
story of Barnum's career and bumpy marriage is clearly and cleverly assumed 
under the energetic direction of Dave and Claudia Hall and has been 
choreographed with imagination by John Accursi. 
</P>
<P>
 What this show can't do without, of course, is a Barnum, the center ring 
around which everything happens. Matthew Levine, who plays the Prince of 
Humbug, is 14 years old, but you'd never know it. He has a solid understanding 
of Barnum's ability to scam the public, respect for Barnum's knack for twisting 
his practical wife around his little finger and a top-notch singing voice. 
There's also the little matter of capturing the flavor of the vaudeville-tinted 
musical numbers, which Levine has done with apparent ease and a great deal of 
pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Allessandra Stewart is excellent as wife Charity, often disapproving but 
always adoring. Her self-contained, good-humored approach to her husband's 
flights of fancy is admirable. Other standouts in the very large cast include 
Chris Stewart, charming as General Tom Thumb; Trevor Brackney, properly 
energetic as the bravado Ringmaster; Billy Shapiro, properly officious as Amos 
Scudder; Andrea Hough, lyrical and stylish as Jenny Lind and, in the ensemble, 
a firecracker named Scott Weber whose generic clown costume can't hide his 
unbounded joy in entertaining, which he does expertly, whether swaggering 
across the stage or tossing himself with abandon into the air above it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Barnum," Westminster Cultural Arts Center, Hoover Street and Westminster 
Boulevard, Westminster. Friday at 1 & 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 & 7:30 p.m., 
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $5. (714) 502-2244. Running time: 2 hours, 10

POP MUSIC REVIEW; KRISTOFFERSON CLASSICS ARE SWEET TO LOYAL EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever it is that Kris Kristofferson is doing now, it might not quite 
qualify as a career. His last album is a distant memory; it stiffed, and he has 
been without a contract for years. He hasn't made a movie of note since 
"Heaven's Gate" in 1980, and as most critics noted, "Heaven's Gate" sucked 
potatoes big time. 
</P>
<P>
 He evidently has taken it all in stride, though. Someone interviewing him for 
a British publication recently quoted a critic to the effect that in all his 
post-"Gate" films there has been "very little difference between Kristofferson 
comatose and conscious." To which the 58-year-old performer gamely replied: 
"Aw, that's just nit-pickin', ain't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 If he is not perturbed by his plummet from the heavens, neither, clearly, are 
his fans. There may be no loyalty like that of a country fan. On Monday night, 
Kristofferson's first of four shows at the Crazy Horse Steak House (two shows 
Monday, two on Tuesday) was nearly sold out, and even though he had throat 
problems, he was given two standing ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the set, he related that "Willie joined me once onstage, and I said, 
'Thank God you're here. I'm losing my voice.' And he asked, 'How could you 
tell?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kristofferson indeed does have a craggy ravine of a voice, into which his sore 
throat made scant inroads Monday, other than prompting him to cut some songs 
off short. But, as usual, it got the job done, although he certainly has given 
more effective performances at the Crazy Horse in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chief difference between those shows and this one was that, for reasons of 
muse or economic necessity, Kristofferson no longer tours with his fine 
seven-piece band, the Borderlords, a group rambunctious enough to make his 
innumerable songs about freedom feel free. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the past couple of years, Kristofferson has been backed only by 
keyboard player Danny Timms. His current tour is somewhat buoyed by the 
addition of guitar roadie Scotty Music on drums or percussion for several 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Music's presence saved the Monday show from the dire manner in which it 
started, with the once-touching "Help Me Make It Through the Night" being sent 
to disco hell by Timms' barrage of sequenced synthesized drum sounds, 
slap-happy bass and syrupy synth tones. 
</P>
<P>
 That number aside, Timms proved a generally capable sideman, with a piano 
style reminiscent of Leon Russell's and vocals from the Bob Seger school that 
mixed well with Kristofferson's and stood out on three solo numbers. Throughout 
the show, though, the keyboards were mixed so high in the sound system that 
they obscured some lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kristofferson is reported to have an album of new songs in the can, recorded 
with hit producer Don Was, but most of the set was devoted to the usual 
suspects, songs that fall into two schools: his early ones about relationships 
and inner battles, and the more recent ones about politics and causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is one of the few writers who can use the word freedom in nearly 
every song without making listeners gag, his newer songs offer no match for the 
insight and personality that went into his early work. And one couldn't help 
but notice that a full third of his 21-song set was drawn from his debut album 
("Kristofferson," from 1970), and that those were the songs that seemed to 
reach his listeners the most. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, along with the expected classics "Sunday Morning Comin' Down," 
"To Beat the Devil," "For the Good Times" and "The Best of All Possible 
Worlds," we did get to hear the ignored treasure "Casey's Last Ride," a sad 
ballad placed in a British pub where "the lonely men reach for anything they 
can to keep from going home." 
</P>
<P>
 There were a couple of new songs, including one story song evidently titled 
"The New Mr. Me" in which one character is described as having "a face like 
Bobby Dylan, only worse." "Slouching Toward the Millennium," an unreleased song 
Kristofferson has been doing in concert for a few years now, included some new 
observations about the Menendez brothers, the Bobbitts and other recent events, 
but the gist of them was lost in the sound mix.

TOP-GUN CLUB; MORE THAN A FEW GOOD TENNIS PLAYERS FLOCKING TO UNASSUMING, 
OUT-OF-THE-WAY COURTS IN COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're driving down Southeast Bristol Street, looking for the Palisades 
Tennis Club, you'd better be wide awake, and watch for it carefully. It's easy 
to miss the small sign that marks its entrance. But it's there, below the one 
for the Mexican restaurant that is considerably more prominent. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, the tennis courts are there, too, just a few feet behind the 
sizzling fajitas and the steaming flour tortillas. One of the courts is flush 
against the restaurant's back patio. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unassuming setting, this small white brick and stucco building that 
appears to have emerged incongruously in the parking lot. There are only five 
courts and none of them have lights. There is no posh players' lounge inside, 
and no stylish clothes by Fila and Ellesse on racks. No bar. No swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Just tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only things we sell here are tennis balls and Gatorade," Ken Stuart said, 
laughing. He is the owner and general manager, which he says means he works 
there seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many clubs, however, have a player ranked 22nd in the world in doubles 
playing in its club tournaments, as Palisades did with Rick Leach this spring. 
Not many have women players of the caliber of Lindsay Davenport and Debbie 
Graham, who also are on the pro tour, on their membership rosters. Other 
members include pro players Scott Davis, ranked 36th in doubles on the ATP 
computer, and Grant Connell, ranked third in doubles. Many of the region's top 
amateur players play there, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The membership is small by most standards. It's limited to 150 players, and 
it's full now. Stuart says there are more than 30 players on a list waiting to 
get in. But the main difference between Palisades and most other clubs is the 
high level of tennis played there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "top gun" kind of atmosphere, created when Stuart asked that every 
player who walked through the door have at least a 4.5 U.S. Tennis Assn. 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 100 of our players are either low-level Open or A players," Stuart 
said. "We have a lot of players who are ranked high in Southern California, as 
well as nationally in the age divisions. Typically, in even some big clubs, you 
might have 10 or so really good players."  
</P>
<P>
 USC tennis Coach Dick Leach, who lives in Laguna Beach, plays there along with 
both his tennis pro sons, Rick and Jon. He calls Palisades "probably one of the 
most unique clubs around" because of the caliber of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Buck, the director of adult tennis for the Southern California Tennis 
Assn., says Palisades is beginning to get the same type of reputation that the 
Los Angeles Tennis Club once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. Tennis Club used to fulfill that function in the Los Angeles area," 
she said. "Top players who came to town knew they could always get a game 
there. Palisades is getting that reputation now for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The pro at the club is Robert Van't Hof, who at one point was ranked among the 
top 50 players in the world in singles and as high as 25th in doubles before he 
retired after the 1991 U.S. Open. He is now the coach for two pro players, 
Davenport and Todd Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good situation for me because I know I'm always going to be able to 
get a good game at Palisades," said Bill McQuaid, who teaches tennis at an 
apartment complex in Costa Mesa and is ranked No. 9 in Southern California in 
the 30-year-old singles division. "And not having lights doesn't bother the 
good players. All of them only want to play in daylight anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of lights gives Stuart a bit more rest from his morning-to-dusk 
schedule once late fall and daylight savings time arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, Stuart was a fringe player on the pro tour at the dawn of 
open tennis. He played at a time when players such as Arthur Ashe, Rod Laver, 
Stan Smith and John Newcombe were holding center court. "In those days, I had 
to write the tournament promoters a year in advance to try to get into 
tournaments, then wouldn't hear back from them about whether I was in the field 
or not until two or three weeks before the tournament started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart says he never was in it for the money. It wouldn't have made much 
difference. The prize money then was a far cry from today's purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1968, I won four rounds of qualifying for the U.S. Open, then was beaten 
in the first round of the regular draw and ended up getting a check for $100," 
he said, thinking back. "But I thought that was great. Hey, that meant I had 
money to get home." Stuart remembers winning a tournament in Ohio that same 
year and picking up a check for $300. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most money I ever made playing tennis was $35,000 in 1970, and that year 
I was able to qualify at Wimbledon in singles, doubles and mixed," Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart decided he could make more money teaching tennis than playing it, and 
he decided to do that in Long Beach. He taught tennis 10 hours a day, studied 
for a master's degree at Long Beach State and played tournament tennis on 
weekends. In 1973, he became the first general manager and tennis director for 
the John Wayne Tennis Club, which he helped design, in Newport Beach. He left 
in 1979 when a close friend lured him into a sales position with his company. 
He was involved in a variety of entrepreneurial projects in the 1980s, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1992, he decided to return to tennis, and was looking for a place to 
do it. The Palisades Club had been closed for four years, and weeds sprouted 
from cracks in the courts. But Stuart, decided to try to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the idea at the start of making it one of three things," Stuart said. 
"I thought about making it a club for just women or a club for juniors, and 
decided on the third choice, trying to make it a club for top players, players 
with a ranking of 4.5 or above, and that's what I did. I began inviting some of 
the better players I knew, and it developed from that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart said he gave himself a budget of $25,000 to do it. "And now, about 
$95,000 later, here it is," he said, smiling.

RAMS' HENLEY SAYS HE WANTS TO EXPLAIN, BUT FORCED TO WAIT; FOOTBALL: HE INSISTS 
HE IS INNOCENT OF DRUG CHARGES AND WANTS TO PROVE IT, BUT BELIEVES SPEAKING OUT 
IS NOT IN HIS BEST INTEREST.

<P>
 They were there when he was 9, the wind knocked out of him on the football 
field, crying. And they have continued to be there for him through high school, 
UCLA and on to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Saturday night, Darryl Henley had a request of his mother and father: 
Don't come to my game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was terrified," said Henley, Ram cornerback and accused drug dealer. "I 
didn't want my mom to sit up there and be subjected to whatever. My dad said he 
didn't care what people said, he had gone to all my games and he wanted to be 
there, but I couldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean I was terrified about going to the stadium myself, about how people 
were going to react. I arrived, gave my name at the gate and looked at the 
peoples' expressions. OK, it was positive, but how were the other 25,000 people 
in the stadium going to react? 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of my car, there were people there for autographs. Do they believe 
you? Do they believe in you? 
</P>
<P>
 "The real true Ram fans sit in the end zone, just outside the tunnel, and I 
want to tell you, I felt fright. What were they going to say when I came down 
that tunnel? I remember coming out, there was nothing bad, and I know, because 
I was listening for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted Henley last December on charges of cocaine 
possession and distribution, and if convicted at his trial beginning Jan. 10, 
Henley could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains free on $200,000 bail. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue recently 
reinstated Henley, who had taken a leave of absence from football last October, 
and Henley signed a $350,000 contract to play again for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a negative thing with a majority of people," Henley said. 
"They're saying, 'How in the hell can this person look at himself in the 
mirror, not even give a reason to anyone for what has happened and then just 
line up and play football like everything is OK?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to write with a can of paint on this big window: 'I am 
innocent.' I want to tell my story, but I can't. I feel that would be risking 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 10 months since Henley's problems became public, more than a year 
since the Rams became aware of his difficulties, and in all that time Henley 
has declined to explain himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has been made in the paper and I haven't said a word," he said. 
"Early on I kept asking my people, 'Can't I say something? Can't I? Let me 
explain to people.' But I had no idea how important it was for me not to say 
anything until it's time -- until the O.J. Simpson case. I wasn't convinced 
until then." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who faces two murder counts, agreed to speak with detectives without 
an attorney present early in the investigation. Legal experts say now that 
conversation might very well complicate his defense in next month's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew exactly what O.J. had to be thinking when he went in there and wanted 
to talk," Henley said. "That's what I wanted to do, but from a legal standpoint 
they criticized him, tore him up. Who knows what went on in there? Who knows 
what is going to be misconstrued? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what people say and I'd be just like that guy in middle America who 
says, 'You got nothing to worry about if you're innocent.' But so many things 
you say can be misconstrued. I was eating in this restaurant and I ran into a 
judge who told me that he has had hundreds of thousands of people come through 
his courtroom. He said, 'I haven't seen one of them talk their way out of jail, 
but there have been several who have talked their way in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While in training camp, Henley continues to telephone his probation officer 
twice a week as well as meet him twice a month. Bail restrictions, which 
prohibit his leaving a seven-county area of Southern California, will prevent 
him from playing in next week's exhibition in San Diego unless the court rules 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorney, Roger Cossack, petitioned the court Tuesday to allow him to 
travel this season, and asked for a ruling before the Rams' game with San Diego 
on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's freedom and opportunity to play football raised the ire of attorneys 
for the other defendants in the case, who remain jailed, but Henley said he has 
received no special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told there are two reasons they don't give bail: if you're a danger to 
your community or a flight risk," Henley said. "I've never been a danger to the 
community, and now that God has delivered what I've asked, I'm not going to run 
from football. Why would I be so stupid after doing what I was supposed to do 
for the past 10 months?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Henley is not allowed to travel and play in half of the team's 
regular-season games, the Rams might release him. But then uncertainty has been 
a large part of Henley's life for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have I let people down?" he said, repeating the question. "I let myself down. 
This is what I worked for, then 30 days prior (to last year's training camp), 
it's almost smashed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let my parents down with the negative stuff. It doesn't matter what it is 
or in what context, they have to answer to it. I'm not saying by any means that 
I have done this, but it's just the implication -- it lets people down and 
hurts people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a federal affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana last October, 
federal drug agents said Henley and Tracy Donaho, a Ram cheerleader at the 
time, showed up on July 15 at the Atlanta airport to claim a suitcase 
containing 12 kilos of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Henley also allege that his Brea home served as a hub for 
a drug operation with distribution points in Atlanta and Memphis. Six weeks 
later, Henley told Anaheim police that he was accosted at Rams Park by three 
men, one of whom displayed a gun. He said they took his car, which contained a 
loaded 9mm pistol. Three men were later indicted on federal extortion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "People believe what they read, but unfortunately believing what you read is 
not always the best policy," Henley said. "With the things that are written, 
it's hard to be objective. I don't blame people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared from the time I realized I was this person, this implicated 
person. But I also knew, that what with everything being said, they had the 
burden of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to work, he said, none of his teammates have asked if he is 
guilty or innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the coach (Chuck Knox) has something to do with that," Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because charges have been filed against him, he said, there will be many who 
think there has to be some truth to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of overrides innocent until proven guilty," Henley said. "But then 
if this happened to somebody else, and I was paying money to watch football 
games and I thought football players were role models, I'd be saying, 'What the 
hell is this person thinking?' That's what I would be saying without knowing 
any more details." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, he said, he had hoped to make this more than a one-sided story. His 
trial had been scheduled for last February, then postponed to May, again to 
August and now to Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was yelling at my attorneys, 'Why isn't this over? I need to get on with my 
life.' The only way for me to be functional every day was to hope I could come 
back and play football. Three times I tried to start working out, and I never 
could get past 10 days before quitting. I'd get myself ready and then the trial 
would be delayed, and it would just kill me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a friend, Ronald Knight, who would call every morning. 'Man, get up,' 
he'd say. And I'd tell him I don't want to get up. I would just sit in my 
attorneys' office. I had nothing to do. I tried blinking my eyes several times, 
but it just wouldn't go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley had been scheduled to go to trial on Aug. 23, which would most likely 
have kept him from playing this season. The postponement to Jan. 10 was his 
first real good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say if it never goes to trial, you should be happy," he said. "I 
think in order for my life to go on, things have to happen in trial. Before, it 
was a day I wanted, but really didn't want. The reality of the situation is, 
hey, you can go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "After dealing with the reality and you have said you have not done this, then 
you have to be a tough . . . and fight this. I have to have that trial if I 
want to get things back to normal, well, halfway normal again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government said for some reason, and God knows they won't, that they 
were dropping charges, that would do nothing for me. I don't want to risk my 
life going to jail, but this has to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 If successful in defending himself, will it be enough to restore his good 
name? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think historically it has ever been done," Henley said. "I've taken a 
sock in the ribs financially, but if I play well this season it can put me back 
where I was. I call that get-back, and it's a major motivation. For all the 
people that were hurt, including myself, I have a chance to get it back. But it 
has to be done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley will be an unrestricted free agent at season's end and, if he plays 
well and then is exonerated, undoubtedly will command big money to play in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I can begin to piece my life together," he said. "Not put it back 
together totally, but piece it together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have stood by him from the beginning. They were aware of the possible 
charges against Henley last July and allowed him to play on. He didn't play in 
11 games after taking a leave of absence, but the Rams paid him his entire 
$600,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Shaw (Ram president) came to my room and told me, 'I know what you're 
going through. You're going to have good days and bad days. You're going to 
want to talk about it, but you can't. Period. Here's my home number, call if 
you need something.' That was July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "John told me it was going to happen. He looked me right in the eye, and said 
it might not be what I want to hear, but the indictment is going to be handed 
down. He talked to me every week, and he said if my head was about to blow up 
and I needed time away he would talk with (Knox) and get me a day off. We 
weren't 14-2 or anything like that. He was taking care of me as a person. This 
wasn't some sort of football issue and that was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the NFL reinstated Henley two weeks ago, he was free to sign anywhere in 
the league. He immediately came to terms with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Shaw after I was reinstated that you can pay me one dollar a week to 
play again. What he did was big. I had someone from another team, that was 
trying to sign me, say that any other team would have reacted the same way. 
Maybe on the surface, but there were things happening behind the scene. Chuck 
called to check on me, Joe Vitt, Rod Perry, George Dyer, all the defensive 
coaches called." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henley had kind words for his coaches, he returned to training camp 
with a chip on his shoulder. He blamed the media for listening to the 
government's side of the story, and took a confrontational approach with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not function with all the emotions running wild inside of me," he 
said. "My mother was reading things about me in the paper. I was hating people 
for what they were thinking. That was my attitude: I don't care, I don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've learned a lot the past two weeks about handling situations I don't 
want to deal with. I'm not a jerk. I'm not walking around thinking this isn't 
any big deal and I'm going to walk. No, no, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing everything within the confines of the (bail restrictions). The 
government people involved in this are not my enemies. People are just doing 
their jobs, and while that's not easy to accept, there's no reason for me to 
blast anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Assistant U.S. Atty.) John Rayburn went to my high school. When he graduated 
from college he got a law degree. When I graduated from college I became a 
football player. I'd rather have our paths cross at a Damien High School Alumni 
Assn. meeting, but that hasn't happened. These are the cards that have been 
dealt." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he was advised by friends and attorneys not to give this 
interview, but he said he wanted fans to understand why things have happened as 
they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just like people to think about it," he said. "I want to address things, 
but if they were in my situation, and by God they don't want to be, they 
wouldn't do anything differently right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing that could prepare me for this. The first time I went to 
court I almost passed out. To hear the charges, the things they were saying 
about you, you wonder just where did they come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think, 'How the hell did I get myself into this?' But then that's a 
statement that can be misconstrued. Someone could come back in court and say, 
'What did you mean by that?' That's why I have to be careful. The safer version 
of that is, 'Why am I here?' That's it. Everything you've said you are held 
accountable for . . . there's so much I want to say, and I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he does get the chance to talk, though, he will do so for the benefit of 
12 peers, who will determine his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attorney says when I open my mouth about this case it will be to the 
people who count," he said. "But if any kid is going to get anything out of 
this, I'd tell them to beware, just beware."

KIMBLE VOWS TO BOUNCE BACK; FORMER LOYOLA STAR CHASES NBA DREAM DESPITE 
FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bo Kimble still believes. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling he has now is not so very different from the adrenaline-primed 
determination that carried him and his Loyola Marymount teammates on that 
spine-tingling NCAA tournament run after Hank Gathers had collapsed on the 
court and died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 His belief is dogged and passionate -- and probably a little irrational. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble still believes he can play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been little more than four years since the Clippers made Kimble a 
lottery pick by taking him eighth in the NBA draft. It was a decision that 
ranks among the worst of the Clippers' bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, Kimble's career is a shambles. What remained of his five-year, 
$7.25-million contract was bought out by the New York Knicks last year after he 
had appeared in only nine games the season before. 
</P>
<P>
 He was even sent packing by a French team in December when his struggling Lyon 
club made personnel changes. His name has become synonymous with a wasted pick 
-- a player who might bomb is "another Bo Kimble." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a 68-point game last month in the summer pro league at UC Irvine didn't 
convince many scouts that he will ever make it in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't think he can play," said one scout who wants to see Kimble make 
it but doubts he will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to give up," Kimble said. "For a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble has always had an amiable confidence about him, but now that assurance 
seems more than a little deluded. He is one of the few who believes his failure 
has been merely a question of circumstance and opportunity -- and the 
misfortune of being a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys who I've played against and who I've dominated throughout my 
career, I see them playing," he said. "It's really hard for me because I know I 
should be out there also. Guys like Lionel Simmons, Pooh Richardson, these are 
guys who are friends of mine, but guys I used to get the best of throughout my 
career. So it's frustrating to see them playing and know that I belong out 
there and not to have that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 NBA scouts say there's a reason: The abilities that made him the NCAA scoring 
champion with a 35.3-point average in 1990 have not translated to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some question his quickness. Most question his defense. Others question his 
strength or ballhandling, or wonder what position he really should play, 
shooting guard or small forward. Still others think the Loyola system that made 
him famous created a player who can't adjust to the NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the one thing that always seemed rock-solid-certain about Kimble came 
into question once he reached the NBA: his outside shot. At Loyola, he rained 
down jumpers from beyond the pro three-point line, shooting 41% from 
three-point range his senior season, and 53% overall. His first year in the 
NBA, he made 29% of his three-point shots and a wretched 38% overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble understands this is an important summer, and his goal was clear: He 
needed numbers. Numbers got him attention in Loyola's prolific scoring game, 
and he needed them again. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to catch some scout's eye, he called clear-out after clear-out to 
take his man one on one. He got his numbers, averaging 35 points and shooting 
57%, 35% from three-point range. Still, not many are convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks like the same Bo Kimble to me," said Frank Hamblen, assistant coach 
for the Milwaukee Bucks, after watching Kimble play. "Defense is not a priority 
in his game. He has a selfish game, a shooter's mentality. But maybe he's just 
playing to his game, because he can really shoot the ball with great range. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy I think really needs to learn the structure part of basketball 
instead of up and down and let it go. I don't think he benefits by playing in 
the L.A. summer league per se, unless he gets with a coach who's going to have 
some structure. This is like he played in college, up and down, up and down." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he drove the lane with ease against lax summer defense, not many are 
convinced he can do it regularly in the NBA, where the guards are quicker and 
Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo wait in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a problem getting to the basket," he said. "I've just had a 
problem getting on the court to get to the basket. I'm not deterred at all, 
though. I'm hoping that before the later years I do get a true opportunity 
because I have a lot to show people." 
</P>
<P>
 He might have to show them in the CBA first. The Rapid City Thrillers recently 
traded for his rights, gambling they can sign him, even though Kimble would 
prefer the NBA or Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players like Bo are really what the CBA is good for," said Eric Musselman, 
coach and general manager of the Thrillers and the son of Bill Musselman, the 
former Minnesota Timberwolves' coach. "I think especially with expansion, 
Toronto and Vancouver coming in, the CBA is a good route. A lot of times 
players in this league can build their confidence up, and playing here becomes 
a short-term thing to help them get back to the NBA. . . . I know this: If he 
plays in our league, he'll be back in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to forget that Kimble's NBA career began well. With Ron Harper out 
with a knee injury, Kimble started 22 of his first 23 games as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hammond, a former Clipper assistant coach who is now an assistant and 
director of scouting for the Detroit Pistons, remembers the excitement 
surrounding Kimble's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," he said. "We'd go around during the exhibition season and 
they would introduce Charles Smith, Danny Manning, Ken Norman. Then they'd 
announce Bo, and he got a standing ovation everywhere we went." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite some high-scoring games, by December, inconsistency and a 
spiraling shooting percentage had cost Kimble his starting job. Harper returned 
and Kimble's playing time dwindled to single-digits, when he played. 
</P>
<P>
 His confidence crisis deepened, and he never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Clippers, I was told not to play the way I played at Loyola 
Marymount," he said. "Not to shoot a lot of jumpers. They put emphasis on that. 
Therefore I was caught into hesitating on shots I knew I could make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to unity, and there was no unity on the Clippers. I'm used to 
playing as a team and being together. But NBA basketball is quite different 
than anything I've experienced. I didn't have the support of the coach (Mike 
Schuler). If you're drafted to be the scorer and the shooter, and your coach is 
telling you, 'You're not at Loyola. Don't shoot this shot, don't shoot this 
shot.' Well, then you start to wonder. I kind of lost my identity of who I 
really was. If I can't shoot and score, do what I do best, well, then what do 
you want me to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond spent a lot of time with Kimble after practices, and found himself 
amazed at Kimble's shooting ability, then equally amazed that he couldn't seem 
to show the same touch in games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He still has put on some of the most amazing shooting performances I've seen, 
not in a game, but just shooting around," Hammond said. "He'd shoot 25 
three-pointers, NBA range, and make 20. He'd shoot 25 again, make 21. He'd do 
that consistently, but then he'd get in a game, and he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Kimble was traded to the Knicks, a throw-in in the trade that brought 
Mark Jackson to L.A. He was an unneeded fifth guard, and he spent most of the 
season on the bench or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing the things I know now, I wouldn't have wanted to play for the 
Clippers," Kimble said. "It doesn't represent what true NBA basketball is 
about. When I went to the Knicks, I personally feel I went from worst-class to 
first-class." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Westhead, Kimble's coach at Loyola, said he is still "a little puzzled" 
over Kimble's difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was the kind of player who would always find a way to score," 
said Westhead, now at George Mason University after an unsuccessful stint with 
the Denver Nuggets. "Whether that meant he'd be a standstill jump shooter or a 
guy who'd take it to the basket or somewhere in between, I didn't know. But I 
thought he was a very creative offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there'd be hurdles to overcome (adjusting to the NBA), but I thought 
he had a confidence about him that he would do fine. . . . I thought his 
outside shot would have been good enough to carry him." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, I was surprised at his reluctance to shoot the ball," said 
Westhead, who was coaching Denver at the time. "All at once he became a passer. 
He'd get the ball and reverse it. That wasn't Bo. Bo gets the ball and says, 
'I'm going to score.' That was a sign he wasn't comfortable with his game or 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it becomes easy to track. Once your minutes go down, if you're a shooter 
you start playing tight. If you're not making shots, your minutes keep going 
down, and unfortunately what happens to a player is he begins to second-guess 
his shot and he goes spinning downward." 
</P>
<P>
 More than one scout thinks Loyola's system hurt Kimble's pro career -- 
pointing out that it didn't work in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might have been the all-time guy who was in the right place at the right 
time," one said. "Maybe the Loyola system, which made him what he is and got 
him his money, also put him in the position he is in. The way Loyola played 
wasn't about defense. It wasn't about doing the little things. It was just 
about outrunning everybody and outscoring everybody. There was no such thing as 
a bad shot for Bo Kimble at Loyola. In the NBA, there is." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kimble says "the system" made stars out of some marginal players, but he 
does not mean to include himself. He remains convinced he has the talent to 
make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players know I belong out there," he said. "The people who watch the 
game, they don't understand. All they see is Bo Kimble, great shooter, great 
scorer, not playing. So they think a variety of things. But the players, among 
ourselves, we know who has the talent to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 The way Kimble has always carried himself means there are a lot of people in 
his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even I got caught up in (Loyola's story)," Hammond said. "He was so 
possessed, the way he played, the way he carried himself. I mean, he was on 
'The Today Show' and all those others. I said, 'What a person. This guy really 
believes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He still believes, but the odds are lengthening, especially at 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it hasn't worked for him," Westhead said. "It could have, 
perhaps, with good luck and confidence, gone the other way. If Bo Kimble were a 
starting guard in the NBA, nobody would have been surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the NBA is a tough league. There are always new players coming up each 
year. They get the biggest contracts and there isn't a lot of room left. If you 
don't make it in the first couple of years of your contract, there are a lot of 
replacements stockpiled behind you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo, I think, is a very resilient and tough-minded guy, especially when the 
odds are against him. He's the kind of guy, if you push him, he'll play better. 
The question now is, is anybody listening? For his sake, I really hope so. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it takes is one team that has a need. I think that's the harder part. I 
don't think it's a cracked Bo Kimble who can't get his game together. I think 
he can and will. . . . I hope for him that he does."

PENSKE HOPES TO PUT CART BEFORE HORSE; AUTO RACING: HIS PROPOSED CALIFORNIA 
SPEEDWAY ALREADY IS ON THAT GROUP'S SCHEDULE FOR INDY CAR RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Penske's California Speedway is on the 1996 CART Indy car schedule and 
has been approved for a date on a future NASCAR Winston Cup schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all that's needed is a track. 
</P>
<P>
 Before work on a facility can even begin, however, the site must be cleared of 
toxic waste and approved by the California Environmental Protection Agency. 
Then permits must be granted by the County of San Bernardino. All of which 
takes time -- and money. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed site is 500 acres of a 1,175-acre parcel where the Kaiser steel 
mill operated from 1942 to 1983, only a few miles east of the old Ontario Motor 
Speedway property. Located near the intersection of Interstates 10 and 15, it 
is bordered by Cherry Avenue on the east, Etiwanda Street on the west, San 
Bernardino Avenue on the south and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railway on 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering most of the property are rusting machinery, ramshackle buildings, 
stacks of pipe, piles of slag from the mining operation and dusty weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1993 annual report, Kaiser Resources, Inc., owner of the property, 
estimated the cost of remediation at between $11 million and $32 million, 
"depending on which redevelopment or remediation alternatives are selected" for 
the entire 1,175 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only about eight to 10 acres (of the 500 involved) need serious remedial 
cleanup," said Les Richter, who began work Monday as point man on the project 
while on loan from his duties as a NASCAR senior vice president. That area is 
where the coke ovens were located. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Czarnecki, president of Penske Speedway, Inc., which operates Michigan 
International Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., and Nazareth Speedway in Nazareth, 
Pa., and hopes to operate the proposed California track as well, said he 
expects Kaiser to have the 500 acres bulldozed, graded and ready for 
construction by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kaiser owns the property and is responsible for the cleanup," Czarnecki said. 
"Penske will be responsible for building and maintaining a two-mile tri-oval 
with 60,000 seats and conducting major stock car and Indy car races." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Kaiser site rings a bell, it is because that is where Agajanian Prime 
Ventures, headed by Cary Agajanian, proposed building a multifaceted racing 
facility last year. Others involved in the Agajanian proposal included Roger 
Werner, president of Prime Ticket, and Bill Daniels, prominent Denver sports 
financier. 
</P>
<P>
 Agajanian, a Universal City attorney whose family operated the Ascot Park 
half-mile oval until it was closed in November of 1990, signed a letter of 
intent for use of the steel mill site in March of 1993. Kaiser officials say 
the agreement expired last October before negotiations were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They changed the rules on us," Agajanian said. "We were told at first that 
Kaiser would do the cleanup and we would construct the race track. But later 
they said we had to share the cleanup costs. We could not agree to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Agajanian option lapsed, Penske representatives entered the 
picture through the suggestion of Solomon Bros., a New York underwriting firm 
that does business with both Penske and Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we were told that Agajanian was out of the picture, Roger (Penske) and I 
took Dan Larson (president and CEO of Kaiser Resources) and Rick Stoddard 
(chairman of the board) to Michigan last fall to give them the feel for the 
facility," Czarnecki said. "At that time, we were concerned that perhaps Kaiser 
was riding two horses, but they assured us they were not. At no time did we 
want to encroach on Cary's (Agajanian's) deal." 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement between Penske and Kaiser was signed last March, the week after 
the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Penske Speedway's experience in the development and operation of 
motorsports facilities, combined with the local community and political 
support, we intend to make every effort to bring this concept to reality," 
Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske resolved the financial issue of cleanup by giving 20% of the assets of 
the Michigan and Nazareth Speedways to Kaiser Resources. Kaiser will also 
retain 20% of the California facility's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track will be a mirror image of Michigan International Speedway," 
Czarnecki said. "The only difference may be in the banking. We have talked with 
drivers and racing officials and it is possible that the Fontana track may have 
15-degree banking instead of the 18 degrees at Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen track sites have been proposed for Southern California since 
Ontario was razed in 1980 and Riverside International Raceway was closed in 
1988 to make way for a Moreno Valley mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Arciero was going to build one in Palm Springs, then switched his site 
to Moreno Valley, near the De Anza Cycle Park. Dan Greenwood had proposals for 
the Prado basin in Corona, the Alberhill area near Lake Elsinore, and a parcel 
in Perris. Carl Godfrey announced plans for a track near Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of promoters, among them Gary Sigman, Don Brown and Thomas Lipiri, 
had proposals to build in Glen Helen Park, a San Bernardino County recreational 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Mickey Thompson had options on land in City of Industry for a track. 
Chris Pook, promoter of the Long Beach Grand Prix, has announced plans for an 
oval in Signal Hill. Agajanian looked at sites in Lancaster and Riverside 
county before Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those plans ever materialized. What makes this one different? 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone has the clout to pull off building a track in Southern California, 
it's Roger Penske," a high-ranking racing official said earlier this month 
during the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. "Everything he tries, 
selling cars, leasing trucks, building diesel engines, running race teams, is 
successful. And Lord knows, Southern California needs a racetrack." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that sets the Penske plan apart is that it has sanctions for races 
from CART and NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can build a big top, but no one can guarantee anyone can come to the 
show unless you have a sanction," Czarnecki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows were raised in the racing community when NASCAR gave its long-range 
approval for a date because the stock car racing organization had never offered 
a sanction before a track was completed, much less not even started. Then it 
gave permission for one of its vice presidents, Richter, to become heavily 
involved in the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the sanctioned dates was as important to us as it would be for a city 
to get a major league baseball or football franchise before it built a new 
stadium," Richter said. "From NASCAR's viewpoint, Bill France knows how 
important the Southern California market is to the sport. We have wanted back 
here ever since Ontario and Riverside closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Penske also has close ties with CART and NASCAR, other than as a track owner. 
</P>
<P>
 His Indy car team of Al Unser Jr., Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy has 
dominated the season this year, Unser having won the Indianapolis 500 and the 
team having won eight of 11 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske also has a Winston Cup team with Rusty Wallace the driver. Wallace has 
won five races and is third behind Dale Earnhardt and Ernie Irvan in points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fontana site is not the first explored by Penske in Southern California. 
Last year, he and Czarnecki looked at property in Carson, near the Goodyear 
blimp hanger, but decided they could not get sufficient land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger and I have talked for a long time about the need for a track out here," 
Czarnecki said while visiting Kaiser headquarters in Rancho Cucamonga. "It 
turned out that Fontana is perfectly suited for us because Penske has a large 
truck leasing facility in Fontana and other businesses in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Penske holdings in Southern California include car dealerships in El Monte, 
Downey, Westminster, Ontario and Bakersfield, with 830 employees; 17 truck 
leasing locations with 384 employees, and the western regional office of 
Detroit Diesel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter was chosen to head the California Speedway project because he was a 
prime mover in the development of the Michigan track, which will be the model 
for the Fontana facility, and as former president of Riverside International 
Raceway he is familiar with contractors, suppliers and the like in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the toxic cleanup progresses according to plan, work could start on the 
track by January.

won, 15-0, 15-0, 15-0. Then this big lifeguard got mad at me because he cut 
open the volleyball and found it was corked. Now I can't go back to the beach

 We went to France to something called a four-star restaurant. But the only 
star I saw there was me. Then the waiter got me hot because he asked me to take 
off my baseball cap and to stop chewing tobacco and spitting it on the rug. I 
said, "Hey, here's a hundred bucks, buy some shampoo. Now bring me a bleepin' 
cheeseburger." French dudes. Rude, man.

 Even though groups in nine cities have submitted bids for new baseball teams, 
Harrington, chairman of the Schedule Format Committee that is considering 
expansion, said many clubs fear adding teams will end up costing them money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this notion out there we may expand and get this $150 million 
expansion fee," he said. "It is not in baseball's best economic sense to 
expand, because you have to divide the pot up by a greater number of clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding two more clubs -- bringing the total to 30 -- would cost each of the 
existing teams about $1 million per year in TV and other revenue because it 
would have to be split among more clubs, Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may not be expansion in baseball because a lot of clubs don't want to 
give up a million dollars a year to expansion teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion process also might be delayed because of the strike and the lack 
of a collective agreement between owners and players.

 Gene Budig, the new American League president, said he believes the Seattle 
Mariners have a chance to get a baseball-only stadium to replace the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Budig, who spent part of last week in Seattle, said he still wasn't sure when 
the Kingdome would be playable again. With players on strike, it's not a factor 
now for the Mariners, but it does affect the Seahawks, who were forced to play 
an exhibition last weekend in Tacoma, Wash. The Kingdome is unplayable because 
acoustic tiles are falling from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something good is coming out of this for the Mariners," Budig said. "I think 
there is growing sentiment for a baseball-only facility." 
</P>

 A lawsuit filed on behalf of fans and sports bar owners in an attempt to stop 
the strike has been dropped, lawyer Mark Rubin said in Jacksonville, Fla. The 
suit was dropped after the players union threatened to seek legal fees and 
costs if the plaintiffs lost, Rubin said. . . . In Atlanta, a group of fans, 
saying the Braves sold them season tickets under false pretenses, filed a 
lawsuit to recover the cost of the tickets, along with $5 million in punitive 
damages. "They're holding the fans hostage," said Atlanta businessman Bert 
Erling, one of the plaintiffs.

BASEBALL STRIKE REPORT; NO TALKS ARE EXPECTED UNTIL AT LEAST END OF WEEK,

 Day 5 of the strike by major league baseball players passed uneventfully 
Tuesday. There was no communication between negotiators and no meetings were 
scheduled, although the owners' negotiator, Richard Ravitch, said he expected 
to resume talks with Donald Fehr, executive director of the players union, by 
the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr spent Monday and Tuesday in Washington, trying to re-interest Congress in 
a bill that would remove baseball's antitrust exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch, meanwhile, said the owners do not intend to resume the schedule by 
bringing up minor leaguers as replacements for the striking players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no serious thought given to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston, John Harrington, owner of the Red Sox, said at a news conference 
that if the rest of the season is wiped out, along with the playoffs, the Red 
Sox will lose $14 million rather than make $1 million. He said it would be the 
club's first loss since the early '80s. ROSS NEWHAN

SWIMMING / U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS; EVANS SETS MARK WITH 11TH TITLE IN 400 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 World record-holder Janet Evans won the women's 400-meter race in the National 
Swimming Championships for a record 11th time Tuesday, giving the Olympic gold 
medalist her 40th national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans finished in 4 minutes, 8.78 seconds, fastest in the world this year, to 
maintain her domination of the race that dates back to the 1986 Goodwill Games. 
Evans, who has held the world record of 4:03.85 since 1988, has finished first 
in the 400 freestyle 24 times in 25 starts at the national or major 
international level. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristina Teuscher, 16, who will be a junior at New Rochelle High in New York 
this fall, finished second to Evans in 4:11.20 as she qualified for her fourth 
event in next month's World Championships in Rome. Brooke Bennett, a 
14-year-old from Tampa, Fla., who was the second-fastest qualifier in the 
morning trials at 4:13.67, finished third at 4:13.78. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, 22, tied the record for national titles in one event set in the 200 
butterfly last spring by Mel Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans thought her days as a swimmer were over after the competition in 
Barcelona, but now she's thinking about remaining through the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I'm swimming now is I take it all with a grain of salt," 
Evans said. "I'm going to wait and see how I swim this year . . . . I'd love to 
swim in Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Other champions determined Tuesday were Gary Hall Jr. in the 100 freestyle, 
Lea Loveless in the 100 backstroke and Brad Bridgewater in the 200 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Martino beat Nicole Haislett by .54 seconds in a swimoff to determine 
the second American representative in the 100 freestyle in Rome. The two had 
tied for second when the event was held Sunday. Martino won the swimoff in 
55.30 to Haislett's 55.84. 
</P>
<P>
 The championships continue through Saturday.

THEY'RE BACK AND BITING; BELATED RETURN OF YELLOWFIN TUNA GETS WORRIED 
FISHERMEN OFF THE FINANCIAL HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramune Barkus huffed and puffed, and fumbled her rod at times, but eventually 
reeled her fish to the surface, a missile-shaped tuna that deckhand Shawn 
Stewart stuck with a steel-barbed gaff and plopped onto the deck of the Pacific 
Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the rail at the stern, Barkus' husband, Ralph Hemer, was being pulled 
from one side of the boat to the other until he, too, had put his fish within 
reach of the deckhand's gaff. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Davis, having stumbled from her bunk to the stern, wiped the sleep from 
her eyes, promptly hooked up and successfully battled her fish in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Aaron Howell put two small tuna on the boat within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was hooking up and soon the blue-gray deck of the Pacific Dawn was 
littered with 10-20-pound yellowfin tuna, many of them still flopping. 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as the boat's owner, John Shull, was concerned, dawn in the Pacific 
never looked so good as it did on the eventful day last Saturday, when a fiery 
sunrise was merely a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first productive day of the year for San Diego's huge overnight 
fleet, and it seemed to kick-start a season that, to put it mildly, has been 
slow to get under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Shull, 37, and dozens of other boat owners whose vessels have limited range -- 
100 miles or so -- and whose lifeblood is the tuna that usually show in early 
July in offshore waters just south of the Mexican border, had been waiting for 
the ocean to liven up for the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them had been sitting at the docks more days than not. Or if they did 
have a chartered trip, it more often than not resulted in a "dry run," 90 miles 
south and back again over an expanse of sea that in some ways was more like a 
desert than an ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd just troll and troll and troll . . . and we'd catch nothing," said Jon 
Blackman, who occasionally acts as Shull's second skipper. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief encounter with giant bluefin tuna two weeks ago was nice, but most of 
the fish weighed more than 100 pounds and were too tough to tackle. Only a few 
were landed, and thus the counts were low and response by a tuna-hungry public 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boat owners have had it so rough this season that they have had to move 
out of their homes and onto their vessels. Others were, and some still are, 
facing the possibility of having to bail out of the business, losing their 
boats to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with money to spare used the time to work on their boats. Shull 
installed a tuna tower and new deck on his boat, which runs out of Fisherman's 
Landing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it made him sick, seeing all the boats sitting idle at the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so much lumber at the docks in my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range skippers returning from their trips to areas off Baja California 
200 miles and farther south, where fishing for yellowfin and bluefin tuna has 
been outstanding for six weeks, last week began sighting huge schools of 
yellowfin much closer to home and tipped the overnight fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 The news spread fast and, after a good pick on the fish Friday, everyone 
sensed that Saturday would be the big day.  
</P>
<P>
 The docks were bustling Friday night for the first time this summer. People 
jammed the landing parking lots of Fisherman's, H & M and Point Loma 
Sportfishing, and milled about the waterfront by the hundreds, waiting for the 
call to board their boats. 
</P>
<P>
 They filled the tackle stores, making sure they weren't forgetting anything, 
and when it was time, they hurried down the ramps to the boats, clutching their 
gear, looking like miners hoping to strike it rich.  
</P>
<P>
 And many of them sensed that, in a way, they would. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a definite buzz around the harbor tonight," said Shull, watching 
things from his boat while his crew prepared for its overnight charter.  
</P>
<P>
 That buzz was evident well into the balmy night, aboard every boat from the 
Apollo to the Zaida. But it was nothing compared to the buzz on deck Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first jig strike at dawn, signaling a call to arms, or in this case 
fishing poles, to the several other jig strikes throughout the day, Shull's 
customers battled yellowfin and skipjack tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemer, 63, a Glendale lawyer, had chartered the boat well in advance and was 
going to make the trip, tuna or no tuna.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not complaining," he said, after landing his third yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire fleet was enjoying similar encounters with the highly prized 
yellowfin, working an area 40-70 miles southwest of Point Loma.  
</P>
<P>
 And by day's end, it seemed that the summer season finally had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen celebrated and the boat owners breathed sighs of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet reported 1,476 yellowfin tuna, more than twice the number taken 
aboard one- and 1 1/2-day boat trips all summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "This ought to bring them out of the woodwork," one skipper said to another, 
his voice crackling over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 It has, despite a significant drop in the fish counts Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephones at all three landings have been ringing constantly since Saturday, 
and some of the boats have had to turn away customers for the first time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely got people excited," said J.J. Gerritsen, 28, owner of the 
Tracer, which runs out of Fisherman's Landing. "And we definitely need some 
excitement right now." 
</P>
<P>
 What the fleet doesn't need is the drop in counts, such as those experienced 
on Sunday when boats combined for fewer than 500 fish, and on Monday when the 
count dropped to fewer than 200. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still acres and acres of fish down there and everyone knows it," 
assured Phil Lobred, general manager of H & M Landing.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but what good are they if they refuse to bite? 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to even come close to 
matching last year's success.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Morris, general manager at Fisherman's Landing, keeps track of exotic 
fish counts for one- and 1 1/2-day boat trips at all three landings. Through 
Aug. 14 of last year, the fleet combined for 9,559 yellowtail, 7,258 bluefin 
tuna, 5,973 dorado, 3,176 yellowfin tuna and 16 bigeye tuna. Through Aug. 14 
this year, the fleet has combined for 2,947 yellowtail, 2,214 yellowfin, 223 
bluefin and 19 dorado.  
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that skippers currently are sighting and metering schools of 
tuna as close as 25 miles away, and that the fish are spread out over several 
hundred miles. The fleet finally seems assured of several days such as 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that for every day the fish refuse to bite there is a 
subsequent drop in business, which boat owners and landing operators can 
ill-afford. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they now have customers and reason enough to be out there, trying to 
keep the counts up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're turning people away at night because there's so much business now," 
said Kurt Reynolds, 28, owner-skipper of the Rising Star out of H & M Landing. 
"Everybody was hurting bad, but now it's looking like we're going to make it. 
We're still really concerned, though." Catching Up? 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego game fish catches aboard one-and 1 1/2-day boats through Aug. 14 
</P>
<P>
 1993 -- 9,559 yellowtail, 7,258 bluefin tuna, 5,973 dorado, 3,176 yellowfin 
tuna, 16 bigeye tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 -- 2,947 yellowtail, *2,214 yellowfin tuna, 223 bluefin tuna, 19 dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 *1,476 of the yellowfin were caught last Saturday.

 World record-holder Janet Evans won the women's 400-meter race in the National 
Swimming Championships for a record 11th time Tuesday, giving the Olympic gold

</P>
<P>
 Evans finished in 4 minutes 8.78 seconds, fastest in the world in the event

Goodwill Games. Evans, a USC and El Dorado High graduate, has held the world

times in 25 starts at the national or major international level.

 Cristina Teuscher, 16, who will be a junior at New Rochelle High School in New 
York this fall, finished second to Evans in 4:11.20 as she qualified for her 
fourth event in next month's World Championships at Rome. Brooke Bennett, a 
14-year-old from Tampa, Fla., finished third at 4:13.78. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard so much about this race that I was going to have, so I think I 
focused too much on the race," said Evans, who was second after 50 meters and 
then took the lead for good while completing the first quarter of the race in 
1:00.23. She was more than a second ahead of Teuscher at the midway point and 
was never challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans tied the record for national titles in one event set in the 200 
butterfly last spring by Mel Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my 17th nationals," said Evans, 22, who won three gold medals in the 
1988 Olympics and earned a gold and silver in the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans thought her days as a swimmer were over after the competition in

 More than 1,400 people, including team owner Georgia Frontiere and mayors or 
representatives of Orange County's 31 cities, are expected to attend Friday's 
Anaheim Chamber of Commerce/Rams Booster Club Luncheon at the Anaheim Marriott, 
booster club president Frank Bryant said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon, which will feature Ram Coach Chuck Knox and include the 
introduction of Ram players, will be preceded by a "Save the Rams" pep rally, 
which is scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. outside the hotel and in the hotel's 
Grand Ballroom lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant also said former Los Angeles Olympics organizer and baseball 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth will meet with members of the Save the Rams 
committee next Tuesday to discuss strategies to keep the team in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are fielding lucrative relocation offers from Baltimore, St. Louis 
and Hartford, Conn., and the Orange County group plans to present a formal 
proposal to keep the team in the county to Frontiere and team Executive Vice 
President John Shaw by Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth had lent his name to the Save the Rams effort, but Bryant said this 
will be the first time he'll take an active role in group discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's significant because he has excellent ideas, and he's been 
involved in similar negotiations with his experience as commissioner and 
Olympics organizer," Bryant said. "I think he'll bring something to the 
negotiating table that a lot of the rest of us can't." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

BULLFROGS' KICK ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE; ROLLER HOCKEY: DEFENDING CHAMPIONS 
LIMP INTO THIS WEEK'S PLAYOFFS, HAVING LOST FIVE OF LAST SIX GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Bullfrogs were supposed to run away with their second consecutive 
championship, someone forgot to tell the other 23 teams in Roller Hockey 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, with their roster completely composed of minor league ice hockey 
players, the Bullfrogs demolished the competition, winning 17 of 18 games and 
claiming the RHI's inaugural Championship Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, however, the rest of the RHI emulated the Bullfrogs' personnel 
strategy. The imitation has served to flatter -- and flatten -- the Bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champions are limping into the playoffs, which begin this week. 
The Bullfrogs (13-8-1), losers of five of their last six games, open a two-game 
series Thursday at San Jose (13-7-2) before returning for Game 2 on Friday at 
The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teams split the two games, a 12-minute mini-game will follow the second 
game. If neither team wins the mini-game, a shootout will determine the series 
winner. The winner will advance to the Pacific Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 9-1 start, the Bullfrogs are 4-7-1 since the all-star break, sliding 
to a third-place finish in the Pacific. Anaheim's last non-shootout victory 
came nearly three weeks ago, July 29, over Las Vegas, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, arch-rival Los Angeles (18-4) leapfrogged over Anaheim to win the 
division in convincing fashion. The Blades, who have the best record in the 
Western Conference, open the playoffs tonight at San Diego before concluding 
the series at home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier, the RHI in 1994 is bigger and 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't compare them," Sonier said. "It's like night and day." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bullfrog forward Bobby McKillop: "Last season, we outclassed the league 
talent-wise. We knew if we played half-decent, we'd win because the rest of the 
league stunk." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Bullfrogs have had their share of shining and stinking 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Rob Laurie won his first five starts and flashed his all-star form 
by almost posting a shutout over the Blades in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 By Aug. 2, he was a goalie who skated tentatively after a puck in the corner, 
only to have Vancouver's Rob Hyrtsak steal it to score an empty-net goal in 
helping the VooDoo to a 10-8 victory. Laurie is 3-4 since the all-star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Team captain Kevin Kerr's aggressiveness helped set the tone for the 
Bullfrogs' fast start. He had 22 points and drew 87 penalty minutes in his 
first nine games.  
</P>
<P>
 But since receiving a game-misconduct penalty in a crucial 7-4 loss to the 
Blades on July 23, Kerr has only five points and six penalty minutes in his 
last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 McKillop, last season's playoff MVP, scored only one goal during a four-week 
span in July but rebounded to score 10 goals in his final seven regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 So which is the real Anaheim team? Are the Bullfrogs the dominating defending 
champs of the first-half of the season or the chumps who displayed no offensive 
or defensive consistency in the final month of the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're caught in a tailspin that's partly self-inflicted and partly bad luck," 
Sonier said. "Sure the guys might be a little frustrated now. But all I can 
tell them is to stop hitting all those crossbars, goal posts and goalie masks, 
and just put it in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brett Kurtz, Blade assistant coach and forward: "Fatigue could be one 
factor. But I really don't think Anaheim is struggling as much as that the 
other teams have caught up and adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs forward Savo Mitrovic brushed off the idea the Bullfrogs could be 
tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys have to understand that whatever happens, you've got to find a way 
to win," Mitrovic said. "If you think you're tired, you shouldn't be out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries sidelined some of the Bullfrogs' top players, including Victor 
Gervais, McKillop and defensemen Yuri Krivokhija and Joe Cook. Only three 
players -- Steve Beadle, Jim Brown and Mitrovic -- played in all 22 Bullfrogs' 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team is in perfect health heading into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thursday, for the first time, I'll have to sit three healthy bodies," Sonier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais doesn't figure to get much bench time in the playoffs after leading 
the team in scoring for the second consecutive season.  
</P>
<P>
 He was the team's most consistent scoring threat, finishing with 29 goals and 
24 assists. Brad McCaughey (23 goals, 20 assists) and Brown (24 goals, 16 
assists) also had 40-point seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regular season means diddly-squat," McKillop said. "That's just where you 
weed out teams. Sure we've struggled, but we're gearing up for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mitrovic: "We still can win this thing. Don't count us out."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; POSTCARDS FROM 
CYBERSPACE; LATEST PROOF OF CYBERCITIZENSHIP IS 'HYPERTEXT HOME PAGE' ADDRESS 
</P>

<P>
 If you think having your electronic mail address on your business card is 
sufficient proof of cybercitizenship, you might have to think again. The latest 
cachet in cyberspace-aware business cards is having an "http home page" address 
for people to access. 
</P>
<P>
 The ubiquitous e-mail address is only good for sending or receiving electronic 
messages. But the http home page address, otherwise known as HyperText 
Transport Protocol, is a good way of letting others get information about you 
or your company. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to browse http home pages if you don't have Mosaic or 
aren't directly connected to the Internet. If you have Lynx, you can simply 
type lynx at the prompt, then type g followed by the http address you want. Be 
warned: Some http home page addresses are quite lengthy, and must be typed 
exactly as shown, including correct use of upper- and lower-case letters. For 
example, type g, space, http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/ 
DataSources/WWW/Servers.html for a geographic guide to thousands of home pages 
to browse. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a direct Internet connection to your machine, it's difficult 
to set up a homepage address. But some entrepreneurs have begun offering 
complete home page service on their own machines for companies and individuals 
who can't set one up themselves. To see a good example of this kind of service, 
type g http://www.internet-is.com/ from within Lynx. 
</P>
<P>
 For alternate access to a World Wide Web browser, you can use the Telnet 
service. Type telnet fatty.law.cornell.edu and then type www at the log-in 
prompt. This will start up the Lynx browser program, which you can use to 
navigate home pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a selected list of http home pages: 
</P>
<P>
 * http://www.scubed.com:8001/caltrans/transnet.html (updated traffic reports) 
</P>
<P>
 * http://smaug.ucr.edu/Quakes/quakepage.html (current earthquake information)

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; GIVING SURGICAL IMPLANTS IDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 6 million medical devices a year worldwide are surgically implanted 
in people -- everything from breast implants to chin implants, vascular grafts 
and penile implants. Years later, if a patient visits a doctor because of 
problems, medical information such as the manufacturer of the implant or the 
name of the surgeon may not be available. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, if the patient's implant carries an implant of its own -- a 
microchip on which all relevant information has been encoded. Called 
SmartDevice, the chip, which is about the size of a grain of rice, is 
manufactured by Hughes Identification Devices, a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft 
Co. In the event of complications with an implant, a doctor could retrieve the 
information from the chip using a "gun" that emits a radio beam. The gun 
operates in much the same way that decoders in supermarkets decipher bar 
coding. The information on the chip would also be recorded on a computer-linked 
global registry. 
</P>
<P>
 LipoMatrix Inc., 33% owned by the biotechnology company Collagen Corp. of Palo 
Alto, has been issued a patent for the use of SmartDevice in medical devices 
and has begun putting them into its soybean oil breast implants. SmartDevices 
are already in about 100 LipoMatrix breast implants tested since October on 
women in Britain, Italy and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford University Medical Center will conduct a study on the breast implant 
chips starting in September. 
</P>

 Upsizing the Silicon Wafer: Sheer economics seem to have quelled the fiercely 
competitive nature of semiconductor companies. As the cost of fabricating more 
and more transistors onto a chip continues to soar, even major suppliers such 
as IBM and Motorola are forging alliances with their foreign competitors. Now 
the trade associations from various countries have come together to standardize 
the next generation of silicon wafers. 
</P>
<P>
 These wafers are the basic material upon which tiny transistors are etched to 
produce chips. The larger the wafer, the more chips can be produced from a 
single slice of silicon. Since the silicon is grown as a single crystal before 
being cut into wafers, it is no easy task to produce larger sizes. Currently 
the state-of-the-art wafer measures eight inches. In the past, the push for 
ever larger wafers was driven by individual companies seeking a competitive 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the costs of wafer fabrication soaring, it is generally agreed that 
no one company or country can afford to fund the transition to the next 
generation alone. Thus, at a recent summit meeting in San Francisco, 
representatives from the United States, Japan and Europe agreed in principle on 
the next wafer size as well as an international standard for those wafers. The 
representatives have settled on a 12-inch wafer and agreed to form global task 
forces to define the steps for the transition. All that is delaying a 
definitive agreement is a go-ahead from Japan's trade groups.

 Swiss Army Surgery: Conventional surgical scalpels and clamps are of little 
use to surgeons operating on the narrow, twisted, deep-set vessels of the 
brain. That's why a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory biomedical engineer 
has been collaborating with neuroradiologists from the University of 
California, San Francisco. Their aim is to create smaller and better surgery 
tools that can be inserted into the brain at the end of wire-thin catheters. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Allen Northrup, the Livermore engineer, says the goal is to create an array 
of tools -- sort of a Swiss army knife for surgeons. Northrup is working on a 
barely visible mechanical gripping device that can be opened and closed at the 
end of a catheter. Using tools like this, surgeons will be able to manipulate 
objects where their hands cannot go. Such tools would let surgeons quickly 
place or reposition implants such as microcoils, which are used to restrict 
blood flow during surgery. With these new tools, operating room time for brain 
vessel operations could drop from about four hours to 45 minutes.

 Fish Tents: What do you do with old, unused oil rigs, especially when there is 
a federal mandate to remove or convert decommissioned platforms in the Gulf of 
Mexico? A joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and NET 
Systems Inc., a Bainbridge Island, Wash.-based developer of trawl fishing gear, 
wants to turn them into fish pens for the offshore raising of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 A prototype model looks very much like an underwater tent made of netting, 
with the top of the tent anchored to the platform and the wider bottom portion 
anchored to pilings in the ocean floor. Tests of the model indicate that it 
should safely weather rough gulf storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish pens joined to oil rigs also offer alternative employment possibilities 
for people who have lost work as a result of changes in the fishing and oil 
industries.

ASSOCIATES OF SIMPSON REPORTEDLY SUBPOENAED; PROSECUTION: THE GRAND JURY WILL 
HEAR WITNESSES WHO WERE WITH HIM BEFORE HIS JUNE 17 DISAPPEARANCE, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has issued subpoenas for 
witnesses who may have information about the events leading up to O.J. 
Simpson's failure to surrender June 17 and his subsequent disappearance with 
close friend Al Cowlings, sources close to the case said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Subpoenas have been issued to almost everyone at the house with Simpson on the 
morning before he and Cowlings left, sources said. Among those expected to 
testify at the grand jury are Simpson's friend and lawyer Robert Kardashian and 
his girlfriend, as well as four doctors who either examined Simpson or were at 
the house that morning. They include Henry Lee and Michael Baden, the lead 
pathologists assisting the football Hall of Famer's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people who were at the house and who probably will testify include 
Simpson assistant Kathy Randa and employees of Kardashian and Simpson's 
attorney Robert L. Shapiro. Neither Shapiro nor Simpson have yet been 
subpoenaed, but at least Shapiro could be, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said she 
could neither confirm nor deny that subpoenas had been issued. The district 
attorney as a matter of policy does not discuss any issues regarding the grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors may not use evidence obtained in one grand jury investigation to 
assist in the prosecution of a defendant who already has been ordered to stand 
trial. Because of that, evidence gathered by the Cowlings grand jury 
technically could not be used against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al Cowlings did nothing wrong, so in that respect, I'm not concerned," said 
Donald Re, Cowlings' lawyer, of the grand jury's activity. Although grand 
juries are responsible for approving indictments, they also can be an 
investigative tool, so the issuance of subpoenas does not necessarily mean that 
an indictment of Cowlings is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro would not comment on the subpoenas or disclose who was being 
questioned, but said the exercise would hamper Simpson's defense efforts as he 
prepares for a trial that could force him to confront the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more distraction from our job at hand," Shapiro said. "It's a great 
distraction to our defense, which is being prepared in a very short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are expected in court in the Simpson case today. On Tuesday, they 
submitted questionnaires that they want prospective jurors to complete as part 
of what is expected to be a difficult selection process, given the 
extraordinary publicity involving the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys prepared a 40-page list of questions and, like 
prosecutors, submitted it under seal, as instructed by Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito. The prosecution's proposed list of questions was 108 pages long. 
</P>
<P>
 A final list of questions will be culled from those proposed lists and may 
include additional suggestions from the judge. The first batch of prospective 
jurors is expected to receive the questionnaires in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have employed jury consultants to assist in the selection of 
panelists. Defense attorneys last week hired Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, who helped 
pick juries in the cases of the Los Angeles Police Department officers charged 
with beating Rodney G. King and of rioters accused of trying to kill Reginald 
O. Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in O.J. Simpson's murder case, meanwhile, have chosen a 
Torrance-based consultant to help them select jurors.  
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Vinson, chairman of DecisionQuest Inc., pledged to help the 
prosecution team find fair and impartial jurors who would be able to "set aside 
(Simpson's) celebrity status in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every faith that we will be able to select out those people who are 
capable of keeping an open and fair mind," he said at a brief afternoon news 
conference outside his office on 190th Street in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson, 50, said he had been talking with the district attorney's office about 
contributing his legal services in general when prosecutors asked his firm to 
take on the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the news conference, Vinson said it was his 
understanding that the district attorney's office was "overwhelmed by a wide 
variety of people and organizations" participating in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were flattered and pleased to accept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson declined to be specific about what type of work his firm would do, but 
he said that much of his role would be "jury de-selection," identifying 
prospective jurors not likely to accept the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule (in the jury-selection process) is to help identify people who would 
not be able to make a fair and impartial judgment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury consulting experts have said that attorneys are likely to be interested 
in potential jurors' attitudes toward issues such as interracial marriage, 
spousal abuse and a wealthy defendant. During the selection, each side can 
remove an unlimited number of jurors if it can state reasons why jurors are 
biased, and a limited number of jurors for no reason at all. 
</P>
<P>
 DecisionQuest, along with subsidiary O'Connor & Cohen Inc., uses a variety of 
techniques to identify potential jurors, including focus groups and trial 
simulations. The firm has been in business for 20 years, and has worked on many 
high-profile trials, Vinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be doing a number of different things (in the Simpson case), but it is 
premature to focus specifically on what it will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson, who has a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Colorado, 
said he and his colleagues will be able to handle the media attention in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing our staff is prepared to deal with," he said. "We have 
a very short window before trial and a lot of work for everyone to do."

WORTH THE WAIT; MANY SPEND HOURS IN LINE FOR BACK-TO-SCHOOL DAYS CLOTHES 
GIVEAWAY AT DOWNTOWN MISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 She spent the night sitting on a scrap of cardboard and watching her two young 
sons doze fitfully in a baby stroller on a filthy Skid Row sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Campos was a long way from home Tuesday as she waited 17 hours in line 
for free children's shoes and clothes in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She had come from an unlikely place: suburban Tarzana -- a community better 
known for its BMWs and $400,000 homes than for clothing giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind her in a line stretching three blocks were 5,000 others waiting for 
Back-to-School Days to begin at the Fred Jordan Mission. Two other mothers and 
10 other children living in her apartment house were among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might not realize it, but there are low-income buildings in Tarzana 
too," Campos said. "There are people in Tarzana who need help too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission officials do realize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from as far as La Puente and Pomona were among those who stayed out 
all night to receive free shoes, jeans, T-shirts and school book bags Tuesday. 
The distribution resumes today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 445 Towne Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just shows there are poor people everywhere," said Willie Jordan, widow 
of the mission founder. She launched Back-to-School Days seven years ago with a 
goal of buying school clothes for 100 children living in nearby Skid Row 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The program dramatically expanded the next year when Jordan persuaded the Foot 
Locker Stores chain to contribute new shoes. After that, she was able to get 
clothing makers such as Bugle Boy, Cherokee and Paris Blues to donate new 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $750,000 worth will be given to about 7,000 children this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting the school year with new shoes and clothes is important to 
youngsters' self-esteem, said Natividad Lopez, an Eastside mother of five who 
lined up at 6 p.m. Monday behind Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this I'd have to buy cheap shoes for the children," said Lopez, who 
worked as a housekeeper before illness forced her to quit her job four months 
ago. "These are very, very good shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Her 17-year-old daughter, Iris, agreed: "They'll last a whole year. Staying in 
line all night is worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-dozen Foot Locker shop managers and salesmen helped distribute $90 Reeboks 
and Nikes. Another 200 volunteers organized jeans and dresses by size and 
helped youngsters find their right fit. Pizza Hut workers served juice and 
about 5,000 pizza slices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Debbie Mendenhall of Fullerton exchanged 9-year-old Jeffrey Arroyo's 
new sneakers for a larger size when the Eastside boy stepped outside and 
discovered they were too tight. Then she got his 5-year-old brother, Harold, a 
smaller pair when his were too loose. The boys had been in line 16 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Johnny Guzman of Boyle Heights showed up 10 hours early. "I think 
the economy is getting better," said his sister, Sandra Guzman, a student 
nurse. "But something like this is very good for low-income families that have 
to struggle to get by." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the annual back-to-school giveaway has spread far. Judy Bradley was 
among 69 volunteers who traveled by bus from Minneapolis to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos and friends Maria Tapia and Maria Ramos came by car from Tarzana for 
help.

LAPD'S NO. 2 OFFICIAL FACES COMPLAINTS; LABOR: UNION LEADERS ACCUSE ASSISTANT 
CHIEF BERNARD PARKS OF CIRCUMVENTING LAWS IN ORDER TO FILL JOBS WITH FEMALE, 
MINORITY OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Directors of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, in a highly unusual 
move, said Tuesday that they will file a slew of labor complaints against 
Assistant Chief Bernard Parks, the department's second-highest official and one 
of its most admired and feared leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the league, the union that represents rank-and-file Los Angeles 
police officers, are accusing Parks of circumventing labor laws in a campaign 
to fill LAPD positions with female and minority candidates. The result, league 
officials say, is that qualified white male officers are being denied 
promotions solely on the basis of their race and gender. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's creating these labor issues," said Hank Hernandez, general counsel to 
the Protective League, which has convened a special, four-member committee to 
investigate any allegations against Parks. "He's abused his power. That's 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks vehemently disputed that characterization, and other high-ranking 
department officials said they viewed the league's action as an effort to 
retaliate against the black assistant chief for his vocal backing of 
affirmative action goals and to discourage his aggressive management style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league has, in many instances, a very narrow view," Parks said. "You only 
have to look at the makeup of their board to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 The union board has never had a female or black member. Campaigns by several 
black officers in recent years have failed to win enough support to elect an 
African American candidate to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials deny that their action is racially motivated, and Hernandez 
said the union intends to file a class-action grievance today against Parks on 
behalf of narcotics officers who are angry with the assistant chief. In 
addition, Hernandez said, the union expects to file an unfair labor practices 
charge and will seek a complaint with the federal Equal Opportunity Commission. 
League officials also want to discuss their complaints with Deputy Mayor 
William Violante, a former union leader who oversees public safety issues for 
Mayor Richard Riordan, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge to Parks is an admittedly risky gambit for the police union. 
Never before has the league created a committee to focus on the actions of a 
single supervisor, and Parks is a 24-year veteran known to virtually every 
officer in the department. Parks heads the LAPD's Office of Operations, which 
controls all 18 Los Angeles police stations, as well as a number of specialized 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Parks has direct authority over about 80% of the department, and few 
officials in the LAPD command more respect. Police Commission President Enrique 
Hernandez Jr., among others, has expressed his strong support and admiration 
for Parks. Commission President Hernandez is not related to the league's 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even league officials acknowledge that Parks is an intelligent and skilled 
leader, but they say he has ignored labor laws and stirred considerable 
controversy within the department ranks. Last year, for example, Parks ordered 
an audit of the West Los Angeles police station to determine whether alleged 
sexual harassment had made working conditions difficult for female officers and 
civilians at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of that audit, a number of officers have been transferred out of 
the West Los Angeles station. Internal Affairs is expected to follow up that 
work with possible personnel complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line reaction to alleged harassment at West Los Angeles angered some 
officers, but Parks' intervention in recent promotions within the LAPD's 
Narcotics Group was the issue that brought the league into direct conflict with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of internal memoranda obtained by The Times illustrate Parks' 
determination to see that minorities were represented in those promotions. In 
February, for instance, Parks urged Deputy Chief Bayan Lewis to "ensure that 
both gender and ethnic considerations are pushed to forefront" in those 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks followed up that memo with others in subsequent months, including a 
sharply worded missive to Narcotics Group Cmdr. James Jones in May. In that 
document, Parks commended Jones for making some progress but added that "the 
pace is too slow." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I do not see some graphic numbers in the placement of the remaining . . . 
positions, I am strongly going to consider taking a personal involvement in the 
Narcotics Group selection process," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks followed that memo with another one on June 8, apologizing "if my 
previous note was too harsh or hurt any feelings." But he reiterated his 
commitment to making drastic changes in the gender and ethnic composition of 
the detective ranks of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 After Parks intervened in one set of detective promotions, the list of 
eligible candidates was thrown out. New oral examinations have been scheduled 
for three open detective supervisor positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Parks said his actions regarding the promotions in 
narcotics were intended to correct mistakes in the promotion process and to 
insure fairness for all the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process was faulty," he said. "It's our obligation to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 But his moves infuriated some narcotics detectives. One, Horacio Marco, filed 
a labor grievance, and several detectives have asked to address the Police 
Commission next week to air their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has long been faulted for the dearth of women and minorities in its 
upper and middle-management ranks. As a result, department leaders have pledged 
to take aggressive steps to increase that representation. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that increasing diversity is an important goal of the 
department, league officials said they believe Parks has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parks is micro-managing the Police Department," said Cliff Ruff, the 
treasurer of the union and a member of its special ad hoc committee 
investigating Parks. "He's doing everything on the basis of race. I'm concerned 
that he's about to launch a program of ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks angrily dismissed that comment and accused league leaders of ignoring 
their minority constituents in favor of representing the interests of white 
male officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the league was as concerned about discrimination as it is about 
reverse discrimination," Parks said. "We're talking about fairness for 
everyone, not just people who look like Cliff Ruff."

MAN ATTACKS WIFE ON BUS, IS DECAPITATED IN CRASH; FATALITY: ASSAILANT GRABS 
WHEEL FROM HIS ESTRANGED SPOUSE, THE DRIVER, AND LOSES CONTROL OF VEHICLE, 
WHICH SLAMS INTO WALL. NO PASSENGERS ARE ON BOARD.

 A man who attacked his estranged wife on the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority bus she was driving was decapitated when he grabbed the wheel and the 
bus skidded out of control, caromed off a tree and slammed into a brick wall in 
Compton, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Edward Musgrove, 32, apparently had been lying in wait for 
Troylynn Brown-Musgrove, 31, Monday night at the intersection where she usually 
stops for a few minutes before beginning her next run. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown-Musgrove parked the empty Line 45 bus at San Pedro Street and 
Rosecrans Avenue shortly after 9 p.m., "her estranged husband boarded the bus 
and attacked her," Deputy Brian Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She immediately radioed for assistance and began driving away," Jones said. 
"Her husband continued the assault, and while they were struggling he grabbed 
the wheel, causing her to lose control." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the bus traveled about 100 yards before glancing off a tree and 
crashing into the low brick wall. The impact hurled Musgrove through the 
shattered door and into the wall, decapitating him and tearing off his left 
arm, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore Beck, who was working across the street at an auto repair shop, said he 
ran outside to find the bus -- its wheels still spinning and motor running -- 
wedged against the wall, which surrounds another repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lady was running back and forth in the bus screaming, 'Somebody help me! 
Somebody's trying to kill me!' " Beck recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck said that after helping Brown-Musgrove out of the wrecked bus, he saw her 
husband's maimed body sprawled against the base of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," said Beck, 23. "I've never seen anything like it, and 
I was in the military." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown-Musgrove was taken to Gardena Memorial Hospital, where it was determined 
that she was emotionally shaken but not physically injured, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 After questioning by detectives, she was released.  
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide detectives are considering the death accidental," said sheriff's 
Deputy George Ducoulombier.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said that although Musgrove and his estranged wife had been 
involved in a domestic dispute, the motive for his attack has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said he may have been trying to present Brown-Musgrove with some 
unspecified papers when he attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus driver could not be reached for comment Tuesday. MTA officials said 
she had taken a day of sick leave.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SCHOOL 
BOARD VOTES TO OPPOSE 'SOS' INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education members voted 6 to 0 this week to oppose 
Proposition 187, the "save our state" immigration initiative on the Nov. 8 
state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require expulsion of illegal immigrants from California's 
public schools and deny them most health care and social services.  
</P>
<P>
 Supporters, including the state Republican party, Gov. Pete Wilson and several 
taxpayer groups, say the measure is needed to cut costs and stem illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, including the California School Boards Assn., the California 
Teachers Assn. and the state Parent Teacher Assn., said the initiative would 
turn educators into immigration enforcers and burden them with additional 
paperwork, cost the state considerable federal funding and hurt children.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICE 
DETONATE DEVICE AT MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police detonated a military-style device outside the Simon Wiesenthal Center's 
Museum of Tolerance on Tuesday, officials said, but it was not immediately 
clear if the object was a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident at the museum followed the bombing deaths of more than 100 people 
in a building housing Jewish organizations in Buenos Aires, 21 people aboard a 
commuter plane in Panama and two other bombings in London that left 18 people 
injured last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After staff members and visitors at the center at 9760 W. Pico Blvd. were 
evacuated, the device was detonated by the bomb squad experts at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, named for the famed Nazi hunter, was established in 1977 and is 
dedicated to the study of the Holocaust and the preservation of its memory.  
</P>
<P>
 The call regarding a suspicious package came to police about 1:20 p.m. Traffic 
was diverted from the area as ordnance experts examined the package, said Los 
Angeles police spokeswoman Monique Shackelford.  
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on Pico Boulevard was blocked from Century Park East to Beverwil 
Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the second bomb scare at the center since July 28, shortly after the 
blasts in Buenos Aires and London. The July call was canceled after experts 
went over two suspicious trailers parked near the center and found they had 
been rented to a center employee.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER WHO LEFT BABY IN 
HOT CAR PLEADS INNOCENT TO FELONY COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A high school English teacher, described as an intellectual and dedicated 
family man, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a felony charge of endangering his 
20-month-old son by leaving him locked in a car Sunday in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that the actions of Dennis Karl Fischer, 34, "will not go down in 
the annals of history as the smartest thing," Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leland 
Harris nonetheless reduced bail from $50,000 to $10,000, taking into account 
Fischer's clean record. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that Fischer did not intend to hurt his son, and that the boy 
did not require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Darleen Fischer, the defendant's wife and mother of the victim, said she is 
standing by her husband. She said she considers the criminal charge against him 
to be "overblown." Social workers returned the boy to her custody. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who teaches 10th- and 12th-grade English and is the department 
chairman at Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles, was ordered to 
return to court Sept. 13 to schedule a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will determine whether he will stand trial in Superior Court on 
the felony child-endangerment charge, which carries a maximum six-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutor David Mintz allege that Fischer left his son, Jarred, 
locked inside the car in front of a Foster's Old Fashioned Freeze in the 7300 
block of Reseda Boulevard on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts vary of how long the child was left in the car. Fischer estimated 
that his son was alone for five minutes, but passersby told police he was gone 
20 minutes or more, Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler began screaming, and passersby pulled him from Fischer's Honda 
Civic, using a fan belt to unlock the door, Mintz said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz said the temperature inside the car was estimated at 110 degrees and 
that the child could have suffered brain damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added that the three rescuers found the child flushed and 
perspiring, so they gave him water, wrapped him in a wet towel and kept him in 
an air-conditioned car to lower his body temperature. He said one of the three 
rescuers dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer also called police when he came out of the store and found the boy 
gone, fearing that his son had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who rescued the child refused to return him to Fischer until police 
arrived. Officers took Fischer into custody at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I just find all this amazing," said Laura Holden, a physical education 
teacher and the teachers union representative at Fremont.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are just shocked," said Marcia Hines, an assistant principal at 
Freemont. "They're saying, 'No, it couldn't be him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "He's really a fine teacher. He's responsible and reliable. He 
really has a spotless record with teaching. He's an intellectual."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BACK FROM DEATH'S DOOR; 
MAN DESCRIBES TERROR OF RATTLESNAKE BITE ON THE NECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rattlesnake venom was racing through Donald Mathews' veins, causing his neck, 
face and chest to swell like a balloon. His heart was pounding so fast it had 
become a nonstop roar -- he could no longer feel the individual beats. 
</P>
<P>
 As doctors at Antelope Valley Hospital hustled to save his life, the 
64-year-old Leona Valley man felt his throat closing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gasping for air," he said. "I realized that if I didn't let them get 
these tubes down my throat, I was going to die. So I stopped breathing and 
tried to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Within moments, he said, life-giving oxygen poured into his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, recuperating at his house in a scenic rural area just west of 
Palmdale, Mathews talked about his brush with death. His run-in with a rattler 
was especially dangerous, experts say, because the reptile bit Mathews in the 
neck as he was poking his head into his attic. More than 95% of time, snakes 
sink their fangs into arms, legs, feet or hands and the venom spreads more 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mathews' chest and throat are still black and blue from internal 
bleeding, and his stamina is limited. But the retired trade magazine and 
newspaper editor expects to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' ordeal began about 1:30 p.m., July 29, when he reached into his attic 
to check his mouse and rat traps. He heard a rustling sound but did not feel 
the snake bite him. "I withdrew my hand and saw the blood in it," Mathews 
recalled. "That was when I knew I was in deep, deep trouble. I lunged off the 
ladder. I landed on my elbow." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who was home alone, dialed 911 and waited calmly for help. That 
helped keep the venom from spreading even more quickly, firefighters said. 
Mathews attributes his survival to his good physical condition, the quick 
arrival of paramedics and a rescue helicopter, and to the competence of the 
hospital staff.  
</P>
<P>
 He was released from the hospital after six days. The swelling has gone down, 
and Mathews' strength has begun to return. On Monday, he finally felt up to 
having breakfast at a restaurant down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a matter of being brave," he said. "It's a matter of appreciating 
life and knowing that we're all going to die sooner or later. I don't have any 
fear of dying -- especially now."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ALLEGED 
MADAM'S TRIAL SET FOR SAME DATE AS SIMPSON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial of alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, scheduled to start next 
week, was postponed Tuesday to Sept. 19, the same date as the scheduled start 
of O.J. Simpson's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The date could pose an airwave quandary.Football great Simpson is accused of 
murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, and 
preliminary hearings in both trials have received gavel-to-gavel coverage on 
network television, even preempting regular programming. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the Fleiss trial had 
been delayed because the prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan 
Carter, was tied up in a murder case that would not be finished by the 
previously scheduled date of Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is accused of running a high-priced call-girl ring in a case that has 
fascinated and titillated the nation for more than a year. The 28-year-old 
daughter of a prominent Los Angeles pediatrician pleaded not guilty last 
September to four counts of pandering -- procuring the services of women for 
prostitution -- and one count of possessing cocaine.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REDONDO BEACH; TRIAL 
ORDERED IN PIZZA THEFT THAT COULD DRAW LIFE TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted felon who allegedly stole a slice of pizza from four children in 
Redondo Beach has been ordered to stand trial on robbery charges that could 
send him to prison for life under California's "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a preliminary hearing Tuesday in South Bay Municipal Court in 
Torrance, Commissioner Douglas Carnahan ordered Jerry Dewayne Williams, 27, of 
Los Angeles, held to answer on charges of second-degree robbery and felony 
petty theft with a prior conviction.Williams, who has pleaded not guilty to the 
charges, is in custody in county jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Williams and some friends took the New York-style pepperoni pizza 
from the children, ages 7 to 14, as they sat outside a seaside pizza restaurant 
on July 30. The manager called police, who arrested Williams nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Williams has accumulated four felony convictions 
since 1987, for robbery, attempted robbery, drug possession and joy riding. 
Under the "three strikes" law passed earlier this year, anyone convicted of a 
felony who has two or more prior serious felony convictions must be sentenced 
to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment for Williams has been set for Aug. 30.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SUIT BY 2 
LAPD OFFICERS CITES GAY RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers have filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit 
against the city and the Los Angeles Police Department, accusing the department 
of harassing and discriminating against gay and lesbian officers and failing to 
implement administrative reforms ordered by the City Council in 1993 to settle 
an earlier lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Lance LaPay and Natasha Benavides allege that they have been 
subjected to assaults in police station corridors, slurs and the refusal by 
other officers to patrol with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit demands that the LAPD enforce the terms of the 1993 settlement, 
which includes requirements that the department institute complaint procedures 
to protect gay and lesbian officers' rights and train officers to be more 
sensitive to gay and lesbian issues. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPay claims that the LAPD personnel office has received more than 200 
harassment and discrimination complaints from other gay and lesbian officers, 
but no officer has ever been disciplined. Among about 7,900 officers in their 
department, only nine are openly gay or lesbian, Benavides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams, when asked about the suit, said he had not 
seen it, but said that his "policy . . . has been that gay-lesbian officers 
have been treated the same as everyone else."

RIORDAN LEADS DRIVE TO COMPUTERIZE LAPD; POLICE: THE MAYOR AND AN ALLIANCE OF 
CORPORATE LEADERS SEEK $15 MILLION IN PRIVATE DONATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan announced a $15-million private fund-raising 
campaign Tuesday to begin computerizing the antiquated Los Angeles Police 
Department, which still relies on paperwork to keep track of its tens of 
thousands of criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams said that installing a computer network at the 
department would free officers -- who now spend up to 40% of their time filling 
out forms -- to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Williams, who works on a borrowed computer, must call the LAPD's 18 
geographic divisions to determine staffing levels during emergencies because no 
central computer links the department's outposts. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the new Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A., Riordan joined 
Williams and other officials at the Newton Division station -- built in 1925 -- 
where they toured the decaying offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a minute and look around this room," Riordan said in the roll-call room. 
"This equipment is not like a good wine which improves with age. Just ask 
yourself if you could run your business with these tools." 
</P>
<P>
 In another effort to bring money to the LAPD, Riordan said he intends to fly 
to Washington this morning to lobby Congress to approve President Clinton's 
crime bill, which would fund 100,000 additional police officers nationwide, ban 
assault weapons and support various crime prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the federal funds are approved, Riordan said the fundraising 
effort is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising alliance, headed by Bruce Karatz, chairman of Kaufman & Broad 
Home Corp., is made up of 20 business executives. They include the top 
officials of Ticketmaster, Arco, Food-4-Less, MCA Inc. and In-N-Out Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question, Riordan said he intends to donate to the fund 
himself, and Karatz said all alliance members have agreed to lend financial 
support to the effort through donations and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking everyone in the city to get involved in this campaign," Karatz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members learned of the private fund-raising effort recently. It 
will be presented to the council's Public Safety Committee on Monday for a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1994, the alliance will seek $15 million in private donations -- 
enough to make a significant impact on the department's immediate needs, 
officials said, but far below the estimated $100 million needed for a complete 
computerization of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very ambitious . . . (but) I think it's doable," Karatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, Councilwoman Laura Chick called for a multimillion-dollar 
retrofitting of the LAPD that would go beyond the mayor's fund-raising effort. 
Saying the LAPD is still in the "horse-and-buggy" era, Chick called for a 
summit meeting to prepare a comprehensive modernization plan for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't solve all our woes, but it's a very important first step," Chick 
said of the mayor's effort. "We need a top-to-bottom modernization of the LAPD 
and the first step is a high-tech computer network. That's what they are 
looking to provide." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the $15 million that the mayor's group intends to raise will pay for 
1,700 computer workstations and other related technology, which Compaq has 
offered at reduced prices to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The new technology will save the LAPD more than 640,000 hours annually, 
officials said, which they said is equivalent to 368 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had computers, it would help -- absolutely," said Eric Campos, a 
homicide detective in the Newton Division, the city's third-busiest area for 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the computer equipment will only be a first step. The LAPD would also have 
to add numerous computer experts to its staff and eventually tie all the 
computerized police stations together into a single network at Parker Center, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a toll-free hot line is set up, officials said pledges can be made at 
(310) 443-8444.

BOY'S STEPFATHER SUES MICHAEL JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stepfather of a young boy who allegedly was sexually molested by Michael 
Jackson has filed a new lawsuit against the multimillionaire entertainer, 
saying his family was destroyed when Jackson seduced his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepfather's "family life was devastated by Michael Jackson, who 
interposed himself into the . . . family, lavishing expensive gifts on (his) 
wife and children, pitting family member against family member, and finally 
sexually assaulting (his) son despite (his) best efforts to protect the minor 
child." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by three attorneys on behalf of the stepfather, represents the 
latest legal tangle for Jackson, who has been dogged by lawsuits since a 
13-year-old boy accused him of sexual molestation last year. That boy settled 
his lawsuit for an undisclosed sum, but sources close to the case have said it 
fell between $15 million and $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That ended the boy's suit, but Tuesday's action represents a new wrinkle, 
raising for the first time the possibility that Jackson could be forced to 
battle the boy's family members too. Although he helped raise the boy, the 
stepfather does not live with him at this point, and some legal experts 
questioned whether he would have a valid claim against Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Feldman, the lawyer who represented the boy in his suit, declined to 
comment on the suit by the boy's stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Howard Weitzman said neither he nor Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the two 
lawyers who represent Jackson, had received the complaint. But Weitzman 
dismissed the action as frivolous and said Jackson is innocent of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Jackson has consistently maintained that he did nothing wrong," Weitzman 
said. "This lawsuit is frivolous and another attempt to take advantage of Mr. 
Jackson's notoriety and fame in order to try to extract money from him." 
</P>
<P>
 The stepfather's 22-page complaint reiterates the allegations of sexual 
molestation that surfaced in August, 1993, after the boy told a therapist that 
Jackson had seduced him over a period of months. The stepfather's attorneys 
include Danny Davis, a well-known Beverly Hills lawyer who successfully 
represented the lead defendant in the McMartin Preschool child molestation 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to claiming that the alleged seduction by Jackson split apart the 
stepfather's family, the new lawsuit contends that Jackson's actions caused the 
boy's stepsister pain as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, (she) was used as a pawn by Jackson in his seduction of (the 
boy), and the stigma of being used for that purpose remains with her on a daily 
basis as she continues to grieve (over) the loss of her brother," the lawsuit 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations of sexual abuse by Jackson touched off an international media 
frenzy last year and sparked simultaneous civil and criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is continuing to investigate 
a possible criminal case against Jackson. But no charges have been filed 
against the entertainer, who recently was married to Lisa Marie Presley, 
daughter of the late Elvis Presley.

CHILD MOLESTER TO LEAVE PRISON WITH NEW NAME; CRIME: HIS VICTIM, NOW 14, AND 
HER MOTHER FOUGHT HIS PAROLE. THE GIRL WON A $2-MILLION SUIT AGAINST HIM IN 
JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The convicted molester of a 10-year-old girl will be released today to 
Palmdale after serving half of a three-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Hochstraser, who was known as Richard Streate before changing his name in 
prison, will return to the city where four years ago he molested Desiray 
Bartak. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray and her mother, Wayanne Kruger, waged an unsuccessful letter-writing 
campaign to the Parole Board in February when they were notified of 
Hochstraser's possible release. They were told June 7 of the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am irate that he is being released," said Kruger, who lived with her 
daughter in Thousand Oaks at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's attacker was her godfather. She was visiting him in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray, now 14 and living in the San Francisco Bay Area with her family, said 
the reality of her molester's release sank in Monday evening. "I am scared for 
other children," she said. "It hit me real bad last night. . . . I was crying, 
I felt almost powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her family moved to Northern California in anticipation of 
Hochstraser's release. "We just wanted to get out of Southern California," said 
Desiray. "From what he has done in the past, we don't know what he will do in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plea bargain, Hochstraser admitted guilt in January, 1993, to one 
count of committing a lewd act upon a child. Three other felony charges against 
him, including an allegation that he molested another 10-year-old girl, were 
dropped in the bargain with prosecutors, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case came to national attention in January when Desiray won a $2-million 
civil suit against her attacker. But Desiray has said she does not expect to 
receive the money because her attacker does not have any assets. She says she 
initiated the case to bring attention to the issue and "to show other children 
that we do have power." 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, assistant director of the California Department of Corrections, 
said Hochstraser's early release is normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens with 90% of inmates in state prison," Kindel said. "Almost every 
inmate can qualify for the 1983 Work Incentive Program, which allows them to 
earn credit off their sentence if they go to school or enroll in work 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is available to all inmates in state prison with the exception of 
those convicted of murder, kidnaping or any other offense that requires an 
appearance before a Parole Board hearing. Child molestation is not included in 
that group of more serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the Children's Center of the Antelope Valley, an organization 
that focuses on the treatment of child abuse victims, was concerned about 
Hochstraser's return to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason to believe that he is any different than when he went in 
or that the community will be safe," said Esther Gillies, executive director of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said that additional prison time probably wouldn't have made much of a 
difference. Rehabilitation, she said, "is a lifelong process that a sex 
offender has to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many child advocates, Gillies supports publishing a child molester's name 
to warn the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way their behavior is controlled in public as well as private places," 
she said. "Those around sex offenders on a daily basis should know that their 
children are at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Kindel said he was disturbed by Hochstraser's name change in prison, and sees 
it as a dangerous practice that should be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it very difficult for a victim to keep track of the person in prison 
and while they are on parole," Kindel said. "Inmates should not have the 
absolute right to go to court to change their name." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no restrictions on inmates who want to change their names, Kindel 
said.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SPIN; HOW CELEBRITY, RACE ECLIPSE SPOUSAL ABUSE ISSUE IN 
SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes I wonder how the O.J. Simpson story would have played if he'd been 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose, for example, he were a wealthy Brentwood attorney. How would we have 
written the story of his arrest for murder? 
</P>
<P>
 If the attorney had a record of spousal abuse like Simpson's and had 
surrendered quietly, we probably would have said: "A Brentwood lawyer who had 
pleaded no contest to charges of beating his wife was arrested today on 
suspicion of murdering her and a male friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis in the story would have been on the suspect's pre-arrest behavior 
toward his dead wife. In Simpson's case, reports of abusive conduct brought 
police to their home a number of times prior to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we wrote: "O. J. Simpson, the football great who rose from the mean 
streets of San Francisco to international celebrity, was arrested Friday for 
the murders of his ex-wife and a male friend after leading police on a gripping 
two-hour chase through the rush-hour freeways of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's celebrity and the circumstances of his arrest overwhelmed the issue 
of spousal abuse. So did race -- mainly fears in the black community that 
Simpson, who is African American, was being stampeded into the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial issue was evident last month when African American community 
leaders met with Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. They suggested that Garcetti 
integrate his all-white, all-male panel of top aides who decide whether to seek 
the death penalty in murder cases. John Mack, president of the Los Angeles 
Urban League, said the group also told Garcetti that Simpson "be tried by a 
jury that is representative of the immense diversity of this city, including 
African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse issue was raised at a news conference Aug. 1 by attorney Gloria 
Allred. She said Garcetti should seek the death penalty. "We agree with 
representatives of the African American community that the criminal justice 
system must respect Mr. Simpson's rights," she said. "But we want to also 
emphasize that the same system must also respect the rights of the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after her comments, I received a telephone call from a prominent 
African American civil rights attorney, Melanie Lomax, asking why I hadn't 
written a column on Allred's views. "I am infuriated by the reaction to the 
O.J. Simpson case, when it seems to completely eclipse the idea of spousal 
abuse," she said. "I have the overwhelming sense that he was and remains an 
abusive man. And he must be held to account for this particular spousal abuse 
and his history of terrorizing his former wife and his children." 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised to hear her criticize the African American leaders who met 
with Garcetti. Lomax is a leader who has been outspoken on the issue of 
fairness to African Americans. When Lomax was president of the Los Angeles 
Board of Police Commissioners, she led the effort to oust Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates. And she's a force in politics as a contributor and fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomax acknowledged that, as the African American leaders said, there have been 
"glaring examples where the justice system did not work," such as the Rodney G. 
King beating case. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the "leadership's obligation is to define to the community some 
sort of moral commitment -- that murder is not OK, that violence toward women 
is not OK, and that you're not a hero in the community if you use your physical 
superiority to terrorize women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leadership has permitted too many people to go off in a tangent and not 
recognize the moral imperatives of this case," she said. "Setting aside the 
murder issue, the undisputed facts of threatening and stalking should be 
morally condemned. Instead, it seems they are wrapping their arms around him 
and I think it is appalling." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys, Lomax said, are banking on community support. "Clearly 
the defense is banking on a hung jury," she said. "Clearly they are going to 
play to African Americans, clearly they are going to play to the sense of 
paranoid injustice that has a lot of merit. . . . The best we can hope for is 
that any African Americans on the jury do not look on it in simplistic terms. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a complicated issue. On Tuesday, leaders of Mothers in Action, an 
African American community group, held a news conference to criticize the 
Allred position. "Pitting the rights of African Americans and other persons of 
color against the rights of women will not be tolerated," said Johnnie 
Tillman-Blackston. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Allred emphasized that she represented women of all races 
who have been victimized. "This is not an issue of race," she said. "It's an 
issue of simple justice." 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain is that these sensitive disputes, aired in the media, will be 
on the minds of prosecutors, defense attorneys and prospective jurors when the 
process of jury selection begins Sept. 19.

HUSBAND HELD IN ATTACK ON WIFE IS RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Hills man arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting his estranged, 
wheelchair-bound and legally blind wife -- and restraining and gagging her 
seeing-eye dog -- was released from custody Tuesday, but authorities said the 
matter remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are definitely continuing to look into this," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Nancy Severns, who interviewed the alleged victim.  
</P>
<P>
 After the interview, prosecutors decided that police did not have enough 
evidence to charge horseback riding instructor Terry Foladare, 41, with a 
crime. Foladare had been held at the West Valley jail in lieu of $300,000 bail.

MARINA LEASE, DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVED; DEAL: THE COUNTY WILL GET AT LEAST $80 
MILLION IN REVENUE OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. SUNSET PARK OPERATORS, WHO 
AGREED TO PAY BACK RENT, HAVE A 35-YEAR OPTION TO MANAGE THE 94-ACRE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved a $10-million development plan and 
a long-term lease extension for the Sunset Marina Park after marina operators 
agreed to pay the county $200,000 in back rent. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, marina operators Goldrich and Kest of Culver City have been granted 
an option to manage the 94-acre facility for the next 35 years. County 
officials said the new agreement would provide at least $80 million in revenue 
over the term of the new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long time in coming," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said. 
"This will not only enhance the marina but be a forerunner for future lease 
negotiations at the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The marina, in an unincorporated area between the cities of Huntington Beach 
and Seal Beach, is one of the few public boat landings in the county and the 
development promises both greater access to boaters and newer facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tuesday's agreement, the county would pay $4.4 million on 
improvements to the marina, including an interpretive kiosk, landscaping and 
trails. Meanwhile, G&K would spend $5.5 million to expand the number of boat 
slips from 276 to 341, increase dry boat storage from 97 to 241 and increase 
the number of parking spaces from 190 to 280. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials estimated that the construction could be complete by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Before endorsing the project, however, Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley and Supervisors William G. Steiner and Gaddi H. Vasquez requested that 
G&K agree to pay the county $200,000 the company owed in back rent. Terms of 
the initial proposal had asked the county to forgive the rental payments owed 
by the Culver City operators, who have managed the park since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 G&K attorney Gregory W. Sanders said the company would comply with the 
supervisors' request and were pleased with the terms of the lease extension and 
the development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck West, real estate director for the county General Services Agency, said 
the newly approved agreement requires the company to make the renovations 
before G&K can exercise its option for the additional 35-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1999, when the company's current lease expires, West said the new contract 
would give the county an 80% share of all revenue generated by the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other entity that I know of up and down the coast has been able to 
negotiate such a deal," West said. "The county's portion of the deal is going 
to be a very large number." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has also required the management company to provide a $100,000 
security deposit to ensure that the property is properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 If maintenance becomes a problem, the contract allows the county to buy out 
the lease at any time during the last 7 1/2 years. The cost of such a buyout 
would be based on income being generated by the marina at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lease was approved despite a county policy that states such contracts, 
whenever feasible, should be allowed to expire and then be put out to 
competitive bid. However, the prospect of the county earning additional revenue 
through renegotiation of existing contracts is one exception to the re-bid 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to go ahead with the development plan and lease extension was mired 
in controversy three years ago when it was disclosed that Lee E. Wieder, son of 
Supervisor Wieder, whose district includes the marina, worked as a consultant 
for G&K. At the same time, G&K's maintenance record had also been criticized.

<P>
 County officials have said Wieder's son is no longer involved with the plan 
and maintenance is no longer a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's board meeting, marina boaters were supportive of the development 
plan and offered compliments for G&K recent management record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you could be working with a better management company," boat 
owner Richard Dorsey said. "There was a question about maintenance in the past, 
but all the problems I could see have been corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 Some opposition, however, came from the Fountain Valley Recreational Vehicle 
Assn., which called on supervisors to provide campgrounds on an undeveloped 12 
1/2-acre parcel of the marina that is now a wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Blank, association president, said the original development plan 
contained provisions for campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for public access and (a campground) is where the public would go," 
Blank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the Tuesday's agreement, supervisors asked for a 12-month study of 
alternate recreational uses for the 12 1/2-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of the public hearing, a representative from the city of 
Huntington Beach asked that the county scale back its dry boat storage and 
parking space proposals to ease the development's effect on neighboring 
residential communities. But supervisors turned away that recommendation, as 
having come too late.

WORD BOND; KOREAN AMERICANS LEARNING SPANISH TO FORM LATINO LINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Each Monday night this summer, a tiny classroom has been packed with Korean 
American doctors, merchants and other professionals eagerly scribbling down 
their teacher's every word. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean, the instructor asks his students to repeat after him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuanto cuesta," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70 pupils chant in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, where Spanish has entered the mainstream, Korean 
merchants and other business people, including some who cannot speak English, 
are scrambling to learn the language in an effort to boost business and improve 
community relations, according to local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment for this Spanish-language course, offered at the Korean American 
Center, is more than double that of the center's classes in business 
management, citizenship and even English. 
</P>
<P>
 The center offered the course for the first time this year in an effort to 
boost sagging business in Garden Grove's Koreatown, which stretches two miles 
along Garden Grove Boulevard, said Dr. Koo Oh, president of the Orange County 
Korean American Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem with Garden Grove Koreatown is mainly that there are only 
Korean people," Oh said. "If it continues like this, it's not going to 
progress. They should go mainstream. To do that, they should know English and 
Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Esparza, Orange County human relations commissioner, said: "It's not 
only business wise, it establishes a bond between a community and the merchants 
who are willing to learn Spanish. It shows that they care enough to learn the 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 When Daniel Jeha Lee began teaching the class five weeks ago, he also hoped to 
offer some insight into the Latino culture from a Korean perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven years he lived in Argentina, he developed a profound respect 
for that culture, Lee said. When he moved to the United States in 1992, he was 
saddened to see other Koreans who did not feel the same.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry when Korean people think Spanish people are inferior," said Lee, 
25. "It's because they don't understand the culture. I am trying to make a 
bridge of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The students in Lee's class, which meets from 7 to 9 p.m., all speak Korean 
fluently, but many speak broken English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Koreans have a very good heart; they keep trying to learn English, but 
Spanish comes much easier to them because there are more similarities in 
pronunciation," Lee said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jia Frydenberg, director of the professional English as a Second Language 
program at UCI Extension, agreed that "Spanish is a much easier language to 
learn for Asian people in particular," she said. "English is so idiosyncratic." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "If an Asian person learns Spanish, it also helps them to learn 
English; they complement each other because of the vocabulary and language 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kai Lee, 52, a Fountain Valley dentist and one of Lee's students, is not 
fluent in English and said he wanted to communicate more with his patients, 
about 15% of whom are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Latinos) feel more comfortable coming to a minority dentist," Lee 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Census figures for 1990 show that more than a quarter of the population in 
Orange County speaks only Spanish at home. Another 10% speak Asian languages, 
with Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean topping the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Hien Phan, director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, said that 
Vietnamese business people who want to learn Spanish are likely to take classes 
taught in English at community colleges or private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunah Hwang, another of Lee's pupils, is fluent is both Korean and English. 
But she is familiar with language barriers, which is what prompted her to take 
the class. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of the students in her kindergarten class in Long Beach speak only 
Spanish, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I can gain a lot of knowledge and apply it to my students," said 
Hwang, 27, who also teaches English at the center.

DISCIPLINE POSSIBLE FOR OFFICIALS LINKED TO GRADE CHANGING; EDUCATION: SCHOOL 
TRUSTEES SAY SUCH ACTION COULD TAKE PLACE WHEN THE PROBE IS COMPLETED. THEY 
ALSO PRAISE NEW RULES THAT SPELL OUT COURSE WORK POLICIES.

 As Brea Olinda High School employees corrected yet another batch of newly 
discovered errors in student transcripts Tuesday, district trustees said they 
will consider disciplining employees over the ever-widening scandal -- but not 
until an attorney has finished his investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that an independent auditor had found about 600 instances of 
transcript altering last year -- nearly twice the number school officials had 
suspected -- school board members said they are increasingly frustrated with 
the illegal grade changing at the award-winning high school. But they said they 
are pleased that a chunk of the investigative process is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "One (instance of transcript tampering) is too many for me. More than one is 
way too many," Trustee Bernie P. Kilcoyne said. "It's very disappointing, to 
say the least. There's no excuse for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilcoyne agreed with colleagues on the board that no action should be taken 
against Principal John Johnson or others until Ronald Wenkart, an attorney with 
the Orange County Department of Education, completes a separate investigation. 
But he added: "If discipline needs to be taken, then we're going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees also praised a new policy adopted Monday night that imposes strict 
rules limiting the number of courses students can take pass/fail instead of for 
traditional letter grades. The policy also limits the number of courses 
students are allowed to repeat to improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Barbara Paxton said public focus on the grade-changing issue this 
summer "has been stressful on all staff and stressful for the board, but I 
think . . . the bottom line (is) it's going to be good for kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this has made us look at things we wouldn't otherwise look at," 
Paxton said, "and has made us stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rachael Alcorn, the Sunny Hills High School registrar who was 
hired this summer to audit Brea Olinda's grades for the 1993-94 academic year, 
287 student transcripts were altered, typically after courses were complete. 
</P>
<P>
 That included 238 instances in which course titles were changed and 156 
instances of letter grades being illegally changed to "pass notations," 
according to Alcorn's report, delivered at Monday night's school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn said Monday night that she found 32 uncorrected student transcripts 
despite statements in June by retired Supt. Edgar Z. Seal and Principal John 
Johnson that all the transcripts were fixed months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said those transcripts, including 10 from the Class of 1994, 
were fixed Tuesday. But Supt. Peggy Lynch said she is unsure whether state law 
requires -- or even allows -- the school to send corrected records of graduates 
to colleges and employers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the new policy adopted Monday, students who repeat classes to 
improve their grades will not be awarded double credit. The only classes that 
can be taken for repeat credit, according to the policy, are: photography, 
performing arts, journalism, yearbook, English as a Second Language, student 
government and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy also reduces the courses students can take pass/fail to: 
beginning typing, office aide, peer tutor and science lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the high school said Tuesday that they are skeptical about the 
potential success of the strict new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Bridge, the former math teacher who initially filed a grievance with the 
teachers union that brought the transcript altering to light in May, pointed 
out that Brea Olinda already had policies in its handbook prohibiting use of 
pass notations in academic classes and preventing grades from being changed 
after the fourth week of class. Those policies were broken hundreds of times 
last year, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the Brea way," said Bridge, who now teaches at Long Beach City 
College. "There is no rule at Brea that cannot be broken. That is the bottom 
line of this whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Kolb, an English teacher who complained about the grade changing to the 
state association that credentials educators, said Tuesday that she was 
saddened by the news that there were 600 instances of transcript tampering just 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even I did not realize the magnitude of the problem" she said. "I continue to 
be shocked and appalled."

TEEN TESTIFIES ABOUT DRIVING A DEADLY GANTLET; COURT: WITNESS DESCRIBES MELEE 
AT THE BEACH IN WHICH HIS BUDDY WAS FATALLY INJURED WHEN A PAINT ROLLER SPEARED 
HIS HEAD. HE SAYS HE WAS FORCED TO VEER WHILE PASSENGERS DUCKED AND CAR WINDOWS 
SHATTERED.

 A teen-ager testified Tuesday that he was forced to duck down behind his 
steering wheel to escape a gantlet of young men screaming and throwing bottles 
during a parking lot dispute in which his 17-year-old buddy was fatally speared 
through the head. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente High School student Casey Saul said he was forced to veer to the 
wrong side of the road, while his passengers held their heads between their 
knees to protect themselves as the car windows shattered.  
</P>
<P>
 Saul said he and friends were still cowering as they drove out of Calafia 
Beach County Park and it was several moments before anyone realized that Steve 
Woods was hurt. It even appeared that Woods sat up as the rest of the 
passengers did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then his head just fell over," Saul testified, adding that a young woman 
sitting next to Woods began screaming. "I saw a white rod sticking out (of his 
head). . . . I just started driving to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a San Clemente High School student, died 25 days after the attack that 
left a paint roller lodged in his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul took the witness stand on the second day of a murder trial for Hector 
Penuelas, 17, and Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, two of six young men charged in 
Woods' death. Though he is a juvenile, Penuelas is being tried as an adult 
because of the serious nature of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys contend their clients believed they were about to be 
attacked when a caravan of cars drove toward them just moments after a violent 
confrontation with one of Woods' friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Dennis McNerney, who is representing Penuelas, has 
characterized the incident as a freak accident, not murder.  
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said the two San Clemente youths are guilty 
of killing Woods because they joined in the attack that caused the teen-ager's 
death. Paer, however, has not disclosed who is suspected of hurling the paint 
roller. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-jury trial is being heard by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Everett W. Dickey and is expected to last a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other defendants in the case are awaiting trial while the sixth 
defendant has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was white and the defendants are Latinos and have been labeled gang 
members by the prosecution. Some Latino activists have contended that racism 
may have played a role in the serious nature of the charges filed in the case, 
but prosecutors have disputed those claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble Oct. 15, 1993, began when teen-ager Sterling Breckenridge -- one 
of Woods' friends -- was leaving the park and asked a group of young men 
whether they knew about any parties in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that remark set off the men -- reputed gang members -- 
whose rivals are from that area. Someone punched Breckenridge in the face twice 
before he drove back into the park to alert his friends -- including Woods and 
Saul -- that there might be trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul led the caravan of cars out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Right behind him was Tim Bright. On Tuesday, Bright testified that he veered 
his vehicle toward one young stranger as he tried to escape the park unharmed.  
</P>
<P>
 During cross-examination, Bright agreed with McNerney's description that he 
tried to make the would-be assailant "flinch or jump away," but said he never 
intended to hurt anyone.

 State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren will assist Mayor Collene Campbell today in 
honoring the city's police force and its senior citizen civilian volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city began its Associated Senior Action Program in 1992, volunteers 
have worked more than 18,000 hours in various city jobs that otherwise would 
need to be done by law enforcement personnel.City officials estimate that the 
volunteers' donated time has saved the city more than $217,000 while enabling 
sheriff's deputies to do more police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The tasks the volunteers do include making home checks, visiting elderly and 
shut-in residents, administering the city's bicycle registration program, doing 
clerical work and performing other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've put in so much time," Campbell said Tuesday of the 28 senior 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said she is proud of how the city, despite having to cut $140,000 
from its general fund budget of $10.2 million, has continued to make public 
safety a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a small city that has been able to put forces together," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3 p.m. ceremony will be held in Council Chambers at City Hall, 32400 Paseo 
Adelanto. The public is invited. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; RESIDENTIAL PARKING FEES TO BE REFUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana City Council has agreed to make refunds on parking-permit fees 
in response to protests from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday unanimously approved refunds for hundreds of people who 
purchased $20 parking permits for the 1994-95 year in 13 neighborhoods to 
reduce congestion.The permits were issued in those areas to assure that 
residents would have overnight parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had abolished the fee for permits, effective July 1. However, when 
residents who had bought them before that date complained, city officials said 
they had no authority to refund the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about $7,400 was collected. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Patricia McGuigan said the council approved the refunds to 
be fair to those who bought permits that other people were not required to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes the refund will show residents that "we are listening to 
you. We hear your concerns and try to respond."JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DEVELOPERS' SWITCH TO RETAIL CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metro Pointe development agreement is no longer the agreement it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arnel Development Co., which originally intended to construct high-rise 
offices under the development agreement, will instead build a retail shopping 
center between Bear Street, South Coast Drive and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council gave the developers the go-ahead Monday night, after Leonard 
Hampel, the attorney for the company, explained the amendment outlining the 
changes in the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit of the development agreement still exists. It's just changed a 
little," Hampel told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there were to be two 15-story office buildings, there will now be a 
400,000-square-foot, open air shopping center named South Coast Boardwalk, 
complete with a bookstore, a linen store, a 10-screen cinema, an electronics 
shop and a few clothing stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The $60-million project should be completed by November, 1995, said Dave Ball, 
president of the development company. The about-face in development occurred 
when he realized the market for office space was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Two office buildings already built on the site, which are four stories and six 
stories, respectively, are just 80% full, according to Don Lamb, deputy city 
manager and director of development services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council liked the idea of a shopping center, especially the $1.4 million 
in estimated sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response (in the community) has been, 'Oh, I'd like to go to that,' " 
Mayor Sandra L. Genis said. 
</P>
<P>
 And just how does the new shopping mall plan to compete against South Coast 
Plaza and Crystal Court, two large, established malls in the area? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the developers have done their research," said Bill Morris, director 
of public services for the city. "I don't think the malls are going to be going 
head to head because the stores are different inside the new one. There's a 
demand for these type of stores. If they do compete, it's not going to be a 
detriment." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnel's change of plans prompted council members to express only one fear 
Monday: If the development company decides to withdraw from the project, the 
city might end up owing it an estimated $3 million -- the sum Arnel has paid up 
front for freeway improvements, including the South Coast Drive off-ramp from 
the San Diego Freeway now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's only theoretical. They're not going to walk out on something 
they've invested so much money in," Morris said. Also, the company has leased 
the land for 99 years, so it must build something on it, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said he saw another advantage to the new shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a new entrance to the South Coast Plaza," he said. "It's right 
across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center would be the third phase of the Metro Pointe Master Plan. 
The first two phases included construction of two two-story office buildings 
and a 296-unit apartment complex. TOM RAGAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SHOPPERS FIND A COOL BARGAIN IN VALLEY MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KAY HWANGBO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's just a case of simple math: Seven bucks buys you two hours of air 
conditioning in a movie, but for absolutely nothing you can hang out at the 
mall until your feet are sore from walking. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the kind of calculations that sent Valley residents for the blessed 
cool of the nearest enclosed shopping center on Monday and Tuesday, when 
temperatures hit 100 and 96 degrees respectively in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 And flock to the malls they did. Fallbrook Mall manager Eric Knudson reported 
a 22% increase in shoppers on Saturday and Sunday compared to the same weekend 
last year, which he attributed in good part to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were hordes of people," Knudson said. "There were tons of people buying 
ice cream." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment was echoed by Topanga Plaza manager Clyde Ahl, who estimated 
that the heat wave brought about 20% more shoppers into his mall this past 
weekend than in the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the sixth day of blistering heat that set record temperatures on 
Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley grandmother Jackie Ford didn't need a thermometer to tell her that 
it was one of the hottest days of the year outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so hot in Ford's un-air-conditioned home on Friday evening that she 
packed up her family and rented a motel room so they could get some sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent Tuesday at Fallbrook Mall, killing time there before she could 
escape to her air-conditioned workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Menopause and heat don't go together," said Ford, who strolled through the 
mall in West Hills with her son and granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even going to the pool, which would mean exposing herself to a blazing sun, 
didn't seem appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that surprises me is the humidity," said Ford, a high school 
teacher. "It feels like Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 The back-to-school sales and the end-of-summer sales meant nothing to Canoga 
Park resident Yitzhak Aharoni, who came to Fallbrook Mall with his two sons, 
Eytan, 7, and Daniel, 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing we can do outside so we came to the mall to cool off," said 
Aharoni. "We can't stand the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Aharoni and his 10-year-old daughter, Anat, have slept outside on blankets for 
two nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the mall's courtyard, Chatsworth resident Rick Hutchinson admitted 
he came to the mall just to "hang around and feel the cool breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will be moving soon to San Diego, partly to be closer to his 
school, Mesa College, but also partly due to the fact that he can't stand Los 
Angeles' stuffy climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat trickled down the back of Pat Coffman's neck Monday as he played a video 
game called Primal Rage in an arcade at the Topanga Plaza mall. Despite 
appearances, he said he was much more comfortable there than at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to stay at home because it was way too hot, even with the air 
on," said Coffman, who will be a sophomore at UC Santa Barbara this fall. "It's 
cooler in here. Even if it costs more to play this stupid game." 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of Andrea Klapova's curly hair were damp and her face was flushed 
when she first walked into the mall with her three young children. The 
Calabasas homemaker's first thought that morning, she said, was, "We're going 
to the mall to beat the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers kept cool by thinking about cooler climates. Others bought lots 
of ice cream. Still others just prayed for a break.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; COLLEGE'S PRIZE PAPER MAY HAVE TO FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College's award-winning school newspaper may cease publication next 
January due to budget problems, according to officials from the school's 
journalism program. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly newspaper, the Roundup, and the Bull, a magazine published by the 
school, cannot continue to survive on the money appropriated by the college, 
said Mike Cornner, an adviser to the Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a point where there is no point in doing it at all," he said 
Tuesday. "We will not get in a position where we are going to trim it away and 
trim it away until the students are being defrauded." 
</P>
<P>
 The Media Arts Department, which runs the journalism program, has asked the 
school for $20,000 for this fiscal year, Cornner said. But in a tentative 
budget, the school's president has recommended to the Los Angeles Community 
College District Board of Trustees that the department get no more than the 
$12,500 appropriated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It took about $36,000 to publish the newspaper and magazine last year, Cornner 
said. Advertising brought in about $20,000, while the student government 
donated about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the department cannot depend on advertising to make up any shortfall this 
year, because advertising revenues have fluctuated wildly in the past, Cornner 
said. Further complicating the picture, he said, is that the department has 
been forced to cut the number of issues and the number of pages in both 
publications, which creates a shrinking advertising base. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lee, president of Pierce College, said Tuesday that she believes the 
department may be talking about ceasing publication to pressure the 
administration into coming up with more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to be threatened by the press as to whether they are going to 
get their $20,000, because I am not ready to give an answer until I have 
weighed all the other considerations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do keep in mind that both the Bull and the Roundup are award winners, but 
we also have sports teams that are first in the state or first in the nation, 
such as tennis and volleyball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has recommended that all departments be funded at last year's 
level until the final budget is completed. The Board of Trustees is expected to 
vote on the budget late this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee added that she has been monitoring enrollments in various classes in the 
school and has noticed that journalism classes on the average have a "very low 
enrollment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some classes have eight or nine students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper and magazine could probably resume publishing next fiscal year, 
but not without difficulty, said Joe Soccoccio, chairman of the Media Arts 
department, which offers an associate arts degree in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really get a flow of students going," he said. "If you cut out a whole 
semester of students, it's almost like starting all over again, because you 
lose all the students from the last classes, and you lose the students with the 
most experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The news that the publications could fold saddened Roger Anderson, who was 
editor of a spring '93 edition of the Bull that recently won the Associated 
Collegiate Press National Pacemaker award. The magazine was the only community 
college ever to be so honored, according to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pierce College has dominated the competition for the last 20 years," said 
Anderson, who is now a computer operator for Rocketdyne. "To see that program 
go downhill would really be a bummer." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; BUILDERS' BIDS BEING TAKEN FOR NEW PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bids are being accepted for construction of a new park that includes a 
regional equestrian facility, said City Council member Fran Pavley, who helped 
spearhead the drive to build the 10-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been asking, 'When is this park going to be built?' " she said. 
"Now I have something to tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to take bids on construction of the first 
phase of the park, which will be located between Chesebro Road, Colodny Drive 
and Driver Avenue. Bids will be opened by the city clerk on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will replace a 2.75-acre park down the street that was built by 
the county and taken over by the city when it was incorporated in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The city traded the land from the old park to Chesebro Development Group for 
nine acres on which the new park is to be built, said Audrey Brown, director of 
community services. The city already owned one acre at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
 Chesebro Development Group agreed to the swap, she said, because the 2.75 
acres are not prone to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The equestrian facility takes priority because a $600,000 grant from the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy stipulates that an equestrian center be built with 
the money, Brown said. Additional funds will come from money raised under the 
Los Angeles County Park Bond Act. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, funding has been obtained for the land, the equestrian center, a 
baseball field and a children's playground, she said. Yet to be funded are a 
full-size outdoor basketball court and a 1,500-square-foot recreation building. 
 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say no city general fund money will be used to build the park 
and that all funding will be from grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plans, the equestrian center would be free and open to users from 
the surrounding region. The center will be near a portion of the Zuma Ridge 
Trail, an equestrian trail running through the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavley said the land is already being used by a 4-H group in old Agoura, which 
has built a makeshift ring there until the equestrian center is completed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; GRAFFITI VANDALS HIT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the third incident in three days involving South County fast-food 
restaurants, a Carl's Jr. outlet has been vandalized by "taggers" who 
spray-painted the words "Meat Is Murder" on an outside wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti vandals struck at the Carl's Jr. at the intersection of Aliso 
Creek and La Paz roads early Tuesday, before employees showed up for work at 5 
a.m., Police Services Chief Joe Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were greeted by large, bright-red letters forming anti-meat 
slogans such as "Animal Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, two McDonald's restaurants, one in Mission Viejo and one 
on Street of the Golden Lantern in Laguna Niguel, had been hit by vandals who 
also painted animal rights slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wiles, owner of the Laguna Niguel Carl's Jr., said the graffiti was 
painted over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a frustrating experience," said Wiles, who would not give the monetary 
amount of the damage. "I don't want to give them the time of day. Just clean it 
up and move on." LYNN FRANEY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SITES ADDED FOR VIEWING CLAS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It used to be one of the hottest topics in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors flew when the state Department of Education first administered the 
California Learning Assessment System test for public school students in the 
spring.Parents, educators and conservative activists debated whether the CLAS 
tests stretched students' minds or pried into their private lives with personal 
questions that demanded emotional responses. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of the early controversy it stirred, when unsealed and on display 
for an entire month at the downtown headquarters of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, the test had the attraction power of a bad movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Four weeks of viewing brought just 49 people. Nine of them were journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just trickling in," said Esther Wong, director of the information 
technology division where the tests were on display until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to attract more people and make the review process easier for 
the public, the district has added five sites, including one in Van Nuys, where 
the tests will be on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested can simply browse or seriously study the English and language 
arts portions of the tests that fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders took in the 
spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The public viewing, which is taking place at 50 sites around the state, marks 
the first time that the California Department of Education has made any of its 
statewide assessment exams available to the public. The move was an effort to 
quell early opposition to the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Scoring Center on 6621 Balboa Blvd. in Van Nuys will have the 
materials available from noon to 4 p.m. Monday and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because quantities are limited, appointments are necessary. For more 
information, call (213) 625-4121. SUSAN BYRNES

 Police are asking the public to help identify a dead woman whose body was 
found on fire near the Foothill Freeway in Tujunga, LAPD Foothill Division 
Detective Marv Whiting said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, believed to be in her mid-20s, was discovered by passersby in the 
late evening of Sunday, Aug. 7 in a remote area near La Tuna Canyon Road, 
according to Homicide Detective Keith Honore of Foothill Division.Police

</P>
<P>
 She was either Latina or Caucasian, 5-foot-6 and 135 pounds, and had black 
hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incident is under investigation as a homicide, the coroner's 
office has not determined whether the woman was slain, Whiting said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; POLICE TO SELL BIKE HELMETS AT HALF PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Schoolchildren soon will be able to buy half-price bicycle safety helmets 
through local police, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department will use $10,500 in donations to pay half the cost of 
bike helmets, now required for riders younger than 18 years old.The state bike 
helmet law took effect Jan. 1, but riders have until the end of the year before 
police start writing $25 tickets, Cpl. Larry Wiist said.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorcycle Officer Steve Winston, who gives bike safety presentations at 30 
local schools, said low-income children will be given preference. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers must pay half the cost of the bicycle helmets, which usually run about 
$15. The department will pay the rest and deliver the helmets, Wiist said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fountain Valley-based branch of the Safeco Insurance Co. of America donated 
$10,000 to the fund. A local Kiwanis Club contributed $500, Wiist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations will help buy about 2,500 helmets, which Winston plans to 
purchase at a discount.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; BALLOON FEST BILLED AS BIGGEST ON COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A seven-story-tall, hot-air balloon was inflated Tuesday at City Hall as part 
of a kickoff announcement for Smith's Festival of Ballooning, a family-oriented 
fair scheduled Sept. 23-25 at Tustin Ranch and billed as the largest balloon 
festival ever on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizer John Korff said that about 125 balloons will float over Tustin 
in the early morning and late afternoon each day. There will also be nighttime 
balloon "glows," in which tethered balloons are illuminated from within by 
bursts of flame. 
</P>
<P>
 When word initially began to circulate about the event, some Tustin Ranch 
residents were concerned that the balloons -- which are inflated by air that is 
heated by flame from propane canisters -- would present a fire hazard. Worries 
were also expressed about traffic jams, crime, litter and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the protests faded away, however, when the festival site was moved 
farther away from a residential area, and a parking lot for the event, which 
was to be next to homes, was eliminated. In addition, organizers said the crowd 
will be limited to 35,000 spectators at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be held on a 30-acre site bounded by Tustin Ranch Road, 
Jamboree Road and Portola Parkway. The triangular-shaped, undeveloped parcel is 
owned by the Irvine Co., which is a major sponsor of the event, along with Salt 
Lake City-based Smith's Food & Drug Centers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the logistics have been worked out, I think it will be an 
outstanding way to showcase the community," Councilman Jim Potts said at the 
festival announcement ceremony Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited about it," Councilwoman Tracy Worley said. "We welcome 
the festival and hope it will be an annual event." 
</P>
<P>
 Korff emphasized that the three-day festival will be a family-oriented affair 
with children's activities, fund-raising opportunities for local charities, 
arts and crafts, and performances by the Beach Boys, America, Randy Travis and 
various "oldies" bands. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; INS PLANS INCREASE IN LOCAL SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service plans to increase services for 
the growing Orange County immigrant population, agency officials said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting with Vietnamese community leaders in Westminster, INS 
officials said they will conduct more naturalization ceremonies locally rather 
than in Los Angeles to make it more convenient for Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as soon as federal money is available, there are plans to expand 
the Westminster INS office -- which currently has 14 employees -- to handle 
interviews and tests for people seeking U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get most of the work done here so people wouldn't have to go 
downtown," said Richard K. Rogers, director of the immigration service's Los 
Angeles District, which covers seven counties, including Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a tour of the Little Saigon business district, Rogers and several 
other INS officials met Monday with about 25 Vietnamese community leaders who 
complained about the slow and often confusing naturalization process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said that plans are underway to conduct naturalization ceremonies in 
Orange County at least every three months. 
</P>
<P>
 A naturalization ceremony will be held Sept. 22 at the Sequoia Hotel in Buena 
Park for 1,000 new citizens, he said. It will be the second mass swearing-in 
ceremony in the county. Three years ago, 150 new citizens were sworn in during 
a ceremony in Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS Los Angeles District office receives about 700 citizenship 
applications a day, Rogers said. He said because of the volume, some 
applications are lost or misplaced, but the agency is moving toward using an 
electronic filing system. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two INS offices in Orange County -- in Laguna Niguel and 
Westminster. The local offices process requests for employment authorization or 
permanent residency, and issue new "green cards" to replace the current 
registration cards, which will expire Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great that the INS should do this," said Nam Loc Nguyen, of the 
Immigration and Refugee Department of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese 
of Los Angeles. "The more they come out to the community, the more they become 
sensitive to the needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials also told about 25 people who attended the meeting at the 
Westminster Community Services building that efforts have been made to seek 
travel documents for 15 Vietnamese convicts who are being held at the INS 
detention center in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth John Elwood, district assistant director for detention and 
deportation, said the criminals have completed their jail terms and are 
awaiting deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But because there are no diplomatic relations between the United States and 
Vietnam, Elwood said, seeking travel papers for the Vietnamese convicts has 
been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Deportation) is a strong deterrence for those involved in organized crime or 
gangs," Elwood said. BERT ELJERA

 "It tells the time, it gives you the date, the month, just about everything," 
said an enlightened Acharya, motioning to the steel sundial in the background. 
"It's really neat." 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for Tuesday's tour, which Acharya was a part of. He was just one of 
30 boys, ages 7 to 17, who got a firsthand glimpse into the operations of the 
Chevron Petroleum Technology Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for him, it exposes him to science," said U.K. Acharya, the boy's 
father, who works as a planning engineer for the La Habra-based research 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrisie Neal, an employee of the company and coordinator of the daylong event, 
said the idea behind Chevron's first annual "Take Our Sons to Work Day" was to 
give the children a chance to think about their careers at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, they can decide whether they want to follow in their fathers' or 
mothers' footsteps when they get older, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, on Imperial Highway in La Habra, is filled with labs where 
geologists, geophysicists and engineers conduct petroleum research -- whether 
it's analyzing the amount of petroleum in rocks dug from oil wells to 
developing newer technologies for the exploration and production of oil and 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the children were able to see such technology up front, including the 
electron microscope, which magnified the legs of an ant 4,500 times, and the 
machine shop, where rocks are cut with liquid nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Acharya decides to become a planning engineer is looking a little 
doubtful. 
</P>

 "I think I'll be a doctor instead," he said. TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; JUDGE PUTS CAMPUS RALLY, VIGIL ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge on Tuesday prohibited a Golden West 
College student group from holding a rally and 24-hour vigil on campus this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Jack K. Mandel ruled that there was no urgency in holding the rally 
during the first week of school. But he also said that the students should be 
able to hold the rally later. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Alfredo Amezcua, representing MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano 
de Aztlan), argued that prohibiting club members from staging a demonstration 
-- in an effort to speak out against the club's suspension for about a month 
last spring -- would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials argued that the rally would disrupt students on the first 
days of school, and sought a restraining order to prevent the club from holding 
the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandel sided with the college, but also said the club could hold the overnight 
vigil at a public park because the school is not open all night, and no one 
would listen to their protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members had decided before Tuesday's court hearing to cancel the protest 
because they were afraid they could be arrested should the judge rule in favor 
of the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Westin, the college's president, said MEChA was suspended temporarily 
last spring because the club allegedly participated in several "inappropriate" 
actions, including sponsoring a scholarship fund-raiser where alcohol was 
served. Westin also said the club boycotted a recruitment drive by the college 
aimed at attracting Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Carbajal, MEChA's spokeswoman, denied that the club had alcohol at the 
fund-raiser. A campus security officer found no alcohol at the fund-raiser, a 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin said he read the report but said that, on further investigation by Vice 
President of Student Services William Carpenter, he concluded that alcohol was 
present at the dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension was lifted but the college is not recognizing MEChA as an 
official club because it does not have an adviser. Westin is prohibiting 
MEChA's previous advisers to continue with the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the club is not recognized, the college required the club to get $1 
million liability insurance before holding the rally. MEChA did not buy the 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Mandel ruled that getting insurance "shall not be an obstacle" for a 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA President Miguel Guizar said the club will consider holding a rally 
sometime this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have the vigil but we can still make a lot of noise," he said. MIMI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; STUDENTS LEARN THROUGH 4TH R OF SCHOOLWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading, writing, arithmetic and race cars. Race cars? Yes, race cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Race-car driving has been added to the curriculum at Strathern Street School 
in North Hollywood. More than 400 children participated in the new activity 
Tuesday when they cheered on classmates who were on the playground racing 
remote-controlled miniature cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to teach the students basic schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Moynihan, Chatsworth inventor of this new learning tool, says the concept 
is quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hands-on approach," said Moynihan, president and creator of FUNCAR 
(Fundamental Understanding Naturally Creates Academic Results). 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a race car driver has to learn to read so he can understand a 
driver's manual. Students are also taught math when figuring out how many lug 
nuts they need to put together a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan said even geography lessons can be incorporated into the exercise by 
explaining where race car drivers travel throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that using remote-controlled race cars is an effective way to capture 
a student's interest. Once that is accomplished, fundamental principles can be 
applied. Moynihan tried out his idea for the first time Tuesday at the school, 
where his wife teaches kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan came up with the idea after participating in the school's career day 
in May. At the time, he demonstrated how to maneuver remote-controlled cars and 
talked about his business in Chatsworth, Dan's RC Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that day with the students, I decided to take it a step further," said 
Moynihan. "We are constantly telling kids what they can't do . . . to stay off 
drugs and not join gangs. I wanted to give them something that they were 
allowed to do, that they had fun doing, and that they would learn from at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
 So Moynihan sought corporate funding, which was provided by American Racing 
Equipment and GE Sanyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a great idea," said Rick Pruden, president of American 
Racing and the father of two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student who attended Tuesday's race was required to write an essay on why 
school is important. Students were allowed to write in their native language, 
and winning essays earned the youngster a chance to race. There were 14 winners 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Kubena, vice principal of Strathern Street Elementary School, hopes 
the FUNCAR program will eventually be implemented throughout the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love the cars. While they're playing they don't realize that they're 
learning at the same time," she said. "(The FUNCAR program) proves that you can 
teach students anything as long as you motivate them to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan plans to visit the school once a year, sending written assignments 
quarterly between visits. ALICIA DOYLE

<P>
 Cardinal Roger Mahony will preside over dedication and reopening ceremonies 
for the Glendale Community Center, formerly known as the Catholic Youth 
Organization building, at 10 a.m. Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The CYO has been closed for more than two years.The organization's dilapidated 
structure at 4322 San Fernando Road was torn down and its 6,200-square-foot 
replacement was built with $622,000 in federal Housing and Urban Development 
funds allocated by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A food pantry is already open at the new center. Over the next few months, the 
center will begin offering many other services, including earthquake 
assistance, family counseling, senior issues advocacy, Alcoholics Anonymous and 
Al-Anon meetings, and immigration processing. The center will also offer youth 
activities as well as English as a second language classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in this community, and I see that there is a real need for our 
programs," said Carlos Reyes, former director of the CYO and a staff member at 
the new center. "There was a real void left when the center closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The food pantry, operated on the site by Loaves and Fishes Catholic Charities, 
provides needy families with groceries on a periodic basis and homeless singles 
with free sack lunches. Loaves and Fishes also provides counseling for the 
homeless or those at risk of becoming homeless. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; CBS EXPANSION PLAN GAINS APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The community named for its contribution to the entertainment industry is one 
step closer to having an even bigger reason to call itself Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 City zoning officials have granted approval for a major expansion of the 
30-acre CBS compound on Radford Avenue that will add seven sound stages to the 
network's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator William E. Lillenberg granted to CBS on Friday 
a conditional use for expansion on an 11.5-acre site just north of the 
network's current lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, already owned by CBS and zoned for residential use, was partially 
used for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing community concerns, the network agreed to take steps to lessen the 
impact of traffic, noise and parking at the new facility, including building an 
internal bridge in its project area to reduce traffic on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lorimer, a member of the Studio City Residents Assn., said CBS has acted 
on the majority of the community's concerns about the expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, by and large, CBS has been a good neighbor," Lorimer said. "I wish 
all development efforts in Studio City could go like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The 245,000 square-foot, 10-building plan approved by the Zoning 
Administration includes four 18,000-square-foot sound stages 50 feet high and 
three sound stages 60 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the $30-million plan includes 1,202 parking spaces and the 
private bridge that spans the Los Angeles River to connect the new facilities 
to the existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has said that the studio facilities will be used for its own productions 
as well as for other studios and producers. Currently, about two-thirds of the 
shows produced at Studio Center's 16 sound stages are non-CBS shows for other 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael L. Klausman, president of CBS Studio Center, said the network hopes to 
begin the first phase of construction as early as November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy," he said. "Everyone has worked very well as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval is subject to appeal through Aug. 29. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: HEARING ON HOSPITALS' MERGER IS POSTPONED

<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has postponed today's public hearing on the 
controversial merging of two local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing has been rescheduled for 6 p.m. Sept. 19 at the Council Chambers, 
117 Macneil St., San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra time was given to allow officials from Mission Community Hospitals 
to reply in writing to a City Council complaint about the way San Fernando and 
Panorama community hospitals were merged to form Mission Community Hospitals 
earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 According to City Atty. Julia Silva, the merger may violate a 20-year 
agreement with San Fernando Community Hospital. In exchange for the city's 
support of a bond issue, the hospital administrators had agreed not to join 
with another hospital. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; LIBRARY TAX SET FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to pressure from merchants and residents, the San Fernando City Council 
has decided to hold an election next year to determine if the city will join 
the county in creating a special district to tax property owners to preserve 
public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members declared a victory for voters, who are often 
powerless to determine their taxation, library officials said waiting for an 
election will prevent the San Fernando branch of the Los Angeles County Public 
Library from receiving funds this year from a proposed Community Facilities 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of a new trend to take it to the voters," Councilman Raul 
Godinez II said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly a loss," said Judith Babka, manager of the 80-year-old San 
Fernando branch. "It means we will have to go from being open three days a week 
to two." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed special library district would charge property owners $28.50 a 
year for a single-family house to support the city's library, where budget cuts 
have reduced service from six days a week to three. During the past three 
years, the library's materials budget has been slashed from $48,500 to $500, 
with no funding for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only three of 52 cities in the county have signed on to the district, 
which would raise about $28.5 million for library operations. The San Fernando 
branch would receive about $176,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has until Aug. 30, when the Board of Supervisors will consider the 
proposal, to sign on for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the council meeting, Babka led about 40 supporters in a three-block 
march from the San Fernando branch on Library Street to City Hall. The 
marchers, carrying colorful, handmade signs, chanted, "Save San Fernando 
Library." 
</P>
<P>
 Their cries for help were soon joined by other residents who had come to the 
meeting to support the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, when I came to this country, the people in the library were 
the only ones who helped me learn the language," Juanita Garcia, 43, told the 
City Council. "We need that library." 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents and merchants weren't so willing to turn over their money. 
Brad Buckley, president of the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce, told the 
council that the property tax would "further strain many businesses already 
struggling to keep their doors open." Others resented being the last resort of 
government budget crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents of the property tax said they supported the local library, but 
suggested that the city find other ways to fund the service. Recommendations 
included using rent generated from the old police station, cutting city 
administrative salaries and charging a non-resident library fee. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members agreed that voters should have more control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this is against Proposition 13," said Councilman Doude Wysebeek, who 
made the motion to hold an election on the financing district in March. "They 
can 30-dollar us to death all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other mechanisms to fund county libraries are at work, including a 
bill passed Tuesday by the Assembly that would create a benefit assessment 
district to fund local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Authored by state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys), the bill would create a 
benefit assessment district similar to the facilities district. If approved by 
voters, the district would raise the same $28.5 million for county libraries by 
taxing single-family homes $28.50 annually, but without requiring city 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bill must go to Gov. Pete Wilson, who last year vetoed an earlier 
version. He has not indicated whether he would approve it this time. JEFF

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY GIVES ITS CONSENT TO ANTI-SKUNK 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents plagued by a proliferation of pesky skunks in their neighborhoods 
may soon get some relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Monday agreed to spend up to $3,000 to hire a professional 
animal trapper to remove the skunks in and around Huntington Central Park and 
relocate them to a wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 The trapper charges $25 per skunk, which means the money will pay for the 
capture of at least 100 animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the skunk population has increased rapidly. Skunks have 
overrun the Franciscan Fountains neighborhood near Golden West Street and 
Slater Avenue. They also have been a nuisance in other parts of the city, 
including residential areas off Bolsa Chica Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, community services director, said there are between 250 and 500 
skunks in the Central Park area. Hagan said recent construction at Central 
Library and nearby residential development have forced the skunks to migrate to 
the park and city flood-control channels. Because there are too many skunks, 
many are wandering into residential areas to look for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said that trapping will start next week, and a "skunk hot line" will be 
set up. The city also will make a product available free to the public that 
gets rid of the powerful skunk scent. The nontoxic powder will be available at 
the park's Shipley Nature Center by next week. Residents are asked to bring a 
plastic bag for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal-control officers also will begin a public education program to inform 
residents how to keep skunks out of their yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to the residents to follow up on the Orange County Animal Control 
handouts," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; GROUP RECOVERS FEES BUT WON'T FILE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA and MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered the city to pay the Fullerton Recalls 
Committee about $8,750 to cover attorney fees and court costs stemming from a 
recent lawsuit the committee won to force a special recall election in October. 
The committee had hoped to recover about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Departing from an earlier plan, recall members said they will not use the 
recovered fees to file a lawsuit seeking to keep recalled Councilman Don 
Bankhead from running in November for a four-year council term. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Donald E. Smallwood, after making his ruling on the fees and costs, said 
he hoped the group could avoid further lawsuits and settle its issues at the 
ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Snow Hume, secretary of the recall committee, said the group considered the 
judge's words and will hold off filing a lawsuit against Bankhead pending the 
outcome of the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 After consulting with attorney Mark S. Rosen, who has represented the 
committee, Hume said he thinks a lawsuit at this time would be "premature." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bankhead should win election in November, Hume said, the group would file 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead's term was to expire in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen said he thinks the committee would have had a good case against Bankhead 
had they proceeded immediately with a suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead has said the threatened legal action against him is "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman, along with colleagues Molly McClanahan and A.B. (Buck) Catlin, 
was ousted in June in Orange County's first successful recall election since 
1989. The recall was fueled by anger over a 2% utility tax the three lawmakers 
passed last summer to balance the city's budget, despite protests from hundreds 
of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with state law, the recalled council members will remain in 
office until a special election to replace them is held Oct. 18. All have been 
prohibited from running in the special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead recently submitted papers to run for the council in November's 
general election, which is not affected by the special recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had initially sought to combine the recall election with November's 
general election in an effort to save money. But Smallwood ruled in favor of a 
lawsuit filed by the Fullerton Recalls Committee and ordered the special 
election in October instead. The City Council announced earlier this month that 
it would not appeal the judge's decision on the special election. ANNA CEKOLA

<P>
 Thousands of storm drains in Burbank and nearby unincorporated areas will be 
cleaned this month in anticipation of wet weather in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the year so far has been relatively dry, storm drains are full of 
debris and tree foliage, among other things, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that has to be done to prepare for the rainy season," said 
Donna Guyovich, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will begin Aug. 29 to use hoses to suck the storm drains clean. It 
will take about 45 working days to complete and is not expected to 
inconvenience motorists, Guyovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm drains throughout the county are cleaned annually, she said. VIVIEN LOU

POLICE ARREST WIFE OF SLAIN FISH AND GAME OFFICIAL; CRIME: ARDITH CRIBBS, 38, 
IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TREATED FOR DRUG 
OVERDOSE, AND IS BEING HELD ON SUSPICION OF MURDER.

<P>
 Police on Tuesday arrested the wife of a state Department of Fish and Game 
official found shot to death inside the couple's home here last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardith Cribbs, 38, was taken into custody on suspicion of murder at Pacifica 
Community Hospital, where she was being released following treatment for a drug 
overdose, Huntington Beach police Officer Mike Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cribbs was found unconscious last Wednesday at the home she shared with her 
husband, Gordan L. Cribbs, 49, in the 8700 block of Elgin Circle. Gordan Cribbs 
was a patrol chief for the Fish and Game region, which has its headquarters in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardith Cribbs was taken to the Orange County Jail, where she was being held on 
$250,000 bail, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordan Cribbs, a 26-year veteran with the Fish and Game Department, supervised 
about 100 wardens and other personnel and was responsible for marine and 
wildlife protection from Santa Barbara to the Mexico border and the Eastern 
Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the couple said that Ardith Cribbs' clerical job with the Fish and 
Game Department had recently been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still uncertain about a motive in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still kind of a mystery to us," Corcoran said. "We don't have a motive. 
Could it have been murder-suicide? We don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous prescription drug containers were found at the residence, Corcoran 
said. But it is not certain whose prescriptions they were or what the drugs 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said a .38-caliber revolver that police believe was used in the 
shooting was not the side arm Gordan Cribbs was authorized to carry. That 
weapon was also found in the house, however.

MAN CHARGED IN 3 L.A. SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors filed murder charges Tuesday against a Michigan convict, accusing 
him of killing three people in Los Angeles County, including two teen-agers 
shot to death in Sylmar in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Attys.Pat Dixon and John Zajec said they will begin extradition 
proceedings against Torrance Egan Black, 22, who is now serving a 25- to 
45-year sentence for killing a man in Detroit. Black, who is also known as 
Kevin Ware, was also charged with two special circumstances that could qualify 
him for the death penalty: murder during a robbery and committing multiple 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges involved the June 25, 1993, shooting deaths of Christian Fries, 
19, and Phillip Doll, 17. Fries, who was shot in the head, was found in the 
14000 block of Polk Street. Phillip's body was discovered the same day in the 
14900 block of Roxfold Street. He had been shot and run over by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Black is also accused of the July 25, 1992 shooting of 21-year-old Kimberly 
Horton during a carjacking in Inglewood. A UCLA student, Horton was shot in the 
face, dragged from her 1991 Honda Accord and left on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being handled Downtown by the district attorney's Special Trials 
Division.

FOREST LAWN SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER MISPLACED BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forest Lawn Memorial-Park admitted in a court settlement Tuesday that it lost 
the body of a 77-year-old man who was supposed to be buried there, but lawyers 
for the cemetery denied accusations from the man's family that they were 
defrauded and deceived by the mortuary.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Superior Court Judge James Otero barred the five grown children of 
Alexander Williamson, who died in 1987, from disclosing the financial 
settlement they will be paid by Forest Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Williamson's sons said the court settlement and payment does not 
completely mollify the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They admit they lost my father, but they refused to apologize," said Richard 
Williamson, 36. "I wanted an apology, and I also wanted them to try to find my 
father, but they refused to do that either." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Williamson was supposed to be cremated at Forest Lawn's Glendale 
facility and his ashes buried in a protective vault at the Forest Lawn Covina 
Hills cemetery. But in May 1991, when his children tried to have his remains 
exhumed and reburied next to their mother, no vault was found -- just a few 
ashes and bone fragments buried under a flower pot, along with a metal tag used 
to identify the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Williamson said Forest Lawn maintained during the first two years of 
litigation brought by the family that the tag found at the grave belonged to 
his father. But Forest Lawn attorney Francisco Nicholas said the company never 
attempted to deceive the family. He said that the mortuary had admitted 
negligence and liability from the outset of the court case, and that the 
purpose of the litigation was only to determine the amount of damages to be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of this litigation we came to realize . . . that we were 
unable to identify with confidence the whereabouts of the cremated remains of 
the plaintiffs' father," Nicholas said. "There is no mystery on that." 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been other allegations of misconduct at the Glendale crematory. 
In October, 1990, a Caltrans worker found a box of ashes on the Glendale 
freeway that held the remains of a woman who was to have been interred at the 
cemetery the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Williamson believes his lawsuit and the earlier incident show a 
pattern of misconduct by the mortuary. Officials with the state Cemetery Board, 
which oversees cemetery operations, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas said the Williamson case was an isolated incident and that there is 
no pattern of wrongdoing.

ROCKETDYNE PROMISES TO STIFFEN SAFEGUARDS; INQUIRY: COMPANY SAYS STATIC 
ELECTRICITY, SPARK OR HOT PAN MAY HAVE IGNITED CONTAINER OF EXPLOSIVES IN FATAL 
BLAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promising tighter safety controls after an explosion at their Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory, Rocketdyne officials said Tuesday they believe two test 
engineers died and a third was injured because something ignited the small, 
half-full container of explosives one worker was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 Static electricity, a spark or a hot pan from an earlier test-burn could have 
touched off the highly volatile nitrocellulose the unidentified worker had been 
holding, said Rocketdyne President Paul Smith. But he added, "I really don't 
want to speculate on what caused this explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the theory is not conclusive, it was as close as a three-week 
internal investigation could come to the cause of a July 26 blast at the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the California office of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration is continuing its own investigation of the explosion that killed 
Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park and Larry A. Pugh, 51, of Thousand Oaks, and 
injured Lee Wells, 62, of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be two to four weeks before the state safety agency decides whether to 
cite Rocketdyne for any safety violations, said Rick Rice, a Cal/OSHA 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the privacy of the victims' families, Smith refused to say at a news 
conference at Rocketdyne's Canoga Park headquarters whether it was Pugh or 
Heiney who carried the 6-by-6 1/2-inch plastic container of nitrocellulose that 
Rocketdyne investigators say they believe exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business we're in -- and in fact in any business -- accidents 
shouldn't happen," Smith told reporters. "This accident has only heightened our 
belief that we can't pay too much attention to safety."  
</P>
<P>
 From now on, Rocketdyne health and safety inspectors will scrutinize safety 
procedures in every test involving high-energy chemicals beforehand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And until fail-safe test methods are in place, Rocketdyne has suspended tests 
involving nitrocellulose and glycidal azide polymer, the rocket fuel ingredient 
that was being tested on July 26, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, people get comfortable" in laboratory work, Smith said. Safeguards 
must be in place "no matter how comfortable the employees are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Michael McHale, Rocketdyne's vice president of advanced programs, 
said this is what their investigation found: 
</P>
<P>
 The workers had laid out one aluminum test pan that morning, surrounding it 
with a square, bottomless, 2-foot-high box-like shield made of 3/8-inch-thick 
aluminum sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they covered the pan with a layer of sawdust and spread about three or 
four pounds of nitrocellulose atop that, capping the mixture with three to four 
pounds of glycidal azide polymer. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker assigned to ignite the mixture inserted an electrical device known 
as a "match" into the mixture. He alone carried a key to switch the device on, 
so the chemicals could not be sparked accidentally while other workers were 
nearby, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then that worker and his four colleagues retreated to the safety of a nearby 
block house. There, he used the key to trigger the match, which heated in 
microseconds to about 450 degrees Fahrenheit and set the sawdust and chemicals 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief, intense fireball about 15 to 20 feet across bloomed out of the top of 
the shield enclosure while acoustic probes nearby recorded the shock waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers noticed some flames lingering in the residue afterward, indicating not 
all the chemicals had burned. But they dumped dirt and water into the pan, then 
shoved it toward the northern end of the test enclosure and set up another 
shield and pan directly to the south of the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 After laying chemicals out in the southern pan, the workers retreated to the 
blockhouse and ignited them, causing another fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went normally, and at this point they returned to the area," dumped dirt 
into the southern test pan and cleaned out the northern test pan, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question it had cooled off," he said. "They put in the sawdust, 
they put in the chemicals and started to withdraw from the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the workers saw either Pugh or Heiney -- Rocketdyne declines to say which 
-- walk to a storage area and retrieve an open, five-pound plastic container of 
nitrocellulose. 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving test workers told investigators the container seemed to hold about 
two pounds of the material, a highly volatile nitrated wood pulp. 
Nitrocellulose is used in testing to accelerate the burning of other chemicals, 
said Rocketdyne spokesman Paul Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
 The inch-thick layer of nitrocellulose spread out on the test pan could never 
explode, but several inches of it in the plastic container could, said McHale. 
</P>
<P>
 As the worker carried the container back toward the test pans, his co-workers 
"were all looking at other things, and none of them saw what happened to that 
container of nitrocellulose," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 It blew apart the southern test shield -- which had held only residue from the 
second test -- splitting its seams and flinging the aluminum shield walls in 
all directions. The explosion also threw the northern shield against a hillside 
some 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County coroner's officials said the blast killed Pugh and Heiney 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It also caused severe burns to the arms of Lee Wells, the only one of the 
other three employees at the site who has been identified by Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Wells said his memories of the moments before the blast were 
"pretty doggone foggy." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could remember was I was over at the sidelines and I felt the impact, 
and I was on the ground," Wells said. "I didn't watch them put the stuff in to 
any degree. . . . All I felt was the big rush, and that was it." Blast Theory 
Twice that day, Rocketdyne employees had laid out chemicals in aluminum pans 
surrounded by square shields of 2-foot-high, 3/8-inch thick sheet aluminum. 
Then they had retreated to the blockhouse,ignited the chemicals remotely and 
recorded the resulting fire with acoustic probes.After two successful tests, 
workers cleaned out the northern pan and filled it with chemicals for a third 
test. As heiney or Pugh walked toward the area carrying a small container of 
nitrocellulose, something ignited the chemical and triggered the explosion. The 
blast blew apart the southern shield and flung the northern shield against a 
hillside 50 feet away. 1. Otto K. Helney, an engineer, was killed. Responsible 
for the pans housing the chemicals, he was only about two feet away from the 
explosion. 2. Larry A. Pugh, a physicist, was about six feet away and was 
killed instantly. 3. Lee Wells, on site to assist, was farther away and blown 
against hills behind test site, suffering second-and third-degree burns on 20% 
of his body. 4. Site manager / chemist, farther away, escaped without injury. 
5. Engineer, also unharmed. Source: Rockwell International's Rocketdyne

ALLEGED KILLER PORTRAYED AS MANIPULATOR OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM; COURTS: 
TESTIMONY CLAIMS ANNA ALFARO, 20, WAS KIDNAPED, RAPED AND FATALLY SHOT BY HER 
EX-BOYFRIEND. NEARLY FIVE YEARS LATER, SUSPECT IS BOUND OVER FOR TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 She was 20, a Reseda secretary who had just moved into her first apartment. He 
was 19, a reputed North Hollywood gang member known by the street name Chaka. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, nearly five years after she was killed on Christmas Eve, the tale of 
their tainted love has moved to a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels, Ruben Dario Garcia began 
terrorizing Anna Alfaro after she dumped him for her high school sweetheart. 
And then, Samuels alleges, Garcia kidnaped, raped and killed Alfaro -- firing 
the fatal shot into her head in front of two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the officers, William Merchant, testified last Friday that he'll never 
forget the hopeful look in Alfaro's eyes as the spotlight of his patrol car 
caught her crouching submissively in front of Garcia in an apartment building 
alcove. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned toward the officer and their eyes met: "It was like, 'Oh, good. The 
police are here.' Then, the next second, 'Boom!' " Merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing two days of such testimony about Alfaro's death, Van Nuys 
Municipal Court Judge Leslie Dunn this week ordered Garcia bound over for trial 
on charges of first-degree murder, kidnaping, rape, attempted murder and 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-degree murder charge carries three special circumstances that make 
Garcia eligible for the death penalty: He allegedly laid in wait for Alfaro, 
and he allegedly killed her during the commission of two other serious crimes 
-- a rape and a kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels also alleged that Garcia, who had the same nickname as an infamous 
tagger, had manipulated the criminal justice system for years, both before and 
after Alfaro's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he should have been in jail for violating his probation for a 1988 
auto theft conviction on the night he allegedly killed Alfaro, Samuels said. 
Testimony during the hearing and court records painted a picture of an abusive 
relationship -- and of Garcia's ability to evade the law for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfaro's boyfriend, Luis Diaz, testified that they had just delivered 
Christmas gifts at the home of Alfaro's parents in the 7000 block of Hazeltine 
Avenue in Van Nuys when Garcia "jumped out of the bushes," about 10 that night, 
pointed a revolver at him, and grabbed her by the hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled the trigger two times. It clicked. Then he hit her on the head with 
the gun. She was scared and crying. He told her to shut up and hit her on the 
head with the gun," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz dialed 911 and the police search began. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Merchant used the detached and precise language of testimony to 
describe what he saw when he and the other officer spotted Alfaro and Garcia in 
the alcove, by an apartment garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of them looked at us, I put the car in park, and as I was exiting the 
vehicle I heard a gunshot. I saw him extend his arm and fire a second round 
into her head. She fell back against the garage and to her right. The defendant 
turned the gun toward myself and my partner and fired some more rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant said he and his partner rolled for cover. He doesn't remember drawing 
his gun, but he must have, he said. Merchant saw Garcia get back up, then heard 
him crash against some trash cans. Within seconds, he disappeared into the 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed him to be up in the trees, sitting there waiting for us," Merchant 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, five or six other squad cars were sealing off the neighborhood. A 
police helicopter hovered above. Merchant said he provided cover for a rescuer, 
who jumped out of an ambulance and who ran down the alley to check Alfaro's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said she was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 As it has unfolded, the case has served as a tragic example of how difficult 
it is to protect someone from threatened violence, and how frustrating it can 
be to bring an accused killer to trial when states with different death penalty 
laws are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alfaro was laid to rest in what was to be her wedding dress, her story 
inspired news stories, editorials and official frustration over the criminal 
justice system's inability to deal with domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show she had called the police on Garcia four times in the fall 
of 1989, but each time officers arrived, he would be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 She told officers he hit her, causing her to fall through a window on Sept. 
12, that he bit her on Nov. 14, that he slapped her Dec. 11, and that he jumped 
out of the bushes and threatened her with a knife on Dec. 22. She declined to 
prosecute at least two of the cases, the records show, and the Dec. 22 incident 
was still under investigation when she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was suspected of threatening Alfaro's parents after her death, he 
proved equally elusive, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled to New York, and he managed to slip through the cracks while being 
arrested five times on drug charges, using the aliases Daniel Gutierrez and 
Thomas Garcia. By the time New York authorities learned about the California 
murder warrant, Garcia was back on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even after he was taken into custody in Brighton Beach on the warrant, New 
York authorities refused to return him to California until he served his time 
in their state, reasoning that he couldn't finish his New York sentence if 
California executed him. 
</P>
<P>
 New York does not have the death penalty. But after Garcia completed his 
sentence, Samuels succeeded in having him transferred to California to stand 
trial. He arrived this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels expects even more delays. "He's managed to use the system to keep 
himself out of court for a long time," Samuels said. "I expect it will be a 
long time before we go to trial."

WEST HILLS SUSPECT IN ATTACK ON ESTRANGED WIFE RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Hills man arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting his estranged, 
wheelchair-bound and legally blind wife -- and restraining and gagging her 
seeing-eye dog -- was released from custody Tuesday, but authorities said the 
matter remained under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are definitely continuing to look into this," said Detective Nancy 
Severns, who interviewed the alleged victim Tuesday with a prosecutor from the 
district attorney's office Van Nuys branch. 
</P>
<P>
 After the interview, prosecutors decided that police did not have enough 
evidence to charge horseback riding instructor Terry Foladare, 41, with any 
crimes. Foladare had been held at the West Valley jail in lieu of $300,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been living separately in recent months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Detective Harry Hollywood said the case could be resubmitted to 
prosecutors for filing, but that it would take police at least several weeks to 
gather the necessary evidence and conduct a battery of tests and laboratory 
analyses beforehand. Under law, criminal suspects must be arraigned within 72 
hours of their arrest or let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we still have to believe that something did occur but we have 
to gather the evidence to see what kind of case we have," said Hollywood. "You 
have to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that this in fact occurred. 
Based on (the victim's) statements, we believe that something occurred. We just 
have to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the 26-year-old victim contacted officers last 
Saturday night after the alleged attack. Police then took her to an 
unidentified hospital to confirm her account, then arrested Foladare at his 
home after she identified him as her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of forced entry at her Reseda Boulevard apartment and her 
seeing-eye dog's snout had been taped shut while it was restrained in the 
kitchen, according to Hollywood and Severns. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the victim, who works with horses, has a broken leg, apparently from 
a work-related injury. It was unclear, they said, whether she was in a 
wheelchair permanently or only while she recovered from the leg injury.

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ATTACK PROBED AS POSSIBLE HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Beach man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to assault charges stemming 
from an attack on a black teen-ager whose beating is being investigated as a 
possible hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Thomas Jones, 20, remained in Central Men's Jail in Santa Ana on 
$100,000 bail after being charged with assault with a deadly weapon and 
attempting to dissuade a witness from testifying, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said a third suspect has been 
arrested in connection with the Aug. 5 beating of Ruben Charles Vaughn, 15, of 
Tustin, and a white friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, who suffered a broken jaw and several puncture wounds, has been 
released from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Tom Garner said a 17-year-old Lake Forest boy turned himself in 
to deputies Monday morning in connection with the incident. Another juvenile 
had been arrested earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a well-liked student and standout football player at Santa Margarita 
High School, was beaten and stabbed with an unknown weapon, and his friend was 
punched and attacked with pepper spray after they showed up in Portola Hills 
for a party attended by about 30 people. Vaughn's stepfather has said Vaughn 
was lured there for the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone shouted a racial slur during the attack, authorities said, and 
investigators are trying to determine if the assault was racially motivated.

CITY TALKING TO STATE ON PENSION SPIKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are in Sacramento today to meet with state Public Employees' 
Retirement System officials to discuss the city's tab for pension-spiking 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, Councilman Dave Sullivan and attorney 
Peter J. Brown, hired by the council to represent the city on the spiking 
issue, will be involved in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find out all our options before deciding how to proceed 
further," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A council majority contends that the practice of some city employees inflating 
their pensions to increase their retirement pay is illegal and that the city 
should not be obligated to pay an estimated $13-million for pension spiking.  
</P>
<P>
 Spiking is the term given when employees artificially inflate their retirement 
pay by taking unused vacation days, car allowances and city retirement 
contributions as if they were part of the final year's salary, on which a 
pension is based. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the council decided to challenge PERS on the legality of spiking and 
voted not to pay a pension-spiking bill.  
</P>
<P>
 PERS informed the city July 22 that it is obligated to pay for pension-spiking 
costs, and that it will increase the city's contribution rate to cover the 
unfunded liability.

GIRL, 7, KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 7-year-old Santa Ana girl was killed Tuesday when she was ejected from her 
family's car after a tire blew out, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjan Garcia Ramirez was thrown from the back seat of her family's car as it 
was traveling north on the Santa Ana Freeway near Brookhurst Street, according 
to the Orange County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Other family members were taken to area hospitals for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was sitting in the back seat of the Mercury, without a seat belt, 
between two other children, police said. After the blowout, the coroner said, 
the girl was ejected from the car, which subsequently rolled over her, killing 
her instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the other children was thrown from the car. No other vehicles were 
involved in the accident.

TWO PILOTS SAFE AFTER DESERT CRASH OF JET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Air Force training jet crashed into the Mojave Desert here Tuesday morning, 
but the two men on board parachuted to safety, base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Air Force Capt. Roderick L. Cregier, the commander of the aircraft, and a 
Swedish Air Force pilot were picked up by a helicopter, taken to a base 
hospital, examined and released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both are in good condition," said Edwards spokeswoman Dottie Spiegelberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the Swedish pilot, who was taking part in an exchange training 
program, was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was under investigation by Air Force officials, but the cause was 
not immediately determined, Spiegelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were flying an A-37 two-seat, twin-engine jet on a mission for the 
Air Force Test Pilot School when the crash occurred at 10 a.m. in an 
unpopulated portion of the base. A-37 jets, built mainly in the late 1950s, are 
used primarily to train pilots at Edwards.

COALITION GETS GRANT FOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN; RECOVERY: L.A. COUNCIL EARMARKS 
$350,000 FOR VALLEY GROUP TO IDENTIFY NEEDS OF BUSINESSES AND WAYS TO ADDRESS 
THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of business associations will receive $350,000 in federal 
earthquake recovery funds to create an economic development plan for the San 
Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, known as the Economic Development Alliance, was created after 
the Jan. 17 quake to advocate for the economic and business interests of the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very big issue for the San Fernando Valley -- economic 
development," said David Honda, chairman of the alliance. "We're very pleased 
with this." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance will draw upon the resources of its individual organizations and 
of academia to develop an economic development plan, Honda said. Researchers 
from UCLA, USC and Stanford will work with the alliance to identify the needs 
of the Valley's business community and ways to address those needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to reinvent what's already been done and ask the same 
questions," said Honda, who is also chairman of the Valley Economic Development 
Center, a member of the coalition. "People don't want to hear the same 
questions. They just want results." 
</P>
<P>
 The funds are part of a $1.8-million grant that the U. S. Department of 
Commerce's Economic Development Administration awarded the city earlier this 
year. The alliance played a key role in writing the city's application for the 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically developed a plan and approached the city with it," said Ted 
Berkowitz, manager of industrial development for the city's Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkowitz said the alliance was ideal for the grant because of the members' 
Valleywide focus and years of expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a natural for them," he said. "They bring their own resources to 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
 After the plan is written, the alliance will apply for federal money that can 
be distributed in the form of loans to businesses that did not qualify for 
Small Business Administration or Federal Emergency Management Agency loans 
after the quake, said Jerry Curry, president of United Chambers of Commerce of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite a few businesses fell through the cracks," Curry said. "We hope that 
businesses that are struggling will still benefit from this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the grant will be used to hire staff who will provide 
citywide economic development services, Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before passing the proposal, several council members, including Laura Chick, 
praised the alliance for "pulling together in an incredible way," and working 
in cooperation with government to solve the community's economic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance consists of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando 
Valley, the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., California Industrial 
Leadership Council and the Valley Economic Development Center.

DAD PLEADS INNOCENT TO ENDANGERING CHARGE; COURT: JUDGE REDUCES TEACHER'S BAIL 
AND SAYS HE DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT SON HE LEFT ALONE IN CAR, BUT SETS SEPTEMBER 
HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A high school English teacher, described as "an intellectual" and dedicated 
family man, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a single felony charge of endangering 
his 20-month-old son by leaving him locked in a car Sunday in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that the actions of Dennis Karl Fischer, 34, "will not go down in 
the annals of history as the smartest thing," Municipal Court Judge Leland 
Harris nonetheless reduced bail from $50,000 to $10,000, taking into account 
Fischer's clean record. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that Fischer did not intend to hurt his son, and that the boy 
did not require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Darleen Fischer, the defendant's wife and mother of the victim, said she is 
standing by her husband. She said she considered the criminal charge against 
him to be "overblown." Social workers returned the boy to her custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, defense attorney Jan W. Versteeg said, "has totally torn asunder a 
loving, close-knit family."  
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who teaches 10th and 12th grade English and is the department 
chairman at Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles, was ordered to 
return to court Sept. 13 to schedule a preliminary hearing. The hearing will 
determine whether he will stand trial in Superior Court on the felony child 
endangerment charge, which carries a maximum six-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutor David Mintz allege that Fischer left his son, Jarred, 
locked inside the car in front of a Foster's Old Fashioned Freeze in the 7300 
block of Reseda Boulevard on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts vary of how long the child was left in the car. Fischer estimated his 
son was alone for five minutes, but passersby told police he was gone 20 
minutes or more, Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler began screaming, apparently while his father was inside a nearby 
music store, and passersby pulled him from Fischer's Honda Civic, using a fan 
belt to unlock the door, Mintz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mintz said the temperature inside the car was estimated at 110 degrees and 
that the child could have suffered brain damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added that the three rescuers found the child flushed and 
perspiring, so they gave him water, wrapped him in a wet towel and kept him in 
an air-conditioned car to lower his body temperature. He said one of the three 
rescuers dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer also called police, fearing his son had been kidnaped when he came out 
of the store and found the boy gone, said Versteeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Versteeg said the day began innocently when Fischer took his son for a swim. 
The boy was asleep in his car seat so Fischer decided to leave him behind while 
he went into the store "to pick up a few things," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got distracted inside," Versteeg said. "He came back and the child was 
gone. He was horrified. He thought the child was kidnaped. He was devastated. 
He loves his son very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who rescued the child refused to return him to Fischer until police 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers took Fischer into custody and the case was reported to social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday, he went for a swim with his son, and that afternoon he found 
himself in jail," Versteeg said.  
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues said the Fischers had postponed having children until they could 
buy a home. They said he was happy with his new family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just find all this amazing," said Laura Holden, a physical education 
teacher and the teachers union representative at Fremont.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are just shocked," said Marcia Hines, an assistant principal. "They're 
saying, 'No, it couldn't be him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "He's really a fine teacher; he's responsible and reliable. He 
really has a spotless record with teaching. He's an intellectual."

SUPERVISORS URGED TO INCREASE FUNDING OF HOSPITALS; GOVERNMENT: HEARINGS ON 
PROPOSED $3.7-BILLION COUNTY BUDGET OPEN WITH PLEAS ON BEHALF OF MEDICAL CARE 
FOR THE POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As public hearings on the Orange County budget opened Tuesday, health care 
representatives urged the Board of Supervisors to increase funding to hospitals 
that are bearing the burden of providing free medical services to poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get real on funding the (Medical Services for Indigents) program," said 
Edward J. Foley, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
"You must at least pay a fair share." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley and several other speakers said demands on hospitals and other groups 
that provide services for the poor are increasing, while financial support from 
the county has dropped below the funding levels of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came as the county kicked off three consecutive days of public 
hearings on its proposed $3.7-billion budget for the fiscal year starting in 
October. The budget provides about the same level of funding for county 
services as in the current year, while proposing the hiring of 932 new 
employees. Most of those positions would be funded through state and federal 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board reviewed the proposed departmental budgets for the 
county's Health Care and Social Services agencies. Both agencies are expected 
to receive slight increases over last year's funding and staffing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed budget, the Health Care Agency's indigent-care program is 
slated for a $2.25-million boost over last year's allotment of about $31 
million, officials said. That amount, however, is still below the $36 million 
appropriated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is doing as well as they can considering our budget restrictions," 
said Herbert Rosenzweig, director of county medical services. "Most of our 
budget reductions have been forced upon us by the state, but the county has 
recognized a need for these services and has put more money to them this year. 
We're doing the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said the county should do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chauncey A. Alexander, another health care representative, asked that the 
county increase indigent care funds by $1.3 million. He also asked board 
members to allocate $255,000 for community clinics that provide for the 
"health-care deprived" and another $123,000 for additional 18 to 20 shelter 
beds for the "homeless mentally disabled on our streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to adopt the proposed county budget in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials are relieved that the proposed budget does not call 
for the severe cuts imposed in the past two years, they said they are concerned 
about the uncertainty swirling around the state budget, which has been balanced 
with uncertain federal funding. If those federal funds are not available, the 
state may look to counties to make up its shortfall, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider told the board that the county 
is in a stable financial position despite a "weak economy" that "continues to 
affect revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done a lot with very little," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the board will consider departmental budgets for public protection, 
environmental resources and general government. The final public hearing 
Thursday will cover capital improvements, debt services, insurance and 
revenues.

TRANSIT AIDE TO PAY $2,500 FINE IN CONFLICT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A middle manager at the Orange County Transportation Authority has agreed to 
pay a $2,500 fine for breaking state conflict-of-interest laws by failing to 
disclose a side business, a spokesman for the district attorney's office said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Efren Villanueva Medellin, a 23-year county employee, paid the fine and 
acknowledged his culpability to settle a civil lawsuit that the district 
attorney filed against him Monday for violating the Political Reform Act of 
1994, Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges will be sought because Medellin was not found to have 
intentionally violated the law, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Anderson said there was no evidence that Medellin used his former 
position as a maintenance supervisor to enrich his own business, which he ran 
out of his Garden Grove home. The enterprise, called Medellin Product Services, 
sold automotive parts to customers, including other transit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Anderson said that Medellin broke the law when in March, 1991, he 
neglected to mention in financial interest reports required of all public 
officials that he had started a business the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Medellin did list the business in his 1992 report, he neglected to 
report sources of business income over $10,000 as required by law, Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medellin refused to comment on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Heyser, the OCTA's director of human resources, said Medellin, 46, 
earlier this year gave up his home business as part of a separate agreement he 
made with the transportation authority. 
</P>
<P>
 When OCTA officials first became concerned about potential conflicts involving 
Medellin's home business in 1993, he requested reassignment from the 
maintenance department, where he might influence the purchase of bus parts, 
Heyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that more recently Medellin, who had been moved to the operations 
area, was again shifted, this time to facilities, where he holds a 
$62,900-a-year management job and "is not dealing even indirectly with any 
parts vendors." 
</P>
<P>
 All this was done, she said, "to remove the appearance of conflict of interest 
and to ensure there would be none. . . . We are very serious about this."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ENVIRONMENTALISTS SUE TO STOP TOXIC WASTE 
BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of environmentalists has filed a lawsuit demanding that a cement 
company stop burning hazardous wastes, claiming that burning the materials 
violates federal law and poses a health danger for nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement Co. of California already has been ordered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency to stop burning the materials at its facility 
near Lebec as of Aug. 25.  
</P>
<P>
 But the company will try Aug. 24 in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco to delay the EPA's ruling until an appeal can be heard. The 
lawsuit is intended "as a backup" to the EPA order, said Lyle Talbot, a member 
of the Desert Citizens Against Pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeks 
an injunction to halt the hazardous materials burning. No hearing date on the 
request has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not to shut down big business, but for the people who prepare the 
witch's brew and feed it to the kiln," he said. "They can continue to make 
cement the old-fashioned way." 
</P>
<P>
 The company burns spent hazardous solvents mixed with petroleum in a kiln to 
generate the heat necessary to manufacture cement. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Unmacht, president of National Cement, called the lawsuit "frivolous" and 
said he doubts it will have any impact on the company's battle to continue 
burning the materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks that National Cement be required to pay more than $27 million 
in government fines for allegedly burning hazardous materials illegally since 
August, 1991. Talbot said several of the group's members who live downwind of 
the company's kiln have experienced nosebleeds, headaches, respiratory problems 
and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unmacht said many of his employees live in the same area and "they don't 
report those symptoms." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The long-running dispute over the burning also involves the Tejon Ranch Co., 
owner of the land where the kiln is located. Tejon Ranch officials said they 
are aware of the burning, but that they are not participants in its supervision 
and direction. Tejon Ranch is about 30% owned by Times Mirror Co., publisher of 
The Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 National Cement has the only operating commercial waste incinerator in 
California, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Unmacht said about 40% of the mixture currently burned is hazardous waste. He 
said the company will use an all-petroleum mixture if the order to stop 
hazardous materials burning is upheld, but eight employees with Systech 
Environmental Corp., which processes chemicals at the kiln site, would be laid 
off.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER OKS LIBRARY SERVICES TAX FOR ONE 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have voted to impose a new library services fee on 
property owners for one year and let voters decide whether to maintain the fee 
beyond that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The library charges will be added to property tax bills if the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors votes to set up a proposed assessment district 
after an Aug. 30 public hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearing, the supervisors asked elected officials in the 52 
incorporated cities served by county libraries to decide whether they will 
allow the fee to be collected in their cities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the owner of a single-family house in Lancaster would pay $28.50 
a year for library services. Other fees would be imposed for mobile homes, 
apartment buildings, commercial structures and vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fee would not be collected in Palmdale, which operates its own city 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster council members, who voted Monday to impose the fee, said they are 
reluctant to raise local property tax bills but want to restore library hours, 
which have been cut dramatically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a library user. I consider myself self-taught through books," said 
Councilwoman Deborah Shelton. "I don't think I'd be what I am today without a 
library and books. I really could not bring myself to leave the library hanging 
in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster branch library once operated seven days a week for a total of 64 
hours. In recent years, however, the county system has lost about half of its 
property tax revenue because of state budget problems. The Lancaster branch, 
one of the busiest in the county system, is now open only four days a week, for 
a total of 28 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 If county supervisors approve the new assessment district, the Lancaster 
library's hours will increase to at least 55 hours, six days a week, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Roberts and Councilmen Henry Hearns and Michael Singer joined 
Shelton in approving the new fee for the fiscal year that began July 1. 
However, the council also has placed an advisory measure on the November 
ballot, asking residents if they want to continue the fee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure is voted down, council members have said they will remove 
Lancaster from the assessment district next year, ending the fee. The election 
will occur too late to delete the fee from this year's tax bills, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Runner cast the only vote against collecting the fee this 
year. "I felt uncomfortable imposing the tax for even one year until we heard 
from the public at an election," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Runner said widespread confusion could occur if the library measure loses in 
November, then shows up on property tax bills in December because of the 
council's vote this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, County Librarian Sandra Reuben said Wednesday that she is pleased by 
the Lancaster council majority's decision. "I'm delighted," she said. "This is 
a major library in a major community. It really means we can start getting back 
to normal services." 
</P>
<P>
 If county supervisors approve the assessment district Aug. 30, expanded 
library hours in Lancaster will probably begin about a month later, Reuben 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STUDY ORDERED AFTER SHAFT MISHAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to recent accidents in which people have fallen into deep shafts, Los 
Angeles County supervisors Tuesday ordered a study of potential laws to 
increase safety at construction sites.  
</P>
<P>
 The action proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich comes after two accidents in 
less than a week involving deep holes at construction sites, one of which was 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 9, a Santa Clarita building inspector slipped down a 66-foot-deep 
shaft while inspecting homes demolished after the Northridge earthquake. Wedged 
in the hole for nearly four hours, Jaime Lozoya, 32, died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, an 11-year-old boy was rescued in fair condition from a 
40-foot-deep shaft at a construction site in Malibu.  
</P>
<P>
 Imposing fines on property owners who do not securely cover holes bored for 
geological testing or other reasons may help prevent accidents, an Antonovich 
spokesman said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MONTANA PILOT AMONG THREE KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lolo, Mont., pilot was one of three men killed Saturday when their 
fire-retardant bomber crashed in California, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Buc, 61, died when his C-130 Hercules tanker exploded in mid-air and 
crashed in the Angeles National Forest near Palmdale, about 85 miles northeast 
of Los Angeles, Jerry Buc told the Missoulian newspaper in an interview from 
his Texas home. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and relatives said Robert Buc retired from the Navy as a lieutenant 
commander after more than two decades of service and about 500 aircraft carrier 
landings. He had flown fire retardant-type planes for about 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a natural for it because of all his experience in the Navy," Jerry 
Buc, a retired Navy pilot, said about his brother's ability to meticulously 
position his huge plane for the most effective slurry drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Buc's death has not yet been officially confirmed. The U.S. Forest Service in 
California said that the Los Angeles County coroner would release 
identification of the three killed. But a coroner's office spokesman said 
Tuesday it had no identification of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Buc was told of his brother's crash late Saturday afternoon by the owner 
of Hemet Valley Flying Service, a California company that contracts retardant 
planes to the U.S. Forest Service.

VOTE ON FATE OF 2 GOLF COURSES AGAIN PUT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday once again postponed a vote on a controversial 
proposal to privatize the operations of two city-owned golf courses, although 
an independent report called it "a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they wanted to give the city's budget advisory commission 
a chance to review the report presented Tuesday by a management consulting firm 
outlining the pros and cons of the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 A contributing factor to the delay was the absence of Councilman Frank 
Feldhaus, who left the meeting midway through. Councilman Irv Pickler explained 
to the audience that Feldhaus had "another meeting to attend." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of privatizing the H.G. (Dad) Miller and Anaheim Hills golf courses 
has lead to a fierce debate between those who maintain it would create 
additional revenue for the city and opponents who say the city would lose 
control of a valuable asset. 
</P>
<P>
 American Golf Corp., which submitted the most attractive offer for the 20-year 
contract, would make about $2 million worth of improvements to the irrigation 
systems and pay rent of $1.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by KPMG Peat Marwick Management Consultants said privatization would 
mean the immediate transfer of more than $2 million into the city's general 
fund, because that's money the city wouldn't have to spend on golf course 
irrigation systems. It also would mean an upfront profit of $1.7 million and a 
guaranteed income to the city of $1.65 million per year.  
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, these benefits outweigh the risks of losing some control over 
the golf course operations," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Bob D. Simpson and Fred Hunter have opposed privatization, saying 
the return wasn't enough to justify relinquishing control of the courses and 
that the city should be loyal to its workers.  
</P>
<P>
 The 25 full-time workers and 40 part-time workers would no longer work for the 
city, but American Golf officials have said those employees would be rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly and Councilmen Feldhaus and Pickler have favored privatization 
but have not yet endorsed American Golf's proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really need to put this to conclusion," Simpson said. "There are a lot of 
folks out there who've been waiting for a long time for us to make a decision 
we should have made a long a long ago."

PROGRAM TAKES HEALING ARTS TO NEIGHBORHOODS; WORKSHOPS: LOCAL ARTISTS SPREAD 
THE WORD TO INNER-CITY YOUTHS ABOUT SONG, DANCE AND THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Los Angeles smoldered and burned-out lots stood suddenly fallow after 
the April, 1992, riots, Sheila Scott-Wilkinson got the chance to bring a 
long-held vision of hers to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts called on 
the film and television actress to begin working some healing magic for the 
scarred city. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $60,000 grant, Wilkinson immediately began formulating on paper what 
had been in her head for years: a grass-roots series of arts workshops for 
youths that would employ as many local artists in as many parts of the inner 
city as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, hundreds of teen-agers around the city are not only sharing Wilkinson's 
vision but are shaping it into their own through song, dance, theater and other 
art forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, I had been seeing a tremendous need for high-quality arts 
programs in places like South-Central. Not enough artists even think about 
working there," said Wilkinson. "They (the state and federal arts agencies) 
didn't really know what I was going to do. But I did."  
</P>
<P>
 An acting teacher who also operates Art Reach, an arts workshop for prisons 
and correctional youth facilities, Wilkinson had experience coordinating arts 
programs, though not on so grand a scale. She drove throughout the city 
checking out sites and single-handedly assembled a summer Artists-in-Residence 
program. She placed artists for up to six weeks of workshops from Compton to 
Pico-Union that offered young people ages 12 to 18 free training in theater, 
dance, visual arts, comedy, music, video production and creative writing.  
</P>
<P>
 The best part, said Wilkinson, was turning places -- churches, libraries and 
community centers -- into meeting points for artists and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of set up shop where the space was available or centrally located," 
said Wilkinson, herself an artist-in-residence at the William Grant Still 
center in the Crenshaw district. "And I talked a lot to artists and community 
people to see what program was needed or wanted most."  
</P>
<P>
 For Edward Grice, associate pastor at True Growth Inspiration Missionary 
Baptist Church in South-Central, the twice-weekly music and drumming workshops 
did more than intended. From the core of more than 20 arts students, Grice 
formed a teen round-table discussion group that meets once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of shootings recently at Washington High School, and the 
teens wanted to address that on a regular basis," Grice said. "This was a great 
opportunity to do that." Now in its third year, the program has expanded to 45 
artists and includes Venice's Oakwood district -- on the $60,000 budget.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted this program to not only fulfill kids, but make the artists more 
complete by bringing them into the community and forcing them to deal directly 
with cultures other than their own," said Wilkinson.  
</P>
<P>
 While the program's teaching staff reflects the ethnic makeup of Central Los 
Angeles -- black, Latino and Anglo -- all deal with students of other colors 
and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Master drummer Ernesto Salcedo teaches a universal language of rhythm during 
workshops, when students mimic his beats on a variety of African, 
pre-Columbian, Native American and Latin American instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drums tell myths and stories of cultures these kids have never been 
exposed to," said the East Los Angeles native.

A MATTER OF REVIVAL; MERCHANTS, CITY HOPE TO RESTORE PROSPEROUS PAST OF OLVERA 
STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vivien Bonzo and other Olvera Street merchants have waited more than two years 
to bring new life to the city's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have that chance. After a long delay, a commission has been appointed 
to oversee the historic El Pueblo de Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to turn it into a Universal Studios," said Bonzo, president of 
the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. "We want it to be real. We want to promote 
the (historical) qualities that are inherent here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year owner of La Golondrina restaurant plans to go over a five-page 
wish list with the new El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument Authority 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Her concerns and those of the 76 other Olvera Street merchants have piled up 
because it has taken more than two years for the mayor's office to make 
appointments to the commission, which will take over operation, management and 
maintenance at El Pueblo from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation.  
</P>
<P>
 Five of the seven commissioners were confirmed by the City Council last 
Tuesday, while the remaining two are scheduled to appear before the council by 
the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to do is quickly start meeting with the merchants," said Lydia 
Lopez, chairwoman of the commission. "There's a lot of sorting out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and commissioners agree that the fledgling commission will have much 
to learn in the next few months about the two-block Downtown area where 11 
families founded Los Angeles in 1781. The El Pueblo Authority will also need to 
understand the history and political squabbles behind the Mexican-flavored 
marketplace known as Olvera Street and the vacant undeveloped landmarks at the 
south end of the Monument, such as the Pico House and the Garnier Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners and merchants alike say they want to see a detailed plan for the 
historic park and to develop ways to promote El Pueblo as a multicultural 
center highlighting the history of its Mexican, European, Asian and African 
American settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some sticking points will have to be smoothed over once the commission 
takes over operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A key issue is that of the Pico and Garnier buildings south of the park, Bonzo 
and other merchants said. The Pico Hotel was built by Don Pio Pico, the last 
Mexican governor of California. The first three-story building in Los Angeles, 
it opened for business on June 9, 1870. At the two-story Garnier building, 
Chinese businesses set up shop and Chinese community groups formed in the mid- 
to late 1800s.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonzo has been opposed to any major commercial or office development in that 
area. Instead, she prefers to renovate the historic buildings as cultural 
centers or museums. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Martinez, president of another merchants group, Business Leadership 
of Olvera Street, wants to draw the business crowd by turning some of those 
buildings into office space and by offering a variety of non-Mexican-style 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to stay competitive with the other theme parks around Southern 
California," said the owner of Margarita's Gift Shop and Lozen's Trading Post. 
"It's like Universal City Walk, where you've got Tony Roma's and all sorts of 
selection of foods." 
</P>
<P>
 "Olvera Street has its own character. . . . You're (still) going to draw 
people to the area," he said. "I'd rather have those buildings be occupied than 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the commissioners polled about this issue said they need more time to 
listen to both sides. But some did agree to try to find ways to merge 
commercial and historical interests, if possible, to create a more attractive 
El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two merchant leaders disagree on development, both have claimed 
that the monument has suffered from mismanagement and neglect by the parks 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, however, has gone so far as to ask for the removal of El Pueblo 
director Anthony Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first point (commissioners) should address, if anything, is to either 
remove or transfer some of the staff we have right now," he said. Gonzales 
"hasn't cared in three years. He's not going to care now." 
</P>
<P>
 The merchant and his wife, Emily Martinez, say the streets are dirty and 
Olvera Street maintenance staff are lax about picking up trash. The couple also 
questioned the nearly $1.6 million Gonzales budgeted this year for staff 
salaries and benefits -- more than half the total 1994-95 budget of $2.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said the 45 full-time and 20 to 25 part-time staff are doing the best 
job they can with the resources they have. The staff includes attendants at 
five parking lots, and clerical and maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the landlord and they're the tenant," he said. "It's how the person views 
the cup, half-empty or half-full." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales intends to provide all the information that commissioners may request 
about budget or staff supervision. "Based on the information, they will make 
the decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have yet to determine exactly what role the commission will 
have in selecting staff and appointing a general manager.

VALLEY BRIEFING: STREET GAMES; RECOGNIZING AND AVOIDING CON ARTISTS AND THEIR 
SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some con artists call it "playing the letter" or "in the game." Others simply 
call it "the donation." But whatever they call it, police say one thing is 
certain -- a victim's gullibility is their license to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $600,000 in untraceable cash has been stolen from unsuspecting Los 
Angelenos within the last year and a half in street cons, Los Angeles police 
said. The typical victim is older, female and lives alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A rash of fake contractors swooped down on victims of the Northridge 
earthquake last January, escalating the number of complaints to the Van Nuys 
office of the Contractor State License Board to 275 a month, three times the 
average number. 
</P>
<P>
 The con artists manipulate people with a friendly exterior or feigned naivete 
trying to illicit one of two responses in people: sympathy or larceny, (or 
perhaps even both). 
</P>
<P>
 All street games start with "the catch," when con artist approach their 
victims, usually near banks, check-cashing stores and Western Union outlets. 
The game typically takes place within three hours and victims are asked to keep 
the transaction a secret. The Jamaican Switch: How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 To perform the "Jamaican Switch,"a scam directed at African Americans during 
the days of apartheid, con artists appealed to their victims sense of social 
justice. New variations on the scam have emerged, but the classic switch 
involves con artists pretending to be Africas or other foreign nationals in 
need of help. In January a San Fernando Valley man lost $27,000 in such a scam. 
Here's one example of how the scam works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Con artist, speaking in a foreign accent, asks, "Can you help me find an 
address? I've inherited all this money and need to find my lawyer's office." 
</P>
<P>
 2. As accomplice approaches, pretending to be a curious onlooker, the con 
artist says, "Here's the letter from my lawyer verifing the inheritance." 
</P>
<P>
 3. "Can you two help me donate this money to a charity?," the con artist asks. 
"For political reasons, I cannot bring the money back to my homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 4. "Why don't you put the money into the bank?," suggests the accomplice, who 
then asks the victim, "Would you handle making the donation?" 
</P>
<P>
 5. Con artist asks, "Can blacks withdraw money from American banks? The 
governmentcontrols money in my country." Accomplice pretends to withdraw money 
to prove it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Unconvinced, the con artist asks the victim, "Can you withdraw money too?" 
He and accomplice press the victim until she withdraws some money as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 7. "I'll put your money with mine into this bag, which you can hold onto until 
you makethe donation for me," the con artist says. 8. The con artist and 
accomplice distract the victim, switch the money with fake bills and flee. HOME 
IMPROVEMENTS  
</P>
<P>
 WARNING SIGNS: Fraudulent contractors who solicit home repair work 
door-to-door. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW IT WORKS: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Con artist, sometimes accompanied by a small crew, will offer to use some 
"surplus" supplies from another job down the street to patch a roof or make 
some other repair. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The fake contractor will quote a low price for the work, then pretend to do 
repairs, slapping tar and mortar in the appropriate places, not expecting the 
victim to check the work. 
</P>
<P>
 3. After the "work" is completed, the con artist will charge the victim a 
higher price than quoted, saying that unexpected costs came up. 
</P>
<P>
 4. If a victim refuses to pay, they are usually threatened or pressured into 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
 TARGETED VICTIMS: Usually elderly people who live alone. 
</P>
<P>
 AMOUNT LOST: 75 arrested in Los Angeles County in last 12 months for being 
unlicensed contractors. 285,000 licensed statewide and that many unlicensed. 
PIGEON DROP 
</P>
<P>
 WARNING SIGNS: People who say they just found some money and want to share it 
with you. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW IT WORKS: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Con artist claims to have found an envelope filled with a large sum of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Con artist shows victim the money and asks for assistance in locating the 
rightful owner. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The victim is told they will receive a portion of the money for helping out 
if they produce some of their own cash as an act of "good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Once the victim complies, they are distracted and their money stolen. There 
are many variations of this crime. 
</P>
<P>
 TARGETED VICTIMS: All ages and backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 AMOUNT LOST: From 1993 to the present, $24,500 has been reported stolen in 
Pigeon Drop schemes in Los Angeles. Such cons were especially common in 1990, 
when $44,500 was reported stolen.

AN INSIDER'S LOOK AT HOW NEA AWARDS ITS GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY GRUNDBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This month, recommendations for three artists' grants were denied by the 
National Endowment for the Arts, causing a new wave of controversy for the 
embattled arts agency. Calendar asked Andy Grundberg, chair of the photography 
panel that recommended the grants, to provide an insider's view of the 
proceedings and current state of affairs at the endowment. Grundberg is a 
former photography critic for the New York Times and is currently director of 
Friends of Photography in San Francisco. * 
</P>
<P>
 As one who has admired the National Endowment for the Arts for its commitment 
to artistic excellence and cultural equity, I find it hard to believe that the 
agency's putative conscience, the National Council on the Arts, decided on Aug. 
5 -- after an informal lunchtime slide show -- to deny fellowships to three 
deserving photographers. As a member of the "advisory peer panel" that had 
recommended that the three artists receive the fellowships, I find it even 
harder to believe that the council acted purely on aesthetic grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The three artists -- Merry Alpern, Barbara DeGenevieve and Andres Serrano -- 
were selected from among 1,700 applicants for the photography fellowships that 
the endowment awards every other year. They are photographers whose work I have 
followed, respected and often (though not always, as is my critic's 
prerogative) admired during the course of my 20 years in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The six other panelists who were convened by the endowment last spring 
included five nationally known artists and one "layman" from outside the field. 
All of us agreed that Alpern, DeGenevieve and Serrano deserved to be among the 
30-odd candidates we ultimately recommended to receive endowment funds. But the 
National Council, which includes no one with a background in the art of 
photography, saw fit to overrule our recommendation. Never before had the 
council rejected a fellowship peer panel's judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 At least superficially, the council's action was within the rules under which 
the endowment operates. All grants applications go through the same exacting 
process: They are reviewed by an advisory panel of experts, which recommends 
them to the National Council. The council then recommends them to the chair of 
the endowment. Only when the chair approves does a grant become official. But, 
if the council disapproves, as it did in this case, a grant cannot be awarded. 
(This little-known wrinkle was put into effect by Congress in 1990.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, the National Endowment for the Arts has long honored a higher 
mandate: that decisions be made not on the basis of favoritism, political 
expediency or influence, but solely on the basis of artistic quality. As a 
panel, we observed this mandate scrupulously. Unfortunately, the National 
Council did not. 
</P>
<P>
 As the transcript of the council's public session reveals, the discussion 
about the photography fellowship began with citations of Congress' eagerness to 
see that the council not be a "rubber stamp" of peer panel decisions. One 
member alluded to the fact that Congress is about to decide how much to cut the 
endowment's budget for the coming fiscal year. Other council members then 
expressed doubts about whether the pictures they had seen in slide form 
represented the best the field of photography had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic quality? Let's not kid ourselves. The name "Serrano" on the list of 
fellowship recommendations set off alarms among the council's 26 members well 
before they arrived in Washington for their meeting. They knew, as we on the 
panel knew, that Serrano's work had touched off a political crisis for the 
endowment five years ago -- a crisis that has seemed to abate only recently. 
But as panelists we abided by the instructions given us: We were to decide only 
on artistic merit. And the work Serrano submitted with his application was 
among the strongest we had the privilege of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The same was true of the work of Alpern and DeGenevieve. Like Serrano, who had 
photographed dead bodies in powerful fashion, Alpern and DeGenevieve focused on 
powerful, sometimes disturbing, subject matter. Their sin, however, was to 
include images that revealed the human body, and human foibles, in unflinching 
fashion. Alpern's documentary images of sex and drugs being traded in an urban 
office building and DeGenevieve's crafted image/text works about gender and 
sexuality apparently pushed more than half the council members over the edge. 
Either that, or they felt that singling out Serrano would look too calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 So the council did the expedient thing, late enough on a Friday so that 
virtually no press coverage emerged until several days later. What amazes me, 
and makes me intensely angry, is the casualness with which the council members 
took their responsibility to consider the aesthetic issues raised by the images 
they chose to view. For one, not every member of the council actually saw the 
slides submitted by the three photographers; they were shown first to a 
subgroup of eight members and again during an unofficial session during a lunch 
break, when attendance was entirely optional. For another, no one had the 
wisdom to refer to critical expertise in a field outside their ken; no reviews 
were read, no references made to the artists' exhibition records or other 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has participated in an endowment peer panel can testify to the 
fairness of the arduous, sometimes exasperating process by which grant 
recommendations are made. In my case, five days were spent looking at, by my 
estimate, 25,000 slides. First we looked at 17,000 slides submitted, then at 
the first-round survivors, then again at a second cut, and once again to select 
the finalists. We argued and agonized, asked to hear the artist's statement and 
exhibition information, looked at the slides again, and finally agreed without 
dissent. By the end of the week we were all fast friends, and we knew more 
about the state of contemporary photography than we could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Council operates quite differently. Its decisions, although 
binding on the chair of the endowment, are made quickly and across a wide range 
of disciplines. The council's members cannot see the thousands of slides culled 
early on. They cannot debate the stature of an artist who is totally unfamiliar 
to them. Ultimately their decisions come down to two factors: personal taste 
and politics. Neither belongs in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's recent actions suggest that the process is now fundamentally 
flawed. Congress has interfered with the endowment's procedures to the extent 
that they no longer ensure excellence and equity. I do not know if this is the 
inevitable result of legislative meddling, or a conscious wish to subvert the 
agency over the long term, but it seems clear that we need to return to the 
original language of the authorizing legislation for the endowment, or at least 
to a pre-1990 version. Until this happens, two dozen political appointees 
constituting the National Council for the Arts will continue to be national 
arbiters of what art is good enough to be recognized and rewarded.

A STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND IS HOLLYWOOD PICTURES' NEW PLAYER; MOVIES: FORMER 
PUBLISHING CHIEF MICHAEL LYNTON HAS TAKEN THE REINS OF DISNEY'S TROUBLED FILM 
DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood can be a tough and skeptical town -- particularly if you arrive here 
without a Rolodex or a road map to the lay of the land. It is peculiar in that 
even an industry outsider can be both a stranger in a strange land and an 
instant "player," just by breaking into the business in the right job. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Michael Lynton, 34, a Harvard-educated, ambitious executive from 
New York's literary community working for Walt Disney Co.'s book and magazine 
publishing unit, Hyperion, became president of Disney's troubled movie 
division, Hollywood Pictures. He replaced Ricardo Mestres, who had headed the 
label since it was begun five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton -- whose background is in corporate finance, publishing and marketing 
-- is believed to be the first non-movie executive ever to be installed as head 
of production at a major studio. That high-level job typically goes to an 
executive who's risen through the ranks and paid some dues. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of how high and where he landed -- Disney being one of the most 
successful entertainment companies in the world -- Lynton automatically has 
player clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Since relocating here from New York and taking over the post in early July, he 
has naturally been deluged with calls and scripts from agents eager to get 
their actor, writer, director and producer clients in business with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agents love a new guy. They can pull out their old inventory that's already 
been rejected by the last guy and they can easily sell him new ideas and talent 
-- they get a new lamb they can take to slaughter," says one cynical Hollywood 
filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 United Talent Agency partner Jeremy Zimmer, one of the few agents Lynton met 
before his move to Hollywood, says, "Politically, he's already making all the 
right moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Translated, that means he is having meals and meetings with all the right 
folks. He's had the quintessential power dinner at Morton's with Jay Moloney, 
one of CAA's most aggressive, high-profile young agents. He's played tennis 
with Jim Wiatt, president of ICM, another prominent agency. He's even had 
dinner with Warren Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it all looks well-calculated. But Lynton, who is self-effacing 
and swears he won't be trading in his dusty Chevy jeep for a new Range Rover, 
insists, "I'm not aware these were the right moves." When asked if he had dined 
at Morton's on a fashionable Monday night, Lynton answered, "Yeah, I think so. 
Why, is that significant?" The dinner with Beatty, he claims, "was totally 
separate from anything -- purely social." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer suggests that while Lynton's naivete may be genuine, one of the 
subtleties of Hollywood is "how seductive it is." While your tennis partner or 
dinner companion may appear to be your friend, "it's often just about people 
selling each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at breakfast at the posh Four Seasons Hotel in West Hollywood, dressed 
in a gray suit (he owns no Armani) and brown oxfords, Lynton seems remarkably 
calm and cool for someone who just became head of a movie label, recently 
bought and moved into a $1.4-million house in Los Feliz, and, along with his 
wife, Jamie Alter, vice president of Court TV, is about a week away from 
expecting his first baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hectic and I know I have a lot of balls in the air, but for the 
most part it's been invigorating," says Lynton, insisting that so far he's 
neither shell-shocked nor intimidated by the Hollywood crowd. "I may be naive 
and a bumpkin, but I haven't had this much fun in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton never expected to find himself in Hollywood. He was in Colorado on a 
ski holiday in March when his close friend David Hoberman, president of motion 
pictures at Walt Disney Studios, called and asked if he'd be interested in the 
job. The two had become friends after meeting three years ago at a Disney 
corporate retreat in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, Lynton called back to say he would consider it. He met with 
Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner and Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, both of whom he had known since his association with Disney began 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 They were no doubt impressed with Lynton's track record. He began as manager 
of business development for the consumer products division and after a year was 
promoted to director of marketing. In 1989, he moved into publishing and helped 
launch several new book imprints including Hyperion, Hyperion Books for 
Children, Disney Press and Disney Mouseworks. Also established under his tenure 
was the monthly magazine Disney Adventures and the upcoming Family PC. Lynton, 
who received his MBA from Harvard in 1987, said initially he wondered how 
transferable his skills would be and how the industry would receive his lack of 
experience. Disney management expressed confidence in his smarts and promised 
to give him "adequate time to learn the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoberman says he hired Lynton "because he brings a new discipline and point of 
view to the job. He knows literary material, he knows what a good story is and 
he knows what appeals to him." He added that Lynton's mandate is to "make an 
eclectic group of films of a certain quality" at Hollywood Pictures, whose 
lackluster slate of inexpensive comedies over the years included such 
box-office duds as "Holy Matrimony," "Aspen Extreme" and "Super Mario Bros." 
</P>
<P>
 To his advantage, Lynton inherits the benefits of an experienced production 
staff and a year's worth of movies set up under Mestres, including Robert 
Redford's highly anticipated "Quiz Show," the Sarah Jessica Parker-Antonio 
Banderas drama "Miami" and "My Posse Don't Do Homework," starring Michelle 
Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton says while there are certain aspects of his former job that are similar 
to the movie business ("you have to trust your own taste, stand by your 
decisions and be able to spot a good story"), he also says he feels like "a 
stranger in a strange land." 
</P>
<P>
 Where dealings in the book world, he says, tend to be relatively 
straightforward, with only one author and one agent, there are "many more 
parties involved (in a movie deal) and each is willing to negotiate a variety 
of different arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Moloney, who has been a friend of Lynton's for the past two years, is 
confident the executive "will find his way through the maze (of Hollywood) very 
quickly. . . . He's a very elegant, sophisticated, intelligent guy who already 
has a good sense of the protocol and who to go to to make something happen. 
He's figured out rather quickly the general politics of the town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean he won't have to navigate carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 United Talent Agency President Marty Bauer says, "This town is about ego and 
power. . . . I don't think Hollywood is open to outsiders normally, because 
people don't like change. It's very easy to be a player in Hollywood . . . but 
the question is, how do you become a successful player? And that depends on 
whether or not you can function with the power in an effective way." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some producers who wonder if Lynton's taste in movies might be too 
elitist and highbrow, given his literary background. "He seemed a little 
fancy," said a producer who met with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton says, "My tastes are neither highbrow nor pretentious -- quite the 
contrary -- they're very broad and mainstream." He said that even at Hyperion, 
"by far the bulk of our (book) list was extremely mainstream and the magazines 
were mass circulation." The imprint has published several celebrity and 
entertainment-related books, from Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" 
children's book to Robert Evans' autobiography, "The Kid Stays in the Picture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in his new post, the intention "is not to do art-house movies. We 
are a commercial studio. I recognize that and want to do mainstream, commercial 
movies of all genres." 
</P>
<P>
 A movie fan from childhood, Lynton was born in Holland to upper-middle-class 
German Jewish immigrants. "I've always loved movies," says Lynton, recalling 
his frequent trips as a young boy to his neighborhood theater, the Asta, "which 
was run by an old guy named Ben who sat at a card table in front and knew 
everyone by name." The cinema, he said, "had 10 rows of folding chairs for the 
kids and 10 to 15 small tables in the back where adults could drink and eat 
dinner." Some of his all-time favorite movies are "The Longest Day," "The 
Godfather," "American Graffiti," "Rocky," "Saturday Night Fever," "Chinatown" 
and "Shampoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Of this summer's stock, Lynton listed among his favorites "Speed," "Forrest 
Gump," "True Lies" and the British comedy "Four Weddings and a Funeral," which 
he regards as "the perfect movie." 
</P>
<P>
 At least initially, Lynton is getting a warm reception from Hollywood. It was 
hard to find anyone who didn't say of him, "he's smart," "he's savvy," "he's 
well-read" and "he seems like a quick study." One literary agent even noted, 
"He's very much a politician." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the words of one skeptical industry insider: "The personal politics 
take a long time to navigate in those ego-strewn waters." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of homework to do," insists a producer. "Hollywood is a whole 
other business. We trade on relationships and knowing people. This is not 
stoves or widgets." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Mardigian, longtime head of the motion picture literary department at 
William Morris Agency, says of Lynton: "He seems very interested in learning 
about the business and what he could do to make things run more smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney insider predicts, "He has a year and a half to get his sea legs and 
another year and a half to prove himself." 
</P>
<P>
 And a filmmaker in town suggests, "If he rubs enough butter on the bread of 
Mike Ovitz, Jim Wiatt and Jeff Berg, he'll do just fine. But, at the end of the 
day, he has to put himself behind some good movies."

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: FOX, O.J. AND RIGHT TO SPEEDY TV MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if the Simpson-Goldman homicide case and its coverage weren't something of 
a mind-shattering acid trip already. 
</P>
<P>
 The case roared into the infra-ray theater of the bent and screwy in a big way 
last week when Simpson's lead attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, appealed to the Fox 
network's "common sense and principles of fair play" in urging postponement of 
"The O.J. Simpson Story," its microwaved, quickie movie set to air Sept. 13. 
That's six days before the scheduled start of jury selection for Simpson's 
trial for the knifing murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense? Fair play? Was Shapiro kidding? Was he getting in touch with his 
inner child? He is either naive about Fox (unlikely), giddily optimistic or a 
supreme humorist. The only thing goofier than his appeal to Fox's integrity 
would have been the Simpson prosecution team appealing to his "common sense and 
principles of fair play," or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fault Shapiro for using words that are not in the vocabulary of Fox, which 
probably thought he was speaking a foreign language. Now if he had appealed to 
its "principles of cynical opportunism," he might have gotten somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the network that last April barely outraced CBS onto the 
air with a speed-stitched movie about the Menendez case in advance of the 
brothers' second trial for the shotgun slayings of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the proximity of the Simpson movie to the Simpson trial, the calculated 
choice of Sept. 13 as the air date for this latest docudrama, probably held 
together by snaps and Velcro, is even more reprehensible. Shrill shrieks from 
the media have already diverted the case down numerous surreal alleys and dead 
ends, and a valid concern now is that the timing of the movie will make it even 
more difficult to impanel an impartial jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern has been ongoing over Simpson getting a fair trial. His status as a 
wealthy black celebrity and the ex-husband of a white woman have sparked 
polarizing debates about jurisprudence vis a vis classism and racism. Some in 
the media have crashed through the delicate tundra of this issue like oafish 
Abominable Snowmen, their heavy-footed coverage creating more noise than light. 
And now, when needed least, here come those cement clodhoppers from Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the movie good business -- it's obvious now that there is wide public 
interest in virtually anything with an O.J. logo -- but bad citizenship. Not 
that Fox appears to care. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Shapiro's appeal was rejected by Fox. Nor, just as predictably, 
was he able to persuade a judge to block the movie, issues of free speech and 
prior restraint correctly coming into play as they did earlier when attorneys 
for the Menendez brothers failed to stop the Fox movie about their clients from 
airing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Legally, Fox is on firm ground. The price of free media is media that 
sometimes behave abysmally. This is just another case of a network doing 
something because it legally can, regardless of the separate ethical or moral 
questions. If the courts say you can do it, you do it. Period. End of debate, 
even if television's right to a speedy movie may conflict with the accused's 
right to a trial that is not only speedy but also fair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But not to worry, assures the always tasteful Fox, saying in a statement that 
its movie about Simpson "in no way suggests his guilt or innocence," but 
instead draws on the "public record" for its "intimate look at his life story." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what Fox means by "intimate" remains to be seen, as does whether the 
movie's depiction of the "public record" includes those 911 calls that Nicole 
Simpson made concerning the behavior of O.J. Simpson, or of any other material 
that could reinforce either positive or negative impressions of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 As further justification for its revved-up account of Simpson, Fox notes that, 
by the time of the trial, "the media will have, collectively, broadcast 
hundreds of hours on the same subject." That being the case, "The O.J. Simpson 
Story" appears redundant by Fox's own definition. The producers presumably know 
nothing the media haven't already reported. And what illumination comes from a 
story that regurgitates the "public record"? O.J., the kid who pulls himself up 
by his bootstraps? The All-American and All-Pro running back? The hurdling 
Hertz spokesman? Where will the victims -- Nicole Simpson and Goldman -- be in 
all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 And surely it won't end here. What comes next on TV's exploitation agenda, 
"Ben & Jerry's: The Movie"? In this climate, anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of enlightenment from "The O.J. Simpson Story," expect only the kind 
of huge exclamation mark that such tawdry, cash-grubbing, hurried-up projects 
inevitably attach to sensational crime cases, in all likelihood assuring Fox 
the epic audience that it is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Screw the consequences.

COLUMN ONE; AN UNCIVIL WAR OVER DISNEY PLAN; FAMILIES, FRIENDS AND EVEN 
VENERABLE HISTORIANS FEUD OVER PROPOSED HISTORY PARK NEAR A VIRGINIA 
BATTLEFIELD. WHAT LIES BENEATH ALL THE SOUND AND FURY? 
</P>

<P>
 There are no cannons exploding this time, no thundering hoofbeats or trumpeted 
calls-to-arms. But in the quiet country that lies between Washington and the 
Blue Ridge Mountains, a full-scale battle has been joined. And as was often 
said about an earlier conflict in these hills and valleys: there ain't nothing 
civil about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's troops are fighting for economic truth and justice. They are battling 
about building. Hovering over the whole dispute is this question: Whose history 
is it, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 These contemporary combatants are crossing swords over a plan by the Walt 
Disney Co. to build a 3,000-acre history theme park and mixed-use development 
four miles from the Civil War battlefield at Manassas -- Bull Run to 
Northerners. Cost estimates range from $650 million to $1 billion. In an eerie 
echo of the past, the conflict is dividing friends, neighbors and families. 
Both sides in what is sometimes called the Third Battle of Bull Run routinely 
trade lethal-impact verbal volleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is serious," said Robert Singletary, a Haymarket business consultant who 
heads a group called Welcome Disney. "It's just as serious as war." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over Disney's America, as the proposed entertainment center is 
called, has galvanized factions from across the social and political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Former White House Press Secretary Jody Powell -- who boasts that nine 
ancestors wore the gray uniforms of Johnny Reb -- serves as a public relations 
consultant to Disney. Opposite him is another ex-White House employee, 
presidential speech writer and onetime presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who 
fulminates that the land on which Disney intends to build "belongs to all 
Americans, past, present and generations to come, and we have a duty to 
posterity to preserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists -- who fear traffic, urban sprawl and potential damage to 
the Shenandoah National Forest 35 miles away -- are met head-on by growth 
proponents who argue that because development is inevitable, why not turn it 
over to a friendly, responsible steward like the Walt Disney Co.? 
</P>
<P>
 Families who protest that they will lose the small-town serenity that seems 
remarkable just one hour from downtown Washington are labeled 
not-in-my-backyard-ists by groups with names such as Friends of the Mouse and 
Patriots for Disney. Accusing their adversaries of elitism, NIMBYism and 
"economic no-growthism," these forces contend that tax revenues will soar, and 
the project will infuse this sparsely settled region with commercial vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who welcome Disney's America insist the opposition's behind-the-scenes 
strategists are a handful of wealthy landowners whose estates and horse farms 
lie close to the development site. 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors counter that Disney's America will only fatten the coffers of an 
already-rich corporate kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fiercest fusillades have been saved for an unusual coalition of 
historians. Although they assert that they simply question the wisdom of 
locating a theme park in a region damp with what Civil War scholar C. Vann 
Woodward has labeled "the blood, sweat and tears of American history," they 
have been depicted as trying to control the very field of American history 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions of "the Mouse" say these turf-conscious intellectuals are effete, 
narrow-minded and possessive about their subject. Further, they charge that 
these writers and academics are pawns of the horsy set, who have marched the 
historians out to serve as their front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you take someone like David McCullough," Singletary said. "He's a fine 
author, but he's out of his field on this one. He doesn't have an exclusive 
right on who writes history. He's just being used." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, retorted McCullough, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who narrated 
public television's 1990 "Civil War" series. He was among the first of more 
than 200 historians who last spring formed Protect Historic America, which 
exists solely to oppose Disney's America. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney supporters -- who include Virginia Gov. George Allen as well as the 
state's two U.S. senators -- portrayed the organization as a bunch of stuffy 
eggheads who hadn't spent enough time outside their ivory towers to understand 
what real Americans want to know about their country's past. Upbraiding Disney 
for planning to "plasticize" history, Protect Historic America's forces 
retaliated by defending existing historical resources, such as the museums that 
abound in nearby Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, the group has circulated Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner's 
own recollection that being "dragged" to the nation's capital as a boy "was the 
worst weekend of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than engaging in a historical shouting match, McCullough said, his 
compatriots' goal is to preserve "some of the most scenic and historic land in 
America," gentle land that was home to four of the first five presidents. 
McCullough said his group's real objections come down to the simplest, most 
sacred canon of American real estate: location, location, location. "We are not 
against Disney's aspirations to do American history," he said. "What we are 
against, adamantly, is where they want to put it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has responded to these arguments by noting that the 3,000-acre tract is 
private, and "we have a right" to build on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The site served as a campground for Union and Confederate troops alike, said 
Protect Historic America President James McPherson, a Princeton professor of 
history and author of 11 Civil War books. 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, skirmishing took place in Haymarket itself. These days, many 
of its 431 inhabitants can be found at Kris and Karen's Subs and Salads, 
debating what is referred to only as "Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all anybody talks about," said Ziba Dearden, who shoes horses in the 
affluent hunt country. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk bypasses the historians -- "They have no influence, anyway," Dearden 
said -- and goes well beyond the proposed park. Disney officials said its 
content has not been finalized, but a Lewis and Clark raft ride is often 
mentioned, as is a virtual-reality display in which visitors can join Civil War 
battles. A high-speed ride through the Industrial Revolution, concluding with a 
narrow escape from a vat of molten metal, has also been discussed. After some 
criticism, an attraction that would have allowed visitors to "experience" 
slavery apparently has been shelved. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Disney's America would come a subdivision of more than 2,000 homes. 
A comprehensive plan approved by the supervisors of Prince William County would 
permit up to 2 million square feet of commercial development. Eighteen-story 
office buildings would be allowed to rise from grassy hills. A water park is 
among the features of a 2-foot-thick development plan, as are 1,300 hotel 
rooms, two golf courses and a 283-acre campsite. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrelated to Disney, a 21,000-seat concert amphitheater is in the works. Tim 
Thompson, owner of a general store in the nearby hamlet of Thoroughfare, is 
enthusiastic about plans to build a thoroughbred track and a Formula One 
automobile racetrack. Thompson said the attractions could be an economic 
bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business-wise, I'd have to be out of my mind not to want these things," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But foes of the Disney project think it's crazy to permit large-scale 
development on land they consider hallowed not only historically, but also 
environmentally. The area's historic towns and Civil War sites have retained 
their charm and authenticity in large part because of assiduous conservation 
efforts, said Tim Lindstrom of the nonprofit Piedmont Environmental Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from worrying about what kind of history might be portrayed in a theme 
park, Lindstrom, an attorney and zoning law specialist at the University of 
Virginia, said the group is concerned about the impact on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney development, he said, "is like a double-barreled shotgun aimed 
directly at the heart of the land we are trying to protect." 
</P>
<P>
 But what Disney foes fear most is sprawl. In an impassioned day of testimony 
in June before the Senate subcommittee on public lands, Richard Moe, head of 
the National Trust for Historic Preservation, painted a grim prospect of a 
landscape despoiled by T-shirt shops and fast-food havens. "Road rash" is just 
one of the evocative phrases he used. 
</P>
<P>
 In his headquarters in Gainesville, a few miles from the Haymarket site, Mark 
Pacala, the senior vice president and general manager of Disney's America, said 
arguments about sprawl have been "spectacularly sensationalized." He said 
discussions about gridlock and garish T-shirt shops are linchpins of a "scare 
tactic campaign." Fears about "millions and millions of square feet of 
commercial space, about new towns -- it's ridiculous," he said. Because 
Disney's America is intended to be a "one-day destination" for visitors who are 
already in the Washington area, "it's just not logical. It's not going to be 
the economic locomotive to generate all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Such reassurance offers scant comfort to Pat Blackwell, a Haymarket resident 
who launched a grass-roots group called Protect within days of last November's 
announcement that "the Mouse" was coming to town. Blackwell said Protect is 
most concerned about "the sprawl and the pollution that a Disney would bring 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 With Disney's own projections calling for up to 35,000 automobile visits per 
day, Blackwell said she worries that her view of the mountains will all but 
disappear. Pollution frightens her, she said, adding, "Air's a necessity, 
that's a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, said fellow Haymarket resident Linda Budreika, the park sounded 
"sort of interesting." But after watching Disney's presentations, "movies about 
Walt Disney and the Imagineers," Budreika said, doubts set in. Soon this 
suburban mother of four was among protesters at the Washington opening of the 
Disney movie "The Lion King," loudly chanting, "Hey, ho, Eisner's got to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Budreika dismissed the Disney suggestion that the park would provide jobs for 
residents. Prince William County's unemployment rate is less than 3%, "and when 
you're talking about the low-paying jobs, places like McDonald's and Wendy's, 
the 'Help Wanted' signs are all over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The infrastructure isn't there," Budreika said. "The need for low-income 
housing and social services is going to be greater than the benefits." Charging 
that Disney has evaded such objections, she said, "they're masters of 
illusions, they say everything will be fine. Can Dumbo fly?" 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of criticism only supports Disney Vice President John Dreyer's 
belief that much of the project's opposition reduces to plain old NIMBYism: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very similar to the arguments you've heard about a dozen 
projects around the country -- which is, 'I'm here, I don't want anyone else to 
come.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While he is not entirely happy to admit it, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian 
Richard Ketchum of Dorset, Vt., one of the founders of Protect Historic 
America, said there may be some truth to this assertion. "I'm afraid that the 
'location' business is a bit of NIMBY," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney has been swift to employ "the so-called 'wise-use' attitude -- 
meaning, 'This is my land and nobody's going to tell me what to do with it,' " 
Ketchum said. "Disney has been on that particular tack ever since anybody 
raised a voice against them." 
</P>
<P>
 But with its "very well-recognized" profile, Dreyer said, Disney makes a handy 
target, for "a kind of fraternity and sorority of people who live out there and 
who are well-connected to the media and the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The implication that he and his fellow historians might be lumped in along 
with "elitists and fox hunters" also irked Ketchum. "Eisner's not exactly a 
beer-drinker, you know," he pointed out. "If you want to talk about elitism, 
last year he earned $203 million." 
</P>
<P>
 (Eisner declined to be interviewed because "he's said all he needs to" about 
the project, Dreyer said.) 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster its share of the historical debate, Disney has brought in its own 
experts. Civil War authority Shelby Foote has said he was approached, but 
joined up with Protect Historic America. Two prominent historians who are 
consulting on the Disney project are Eric Foner of Columbia University and 
James Oliver Horton of George Washington University. Both were on leave and 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But A. Wilson Greene, head of the Assn. for the Preservation of Civil War 
Sites in Fredericksburg, Va., said his 200-member organization had agreed to 
provide "historical advice and research" in exchange for consulting fees and a 
$100,000 donation from Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to make it very clear, we are not shills for Disney," Greene said. "We 
are not proponents for Disney's America; neither are we opponents. Unlike some 
of the critics of Disney, we have met them and dealt with them." 
</P>
<P>
 From the standpoint of battlefield preservation, his own specialty, Greene 
said, Disney's America does not represent the sole threat" to the 15 or so 
Civil War engagement sites in the Haymarket area. "There are battlegrounds all 
across this area that are teetering on the brink of destruction that has 
nothing to do with Disney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Greene admitted that he was not entirely comfortable with every aspect 
of Disney's plan to "tell and teach history" through entertainment and virtual 
reality. "The image that you may be trivializing the Civil War, involving the 
deaths of more than 600,000 people -- that is offensive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington transportation planner Courtney Gallop-Johnson, founder and chair 
of a group called the Black History Action Coalition, said that possibility was 
the crux of her organization's opposition to the project. She said the 
coalition is made up of "African Americans who share a grave concern with 
Disney's plan to portray slavery as part of a theme park. We don't think that 
it is a historically dignified or accurate portrayal, or suitable fare for an 
amusement park." 
</P>
<P>
 Worrying, for example, that "little souvenir slave ships" may be on sale, 
Gallop-Johnson said it would also be insulting for slavery to be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his own testimony on Capitol Hill, Disney Design and Development Corp. 
President Peter Rummell rebuffed the suggestion that his project was in any way 
vulgarizing history or plundering sacred ground. "Those are harsh words for a 
production that not only hasn't opened, but hasn't even been fully written," 
Rummell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney vice president Dreyer observed that movies and novels have helped spark 
interest in the Civil War. Participants in modern-day re-enactments regularly 
pretend to be Union or Confederate soldiers, he noted. And "living history" 
sites such as Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia or Plimoth Plantation in 
Massachusetts might also be seen as theme parks, Dreyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary of their depiction as elitists, the historians said those arguments 
would get no disagreement from them because much of their discipline is 
interpretive anyway. Shifting the discussion that way is "a red herring," 
Protect Historic America's McPherson said, adding, "you don't need a license to 
practice history." 
</P>
<P>
 Before its scheduled opening in 1998, the park must hopscotch through more 
than 70 stages of approval from three dozen local, state and federal agencies. 
Disney officials say they will hold firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Arranging tomatoes at his family's stand six miles from the proposed park, 
William Coffey said he was prepared for the traffic, and even for the 
possibility that the Manassas battlefield might have a neighbor with roller 
coasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what I hate to see," Coffey said, "is all this arguing." Details of the 
Disney Development 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's America is projected to be the centerpiece of 3,000-acre site on 
rolling farmland near the junction of Interstate 66 and U.S. Route 15 in 
Haymarket, Va., 35 miles from Washington. A history theme park will occupy 
approximately 100 acres, with the remainder used for houses, commercial space 
and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected opening: 1998 
</P>
<P>
 Completion costs: $650 million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors per day: Up to 30,000 
</P>
<P>
 Content: Disney officials remain vague about what the theme park will offer. 
An Industrial Revolution-themed thrill ride has been discussed; an exhibit that 
would allow visitors to "experience" slavery apparently has been tabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's view: Disney Chairman Michael Eisner has stressed that objections to 
the park's content are premature, like "reviewing a movie before the script is 
written." To charges that his project may be plasticizing history, Eisner 
replies: "The First Amendment gives you the right to be plastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Previous plan: Prince William County officials originally approved plans to 
build more than 4,000 houses on the same land parcel. That project fell into 
financial trouble before the Disney project was undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 State help: The Virginia General Assembly approved a $163-million bond measure 
to improve the area's roads to accommodate Disney, with the expectation that 
tax revenues would more than make up for that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The location: Four miles from the perimeter and seven miles to the entrance of 
the Manassas battlefield -- where the first and second Battles of Bull Run took 
place during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by History 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need to manufacture historical displays in an area full of actual 
Civil War battlefields, critics say.

FEARS RISE AFTER 4TH PLUTONIUM BUST IN GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in northern Germany on Tuesday confirmed the arrest of yet another 
plutonium black-marketeer -- the fourth such seizure in the country this summer 
and a further advance in the chilling prospect that an international, 
underground trade in weapons-grade plutonium has gone from thriller writers' 
imaginings to nuclear experts' near-certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarming news came even as authorities in southern Germany revealed that a 
separate bust, made at the Munich airport and first disclosed Saturday, had 
yielded 10.7 to 12.5 ounces of the deadly material -- the largest seizure of 
illicit, weapons-grade plutonium on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavarian investigators said that plutonium had been carried into Germany 
aboard a Lufthansa flight from Moscow, as part of an offer to sell 8.8 pounds 
of the material for $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say a crew of unsophisticated assemblers would need 13 to 18 pounds of 
weapons-grade plutonium to fashion a nuclear device, although some advanced 
devices in superpower arsenals contain just 8.8 to 11 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that still cheers me up is that these (smugglers) are still 
looking around for a market and don't seem to have any channels set up to 
terrorist groups yet," said Harald Mueller of the Peace Research Institute 
Frankfurt, pointing out that the smugglers apprehended in Munich were so 
amateurish they virtually stumbled into the arms of the German police. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the way they smuggle the stuff in, the way they protect themselves 
from nuclear materials," he said. "It doesn't speak of very professional or 
powerful organizations. But we must realize that while we know that a lot of 
this stuff is being found in Germany, we don't know what share of the total 
illegal trade in nuclear weapons it represents." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany now seems to be attracting nuclear smugglers because it is a rich 
nation, prompting criminals to think it could be home to wealthy buyers, and 
because it has the best air connections with Russia and the other former Soviet 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators have warned since the Soviet Union's collapse that illicit 
nuclear materials would eventually find their way onto the black markets here; 
there were, indeed, 123 known cases of illegal nuclear-materials trading in 
Germany in 1993 alone, Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in virtually all of those cases, the smugglers were relatively low-grade 
criminals, who saw how profitable it might be to palm off useless radioactive 
junk as key arms-building material. Only this summer is the real, weapons-grade 
plutonium starting to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, police in the northern city of Bremen confirmed they had arrested 
a 34-year-old German who had offered to deliver 2.5 ounces of weapons-grade 
plutonium to undercover agents. They also seized 0.07 ounce of plutonium, shown 
to them as a sample. They said it was of Russian origin. 
</P>
<P>
 They conceded that, by moving in quickly to arrest their suspect, they might 
have let slip through their fingers the remaining plutonium he claimed to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, 68 grams (2.43 ounces) of plutonium are vagabonding in 
northern Germany," complained one undercover agent involved in the arrest, in 
an anonymous appearance on the popular television show "Kontraste." Authorities 
disputed the agent's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutonium is dangerous not only because it is used to make nuclear weapons but 
also because it is, in and of itself, one of the deadliest poisons known. 
Inhaling as little as one ten-thousandth of a gram can cause lung cancer or 
leukemia; a terrorist who didn't want to bother making a nuclear device could 
easily wreak havoc by using it to contaminate an urban water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since it became known late Monday that almost 2.5 ounces of plutonium 
might be on the loose in Germany, authorities here have been issuing 
reassurances, saying there is no proof the substance is anywhere in Germany at 
all and that only a tiny fraction of the small seized sample was pure, 
weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would need a truckload of this stuff to make a bomb," prosecutor Hans 
Georg von Bock und Pollah told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts sharply with the situation in Munich, where authorities this 
week completed tests on plutonium they captured last Wednesday and revealed it 
was 87% pure -- not top of the line but enough to persuade investigators that 
smugglers really could have put their hands on enough plutonium to make a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have arrested three suspects: a Colombian who had lived in Moscow and 
two Spaniards. A fourth suspect is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 German authorities say they believe all four of the plutonium shipments 
captured this summer originated in the former Soviet Union -- a charge heatedly 
denied by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, the Atomic Energy Ministry, federal Counterintelligence Service, 
Foreign Ministry and President Boris N. Yeltsin's National Security Council 
have all rejected the idea that the Munich seizure could have involved Russian 
plutonium, although Moscow has said it will cooperate with a senior German 
envoy scheduled to arrive later this week to discuss the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the Atomic Energy Ministry and the counterintelligence service 
insisted Tuesday that no plutonium losses had been registered at any of 
Russia's atomic energy reactors and research centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very sorry, but this is a hypothetical question," said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigory Karasin, when pressed to acknowledge the possibility that the 
plutonium could have come from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The edginess of his comment, and those of other officials, suggests that 
Russia views the dispute over the smuggled materials as an East-West conflict. 
Russian officials involved in the nuclear weapons field, highly suspicious of 
Western motives, have consistently downplayed concerns about the security of 
Russia's nuclear materials. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Vladimir Klimenko, a Yeltsin security adviser, said Western 
agencies and media were spreading "rumors" of nuclear leaks from Russia merely 
to press for "control over the production of our nuclear materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny Mikerin, deputy atomic energy minister, added: "I think this ballyhoo 
has a purely economic explanation: (By) telling the world that there is no 
proper control at nuclear enterprises, the West tries to impose on us its 
supervision in the construction of control systems. These are 
multimillion-dollar orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet breakup, Western officials, nuclear specialists and law 
enforcement agencies have viewed Russia's lack of nuclear security with alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on nuclear proliferation note that the former Soviet Union never 
established an inventory of its plutonium stock, relying instead on brute KGB 
force to control the material. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, formerly strict KGB safeguards over such substances have faltered, 
and to make matters worse, Russia has hundreds of thousands of underpaid 
soldiers and civilian atomic-energy workers -- all threatened with layoffs -- 
sitting around at its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is scary," said one diplomat. "If you build a bomb, you don't have to do 
it at once. You do it in little pieces. It's probably safer that way." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other experts belittled the Russian denials, pointing out that Russia 
is one of the few countries in the world that makes this particular form of the 
radioactive substance -- plutonium-239 -- which does not occur in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian experts said it will be possible, relatively quickly, to determine 
where the plutonium-239 was manufactured, as this could have been done at only 
a handful of sites in Russia. But they also cautioned that the material then 
probably was distributed to an array of places -- and it will be much tougher 
to determine where it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials said the Clinton Administration has lodged a stern protest 
about the incidents to the Kremlin through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Insiders 
said Washington wants to ensure that the situation receives "maximum attention" 
at Russia's highest levels.

DEATHS DON'T HALT RAIL CROSSINGS ON FOOT; SAFETY: DESPITE FATALITIES, PEOPLE 
STILL USE SHORTCUT ACROSS METROLINK TRACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It was as if the gruesome deaths of three people hadn't happened a day 
earlier. Pedestrians on Tuesday were still taking the shortcut across a 
Metrolink track in Glendale, opting for convenience over safety, at the very 
spot where three members of a family were struck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit shaken," Rene Nettles, 27, said Tuesday as she made her 
way to work across the tracks where a 7-year-old girl, her mother and her 
grandfather were run down Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sorry for the family," Nettles said. "But I just went ahead and took 
that chance. This way is faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 7 and 8 a.m., Nettles was joined by a dozen others who walked through 
a break in the fence designed to keep pedestrians off the tracks, which are on 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
 All made it across safely within a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Antonio Juan Pina, 79; his daughter, Maylem Blanca Villanueva, 
37, and granddaughter, Francis Villanueva, 7, were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the latest in a string of pedestrians killed by trains across the 
country as railroad use rebounds in crowded urban areas where it had faded from 
consciousness as a relic of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 523 pedestrians, joggers and bicyclists nationwide were killed by 
trains, 98 of them in California, more than twice as many as in any other 
state. In addition, 626 motorists were killed at highway rail crossings, 36 of 
them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable proportion of the cases were ruled suicides. But the deaths have 
increased concern among federal officials over railroad safety, prodding 
Congress to address the number of rail-related fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians and motorists hoping to beat a train to a crossing often fall 
victim to the difficulty of judging the speed and distance of trains that 
travel at the pace of freeway traffic but appear to be going much slower, said 
Herschel Leibowitz, a psychology professor at Pennsylvania State University who 
has studied such accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make mistakes in judging large objects like trains," he said. "The only 
cue you have is the increase in size of the object," which appears to get 
bigger as it approaches, Leibowitz said. "And that really is a very poor cue. 
It increases very slowly, even at 60 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 And pedestrians often expect the trains to stop for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the responsibility on the trains. For some reason they assume the 
train will stop, but the train really can't do much about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a typical Metrolink train about a quarter of a mile to come to a stop 
from a speed of 60 m.p.h., Metrolink officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's accident, witnesses said, Pina, his daughter and granddaughter 
took the shortcut over the tracks to avoid the effort of climbing to a 
pedestrian overcrossing and then either ignored or did not hear the horn blasts 
of a southbound Metrolink train traveling at 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Although train horns are loud, the wind, surrounding noise or even an intense 
conversation can mask the sound of an approaching train, rail safety experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's doctor, Elizabeth Remedios, said Tuesday that the grandfather 
suffered from a recently broken hip, Alzheimer's disease and hearing loss, so 
he may have not known there was a train coming or could have been unable to get 
out of the way. Maylem Villanueva may have been distracted by the difficulty of 
dealing with both her father and her daughter, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine trying to get your father off the tracks. He might be listening to 
you but not following your instructions. And you are trying to get your little 
girl. And a train is obstructing your view," Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's deaths brought Metrolink-related fatalities to 21 since the service's 
inception in 1992. Nine of those deaths have been ruled suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials Tuesday stressed that their tracks are private property 
and that those killed while trying to cross them are trespassing. Since the 
rail service began, sheriff's deputies have issued about 3,000 citations and 
made 1,000 arrests, primarily for trespassing violations along Metrolink rights 
of way. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no warning signs are posted at the site of Monday's accident. The 
pathway across the tracks, leading from a sidewalk that runs right to the break 
in the fence, is virtually unobstructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is patrolled regularly, but keeping trespassers away is practically 
impossible, said Lt. Marc Klugman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's Metrolink bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you fence the entire length of the track?" he asked. "We're trying to 
find the places where it's most effective to fence, and we will. Signage is OK, 
but it won't stop people from getting run over. How do you protect people from 
themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Metrolink erected a two-mile-long fence in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley to help prevent accidents along a seven-mile stretch where six 
fatalities occurred within 14 months. Since then, there have been no fatal 
accidents in that area, spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. But it has not yet been 
decided whether to expand the fencing project, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Fencing is not common in other parts of the country, according to the Assn. of 
American Railroads. Currently pending in both houses of Congress is legislation 
that would give incentives to local governments to close dangerous crossings 
and fund education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said Metrolink has been trying to educate the public in large part by 
distributing flyers to schoolchildren and residents living near the paths of 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Train accidents involving pedestrians or cars are sometimes ignored by 
national news organizations, which concentrate on more dramatic derailments 
even though non-derailment accidents account for 90% of all railroad-related 
fatalities, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derailments are very high-profile accidents," said the agency's Luis del Rio. 
"The daily story is actually the fact that every 90 minutes there's a collision 
between a train and a motorist." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Soper of Operation Life saver, a nonprofit organization based in 
Alexandria, Va., that promotes railroad safety, cited two accidents Aug. 3 -- 
an Amtrak derailment in New York with no injuries, and a collision between a 
freight train and a car in Wyoming that killed five teen-agers -- saying the 
derailment received more news attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and rail safety advocates blame many of the non-derailment 
accidents on a lack of attention to the issue in the news media and in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains are often portrayed in class and in the media as relics of the past, 
not as a mode of transport still in use, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all grown up with the railroads as part of our romantic and nostalgic 
past," with Rockwellian images of "a small boy with his dog walking along 
railroad tracks," Soper said. "It tends to tell readers or viewers that this 
must be acceptable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless someone has the opportunity to stand next to a locomotive engine and 
see how enormous that mass is compared to a 170-pound person," there is little 
sense of how deadly an accident can be, Soper said. 
</P>

Metrolink Accidents 
</P>
<P>
 Since Metrolink train service began in October, 1992, there have been 21 
deaths from train accidents. About half of the deaths were classified as 
suicides. Here's a look at the incidents this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monday: Antonio Juan Pina, 79, his daughter, Maylem Blanca Villanueva, 37, 
and 7-year-old granddaughter, Francis Villanueva, are killed taking a shortcut 
underneath a bridge in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 9: An unidentified woman standing on Santiago Creek Bridge just south 
of the Garden Grove Freeway in Santa Ana is struck by an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 4: A woman, believed to be a transient in her mid-30s, is struck by a 
train as she walks onto the tracks in Sun Valley, reading a Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 27: Darren Fisher, 32, of Simi Valley is killed along the tracks in Simi 
Valley as he tries to rescue his dog. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 12: David Michael Gavin, 28, apparently distraught over a breakup with 
his girlfriend, backs his car onto the tracks in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 24: An unidentified man carrying several duffel bags places them on the 
ground next to the tracks before walking into the path of an oncoming train in 
Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 2: A boy is killed riding his bicycle around a railroad crossing 
barrier near the Burbank station in Sunland.

FED HIKES INTEREST RATES AGAIN; BLOW TO RECOVERY FEARED; ECONOMY: INFLATION 
FEARS FUEL YEAR'S FIFTH INCREASE. MOVE BUOYS MARKETS BUT IS LIKELY TO HAMPER 
GROWTH NATIONWIDE AND IN SLUGGISH CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a controversial move expected to slow the nation's economic recovery, the 
Federal Reserve on Tuesday raised short-term interest rates by one-half 
percentage point, the fifth time this year that the central bank has increased 
rates in its bid to curb the threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's action to hike its two benchmark interest rates to their highest 
levels since the end of 1991 boosted stock and bond markets but brought 
warnings from an array of economists that the agency's aggressive 
anti-inflationary policies are starting to weaken the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's move poses particular risk to California's still-sluggish recovery, 
where economic growth and job creation lag far behind the national average and 
thus are more sensitive to higher interest rates. California's important 
housing industry is especially vulnerable should higher rates depress home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers could also be hurt as rates on other loans continue to rise while 
rates that banks pay for certificates of deposit and other savings aren't 
expected to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed signaled Tuesday that it is far more concerned about the potential 
threat to the economy from rising prices than from slower growth or higher 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of repeating its past mistake of waiting too long before attempting to 
stamp out inflation, the central bank voted to hike the federal funds rate, 
which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 4.75%, while also 
increasing its discount rate, which the Fed charges commercial banks for 
short-term loans, to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Major banks, led by Chase Manhattan, quickly followed the Fed rate hikes and 
raised their prime lending rates to 7.75% from 7.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial markets, which had widely anticipated that the Fed would raise 
rates Tuesday, welcomed the size of the rate hike. Many on Wall Street had 
expected a smaller move, but were pleased because the more aggressive action 
suggests that the Fed will not have to hike rates again soon, reducing the 
sense of uncertainty in the markets over monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 24.28 points Tuesday to close at 
3,784.57, while the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond plummeted to 
7.37% from 7.51% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in long-term bond yields led some lenders to cut their rates on 
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages by a quarter percentage point on Tuesday. 
However, rates on other consumer borrowings, such as home equity and credit 
card loans, are expected to rise as they are tied to banks' prime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of Tuesday's move by the Fed, many economists said they believe 
that the economy's growth rate will plunge in 1995, and predicted that the 
economy will perform at a relatively sluggish pace for the remainder of 
President Clinton's four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is that 1994 is as good as it is going to get for Bill 
Clinton in terms of economic growth," observed Ross DeVol, an economic 
forecaster at the WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In its formal statement announcing the rate hikes, the Fed argued that it was 
not moving to quash growth, but was taking a preemptive step against inflation 
to allow the economy to continue to grow at a reasonable rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These measures were taken against the background of continuing strength in 
the economic expansion," the central bank said. "The actions are intended to 
keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby foster sustainable growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed added that it does not believe it will need to raise rates again in 
the near future. "These actions are expected to be sufficient at least for a 
time, to meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth," the Fed 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed could change direction again quickly, as it has in the past. It 
issued a statement after its last rate hike in May that also suggested 
officials at the central bank did not see the need for further action any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, analysts said Tuesday, the Fed is signaling that it has adopted an 
aggressive policy designed to make "price stability" a higher priority than 
faster job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists believe that the Fed's moves show that it wants to keep inflation 
from growing by more than 2.5% to 3% per year -- down from its current rate of 
about 3.5% -- while also suggesting that the Fed believes the unemployment rate 
cannot fall below its current range of about 6% without leading to an 
inflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a radical departure from past Fed policies, in that they are 
being far more aggressive in reaching their objective of price stability while 
largely ignoring the impact on employment and growth," said Allen Sinai, an 
economist with Lehman Brothers/Boston Co. Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, economists said, they believe the Fed is concerned that economic 
growth has been too rapid over the past year. In the second half of 1993, the 
economy grew at a pace of about 5%. In the first half of this year, it grew by 
about 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've added 329,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past five months, and 
the Fed seems to believe that kind of growth will increase inflationary 
pressures," noted economist DeVol of WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed is now run by a group of people who are very heavily committed to the 
concept of price stability," said Allen Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie 
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. "The message is that the Fed was not 
willing to tolerate the threat of 3% inflation in 1995," added Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration again sought to avoid a fight over interest rate 
policies, but issued a statement that seemed less enthusiastic in its support 
for the Fed than the White House had released following previous rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration recognizes and respects the independence of the Federal 
Reserve to make decisions about the nation's monetary policies," said a joint 
statement from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 
chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 But other Democrats, fearing that the Fed's actions could undermine the 
recovery, were more than willing to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Fed had done is place the narrow interests of the bond market far 
ahead of the American people who work hard for a decent standard of living," 
complained Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), in a statement on the Senate floor 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the Fed acting in the national interest or chasing its long-held dreams of 
zero inflation to the detriment of American taxpayers?" wondered House Banking 
Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the Fed's leading congressional 
critic. "Once again, (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have 
mugged America." 
</P>
<P>
 Even major business groups joined in. "The Federal Reserve's monetary 
tightening may be a case of too much, too soon," argued Paul Huard, senior vice 
president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. "The danger in raising 
interest rates (again) so soon is that the economy is probably poised for a 
slowdown anyway," he added.

PREVENTIVE CARE VOTE IN SENATE CRACKS LOGJAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking a partisan standoff Tuesday to cast its first vote on health care 
reform, the Senate adopted a Democratic measure that would require all private 
insurance plans to begin covering prenatal care and childhood immunizations by 
next July. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of desultory debate amid a rising chorus of Democratic complaints 
that Republicans are engaged in delaying tactics, the 55-42 vote provided the 
first solid indication of the rocky road facing Congress as it attempts to 
enact comprehensive reform before adjourning early in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Republicans voted for the two-page amendment while one Democrat voted 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 And even as the Senate began voting on amendments to the bill crafted by 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), as many as 20 senators from 
both parties -- billing themselves as centrists -- met off and on throughout 
the day and into the night in an effort to craft an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we still have a long way to go from doing anything on health 
care," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). 
</P>
<P>
 From the other side of the aisle, Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) agreed, 
saying that the vote had "nothing to do with progress" on health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) emphasized after the vote that the 55 votes 
for the amendment, offered by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), "in no way 
reflected the support" for Mitchell's bill, meaning that the proposal still 
lacks the votes it needs for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd's amendment would require insurers to provide preventive care to pregnant 
women and children by July with no co-payments. Mitchell's bill has such a 
requirement, but it would have taken effect 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Domenici and other Republicans characterized Dodd's amendment as unnecessary 
government intrusion into medical decisions that are best left to physicians 
and other health providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the path I don't think we want to go," said Sen. John H. Chafee 
(R-R.I.). "This was a vote on whether you want the secretary of health and 
human services to develop a plan or let the marketplace do it," Domenici added. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd introduced his amendment Friday night, and almost immediately tempers 
frayed as Republicans continued making often rambling opening statements on 
health reform, delaying any votes on amendments to Mitchell's bill. Since 
Dodd's amendment was introduced, the Senate has spent nearly all of Saturday, 
Monday and Tuesday ostensibly debating it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after Mitchell threatened late Monday to keep the Senate in 
session round the clock that Republicans, after an hourlong caucus Tuesday 
afternoon, agreed to allow a vote on Dodd's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Republicans who voted for the amendment are Sens. James M. Jeffords of 
Vermont, the sole GOP sponsor of President Clinton's bill last year, and 
William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was the only 
Democrat to vote against the proposal. Both California senators, Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, voted for the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the increasingly partisan tone of the health care debate, Sen. John 
B. Breaux (D-La.), a key moderate, criticized the attendance at the GOP caucus 
of Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour's presence, Breaux fumed, meant that "health care has become clearly a 
political, as opposed to a health reform, opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Senate resumes debate on health care today, the amendment process is 
expected to continue, with Republicans set to offer the next amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that Republicans are ready "to 
try to keep this thing moving" but quickly added: 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's very important that we have an opportunity to tell the American 
people about the bill. . . . We're going to continue to make our case. We're 
not going to be rushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders, in a press conference, however, professed a rosier 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're off and running. This is the beginning," said Sen. Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a breakthrough," added Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) "All of us are 
hopeful we can put away the cots . . . and really get about the business of the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), one of the group of senators who are 
trying to fashion another reform proposal, said that the group's emerging plan 
aims to raise the percentage of Americans with health insurance from the 
current 85% to "the low 90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill aims for 95% coverage by the year 2000, relying on voluntary 
measures and a variety of insurance reforms and subsidies to the needy. It 
would trigger an employer mandate by 2002 in states that had not achieved 95% 
coverage, requiring large businesses to pay at least 50% of a worker's health 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the senators working on the alternative plan said that cost 
containment is their priority. But Breaux said that they are also seeking to 
reduce the benefits package, perhaps by requiring the elderly to join health 
maintenance organizations or managed care networks to receive coverage for 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), David L. Boren (D-Okla.), Robert F. 
Bennett (R-Utah) and Domenici were preparing a bare-bones bill along the lines 
of one offered in the House last week by Republicans and Southern Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at a rain-shortened 
rally on Capitol Hill, where a pro-White House group, Families USA, unveiled a 
clock that it said tallied the number of people that have lost insurance since 
the Senate began its debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The count, which does not adjust for those who regain coverage, had run to 
more than 500,000 and was growing by 51 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see the numbers ticking away behind us," Mrs. Clinton said. "It really 
is a question of security. . . . Millions know what it means to live on the 
edge of personal security."

IF YOU LIKE IT HOT, YOU'LL LOVE MONROVIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The whole Los Angeles area has been withering under record-shattering 
temperatures for more than a week now, and no place has suffered more than 
Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled against the foothills that border the San Gabriel Valley on the north, 
Monrovia has consistently been the hottest spot in the Los Angeles Basin, 
according to the official figures released each day by the National Weather 
Service. With an average high temperature of 105 during the last week, Monrovia 
residents have been struggling to beat the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those lucky enough to take refuge indoors were having a hard time staying 
comfortable by Tuesday: Hardware stores had run out of fans, and 
air-conditioning equipment was in short supply. Desperate customers at one 
appliance store volunteered to drive to a Santa Fe Springs warehouse to get 
their air conditioner rather than wait a day for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 For those outside, comfort was out of the question. The goal was mere 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Alfonso Pulido, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, as the temperature in the shade peaked at 101 degrees, Pulido was 
out in the sun, shoveling 300-degree asphalt for a newly paved parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat shimmered off the fresh blacktop, scorching Pulido's nostrils and 
searing the soles of his shoes.

 "You feel like your feet are on fire," he said. "From the knees down, it's 
burning." 
</P>
<P>
 For most who dwell in Monrovia -- a city of almost 36,000, 15 miles northeast 
of Downtown Los Angeles -- this is just another summer. Heat in Monrovia is 
like fog in London, and you don't hear Brits mouthing off about that . In 
Monrovia, heat can be a point of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are second only to Death Valley," shop owner Keith Madison said proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Monrovia's problem is that it's in the wrong place, said Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty well inland, so it's farther from the coast and the onshore 
breezes that cool off a lot of other cities," he said. "It's at a higher 
elevation than most -- 600 feet -- and that also decreases the effects of the 
marine air, which tends to stay lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of clay soil, which absorbs heat better, Monrovia has sandy soil that 
reflects more heat, making the air temperature warmer," Brack said. "And 
Monrovia's on a south-facing slope, which means that it gets a little extra 
sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Summing it up, Brack said that when it comes to hot weather, "Monrovia's in 
the perfect location." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on Aug. 9, the high temperatures in Monrovia have been 102, 102, 106, 
110, 108, 103, 105 and on Tuesday, 101. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other cities listed by the National Weather Service that approach 
Monrovia's lead in the heat department, and there may be some contenders that 
are unlisted. Woodland Hills and Van Nuys actually beat Monrovia's 102 reading 
Aug. 10 by one degree and unlisted cities like Northridge, Duarte, Azusa and 
Glendora might have too. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to listed average high temperatures, Monrovia is the champ. 
Monrovia's average high during the week that began Aug. 9 was 105, compared to 
104 in Woodland Hills, 103 in Van Nuys and a measly 97 in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the continuing heat is the product of a massive high-pressure 
weather system that has been locked over Central California, blocking out the 
normal flow of cooling, onshore breezes. He said this system should start 
moving east today, permitting more ocean breezes and setting off a gradual 
cooling trend. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key word is gradual. Brack's predicted high temperature in Monrovia 
today is: 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For Monrovians, there are several rules of thumb for surviving such 
temperatures: Stay inside when possible. Drink plenty of fluids. Take showers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm up to three showers a day," said Rick Moreno, a 40-year-old who had holed 
up in a Monrovia coffeehouse Tuesday, sipping water. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Tatosian, 38, had other ways of coping. It's best to go barefoot, she 
advised. Stockings are out, with sandals and dresses the clothing of choice. 
The key, she said, is to keep your perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it doesn't last long," Tatosian said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that to keep her two cats from overheating, she dunked them in the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky Monrovians, like Melodie Keefer, had a job in a cool place. Keefer works 
in a flower store. People came into her shop not even pretending that they were 
interested in the orchids or roses, she said. They had their eyes on only one 
thing -- the huge walk-in refrigerator that chills the bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 The less fortunate, like Pulido the paver, work outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Mims, shirtless and dripping with sweat, was digging an irrigation ditch 
Tuesday. "Every day is a new heat adventure," Mims sighed. "I only hope the 
next job we do is a pool job." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, contractor Al De La Peza was nailing up plywood on the frame of a 
house. "We are frying like bacon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for John Caputo, a telephone installer and repairman, the hottest part of 
his job is inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's 110 degrees outside, it's 140 degrees in an attic," Caputo said. 
"Installing a telephone can be miserable. It gets hot. Very, very hot." 
</P>
<P>
 But many Monrovians merely shrugged at the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try hard not to pay any attention to it," said Michael Phelps, 16, one of 
the few residents to venture out on Monrovia's streets in the shimmering heat. 
"It's just a way of life."

DON'T BE AFRAID, TUTSI VICTORS TELL WARY RWANDANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the bed of a pickup truck in the red mud of an African hilltop, one enemy 
reached out to another Tuesday in a desperate overture to save what is left of 
a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in a "safe zone" of Rwanda, protected by French marines, a delegation 
from the nation's new government stood before thousands of followers of the 
defeated old government. Their message: Don't flee. Don't create another 
refugee crisis for the world. Don't be afraid. Rebuild Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.2 million to 2 million fearful Rwandans have crowded into this 
southwest corner of their nation under a protective shield of French and U.N. 
forces. Most are Hutus and followers of the defeated Hutu regime. The new 
government and army are controlled by rival Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 Between these two peoples, a river of blood and vengeance has flowed for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds or more of the Rwandans in this region already are refugees who 
fled other parts of the country in the face of the victorious Tutsi forces. 
Tonight, and in the next few days, they face a collective decision that will 
determine their fate and that of their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they follow 1 million other refugees into permanent camps inside 
neighboring Zaire, to face disease and impoverishment, to let their deep ethnic 
hatreds burn for years? Or do they stay put when the French pull out of Rwanda 
next week and entrust their fate to U.N. peacekeepers and their old foes, the 
Tutsis? 
</P>
<P>
 "Stay where you are. Be calm and help us rebuild the country," said Seth 
Sendashonga, the new government's interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 4,000 who had gathered at an athletic field overlooking this town 
for a historic glimpse at their vanquishers applauded politely. A crowd of 
10,000 heard a similar speech later at a hilltop church 10 miles away near a 
refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitation Minister Jacques Bihozagara took his turn climbing into the 
back of the U.N. pickup and pleading with these Rwandans: "It's not worth being 
a refugee. I myself have been a refugee for a long time. . . . The conditions 
in the camps are terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsis' appearances provided ordinary Rwandan Hutus here with their first 
glimpse of the men who have taken over their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp leaders had asked for the chance to hear firsthand what the new 
government has been saying to the rest of the world -- that the horrible scars 
of Rwanda's ethnic turmoil should not prevent attempts at reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation of four government ministers from the new Rwandan Patriotic 
Front government arrived by helicopter under U.N. escort. For them, the stakes 
are almost as high as they are for the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutus once made up 85% of the population of Rwanda, and without these 
people Rwanda might not be able to prosper. It might not remain a legitimate 
country. And without assimilation, Hutu refugees might mount a military 
counteroffensive to retake their property and keep Rwanda in civil war for 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rwanda will still be a country without its population," Sendashonga said in 
an interview. "But there will be problems. Reviving the economy, for example. 
We don't think it will be easy without them. That's why we are asking them to 
come home." 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees themselves seemed to remain of a nervous, mixed mind as to what 
to do. Even as the officials spoke, perhaps 20,000 of them lined the 100-mile 
road to Zaire. An additional 10,000 or so had packed up and crowded the 
roadside here in this regional population center. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest stood their ground in fearful agony as tropical rainstorms swept the 
dusty landscape, the harbingers of Central Africa's coming wet season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the streets, and on the terraced hillsides where they live in shacks 
covered with branches, the refugees huddled. Their children were filthy, their 
few possessions threatened by marauding bands of bandits. Disease brewed, 
perhaps, in their next drink of water. And all the while, there was the 
relentless question: Flee or not? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've nowhere to go. I'll stay. We've been reassured by what we've heard," 
said Romein Kabera, an 18-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cyprien Gakubka, 40, who called himself a former journalist, said the 
opposite: "We don't trust these new guys. There are no guarantees of our 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Hutus fear, of course, is retribution. Hutus were responsible for the 
massacre-by-machete of perhaps 500,000 Tutsis from April through June, one of 
the swiftest, most brutal genocides of modern times. Now they look every bit 
the meek and fearful. But the memories of this carnage burn with incredible 
ferocity in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as members of the Tutsi-dominated government urged the Hutus home, the 
house-by-house, village-by-village massacres of Tutsi families remained 
foremost on their minds. Sendashonga called on the guilty to confess and for 
others to accept "there are degrees of responsibility that each has, depending 
on his position in the social ladder." 
</P>
<P>
 He assured refugees that the government intends to administer justice "in 
broad daylight" and not through an indiscriminate campaign of vengeance and 
terror, as has been Rwanda's history. But he also acknowledged that renegade 
Tutsi soldiers had been caught preying on returning Hutus, just as many of the 
refugees have been saying for days now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been cases of loss of discipline by one or two soldiers. And we 
are telling the people that we have these soldiers in custody," he said. "You 
have to acknowledge that most of our soldiers are highly disciplined. Many of 
them are young men who went home and saw their mothers and fathers were killed. 
You must appreciate that the discipline you are witnessing is phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 The new government officials said they have agreed not to move soldiers 
immediately into the protective zone here next week when the French leave. But 
they declined to say how long they will leave the area demilitarized. Civilian 
administrators of the new government, however, will begin entering the region 
when the French depart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we will try to build some confidence," Sendashonga said. "After some 
time of this reassurance, our soldiers will come and assume their duties." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this back and forth may be more than Rwanda's weary Hutus can bear to 
ponder. Bernard Niyomoabo listened to the officials and said his choices are so 
bleak it makes no sense to make the four- or five-day march to Zaire for a life 
in a refugee camp. "If I have to be killed, I may as well be killed here," he 
said.

'SPIRIT OF NEW BEGINNINGS' DRAWS WEST GERMANS EAST; EUROPE: DESPITE OBSTACLES, 
ENTERPRISING WESSIS FLOURISH IN EX-COMMUNIST REGION. THEY CALL WORK MORE 
SATISFYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heike Steinmeier's third-floor walk-up office on a half-renovated block of 
this city in eastern Germany is a reservoir of the very quality that often 
seems so lacking in the western part of the country: gumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning her back on certain comfort in the west, the 31-year-old lawyer gave 
up her job with a high-powered Munich law firm to hang her own shingle in the 
cobblestoned center of a city trying to fast-forward into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 6,000 lawyers in Munich, and everything already works there," 
Steinmeier said. "Here, everything is chaos, and there are 500 lawyers. It is a 
feeling of doing something with more meaning. And the work is a lot of fun. You 
see something happening every day." 
</P>
<P>
 While many hundreds of thousands of eastern Germans rushed west after the 
collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to seek a job and a better future, a 
smaller number of westerners -- wessis -- like Steinmeier forged east into the 
new frontier of capitalism. In the crumbling buildings and potholed streets of 
the former German Democratic Republic, these professionals and entrepreneurs 
saw the challenge of a lifetime: a vast virgin landscape in which to build a 
business from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw the antithesis of western Germany, a land grown fat and complacent in 
its successful postwar reconstruction. For those who still managed to feel 
ambitious after 40 years of the economic miracle, western Germany was a tough 
market to crack -- crowded, hierarchical and highly specialized. And dominated 
by silver-haired men. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no social structure in the east. No one here has been in the golf 
club for 30 years," Steinmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a spirit of new beginnings," added lawyer Kay Schwarz. 
</P>
<P>
 They are new beginnings in which many of the newcomers are flourishing, 
despite tremendous obstacles. They are buying old East German companies and 
starting new ones of their own, investing in factories and construction 
companies, restaurants and boutiques, computer companies and graphic arts 
agencies. In the process, they say, they are learning important and difficult 
lessons about reunified Germany that their friends back home in the west do not 
begin to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastward pioneers are proportionately a tiny minority. According to the 
federal statistics office, about 350,000 westerners have moved to the former 
East Germany since 1990, and no one knows exactly how many of them opened 
businesses or stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there were many carpetbaggers and crooks in the first wave of 
eastward migration, predators feeding on eastern naivete with insurance scams, 
lousy products and, particularly, real estate rip-offs. For those raised under 
communism, ownership of an apartment or office building was more a burden than 
an asset; with rents frozen at 1935 levels, they could hardly afford to keep 
the properties up, and many buildings were in shambles. So the easterners -- 
ossis -- happily sold low, never dreaming that almost overnight the capitalists 
could turn around and resell those old buildings for lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wessis did what they call their "eastern deployment." They put in two or 
three years in the east with a big corporation to advance their careers at 
headquarters back home in the west. They never intended to stay and were only 
too happy to get out at the end of their duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others came and failed. They tried to do things on the cheap or 
underestimated the hardships of working in a land where all the laws were new 
and all the rules had just been turned on their heads. They didn't understand 
the easterners who, in turn, didn't understand them. And they returned to the 
west with a litany of complaints about good-for-nothing easterners. 
</P>
<P>
 These people helped to sully post-Communist goodwill and foster deep 
prejudices on both sides of the old Iron Curtain. Steinmeier has experienced 
the biases in both camps. She tells of driving her car with Munich license 
plates in Dresden one day when suddenly a stranger yelled at her, " Wessi 
slut!" Shortly afterward, she drove to Munich with her new Dresden plates and 
pulled into a gas station where someone shouted, "Silly ossi ." 
</P>
<P>
 When Steinmeier first announced she was moving east, her friends warned that 
she was throwing away the best years of her life. So did the middle-aged 
friends of Fritz Straub, a 51-year-old corporate executive from Cologne who 
decided to buy a furniture company in the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of people laughing at me. They say: 'My God, you old 
bastard. You could have a much easier life.' So far, I'm having a lot of fun. 
To be part of such a tremendous change only happens once in a century. Also, I 
don't want to sound too idealistic, but we have to help these guys in the east 
survive somehow and not lose faith in their brothers from the west." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Schwarz admits that when he moved to Dresden in January, 1992, he 
wondered if his doubting friends weren't right. The 35-year-old 
attorney-turned-real-estate-agent had jumped at the chance to go east and do 
something completely new. But the city known as "Florence on the Elbe" before 
the British bombed it in 1945 was cold and depressing under a cloud of "typical 
Communist smog" from burning coal. And its cultural life seemed just as dim. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he went west every weekend. Then every two. Soon he saw the opening 
of new restaurants, a theater, shops. He and Steinmeier and scores of other 
lawyers plowed through some of the city's 40,000 claims for the restitution of 
properties that had been confiscated, first by the Nazis and then by the 
Communists. Where property rights were settled, scaffolding went up. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dresden is a city ringing with jackhammers, its skyline dotted with 
cranes. Decrepit buildings that survived World War II -- vacant shells, really, 
with trees growing out the top -- have been renovated and restored to their 
18th-Century beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 New telephone lines have opened communications between east and west that once 
were so jammed you could practically only call in the middle of the night. And 
Schwarz has found camaraderie among like-minded people in Dresden, westerners 
mostly, who enjoy the risk and creativity of the new, dynamic eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The wessis say they have made friends with a few easterners who are adjusting 
quickly to the new system and starting to prosper in business. But relations 
between easterners and westerners remain difficult. Steinmeier notes that the 
first question always asked about someone new in business is whether he comes 
from east or west. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude from the west is that the system from the east has failed, so 
the people have failed. The system wasn't competent, so the people weren't 
competent," Steinmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easterners ask the question too, but for other reasons. They've had a lot of 
bad experiences with west Germans, so they think westerner means robber," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Straub sees the problem in equally strong terms. He and three partners bought 
the bankrupt Deutsche Werkstaetten Hellerau furniture company in September, 
1992, and promptly fired two-thirds of the staff in an effort to make it 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Straub had come from a competitive Western business culture where resources 
were always plentiful but only the fittest survived. His employees, on the 
other hand, came from a society in which shortages constantly impeded 
production and profits were not paramount, where no one was ever fired no 
matter how much or how little he worked because, with full employment, there 
were plenty of people on staff to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Their meeting was a shock for both sides, as Straub tried to explain to his 
remaining 100 employees that Germany really did not need another furniture 
company and that, therefore, they had to quickly improve the quality and 
efficiency of their production if they were to compete with their already 
successful counterparts in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very much, and still feel, like a stranger here," Straub said. "I 
really felt like I was (arriving) in a country where I went in as a 
colonialist. It's a little as if we won the war. . . . It's our system. It's 
our rules, and they have to adapt." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, many easterners do feel colonized by westerners and resent those who 
treat the east as an undeveloped country that should be grateful to the west. 
Many easterners are disappointed with capitalism, which has turned out to be 
more expensive and less gratifying than they had dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Western managers in the east are finding that ossis were not all as unhappy 
under communism as the west had believed. They had low rents, guaranteed jobs 
and child-care centers that look increasingly attractive as time goes by. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this leaves western employers "with a funny feeling" over 
misunderstandings that occur between their eastern employees and themselves. 
The manager of a large western hotel in what was formerly East Berlin describes 
the relationship with a humor that betrays real frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I ask for dark blue, they give me light blue," said the manager, who asked 
not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give you the answer 'Yes,' but it does not mean they will do what you 
ask. And once a mistake has happened, you will never find the guilty person. 
You say you want the water served cold and it is still served hot. Then a 
community of people will try to explain why it didn't happen or why you as a 
boss didn't explain which water you wanted cool," the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suspects some of the misunderstandings are a kind of quiet resistance to 
the new order that may not always be conscious, because in general, he says, he 
finds easterners to have "more heart" than westerners -- and more scruples. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be successful, you have to find a way to their souls," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to their minds. Before 1989, East Germany was a big white spot on the map 
for most westerners -- largely inaccessible, a foreign country. Now, wessis who 
want to do business in the east have to learn about life before the collapse of 
communism. They have to learn about eastern Germans and, inevitably, they make 
a lot of mistakes along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagmar Alberti, an easterner whose advertising agency in Apolda, in the 
eastern state of Thuringia, handles several western clients, says she has seen 
terribly misguided advertising campaigns come out of the west. In one case, a 
frozen-pizza producer tried to sell "the Italian lifestyle" to eastern Germans 
who had never been to Italy and could not relate in the least to images meant 
to lure them to the frozen-food section of their supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 A western media company bought a radio station in Thuringia, which is also the 
name of a bratwurst in the west. The company thought it was being funny when it 
advertised its station with a sausage wearing a pair of earphones, but 
Thuringia residents were not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 A cigarette company from the west also missed the mark when its ads virtually 
ordered easterners to buy the brand. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 40 years they were told what to like, what to buy," Alberti said. "Now 
they have their own opinions. You have to offer them a choice, not give them an 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 But for those willing to learn and work alongside easterners, the 
opportunities seem boundless. Markus Rickinger, a 28-year-old from Plattling, 
Bavaria, started his own paint and scaffolding company in Dresden in early 
1991. Today he has 80 employees and does more than $4 million a year in 
business -- growth that would have taken him 10 years in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickinger is at his desk by 5:30 each morning and then travels all day among 
his 15 ongoing renovation projects in a burgundy BMW, with a cellular telephone 
always close at hand. He leaves the office again about 8 p.m. to tour potential 
sites with architects or meet with his employees for a beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickinger says he has a tremendous sense of accomplishment at having built a 
business. And he is proof that for a young wessi entrepreneur, there's no 
business like the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just open your eyes," he said, "and see everything that has to be done."

 More than 1,700 firefighters from throughout the state battled the worst 
California wildfire of the season Tuesday, an arson-sparked blaze in rural, 
hilly San Luis Obispo County that has claimed 37 homes and scorched 45,500 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highway 41 fire -- so dubbed because of its danger to the state highway 
that links scenic California 1 and U.S. 101 near Atascadero -- is the "most 
high-priority fire" in the state, said Thomas Williams, a spokesman for the 
California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not the only fire burning across California. The Devil Creek fire 
north of Lake Arrowhead was contained about 4 p.m. Tuesday after charring 1,800 
acres. The Horizon fire in Yosemite National Park and adjoining parts of 
Mariposa County was contained earlier in the day after burning 2,860 acres. A 
fast-moving fire had blackened more than 1,000 acres near Mt. Baldy by late 
Tuesday, and several hundred firefighters battled a 430-acre wildfire above the 
scenic Mendocino coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a tight squeeze between now and the rainy season," 
Richard Wilson, Department of Forestry director, said during a briefing at the 
fire command post Tuesday afternoon. "We've got our hands full." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Highway 41 fire burned no structures in the city of San Luis 
Obispo, it threatened several neighborhoods with about 100 houses and caused 
early morning evacuations, said Jim Dunn, city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning it looked very bad," Dunn said Tuesday afternoon. "In the early 
morning hours we evacuated the Monterey Heights area of the city just southeast 
of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and we also evacuated the dormitories and other 
buildings at Cal Poly. Fortunately that part of the fire was brought under 
control in the late morning. The people have been allowed to go back into their 
homes in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby city of Santa Margarita was evacuated Monday. Residents were 
allowed to return to their homes Tuesday morning, only to be warned to leave 
again before nightfall. Sharon Parker, who lives in the area, nearly lost her 
home Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire crossed (U.S. 101) and burned right up the fields next to our 
house," Parker said. "If it hadn't been for neighbors with tractors and shovels 
and hoses, we probably would have lost our house. . . . I had never heard a 
fire before. It roared down the hill and trees were exploding and it burned up 
the field and came within 40 feet of our house." 
</P>
<P>
 No business areas in San Luis Obispo County have been affected, said 
Department of Forestry spokesman Bob Bergstrom, but the rolling grasslands that 
feed a thriving ranching industry were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're burning grassland, for a cattleman that's his feed," Bergstrom 
said. "It's like burning dollar bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the evacuees from Santa Margarita fled to Paso Robles, 15 miles north, 
where they sought shelter at the Paso Robles Inn. Crystal McCann, hotel vice 
president and general manager, said her business was completely booked Monday 
-- a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 70 rooms here, and last night we had all filled," she said. "We 
usually run about a 48% occupancy rate. We've had rabbits and birds and we even 
had one person come with a duck and we let them in. What can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, what the inn did was let fire evacuees sleep for free. "We 
comped last night 66 out of 70 rooms," McCann said. "People don't have places 
to go and you can't turn them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 37 homes burned Tuesday were in the Tassajara Creek area about six 
miles north of San Luis Obispo, a steep, wooded canyon surrounded by thick 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which sent a heavy plume of smoke 15,000 feet above San Luis Obispo, 
burned within several hundred yards of the California Men's Colony, a nearby 
state prison. During a frantic six hours Monday, it raced across 30,000 acres, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was returned to all but 2,000 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers by 
Tuesday night, after 110,000 lost electricity when the fire raged into the area 
Monday, said company spokesman Shawn Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was set by an arsonist about 4 p.m. Sunday near Morro Bay, Bergstrom 
said. An ignition device was found, but no suspect has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Highway 101, which had been closed since 5 p.m. Monday, was reopened in both 
directions by 11 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire also brought out the politicians, as Democratic candidate for 
governor Kathleen Brown and Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who is 
running for U.S. Senate, flew to the fire command post, and Gov. Pete Wilson, 
campaigning in Los Angeles, lauded the efforts of firefighters, who had the 
blaze 30% contained by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington, the candidate's wife, also came to the fire scene Tuesday 
afternoon when she heard a broadcast that firefighters were suffering 
dehydration. She chartered a plane from Los Angeles International Airport 
loaded with water bottles and arrived in San Luis Obispo about 3:30 p.m.

HEARING ON JUDGE'S CONDUCT BEGINS; COURTS: DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDING IS FIRST TO 
BE HELD IN PUBLIC SINCE 1988 INITIATIVE AIMED AT OPENING THEM TO PUBLIC 
SCRUTINY. COMMISSION HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR SECRECY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Kings County judge was accused of serious misconduct Tuesday on the opening 
day of the first public judicial disciplinary proceeding against a state judge 
since California voters passed a 1988 initiative designed to strip the veil of 
secrecy from such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Raymond L. Brosterhous II, representing the state Commission 
on Judicial Performance, asserted that Corcoran Municipal Judge Glenda K. Doan, 
50, committed several acts of misconduct, consistently failed to perform her 
duties properly and conducted herself in a way to "bring the judiciary into 
disrepute." 
</P>
<P>
 Doan's lawyer denied any wrongdoing on her part. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the incidents Brosterhous cited involved a Corcoran woman, Darlene 
Jones, who loaned Doan $4,500 in August, 1992. Eleven months later, while Doan 
still owed her money, Jones was prosecuted for the misdemeanor of obstructing a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In front of several witnesses, and while the matter was pending," Brosterhous 
said, Doan discussed the charge with Jones and advised her that there was no 
need to retain counsel because Doan had spoken to the judge. She also told 
Jones "the matter would be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Brosterhous said the women were such close friends that the judge accompanied 
Jones when she visited her husband at a federal prison in Arizona, where he is 
serving time on narcotics charges. The two women are now estranged and Jones is 
scheduled to be a witness against the judge. Doan's attorney said Jones "has an 
ax to grind" because of the unpaid loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brosterhous also said evidence would demonstrate that Doan had "improperly 
exploited her judicial position by engaging in financial dealings with court 
staff" and had engaged "in continuing business relationships" with individuals 
who appear before her. He also alleged that she had deliberately made false 
statements when she filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan's attorney, William A. Romaine of Visalia, retorted that the judge had 
done nothing wrong. He said the judge had no obligation to recuse herself from 
any of the cases in question, had not made deliberate misstatements on the 
bankruptcy filing and was not obligated to report all the loans on her 
disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Romaine asserted that the entire proceeding, which he tried in vain 
to keep secret, threatened the independence of California judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Doan is a municipal court judge from a small San Joaquin Valley 
community, the case has generated unusual interest in part because of the 
widespread criticism of the way the Commission on Judicial Performance 
operates. The commission has been under fire for conducting much of its 
business in secret and for meting out lax discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bills are currently pending in the state Legislature that would 
dramatically change the commission's operations. Both bills would add more 
citizen members to the commission and make it a requirement that all commission 
hearings be held in public once preliminary investigations are completed and 
formal charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Judges Assn. has attempted to scuttle the legislation, which 
has broad bipartisan support. Proponents of the reform have scoffed at the 
suggestion that judicial independence is at issue. Rather, they maintain that 
the measures are a key step toward more open proceedings that would increase 
public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Doan's case, state appeals court Justice William A. Stone and two Superior 
Court judges -- Stephen Henry of Fresno and Rebecca A. Wiseman of Bakersfield 
-- are hearing the testimony. Stone conducted the first day like a formal 
trial, putting witnesses under oath and utilizing normal rules of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is expected to last two to three weeks. After it concludes, the 
three judges will issue a report to the eight-member commission, and the 
commission will make a decision on whether sanctions are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission decides to remove Doan from office, censure her or issue a 
private reproval, she can appeal to the California Supreme Court. The other 
possible outcome is a public reproval, which, in effect, is like a plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan, 50, was investigated by commission staff members for nearly 18 months 
before formal charges against her were made public in July. The charges were 
lodged in March but, as a result of decisions made by other judges in closed 
hearings, they were not divulged to the public until after she had won a hotly 
contested reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the day after the election, Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren sent a letter 
to legislators attacking the state's judges for thwarting the will of voters, 
who in 1988 enacted Proposition 92, which called for open judicial hearings if 
the charges involved "moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption." He did not 
name any judges, but The Times learned subsequently that Doan's case was one of 
four that prompted Lungren's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan was originally elected to a judgeship in 1982 and has been reelected 
twice. She has been publicly reprimanded twice by the commission. The first 
reproval came in 1989 for failing to report $75,000 in gifts, loans and income 
from a client. The second reprimand was imposed in 1990 for helping a friend's 
relative in a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sat next to her attorney at the hearing and occasionally smiled at 
witnesses from the Corcoran Police Department whom she has known for years. On 
Tuesday, her attorney suggested that some of Doan's actions, including 
accepting loans from people whose businesses were in litigation before her, 
were not unusual for a small town.

ASSEMBLY APPROVES LIBRARY FUNDING BILL; LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE WOULD PERMIT 
LOCAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS, BUT REQUIRES VOTERS' APPROVAL OF LEVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Los Angeles County library supporters heralded Assembly passage Tuesday of a 
bill to provide a new funding source for their struggling institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which goes back to the Senate for final legislative approval before 
heading to the governor's desk, was adopted 45 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Library advocates said they will launch a new, aggressive phase of a 
months-long letter-writing campaign to persuade Gov. Pete Wilson to sign the 
bill into law. A similar measure last year produced an avalanche of supportive 
letters, but Wilson vetoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The present bill, authored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), 
permits local governments to set up special assessment districts for libraries 
similar to those that help pay for fire prevention, sewer and flood prevention 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after voters' approval would the library districts be authorized to levy 
charges on property owners. A typical library service charge on a single 
residence in Los Angeles County would amount to about $20 to $25 a year, said 
Bill Siverling, Los Angeles County legislative representative. 
</P>
<P>
 In his veto message last year, Wilson said he refused to sign the bill because 
the library assessment would have amounted to an involuntary tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti, in making another attempt this year, agreed to several changes 
that he believes address Wilson's concerns. Among those was the requirement 
that the assessment district -- and thus the charge -- be put to the voters for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said the governor has not decided whether to sign the 
current version. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach), who led the effort for passage in 
the Assembly, said she believes public support exists for assessments to keep 
library doors open. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California State Library Assn., county libraries were among 
the hardest hit by the state's 1993 property tax shift from counties and 
special districts to schools. A survey showed that many large county libraries 
throughout the state suffered a 50% loss in funding due to the property tax 
shift. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sprawling Los Angeles County library system, costs are expected to 
exceed revenues by about $32 million this year, Siverling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten county library outlets, including a bookmobile that serves Antelope 
Valley, have shut down in the last two years. Some branches that used to be 
open all week are now open only 14 hours a week over two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down to the point where there's nothing left to cut," said David Flint, 
the county's assistant director for library finance. "There's no crying wolf."

'ONE-STRIKE' SEX CRIME BILL OKD BY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elbowing into a fray that has taken center stage in the governor's race, a key 
Assembly committee approved a controversial bill Tuesday that would slap 
first-time child molesters and violent rapists with sentences of up to 25 years 
to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee endorsed the so-called "one-strike" bill 
carried by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) on a 4-to-1 vote after a 
back-room deal was made to tie the measure's fate to sex crime bills carried by 
three Democrats and another Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, Bergeson was able to propel the measure through the Public Safety 
Committee, which historically has been a graveyard for GOP anti-crime efforts. 
The Democrats, meanwhile, gained assurances that Gov. Pete Wilson will sign 
their measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill was watered down by the Public Safety Committee, Bergeson 
continued to portray it as the strongest effort to deal with sexual predators 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much relieved," Bergeson said. "I would like to have had a stronger 
bill, but under the circumstances it's a very good bill and sends a tough 
message to sexual predators. It's probably the toughest in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson began carrying the bill at the behest of Wilson, who has made the 
rape measure a centerpiece of his election-year crime fight. In recent weeks, 
it has sparked a bitter dispute between the governor and Democratic challenger 
Kathleen Brown over her support of the proposal -- or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aired a television commercial in late July portraying Brown as opposed 
to the "one-strike" bill, which originally called for a blanket sentence of 
life without parole for nearly all perpetrators of sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown countered in a news conference and a commercial of her own, calling 
Wilson's advertisement "a despicable lie," arguing that she dropped her 
opposition to the bill after it was narrowed in the Senate to hit only the most 
violent predators with a maximum sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee narrowed the bill still further Tuesday by 
requiring that only the most brutal sexual assaults -- those involving torture, 
mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the intent to commit rape -- would result in 
a sentence of 25 years to life without possibility of parole. Lesser crimes 
could still earn sentences of 15 years to life.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE FELLOW WHO FORGOT NOT TO LAUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is a throwback, a character. The boundaries of modern discourse -- so 
cautious, so polite -- cannot contain him. He tells rude jokes. He pokes fun at 
people. He warbles odes to beer and alimony and Lorena Bobbitt. He laughs 
loudly in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Ron DeLacy. He works by day as a journalist, roaming the Mother 
Lode for the Modesto Bee. He files conventional news stories about fires and 
high crime, and less conventional pieces about Gold Country rogues and strange 
disputes over barking dogs, swallowed gold pieces and the like. "My forte has 
always been the bizarre," he says, "and up here, this is the Mother Lode of the 
bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 At night he sings in a two-man bluegrass band, Doodoo Wah, and dreams of "the 
big time." He and his partner, Dave Cavanagh, perform at taverns and festivals 
all over the foothills. DeLacy writes most of the songs, mainly satirical 
bluegrass pieces. "We're All Working for the Japanese" was his biggest success 
so far. Ray Stevens recorded it, and before the Toyota dealers mounted a 
protest it had reached No. 62 on the country charts. Other Doodoo Wah titles 
include "Since My Baby Turned Gay," described in the liner notes as "a love 
song, no really," and "B.A.R.F Construction (We Throw It Up)" and "The Men's 
Crisis Center," and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Political correctness is not high on DeLacy's list of concerns. "Basically," 
he says, "I believe in freedom of speech. I mean, it's only words. I mean, it's 
funny stuff. I mean. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeLacy wears a droopy mustache and tank-top T-shirts. He doesn't own a tie and 
has written that the only people who should are "lawyers and pallbearers. 
Lawyers serving as pallbearers," he adds, "should have to wear two." Fifty 
years old, he looks a bit like a middle-aged Mark Twain. His writing also is 
reminiscent of Twain and the Gold Rush tradition of yarn-telling. He delivers 
his newspaper accounts with a sly, deadpan style. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for example, is DeLacy describing, in a Metro page piece, a bit of 
judicial business that later would inspire a song: "A defense attorney said 
Wednesday he will appeal his client's conviction, charging among other things 
that the prosecutor disrupted the four-week trial by repeatedly passing gas. 
'It was disgusting,' said Clark Head, a Calaveras County lawyer. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And here he is, in a personal column, on the vagaries of snow chain 
installation: "It is impossible to install tire chains without using foul 
language. The foulest language you know is never foul enough. As you botch the 
job and grow cold, wet and frustrated, you reach down in the gutter of your 
soul, into a reservoir of vulgarity accessible only during the installation of 
tire chains, and you brew and spew verbal hazardous waste. . . . When they 
don't do any good, you get up and kick the car." 
</P>
<P>
 And covering the news: "Forest Service special agents fed $6.7 million worth 
of marijuana through the Fibreboard Corp.'s steam boiler here Thursday. As a 
crowd of 6,000 people looked on, the boiler belched thick plumes of brilliant 
psychedelic oranges and reds and then forgot what it was doing, lost its 
ambition, shut down completely, and demanded peanut butter and potato chips." 
</P>
<P>
 He insists his editors love him, and he loves them. And so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeLacy lives in a double-wide trailer with a wife who laughs lovingly at his 
jokes, a daughter who is queen of the local rodeo, and a son who has fiddled 
for change on the streets of Gold Rush towns since he was 4. It's not a simple 
life, though, for this retro renaissance man. DeLacy's nights often are spent 
in rustic taverns, soaking up tales from strangers about vanished bikers with 
glass eyes and secret new gold diggings and amazing animal encounters. DeLacy 
laughs, barking like a seal, at every offering. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quieter moment, he talks about humor, what makes it work, its curative 
powers. He wonders why some people will tolerate newspapers filled daily with 
murder and mayhem, but condemn as tasteless a little ditty about a lawyer 
breaking wind in court. He says those who take offense at his songs -- 
feminists, gay activists, hardhats, dyslexia sufferers, lawyers, dentists and 
so forth -- don't grasp that the true target of his parody is the singer 
himself, lamenting in a forlorn and bewildered twang how the world has left him 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 He picks up a guitar and runs through his latest. "Where'ja put it, Lorena, 
where'ja put it? Where is it, Lorena. I miss it, Lorena. Lorena won't you 
puleeezzzeeee look around." The ballad bounces down from his porch to a valley 
below, followed soon after by a loud, barking laugh. DeLacy anyway thinks it's 
funny.

PANELS CLEAR BAN ON SALE OF WITNESS STORIES; LEGISLATURE: PRETRIAL PUBLICITY IN 
SIMPSON CASE LED TO THE EFFORT, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO SELL INFORMATION 
ABOUT CRIMES BEFORE OR DURING TRIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing massive pretrial publicity in the O.J. Simpson murder case, legislative 
committees Tuesday approved a pair of bills that would make it against the law 
for a witness to sell information about a crime either before or during a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said the measures would not 
apply to anyone involved in the Simpson case, unless the sale of a witness' 
story occurred after Jan. 1, when the bill would become law. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown argued that the payment of money to witnesses by sensationalistic 
tabloid newspapers and television programs damages the constitutional right to 
a fair trial by compounding pretrial publicity and creating an "incentive to 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, virtually identical versions of which were approved 
unanimously by both the Assembly Public Safety and the Senate Judiciary 
committees, witnesses and potential witnesses to criminal acts would be 
prohibited from selling their information until a trial is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown told the Judiciary Committee that his bill allows a witness to "tell the 
story. You just cannot be paid for it because that taints the perception of 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses who knowingly violated the prohibition would be subject to a 
six-month term in jail or a fine of up to three times the amount of the 
compensation they accepted, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown measure and a similar proposal by Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San 
Francisco) were introduced in the wake of controversy regarding extensive 
publicity in the Simpson murder case in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp cited the example of a potentially important prosecution witness, Jill 
Shively, whom prosecutors decided not to call to testify before a grand jury. 
He noted Shively had received $5,000 from the "Hard Copy" television program 
for her account that placed Simpson near the scene of the murder of his ex-wife 
and her friend at about the time the slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose bill was supported by a representative of Los Angeles Dist. Atty. 
Gil Garcetti and syndicated legal columnist Bruce Fein, said his measure was 
"narrowly drawn" to avoid infringing on the constitutional right to free speech 
and free press. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it drew opposition from representatives of the California Newspaper 
Publishers Assn. and the California Broadcasters Assn., among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Biondi of the broadcasters organization and Tom Newton, representing the 
publishers, voiced fears that news reporters who witnessed a crime while 
performing their jobs could be subject to criminal sanctions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown assured the committee that news reporters were exempt from the bill 
and amended it to also exclude independent free-lancers and stringers who sell 
stories to news organizations.

U.S. REACTS TO HAITI REFUGEES' UNREST; CARIBBEAN: PENTAGON HOPES TO PREVENT 
REPEAT OF RIOT AT NAVAL BASE AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, BY RELIEVING BOREDOM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, conceding that there is "growing unrest" among 
Haitian refugees held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, announced 
measures Tuesday aimed at avoiding a repetition of a weekend riot there. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said efforts are under way to provide more soccer 
facilities and educational opportunities to help Haitians relieve their boredom 
and frustration. And the Army is rushing civil affairs experts to the site to 
help deal with the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments followed the Defense Department's belated disclosure Monday 
that 750 of 15,000 Haitians now housed at Guantanamo climbed over barbed-wire 
fences Saturday and peppered U.S. military police with rocks, injuring 20 MPs 
and 45 Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate move, Reuters news service reported that the Dominican Republic, 
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has agreed to permit U.S. 
officials to transport as many as 2,000 Haitians through its territory so they 
can travel to the United States. About 800 Haitians already have been approved 
for refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians had been unable to leave Haiti because of opposition from the 
country's military government and because of a U.N.-imposed economic embargo 
that has blocked all commercial flights into and out of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration among Haitians at Guantanamo Bay recalls a similar occurrence 
during the George Bush Administration. The problem was resolved then, as 
officials are trying to resolve it now, when the Haitians were provided with 
more to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said the military had been preparing to 
provide many of the same services when the violence erupted but was unable to 
get necessary equipment to the base in time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has set up the facilities in Guantanamo to serve as a 
"haven" temporarily housing Haitians who have tried to flee their island but 
who do not have permission to immigrate to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Administration's latest policy, the only way Haitians can obtain 
such permission is to apply in Haiti. Those picked up by authorities at sea are 
afforded protection in a haven but are not given refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the discontent among Haitians is intensifying because there 
are 15,000 or so of them in the enclave. During the Bush Administration, the 
total was only about 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Boxx, a Pentagon spokesman, conceded Tuesday that "what you see is just 
a growing unrest that has boiled over, and we are trying to contend with that." 
He said there had been a similar incident July 31 but that no one was injured 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saturday's disturbances, Boxx ruled out any suggestion that the 
military would seek to impose more discipline in the enclave. "This is a 
temporary safe haven -- it is not a jail or a prison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Saturday's riot was heightened because the incident was not 
reported to top Administration policy-makers until late Monday, after reports 
had begun to show up in the media. The disturbance lasted about four hours -- 
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxx said Defense Secretary William J. Perry, who was kept in the dark about 
the Saturday melee, was "very unhappy" about the military's failure to inform 
top officials and sent word down the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United States said it has temporarily closed its refugee 
centers in the provincial cities of Cap-Haitien and Les Cayes until facilities 
are set up for sending Haitians who have been approved for U.S. residency 
through the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Nicaragua's top general, Humberto Ortega, announced Tuesday after 
a meeting with a U.S. envoy in Managua that his country would be willing to 
take part in a multinational peacekeeping force in Haiti if the junta there is 
ousted but would not be part of an initial invasion force. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was part of an effort by the Administration to muster an 
international coalition to provide peacekeeping troops in Haiti once the junta 
has been toppled. Although no decisions have been made, U.S. forces would 
launch any initial invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council has authorized an invasion of the island to restore 
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Tuesday that he will delegate an envoy to warn 
Haiti's military rulers to step down voluntarily or face a U.S. invasion. 
Boutros-Ghali spoke in Moncton, Canada, where he was attending the 10-day 
Acadian World Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post reported U.S. officials as saying the envoy will not 
negotiate with the officers, but neither will he immediately deliver a deadline 
for them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing Saturday's violence, the Defense Department said two of the 20 
MPs injured remained hospitalized Tuesday for treatment of cuts while the 18 
others had been released. The injuries to the 45 Haitians were described as 
minor.

POLES' NAMING OF EX-SPY TO TOP POST EMBARRASSES U.S.; ESPIONAGE: WARSAW'S NEW 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WAS GIVEN LIFE IN PRISON AFTER A LOS ANGELES TRIAL. HE WAS 
RELEASED IN 1985 AS PART OF A COLD WAR EXCHANGE.

<P>
 In an embarrassment for the United States, Poland's non-Communist government 
has named one of the Cold War era's most successful Soviet Bloc spies as head 
of its civilian intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Zacharski, 43, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States 
in 1981 for obtaining secret information on the U.S.-made B-1 bomber, the F-15 
fighter and radar systems used in Patriot air-defense missiles, then passing 
the information to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sent back to Poland in 1985 as part of an exchange of four East 
European spies for 25 Western intelligence agents who themselves had been 
convicted and imprisoned in East Germany and Poland. He received limited 
clemency from then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Department officials said that, under terms of the exchange, if 
Zacharski was to return to the United States -- even in his official capacity 
as Poland's intelligence chief -- he would be subject to arrest and 
reimprisonment here. "We haven't changed our position," a department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony does not stop there. Since the late 1980s, when Warsaw shucked off 
its Communist mantle, Zacharski has become one of Poland's leading businessmen 
-- a director of its most profitable retailing chain, the Pewex import 
merchandise shops. 
</P>
<P>
 His years spent in the United States apparently were a learning experience for 
both sides. His performance in recruiting a disgruntled defense worker as an 
agent is still being studied at the FBI Academy. And he, in turn, learned 
American business techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, his appointment may prove awkward for both governments. Supported by 
the United States, Warsaw recently has joined the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's "Partnership for Peace" program, designed to groom former East 
Bloc countries for eventual membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 And Poland has been campaigning hard to become a full-fledged member of the 
Atlantic military alliance now, rather than after an apprenticeship. "This 
isn't the kind of thing that they're likely to put on their NATO application 
form," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington apparently was taken by surprise when the appointment was 
disclosed. U.S. officials said the State Department had not known in advance 
that Zacharski would be named to the post, and as of late Tuesday, the Clinton 
Administration had not decided how to react. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials apparently are urging that Washington not protest 
strongly, arguing they can work with someone who was in the intelligence 
business. Still, "it's not the greatest thing that can happen," a U.S. diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski was tried and convicted in federal district court in Los Angeles 
after having successfully recruited William Holden Bell, a radar system expert 
at Hughes Aircraft Co. in El Segundo, to provide him with copies of documents 
in exchange for cash. Bell served as the key prosecution witness in Zacharski's 
trial, after pleading guilty to one count of passing secret documents to 
foreign agents, in exchange for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason authorities were able to prosecute Zacharski was that, unlike many 
spies who arrive in the United States protected by diplomatic immunity, the 
Pole was working as a civilian as West Coast representative of the 
Polish-American Machinery Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski's appointment was signed Friday by the chief of the State Protection 
Office, a leading Warsaw daily newspaper reported. News of his appointment was 
broadcast Tuesday on Polish TV. 
</P>
<P>
 According to news service reports, at least some Polish security officials and 
members of Parliament voiced surprise and criticism over the promotion of a man 
who served the former Soviet-controlled intelligence agency, but there was no 
official reaction to the move.

<P>
 Joaquin Balaguer was sworn in to a seventh term as president Tuesday, facing a 
reduced two-year term because of allegations of electoral fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Balaguer, 87, has been president of the Dominican Republic for 20 of the past 
28 years. He agreed last week to reduce his term from four years after 
opposition politicians and international observers accused him of fraud in the 
May elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Balaguer originally agreed to a 1 1/2-year term, but Congress voted Sunday to 
set his term at two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congress vote touched off an outcry from the opposition, which claims that 
200,000 people were blocked from voting in the May 16 elections -- nine times 
Balaguer's 22,000-vote victory margin.

FORECASTING; WEATHER SERVICE RETOOLS, SETS ITS SIGHTS ON GREATER ACCURACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Television weatherman Bob Ryan has heard all the jokes. He's heard all the 
whining about off-the-mark predictions and unreliability. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get 90 out of 100, we missed 10. If we get 99 out of 100, we missed 
one," says Ryan, a meteorologist at local NBC affiliate WRC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But weather forecasters and the National Weather Service, which provides them 
with information to develop forecasts, may not be the butt of jokes for much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The NWS is updating its measurement equipment with a cutting-edge radar, 
supercomputer and satellite as part of a $4.2-billion modernization -- a move 
the agency, which has come under fire for failing to give early warnings of 
tornadoes and hurricanes in addition to botching everyday predictions, 
acknowledges is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the high-tech system, parts of which are already operating in Los 
Angeles and many other major cities, forecasters will be able to see everything 
from clear skies to summer squalls more quickly and more clearly, weather 
officials say. NWS forecasts are the basis for newspaper weather maps and 
television weather reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, weather can be a dangerous business. In a typical year, 
the mainland sees 10,000 violent thunderstorms, some 1,000 tornadoes and 
several hurricanes. And the United States experiences more severe flooding than 
any other nation, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, which oversees the NWS. 
</P>
<P>
 In meteorology, accuracy is everything, weather-watchers say. And every little 
bit helps. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new NEXRAD Doppler radar, forecasters will be able to peer inside 
storms for the first time and examine wind rotation, which can indicate when 
maelstroms or tornadoes are in their early stages. NWS storm experts expect 
that the system will give them about 30 minutes extra notice of approaching 
tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 In cold climates, the Doppler system allows forecasters to measure snowfall 
intensity, something conventional radar cannot do, and issue warnings "with 
more confidence," said Bob Thompson, an NWS meteorologist in Taunton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service also bought an advanced supercomputer, the $45-million 
Cray Research Inc. C90 mainframe, which can process 15 billion math operations 
per second. The computer will use mathematical formulas to copy the movement of 
the atmosphere. Using those formulas as models, forecasters try to determine 
what weather systems will do next. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer also provides information for more precise areas, analyzing 
conditions in zones of just 25 square miles -- or one-fourth the size of the 
former system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Williams, who has compiled data for USA Today's weather page since the 
newspaper started publishing 12 years ago, said he is "looking forward to the 
Cray, which can run more localized computer models." 
</P>
<P>
 With the power to process six times as much data as the old system in 
one-fifth the time, the mainframe will "help Americans in all walks of life 
make better daily decisions where weather is concerned," said Elbert W. Friday 
Jr., assistant administrator for weather services for the NOAA. 
</P>
<P>
 The supercomputer will oversee data processing from radar, satellites and a 
new automated measurement system. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the NWS launched its own weather satellite, GOES-1, giving U.S. 
forecasters more than one working satellite in space for the first time since 
1986. For the last eight years, NWS meteorologists have had to borrow the 
services of a European satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The NWS is also installing automated weather-measuring stations across the 
country. Each station will collect data ranging from wind speeds to barometric 
pressure and send it to one of the service's weather forecasting offices 
situated in each state. Weather officials say the new system will be more 
accurate than human data collectors, although the NWS union is protesting 
because several field offices are being relocated.

UPDATE; STOCKDALE TAKES STOCK IN VIRTUES OF NOT BEING VICE; RETIRED ADMIRAL 
SAYS HE'S NOT SORRY HE'S NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH PEROT. BUT HE DOES THINK 
HE COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN CLINTON. 
</P>

<P>
 A large American flag flies from his porch. The "Perot for President" bumper 
sticker on his car is still shiny. And retired Adm. James B. Stockdale believes 
he could do a better job than President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 70-year-old Vietnam War hero -- Ross Perot's 1992 running mate -- 
doesn't spend much time these days contemplating what life would be like if he 
had been elected vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving politics behind, Stockdale has slipped easily into his old routine, 
studying the works of ancient philosophers and waking in the middle of the 
night to write down his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things I'm good at. Fighter pilot I'm good at. I was damn 
good at leading a prison underground." 
</P>
<P>
 But vice president? "That was a lark." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale is a modern-day Stoic, a man of tremendous fortitude who survived 
repeated torture and solitary confinement during nearly eight years as a 
prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 He also survived his brief foray into politics and the televised vice 
presidential debate that propelled him, unprepared, onto the national stage. 
"Who am I? Why am I here?" he asked viewers, seeming somewhat befuddled and 
bewildered in the most memorable moment of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like I was a college football player that somebody decided ought to go 
into boxing and a week later is in the ring with Joe Louis," he recalled. "I 
was playing catch-up all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale, a soft-spoken, white-haired winner of the Congressional Medal of 
Honor, derives strength from the philosopher Epictetus, a onetime Greek slave 
who taught that true freedom stems from never wishing for something that is in 
the control of another. 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, Stockdale said he never hungered for high office and suffered no 
disappointment when he lost. "I don't get up in the morning and think about 
what I would do if I were (vice president), and I never did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Stockdale and his wife, Sybil, split their time between their historic 
craftsman home in Coronado and Stanford University, where he is a fellow at the 
conservative Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very full life. George Shultz is on my right, Edward Teller is on my 
left and Milton Friedman is upstairs," he said, referring to the former 
secretary of state, the nuclear physicist and the economist, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Stockdale returned to Vietnam for the first time since his 
release from captivity in 1973. Touring the country with a Stanford alumni 
group, he saw the prison where he was once held. A 45-minute video of the trip 
titled "Stockdale Triumphs" was recently released by the Stanford Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he had been blindfolded in captivity, this was the first time he 
actually saw what the primitive, impoverished country was like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how junky it looked," he said. "God, we were so dumb about 
it. Did we think of the lives we squandered on this dump?" 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise also took Stockdale through the Gulf of Tonkin, where he lectured 
on President Lyndon B. Johnson's fraudulent pretext for entering the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Navy pilot, Stockdale witnessed the purported North Vietnamese attack in 
the gulf in 1964 and knew that no raid had occurred. But he led the first 
bombing raid on Vietnam the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot down a year later and subjected to grueling torture sessions, he 
desperately resisted telling his captors he knew the Gulf of Tonkin attack was 
a lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his release, he has maintained that the war was based on a fraud. But he 
also criticizes Johnson for failing to end the conflict quickly by sending in 
B-52s to bomb Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 His wartime experience, he believes, would have helped make him a good vice 
president who would bring a sense of integrity to Washington. "I know my 
strengths, and they are to keep that damn White House honest when storm clouds 
are brewing." 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to run for vice president as a favor to his friend Perot, who had 
worked during the Vietnam War to improve conditions for the prisoners. But 
initially, Stockdale was just a stand-in and never expected to be on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong Republican until the 1992 campaign, Stockdale says Clinton is 
leading the country in the wrong direction. He is especially critical of the 
President's health care program, which he believes would turn medical care into 
a government-run "cesspool." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he would like to see Perot form a permanent third party. If Perot runs for 
President again, Stockdale said he would help any way he could but has no 
desire to be a candidate once more. "I'm not the right guy to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not at home talking hypothetically about what should happen to the 
country in the years ahead. I'm not a policy wonk. But I think I would be doing 
a hell of a lot better than Clinton is right now if I was sitting there."

STATE OF EMERGENCY IMPOSED AFTER SRI LANKAN VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sri Lankans voted for a new Parliament on Tuesday, and the government imposed 
a state of emergency after the polls closed in an attempt at preventing more of 
the violence that scarred the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamil rebels who opposed the election blew up a navy ship in northern Sri 
Lanka during the vote, and 25 minor clashes between rival party supporters were 
reported throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four people died in more than 3,000 street clashes during the monthlong 
campaign, and police expect more violence if the governing United National 
Party loses its 17-year grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency decree gave police the right to arrest and detain people without 
charge, and a round-the-clock curfew, expected to last until Thursday morning, 
was declared nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Election results are not expected until today. There have been no reliable 
opinion polls, but analysts said the socialist People's Alliance, a coalition 
of five opposition parties, stands a good chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition has promised to strip the presidency of many of its powers. It 
also has pledged to negotiate with the guerrillas, who have fought for a Tamil 
homeland in Sri Lanka for 11 years.

TB INCREASE FOUND IN IMMIGRANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigrants accounted for 60% of the recent rise in U.S. cases of tuberculosis, 
a federal study found. 
</P>
<P>
 People infected with the AIDS virus were the next largest contributors to the 
TB increase, with an unknown overlap between the groups, said Dr. Michael F. 
Cantwell, who led the study for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Active TB cases in the United States rose 20% from 1985 through 1992 after 
dropping steadily during the previous three decades. In 1993, the total number 
of cases was 25,313, down 5% compared to the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn., dealt 
with 1985 through 1992.

 Breast cancer patients who take estrogen do not appear to increase their risk 
of additional tumors, according to doctors who reviewed studies on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women who are found to have breast cancer get chemotherapy, which hastens 
menopause.But doctors commonly withhold estrogen, which could ease the 
discomfort of menopause, for fear that the hormone could reactivate the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a review of studies on the subject found no evidence that estrogen 
promotes additional breast tumors, and any possible risk may be outweighed by 
estrogen's benefits, said Dr. Melody Cobleigh, director of the Comprehensive 
Breast Center at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobleigh led the review for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, 4,000 
doctors who perform cancer research. The report was published in Wednesday's 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The review looked at whether evidence exists that hormone replacement therapy 
might reactivate dormant cancer cells; promote tumors in women who are known to 
be prone to them, or make cancer harder to detect on mammograms by making 
healthy breast tissue denser.

2 RIGHTIST PARTIES IN GUATEMALA WIN CONGRESS MAJORITY

<P>
 Two rightist parties have captured enough seats in Guatemala's new legislature 
to change the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guatemalan Republican Front, led by former dictator and retired Gen. Jose 
Efrain Rios Montt, won 32 seats in the 80-seat Congress elected Sunday.The 
National Advanced Party won 24 seats. Results were announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The results raised the possibility that Rios Montt could run for the 
presidency, a post he held for about 17 months after seizing power in a 1982 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the constitution, Rios Montt cannot run because he seized power by 
force. But the alliance of rightist parties has enough votes in the legislature 
to amend the constitution to allow him to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups have termed Rios Montt's rule one of the bloodiest periods 
in Guatemala's history. Yet despite his violent past, Rios Montt is a 
charismatic figure in the country and has embraced an evangelistic faith shared 
by about one-quarter of Guatemalans.

VIRGINIA PANEL CALLS FOR ENDING PAROLE, REVAMPING SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commission assembled by Gov. George F. Allen recommended abolishing parole 
and revamping sentencing Tuesday to keep violent criminals off the streets 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virginians deserve a commitment from their government to incapacitate violent 
and repeat offenders," said Richard Cullen, a former federal prosecutor and 
co-chairman of the Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan requires as much as $850 million for new prisons over the next 
decade, Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen states and the federal government already operate without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's current parole system allows early release for good behavior. A 
model inmate can serve as little as one-sixth of a sentence. Parolees have to 
report to a parole officer for the remainder of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the commission plan, inmates would have to serve a minimum of 85% of 
their sentence before winning release for good behavior. The Parole Board would 
be abolished. A commission would supervise released inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, judges would have to fill out a detailed work sheet in arriving at 
sentences. The commission said that would result in longer sentences. But how 
the work sheet would accomplish that was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature is expected to take up the proposal at a special session next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a Republican, is vacationing this week and did not comment on the 
commission report. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics said the plan would add thousands of prisoners to the system. 
Virginia has about 18,000 inmates in state prisons, plus 4,000 to 6,000 in 
local jails for lack of space in the prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime has risen 28% in the last five years in Virginia and will 
continue to rise, Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the verge of having a forest fire, and we have got to do something 
now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said its plan doubles the time now served by violent first-time 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a rapist sentenced to nine years in prison now would probably 
serve 4.4 years. The commission plan increases the sentence to about 13 years, 
and the rapist would serve about 11.

CLINTON WEIGHS CRIME BILL CONCESSIONS; LEGISLATION: PRESIDENT, GOP LEADERS 
DISCUSS POSSIBLE COMPROMISES ON SOCIAL SPENDING AND GUN PROVISIONS. DEMOCRATS 
HOPE TO PICK UP 8 VOTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, struggling to save the $33.2-billion crime bill, met with 
Republican opponents Tuesday night to discuss cuts in social spending and other 
concessions to win more support for legislation that has come to represent a 
test of his ability to break congressional gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 48 hours after spurning their request for a meeting, Clinton met with 
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and 12 other House Republicans to 
discuss possible concessions that House Democratic leaders have floated in an 
intensive -- but so far unsuccessful -- effort to gain the eight votes they 
need to win approval of the crime bill later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the concessions Democrats were offering is a compromise aimed at 
attracting the votes of some lawmakers who oppose gun controls by relaxing 
restrictions on the size of the ammunition clips that could be sold under the 
bill's 10-year ban on the sale and manufacture of assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Other concessions aimed at prying loose Republican votes included what the 
Democratic leaders said would be relatively minor cuts in spending for crime 
prevention programs and the shifting of at least some of that money into law 
enforcement programs favored by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 A fiercely partisan war has raged over the crime bill since last week, when an 
alliance of Republican lawmakers and Democrats opposed to gun controls blocked 
it from coming to the House floor. Declaring a truce, Gingrich said Clinton 
agreed with Republican demands to cut an unspecified amount from the $7.4 
billion in spending on social programs contained in the bill and to work with 
GOP lawmakers on other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President indicated a very strong interest to work with us on a 
bipartisan basis and we're going to honor that," Gingrich said, adding that he 
now hopes to help craft a "genuinely bipartisan" compromise that could pass the 
House before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 No details were agreed upon, however, and a senior White House source 
suggested that the Republicans were exaggerating Clinton's concessions at the 
meeting. The source said the President had reiterated that he would not accept 
"massive cuts" in spending for the bill's crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The source added that Clinton also was firm in his insistence that the assault 
weapons ban remain in the bill, despite powerful opposition from the National 
Rifle Assn. and other gun lobby groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Democratic sources on Capitol Hill conceded that Clinton's 
efforts to compromise with the Republicans underscored what for them has been 
an embarrassing failure. Despite four days of extremely intense lobbying, 
Clinton has been unable to secure guarantees of support from any of the 58 
members of his own party who deserted him on last week's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 With the President's allies agreeing that far more now is at stake for his 
Administration than just the crime bill, Democratic leaders sought to win at 
least a few votes from those who do not like gun controls by offering what they 
described as minor changes in the types of magazine clips that the owners of 
semiautomatic weapons could buy under the assault weapons provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides banning 19 specific assault weapons, the bill as originally passed by 
both the House and Senate would prohibit the sale of semiautomatic feeder clips 
holding 10 or more rounds of ammunition. "Raising that number to a higher, but 
still undecided, figure is one way we may be able to secure a couple of votes," 
a Democratic leadership aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals being floated in a daylong series of meetings between 
lawmakers and senior White House officials included the adoption of tougher 
restrictions on the parole of sexual offenders and an across-the-board cut in 
funds for crime prevention programs that Republicans have derided as 
pork-barrel spending that will have little impact on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) continued to voice optimism Tuesday 
that the bill will be passed without radical alterations before the end of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an indirect admission that the Administration's efforts were faltering, 
Foley also indicated that the next vote on the crime bill is likely to be 
postponed from Thursday until Friday or even Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good," a senior Administration official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting not only for the crime bill but for what many Democrats see as his 
political life, Clinton cleared his calendar to devote full time to winning 
passage of the crime measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But as night fell, the White House had not won a single firm commitment to 
change votes from any of the 225 House members who voted against the bill. 
While Democratic vote counters said they have indications that several members 
will change their votes, on paper they still remained eight votes short of the 
218 needed. 
</P>
<P>
 One argument that White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and other 
officials were using with wayward Democrats was that the political calculus of 
the crime bill has taken on a life of its own since the leadership's defeat 
last week and now threatens not only the bill but Democratic control of 
Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 With Clinton's other major initiative -- health care reform -- also in trouble 
this year, the crime bill could be the only significant piece of legislation 
Congress approves between now and the November elections. As such, it could 
well become a test of the Democratic leadership's ability to convince voters 
that it can overcome gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's political debacle "sent two messages to the voting public," said 
political analyst Charles Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is that Congress is deeply dysfunctional and the other is that the 
President is ineffective" and cannot deliver on his promises even when his own 
party controls both the House and the Senate, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "immediate political importance" of the crime bill easily "equals that of 
health care reform," agreed one of the leadership's chief vote counters, the 
House Deputy Majority Whip Bill Richardson (D-N.M.). "If we don't win on this 
the second time around, we won't have to bother legislating term limits."

PARTY LINES GETTING TANGLED AMID CRIME BILL HAGGLING; POLITICS: THE FINAL 
DEBATE TAKES ON A CONTRARIAN QUALITY. REPUBLICANS ARE BACKING POSITIONS ONCE 
CHAMPIONED BY DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one expects consistency in politics, but the last round of debate over the 
$33.2-billion crime bill is beginning to resemble a hall of mirrors. On two key 
provisions, Republican leaders are attacking the final legislation with 
arguments that the Administration itself once raised -- and criticizing 
language other Republicans helped to write into the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican accusations that the legislation does not offer enough 
community protection against sexual offenders substantially echoes concerns 
that the Administration itself voiced months ago. And the provisions under 
attack from Republican leaders for potentially releasing convicted drug 
offenders from jail were drafted with the support of leading Republicans on the 
House Judiciary Committee -- over the Administration's objections. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the Administration, in effect, is now under pressure from the 
GOP to adopt positions close to its own original preferences in the bill. But 
steering the legislation in that direction, on either front, risks angering 
liberals who rejected the Administration's positions in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, on both counts, the Administration views the Republican objections 
as exaggerating the impact of the disputed provisions: "The bigger flaw is that 
there are mountains being made of these molehills," said one senior Justice 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Administration is willing to satisfy the GOP critics on at least 
the so-called "sexual predator" provisions. Rep. Dick Zimmer (R-N.J.) said 
Tuesday night that President Clinton had called to tell him the Administration 
would accept the changes in the measure that Republicans are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 On the House floor Thursday, Republicans argued that the final legislation 
undermined efforts to encourage community notification when a sexual offender 
moves into a neighborhood after release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 This emotional dispute revolves around the way the House-Senate conference 
committee blended two bills that aimed to encourage states to track individuals 
with records of sexual offenses or crimes against children. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bill -- the so-called "Jacob Wetterling Act" sponsored by Minnesota 
GOP Rep. Jim Ramstad and GOP Sen. Dave Durenberger -- encouraged states to 
establish a registry to keep track of individuals with a record of crimes 
against children; both houses approved that measure. Last fall the Senate also 
passed an amendment to the crime bill from Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) that 
established a second registry for offenders convicted of sex crimes against 
victims of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 The House-Senate conferees decided that it made no sense to establish two 
registries for such offenders, instead creating one larger registry covering 
both groups of offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But in combining the bills, the conferees took provisions from the 
Republican-sponsored "Jacob Wetterling Act" in two key instances that were more 
narrow than the broader requirements established under the Gorton legislation. 
It is those provisions from the Gorton amendment that Republicans are now 
clamoring to include in the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gorton bill, a so-called "sexual predator" would be required to notify 
law enforcement officials of his address every three months for the rest of his 
life. The conferees had accepted the Wetterling provision that required only 
annual notification for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 More important to the critics, the conferees rejected language in the Gorton 
amendment to guide the release of information to communities about sexual 
offenders obtained for the new state registries. 
</P>
<P>
 As is often the case in polarizing Washington battles, the dispute boils down 
to an interpretation of a few words: The Gorton bill says that information can 
be released to "protect the public;" the final bill (drawing on language in the 
Wetterling bill) says that it can be released only for "law enforcement 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the final bill maintain that there is a large difference. The 
standard of protecting the public would encourage officials to widely 
distribute information to a community where a sexual offender has located, 
while the standard in the final bill might impede such efforts, they maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Administration and congressional sources said, Rep. Don Edwards 
(D-San Jose) and other House liberals did intend to narrow the Gorton 
provision's scope, fearing that it would lead to incidents like the recent case 
in Washington state, where a sex offender whose release was made public under 
that state's disclosure law had his home burned down in the Seattle suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Administration took a position not unlike the one GOP critics 
are taking now. In its formal comments to the conference committee in June, the 
Administration expressed concern that the privacy provisions in the bills might 
interfere with state programs to disseminate information about sex offenders to 
"school authorities or victims of earlier offenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Administration officials said they doubt that the final bill 
represents as substantial a change from the Gorton version as Republicans 
contend. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has concluded, 
they noted, that the "law enforcement purposes" standard in the final 
legislation would not impede existing community notification programs in the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders has an 
equally convoluted history. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia has repeatedly condemned the 
conference bill's provision that could lead to freeing low-level, nonviolent 
drug offenders without serious prior records from lengthy mandatory minimum 
prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would release over 10,000 drug dealers who are currently in prison," 
Gingrich said recently. "We are prepared to go to the country and say: 
'Releasing 10,000 drug dealers is not anti-crime.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But two of Gingrich's fellow House Republicans, conservatives Bill McCollum of 
Florida and Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, voted for making retroactive the drug 
offender release provision that Gingrich condemns. On the other hand, the 
Administration opposed this feature, arguing instead that it should apply only 
to those who violate drug laws after the bill is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Administration does not believe that the provision would have 
nearly the impact Gingrich suggests. Based on federal prison statistics, the 
Justice Department estimates that between 100 and 535 prisoners could win 
immediate release. By 1999, the number would be between 2,000 and 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of softening punishment of nonviolent, minor drug offenders emerged 
as a compromise to proposals in the House to eliminate mandatory-minimum 
sentences entirely on grounds that they were using up scarce prison space 
needed for more serious and violent lawbreakers and keeping lesser criminals 
behind bars for longer than they deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearings on mandatory minimums by the House Judiciary crime subcommittee 
headed by Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a middle ground won bipartisan 
support: Low-level offenders serving a mandatory minimum could ask a court to 
be released, citing such factors as no prior serious criminal record, or no 
firearm or violence involved in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Administration objections, however, the conference bill adopted the 
retroactive provision and Gingrich had a powerful one-liner about freeing 
10,000 drug dealers. Yet, said a senior White House official, Republicans 
appear less interested in the issue off-camera: "It has not come up in our 
meetings," the official said.

EX-AIDE SAYS FEINSTEIN HINDERED BIAS CLAIM AGAINST PRINCETON; POLITICS: SENATOR 
REPLIES THAT SHE DID NOT THREATEN TO FIRE THE FORMER STUDENT BUT TOLD HIM NOT 
TO IMPLY THAT HIS COMPLAINT WAS OFFICIAL BUSINESS. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Princeton University student who worked for California Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein said Tuesday that she threatened to fire him if he did not cease 
pursuing his racial discrimination complaint against the university and federal 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic senator denied the charges, which were described in a news 
conference by Paul McDonald, 23, of Houston. Feinstein said she never tried to 
stop McDonald from pursuing his charges and only insisted that he avoid using 
his employment in her office in any private correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul was not discharged from this office. He was not asked to stop pursuing 
his complaint," Feinstein said in a written statement. "He was only asked to 
not use office time to pursue his complaint and to not make it seem that his 
communication was connected to the official functions of the Senate office." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, who is African American, said Tuesday that Feinstein and her 
advisers "demeaned me and disparaged the seriousness of my complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald was hired by Feinstein in September in the entry-level job of 
legislative correspondent. In December, Feinstein said, McDonald wrote to every 
member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, asking for an 
investigation into charges of racial discrimination he had made against 
Princeton University and the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his correspondence, Paul included his business card and asked members to 
contact him at my office," Feinstein said in remarks on the Senate floor 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Feinstein agree that they signed an agreement afterward that barred him 
from associating future requests with her office. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Feinstein, McDonald sent a second letter in January to 
committee members that Feinstein's office found deficient for two reasons. It 
included his office phone number, which is easily recognizable among senators, 
and again did not make clear it was a strictly personal request. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case of a recent college graduate who did not understand the 
ramifications of making personal correspondence seem official," Feinstein 
spokesman Bill Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said he was told in a May 9 meeting that he was fired and was 
discharged May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said he voluntarily resigned May 27 after being given 3 1/2 months 
to find a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald now works for Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.). 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Tuesday, McDonald cited support from Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun 
(D-Ill.), the only black senator, for his discrimination complaint with the 
Department of Education. But Moseley-Braun issued a statement strongly backing 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Feinstein has extended herself on behalf of Mr. McDonald with 
extraordinary patience and support. It is most regrettable that her repayment 
for the kindness is a baseless charge of discrimination. Months ago, I 
recommended to Sen. Feinstein that she fire Mr. McDonald." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's complaints against Princeton charge that administrators passed him 
over for academic promotions, tried to undermine his agenda as student body 
president and wrongly placed him on disciplinary probation for using university 
materials to inform minority students of their right to file charges against 
the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education's civil rights office did not find any wrongdoing 
by Princeton. McDonald's complaint accuses the department of covering up the 
matter and failing to enforce his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said he received "no outside prompting" to go public with the charges 
and said his father, Walter, was paying the costs of hiring a public relations 
firm to assist in the Tuesday announcement, held at the National Press Club.

BOND MEASURE AIDING HOME BUYERS IS TAKEN OFF BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Wary of asking Californians to approve more bond measures, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Monday signed legislation, approved only hours earlier by the Assembly, 
removing from the November ballot a $185-million bond measure designed to help 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Julie Bornstein (D-Palm Desert) pressed for the removal because 
she believed that voters would defeat the proposal, Proposition 182, just as 
they turned down a similar measure in a 1993 special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters' attention is distracted elsewhere," said Bornstein during a brief 
debate in the Assembly, which sent the proposal to Wilson on a 71-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor signed the legislation so it could be deleted from the voters 
pamphlet set to be printed late Monday or early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's actions were triggered by a special election in November in which 
voters defeated Proposition 173. That measure would have authorized the state 
to sell $185 million in housing bonds to provide mortgage insurance for low- 
and moderate-income first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was automatically reset to be placed back before voters in the statewide 
general election on Nov. 8, according to Melissa Warren, a spokeswoman for the 
secretary of state's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the primary two months ago, the state's voters rejected all four bond 
measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said Monday's removal of Proposition 182 from the ballot was the first 
time in recent memory that the Legislature has acted to delete a measure set to 
go before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, an effort to remove a $1-billion rail bond act from the 
ballot was turned down Monday by the Senate on a 15-14 vote. Proponents needed 
27 votes in the 40-member upper house to delete Proposition 181 from the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was granted reconsideration, which means the issue could arise 
again before the Legislature adjourns Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd twist, Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford), who authored the rail bond 
proposal, pushed for its removal, citing the state's dismal economic situation 
and the voters' unwillingness to support more bonds.

<P>
 A tornado spawned by the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl smashed through town 
Tuesday, trapping people for hours in a caved-in shopping center and injuring 
at least 35. 
</P>
<P>
 From 40 to 50 buildings were damaged or destroyed, City Administrator L. C. 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came by swirling trash, metal, limbs everywhere, then it just stopped and 
then went on. You could see big old puffs of blue as it went through" knocking 
out electrical transformers, said Phillip Butler, a grocery store employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. declared a state of emergency in Lexington 
County, and 100 National Guardsmen were dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three people were trapped in the rubble at the Village Square shopping 
center but were rescued three hours later with minor injuries, Sheriff James 
Metts said. 
</P>
<P>
 One person was hurt when a twister flipped a mobile home. A man and child 
initially reported missing in Lexington were later accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other twisters were reported in the state.

FOX'S LIVE NFL TELECASTS MAY VIOLATE FCC, TRADE RULES; TELEVISION: AT ISSUE IS 
THE NETWORK'S FEEDING OF THE GAMES TO MEXICAN STATIONS, WHICH REBROADCAST INTO 
U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the National Football League tries to build an international audience for 
the game, federal regulators are reviewing whether the Fox Television network 
is violating federal law by providing three Mexican TV stations with live NFL 
telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the three stations along the U.S.-Mexico border are 
violating Federal Communications Commission rules as well as the North American 
Free Trade Agreement by broadcasting American programming into the United 
States in competition with U.S. stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal courts and the FCC have previously determined that a similar 
affiliation agreement with one of the Mexican TV stations was illegal. But a 
Fox lawyer contends that NAFTA changes the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If the FCC blocks the affiliation agreements, densely populated stretches of 
Southern California -- including 940,000 TV households in San Diego alone -- 
would not be able to see National Conference football games.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot is at stake" for Fox and the NFL, acknowledged William J. Potts Jr., a 
Washington communications lawyer who represents Fox in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The network is already under FCC scrutiny for possible violation of federal 
laws prohibiting foreign companies from owning U.S. broadcast stations. That 
examination, which began in spring, focuses on who owns six big-city television 
stations purchased in 1985 to form the core of the fledgling Fox network: 
Rupert Murdoch, a naturalized U.S. citizen, or News Corp., the Australian 
company Murdoch runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest FCC inquiry into the NFL broadcasts was triggered after Fox filed 
an application with the agency in February to transmit its programming directly 
by satellite to XETV-TV in Tijuana. The owners of nearby KUSI-TV, a low-powered 
TV station in San Diego that broadcasts a mix of news and syndicated 
programming, objected to the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has given Fox and Murdoch temporary authority to continue their 
arrangement with XETV-TV and two other stations, XHNUL-TV in Nuevo Laredo near 
Laredo, Tex., and XHRTA-TV in Reynosa Matamoros outside of Brownsville, Tex. 
But FCC general counsel William Kennard said the agency expects to issue a 
decision on the arrangement next month, the start of the NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox paid a breathtaking $1.58 billion for four-year broadcast rights to 
National Conference football games in an effort to broaden the audience for its 
network programs, which include such hits as "The Simpsons" and "Beverly Hills, 
90210." The NFL, too, has been seeking more fans by holding preseason and other 
special games overseas, most recently in Barcelona, Spain, and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL officials were en route to their offices Tuesday from Mexico City and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 XETV in Tijuana, which is owned by Televisora de Calimex, had not previously 
sought FCC approval for its Fox broadcasts because Fox recorded its satellite 
signal in San Diego and trucked tapes of its broadcasts to Tijuana to be 
broadcast by XETV on a delayed basis, thereby circumventing U.S. law. But with 
live football games, such an arrangement was not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "KUSI is opposed to (Fox's) application because that station has a track 
record of being a network affiliate, (yet) to the best of my knowledge they do 
no news or public affairs programming" for viewers, as U.S. stations are 
required to do under federal law, said Robert B. Jacobi, a Washington attorney 
who represents KUSI. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobi said the FCC has "the right to review and consider what the (Tijuana) 
station is doing for the American community." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington upheld an FCC ruling that 
struck down a similar affiliation agreement between the ABC Television network 
and XETV. But Fox's lawyer Potts contends the case "is no longer the law 
because we now have NAFTA." 
</P>
<P>
 An FCC official said NAFTA indeed casts a novel twist on Fox's affiliation 
arrangement with the Mexican TV stations. Legal experts say the accord neither 
endorses nor outlaws the practice and that the main issue is avoiding 
transmission interference with U.S. stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States . . . will not consider the nationality of the affected 
stations for the purpose of favoring a U.S. station that is competing with a 
Mexican station for affiliation with a U.S. programmer," the treaty states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new legal issue because we haven't considered the kinds of 
standards that NAFTA imposes on us," said Abbie Baynes, FCC special assistant 
to the general counsel.

KMART TO SELL MAJORITY STAKE IN SUBSIDIARIES; RETAILING: ACTION ON OFFICEMAX, 
SPORTS AUTHORITY AND BORDERS-WALDENBOOKS PARTLY MEETS SHAREHOLDER DEMANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebuffed by shareholders the first time around, embattled Kmart announced 
Tuesday that it will spin off its book, office supply and sporting goods chains 
to raise money for the expansion and modernization of its more than 2,000 
discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the sale of 51% of Kmart's OfficeMax, Sports Authority and 
Borders-Waldenbooks subsidiaries could raise as much as $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart's board, meeting at its Troy, Mich., headquarters, said it will sell 
stock to the public in each of the three chains while retaining about 49% 
ownership. Each new company will have independent management and separate 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan goes part of the way to meet shareholders' demands. In June, they 
defeated a management proposal to sell 20% to 30% of Kmart's equity in the 
three chains and Builders Square, another specialty chain owned by the discount 
retailer. That would have raised less than $1 billion and, critics said, 
prevented Kmart from focusing solely on the discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the sale will significantly reduce the cost of the 
modernization, said Mary Lorencz, a Kmart spokeswoman. "These subsidiaries were 
undervalued. This plan helps the specialty chains, Kmart and the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's announcement still did not satisfy some investors, including the 
California Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think that they should maintain any interest in the specialty 
outlets," said an official at the CalPERS, which owns 0.7% of all Kmart stock. 
"This is more acceptable than the previous proposal, but it's not our 
preference." 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders' unexpected rebuke of management in June raised questions about 
the survival of Kmart Chairman Joseph Antonini. The company's core discount 
stores have been losing ground to the more aggressive Wal-Mart and Target 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Tuesday's action should bolster Kmart's ability to compete by 
giving it a bigger war chest but that Antonini's future hinges on the company's 
performance the rest of this year. Kmart does not need shareholder approval to 
proceed with this latest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart is trying to boost sales by remodeling and expanding its discount 
stores. It has already remodeled two-thirds of its 2,346 stores nationwide. 
About 10% of Kmart's stores are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said it will offer stock in OfficeMax "within the next few weeks." Stock 
in the other two chains will be offered soon, when market conditions are 
favorable, the company said. Builders Square is not part of the spinoff plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also drew mixed reaction from industry analysts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kmart's various parts are more valuable than the whole," said Tony Howard, an 
analyst at Roney & Co. in Detroit. "By going this route, Kmart will realize the 
real value of these subsidiaries and be able to focus on its core business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Kristiansen, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York, said she 
would rather see Kmart "exit these businesses completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart earned $377 million for the six months ended July 27, compared to income 
of $470 million for the same period a year ago -- a decline of about 19%.

DEBATE SPARKED OVER EDISON'S CUTOFF POLICY; ENERGY: A HEAT EXHAUSTION DEATH 
TRIGGERS CRITICISM OF TOUGHER COLLECTION RULES. UTILITY SAYS IT'S EAGER TO WORK 
WITH CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southern California Edison has pulled the plug on more than 200,000 non-paying 
customers so far this year -- double the entire 1993 number -- and this month's 
heat wave has raised the stakes to potentially dangerous levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The death by heat exhaustion of an elderly Palm Springs woman whose 
electricity was disconnected for failure to pay a $40 bill has triggered 
criticism of the utility's recently toughened policies, and Edison responded 
this week with a plea for hard-pressed customers to avail themselves of help. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a problem paying your bill, contact us first. We don't want to 
disconnect you," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, Edison's senior vice president 
for customer solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 California's electric and gas utilities have recently stiffened collection 
procedures and are now strictly adhering to cutoff provisions laid out by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, said Patricia Esule, Los Angeles 
supervisor of consumer affairs for the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Utilities aren't allowing customers to carry past-due balances as long as 
they used to," Esule said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under PUC rules -- which apply to investor-owned utilities such as Edison -- 
bills are due on receipt and considered past due 19 days after the bill was 
mailed. Customers then receive a delinquency notice, which allows 15 more days 
to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the utility must give customers 48 hours' notice -- by phone or mail or 
in person -- that their power is about to be cut off. Special consideration is 
mandated for the elderly or handicapped, but the utilities normally don't know 
whether a customer is in one of those categories because there is no 
requirement for them to gather that information when a customer signs up for 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the Department of Water & Power has not experienced a 
significant jump in cutoffs, though it, too, is clamping down on late payers. 
The policy is "to be really, really tough on those we think are trying to beat 
us," said F. Rennie Powell, director of the city utility's commercial division. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison blames the jump in disconnections on California's dismal economy, but 
consumer advocates say the utility's stricter policies are making matters 
worse. In a statement to be filed Thursday with the PUC, Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization, a San Francisco consumer group, will accuse Edison of "callous 
treatment of residential customers having trouble paying their bills." 
</P>
<P>
 TURN notes that unemployment, while high, has remained stable even as what it 
terms a "rampage of disconnections" has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Other utilities have seen similar increases in power cutoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. cutoffs jumped 20% in July alone. San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. has seen a 28% rise in disconnections this year over last. And all 
the utilities have recently stiffened their collection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to tell customers that we really mean it" about 
disconnections, said Suzanne Middelburg, Edison manager of consumer affairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The utility has added about 30 workers to its disconnection crews since 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy really hasn't changed as much as how we're implementing it," 
Middelburg said. "We weren't as aggressive as other companies."  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the new, tougher policies cite the death in late June of Cynthia 
Blaire, 68, whose body was discovered June 30 in her Palm Springs apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 The temperature in the apartment still registered 110 degrees at 7:45 p.m. 
that evening; according to the Riverside County coroner's office, she died of 
heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing in several attempts to reach Blaire by phone and after mailing 
the required notices, Edison turned off her power June 23. Personal contact is 
not required before a cutoff under PUC rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are shocked and appalled that something like that could happen," said 
Rolfe Arnhym, chief executive and executive vice president of the Palm Springs 
Chamber of Commerce. "With all due respect to Edison . . . there are a lot of 
folks who are hurting (financially). We're going to have to work with them, and 
if we have to rewrite some procedures, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Palm Springs death, Edison has said it will try to directly contact 
overdue customers when the mercury is 105 degrees or higher or 25 degrees or 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, critics fear such problems could grow as the state's electric 
utilities pare back to face the new world of competition. Getting Help 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's heat wave is boosting utility costs for many homeowners 
-- and boosting chances that consumers will suffer a power shut-off for 
non-payment of their bills. Here's what you can do if you don't have the money 
to pay Southern California Edison. (Other utilities have similar programs.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Call. Customers who are sincerely trying to pay won't be shut off, Edison 
says. But you'll need to notify the utility and determine your payment options. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek low-income assistance. Ask about programs that can mean a discounted 
rate if your income is below certain thresholds (between $15,700 and $25,800, 
depending on the size of your household). Call: (800) 447-6620. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sign up for "cycling." Edison offers a cash credit to help defray summer 
electric bills in exchange for allowing the utility to shut off your air 
conditioner during hours of peak demand -- usually between noon and 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget your payments. Edison's "level pay" plan doesn't reduce overall 
utility expenses, but it allows you to even out your bills over 11 months of 
the year. In the 12th month, there's a "settlement bill." 
</P>
<P>
 * Use third-party notification. If you set it up with Edison in advance, the 
utility will contact a third party -- a family member or friend, for example -- 
when your bill is overdue. The third party may help handle the matter with the 
company.

Q & A; RATE HIKE'S MIXED EFFECT; TIPS FOR CONSUMERS, BORROWERS, SAVERS AND 
INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's move Tuesday to raise short-term interest rates by 
half a percentage point will have a mixed effect on consumers, borrowers, 
savers and investors. Some borrowing rates, including those on many personal 
loans, will rise. But other rates, including those on fixed-rate mortgages, 
could fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some answers to key questions about the Fed's move. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will the rate hike affect my loans? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It depends on what kind of debt you have. If you have an adjustable-rate 
credit card or a home-equity loan that's linked to the prime rate, your rate 
will probably go up immediately because most banks followed the Fed's lead 
Tuesday and raised their prime rates by half a point. Rates on most 
adjustable-rate mortgages will also rise, but more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the Fed's action push up rates on fixed mortgage loans? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ironically, Tuesday's increase in the discount rate should keep rates on 
fixed mortgages stable or even push them lower. Yields on 10- and 30-year 
Treasury bonds, which bankers use to price their fixed-rate mortgages, fell 
after the Fed's announcement because bond investors had renewed confidence that 
inflation will remain under control. Some lenders and mortgage brokers 
subsequently reduced the rate on their fixed-rate loans by as much as a quarter 
of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Others dropped their up-front charges. Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank 
knocked 0.375 point off its loan set-up fees, which trimmed $562 off the cost 
of a new, $150,000 mortgage, according to Mortgage Market Weekly, a Santa 
Ana-based firm that follows mortgage trends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about adjustable-rate mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Unfortunately, most lenders raised their ARM rates by as much as half a 
point Tuesday because adjustable-rate mortgages are pegged to the prime rate, 
short-term Treasuries or other vehicles that tend to move in lock step with 
increases in the Fed's discount rate, which rose to 4% from 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've been thinking about buying a home. What should I do now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Don't be in a rush to close a deal. Most experts say fixed mortgage rates 
will remain flat for the rest of the year, and a growing number now say they 
could drop as much as a quarter of a point more. That would knock about $27 off 
the monthly cost of a $150,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
 If home prices were rising sharply, it wouldn't be worth waiting for a modest 
decline in rates, because your savings in interest costs would be wiped out by 
the higher price you'd pay for your home. But because home prices in Southern 
California are flat and the spring home-buying surge is over, "there isn't much 
of a chance that prices in the region are going to go up much over the next 
several months," said David Berson, chief economist of the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae) in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the rate that banks pay on certificates of deposit also rise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They may, but probably not enough to match the Fed's half-point increase in 
the discount rate. With many consumers and businesses nervous about borrowing 
money, most banks are already awash with cash and have no reason to raise their 
deposit rates to attract more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rates on CDs might go up a little bit, but not a full half-point," said Paul 
Havemann, who tracks interest rates for the consulting firm HSH Associates in 
Butler, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything I can do now to protect my pocketbook in the months 
ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. With interest rates rising, you need to become a more aggressive 
consumer. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * If your bank raises your credit card rate, call and complain or look for a 
different company. "Competition in the industry is fierce, and many vendors 
will lower their rate or waive their annual fees just to keep your business," 
said Havemann at HSH Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you invest in CDs, contact at least six institutions to shop for the best 
rate, or consider using a broker to find the best deal. The Times' Business 
section publishes a list of the highest-paying CDs every Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although rates on ARMs are rising, don't automatically rule them out if 
you're buying a home or refinancing. If you plan to move again within three 
years or so, an ARM with a low initial rate is still going to be your best 
choice because you'll save money in the first couple of years and will sell 
before the rate has a chance to ratchet skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will the rate increase affect the stock market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the hike slows the economy and prolongs the recovery -- as most analysts 
expect -- the outlook for stocks and bonds should be bright. The wild card is 
that many investors may now turn to more conservative investments, such as 
Treasury bills, to eliminate their risk but lock in a guaranteed return. With 
one-year Treasuries now paying a healthy 5.5%, it's hard to blame risk-averse 
investors if they shun the uncertainty of buying stocks or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will the rate hike affect the economy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It should slow the economy down. When banks' borrowing costs go up, they 
pass along the increase to their customers by charging higher rates on 
everything from credit cards to business loans. People borrow less and spend 
less when interest rates are high, which in turn puts a damper on economic 
growth.

 Q: Then won't raising interest rates make inflation worse, not better? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In the short-term, the rate hike could make inflation worse. But the Fed's 
job is to worry about inflation down the road, not what inflation is doing 
today. If the Fed's strategy works and the economy slows, it will ease 
long-term inflationary pressures and prevent interest rates from skyrocketing 
next year and beyond. Up, Up and Away 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's move Tuesday to push short-term interest rates a half 
percentage point higher will raise borrowing costs for millions of Americans. 
The Fed raised, to 4.75%, the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other 
for overnight loans. The Fed also hiked, to 4%, the discount rate that it 
charges on its own loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major banks immediately followed by raising their prime rates to 7.75% 
from 7.25%. Rates on home equity loans, credit cards and personal loans will 
also jump, as they are generally tied to the prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, savings rates are expected to continue rising far less dramatically 
than loan rates. That's because demand for loans isn't sufficient to spur heady 
competition between banks for deposits, many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage rates may not necessarily rise, because they are linked to long-term 
interest rates, which actually fell Tuesday because the Fed's move was seen as 
a strong attack on future inflation. Inflation expectations are the main force 
driving long-term interest rates. 
</P>

U.S., JAPAN SIGN ACCORD ON PATENT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trade negotiators from the United States and Japan, struggling to keep rising 
trade tensions from escalating into economic warfare, signed an agreement 
Tuesday to bring their divergent patent laws for software and other 
intellectual property into line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammering out an agreement has been a top priority for U.S. software 
designers, who have complained for years about weak or nonexistent legal 
safeguards that have allowed overseas competitors to pirate their products. 
Provisions in the accord will take effect by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Japanese Ambassador Takakazu 
Kuriyama, the settlement calls for a major overhaul of the Japanese patent 
system, which U.S. trade officials said has undercut American inventors' 
efforts to enter the Asian marketplace. Changes in the U.S. system will be 
comparatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
 To enact the changes in the U.S. and Japanese systems, Brown and Kuriyama will 
introduce bills to their nation's lawmakers next month after negotiators have 
closed the current round of trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching a consensus on the patent system represents one of the few bright 
spots in the talks, which have been bogged down by disputes over an array of 
issues, including automobiles and pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of the agreement may ease U.S.-Japanese friction over patents, 
which give inventors the exclusive right to market their products. U.S. 
inventors have criticized the Japanese system for failing to protect 
information contained in patent filings from pirates. Japan has derided the 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for being too secretive. 
</P>
<P>
 With the settlement, U.S. inventors who have had an "awfully tough" time 
penetrating the Japanese market will have an easier time competing, said Bruce 
Lehman, commissioner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which issues 
about 100,000 patents annually. Patent violations in Asia cost U.S. innovators 
more than $10 billion a year, Lehman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will change longstanding rules in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the accord will bar Japanese inventors from opposing patents sought 
by foreigners before they are granted. The agreement will also establish an 
accelerated application program in Japan to enable inventors to obtain a 
yes-or-no response to their patent request within three years instead of the 
usual five. U.S. innovators will also be able to file patent applications in 
English for the first time. The Japanese Patent Office will stop awarding 
compulsory licenses, which force foreign inventors to give up their exclusive 
rights by licensing rivals to use their technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, officials will start publishing pending patent 
applications 18 months after they are filed -- a step Japanese inventors hope 
will eliminate "submarine" patents, so called because previously unknown 
inventors can suddenly surface and demand royalties on a product before anyone 
knew a patent had been granted. U.S. patents will also be valid for 20 years 
after the application is filed -- similar to patents issued in other countries 
-- instead of 17 years after the patent is issued. 
</P>
<P>
 But the accord did not resolve Japanese complaints about the U.S. practice of 
granting patents only to the inventor of a product rather than to the first 
applicant. Most countries around the world employ a first-come, first-served 
system but U.S. patent officials have resisted pressure to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the Clinton Administration has made progress in "resolving some 
longstanding difficulties," Brown promised that the agreement will help U.S. 
inventors win better access to Japanese markets.

 NBC Buys Salt Lake City TV Station: The network has agreed to purchase its 
Salt Lake City affiliate, KUTV, from a New York-based group controlled by 
investment bankers Veronis Suhler & Associates.The purchase is the latest move 
among all four broadcast networks trying to get greater control over their 
local outlets in the wake of a series of affiliate switches. Supported by a 
robust local economy, Salt Lake City is one of the fastest-growing TV markets 
in the country. NBC already owns six other TV stations, including KNBC-TV in 
Los Angeles. The deal is subject to Federal Communications Commission approval. 
Terms weren't disclosed, but industry experts put the purchase price at about 
$100 million.

 Deadline Nears for Nissan Van Buyback: The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration reminded owners of 1987-90 Nissan minivans that Saturday is the 
last day Nissan will buy back models recalled because of engine compartment 
fires. It said only about 58% of the some 30,000 owners of the vans recalled 
Feb. 3 had responded, with 18,200 asking for buybacks and 123 for inspections 
and repairs. The NHTSA said Nissan has agreed to buy back the minivans through 
Saturday, although the repair offer under the agency's recall is open 
indefinitely.

 State Will Accelerate Use of Alternative Fuel Cars: Under an executive order 
by Gov. Pete Wilson, to be released today, California's government vehicle 
fleet will go beyond federal mandates for adding alternative-fuel vehicles. 
Federal law now requires 10% of the state fleet to be fueled by natural gas or 
other cleaner-burning fuels by 1996 and 75% by 2000. The state initiative will 
raise that to 25% by 1996 and 75% by 1999.

 Genentech Disagrees With Allegations: The South San Francisco-based company, 
which has become tangled in an extensive federal investigative web, denied 
charges that it used illegal marketing practices to increase sales of its 
growth hormone drug Protropin.The comments follow yesterday's announcement by 
the Food and Drug Administration that it will investigate claims by Rep. Ron 
Wyden (D-Ore.) that Genentech Inc. illegally marketed the drug for off-label, 
or non-FDA-approved, uses. Company spokeswoman Laura Leber said Genentech 
"adamantly disagrees" with Wyden's allegations. She said a similar FDA 
investigation in 1992 found no evidence of any illegal conduct.

 Revlon Cancels Magazine Ads: The cosmetics company pulled its advertisements 
from Hearst Magazines, a unit of Hearst Corp., the Wall Street Journal 
reported. A spokeswoman for Hearst said the action was apparently taken after 
the September issue of Esquire magazine published a profile of Patricia Duff, a 
companion of Ron Perelman, Revlon Inc.'s chairman. The spokeswoman declined to 
comment on the billings, but an industry executive said Revlon spends $5 
million to $8 million annually in Hearst magazines.

December.The agreement was approved in separate meetings this week and is 
contingent on the approval of Macy creditors, the court and Federated 
shareholders. However, creditors have already given their support to the plan, 
under which Federated would repay $4.1 billion in Macy debt and Macy would 
become a Federated division. The companies have not yet revealed how they would 
resolve antitrust questions raised by federal and state officials over markets 
in the Northeast and South.

EARNINGS: MAJOR RETAILERS SEE SUBSTANTIAL 2ND-QUARTER GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four big retailers announced substantial earnings gains for the second quarter 
Tuesday, reflecting the strength of merchants who emphasize value. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest store owner, discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said its 
earnings rose 14%. Dayton Hudson Corp. said its earnings more than doubled and 
J. C. Penney Co. announced a 17.4% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot Inc., the successful home improvement chain, said earnings rose 
32%. 
</P>
<P>
 The second quarter was generally good for discounters and retailers of 
merchandise for the home. Apparel sales were uneven during the quarter, but 
Penney, known for valued-priced clothes, and department store operators 
including Dayton Hudson fared better than specialty apparel companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wal-Mart said it earned $564.8 million, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter 
ended July 31, up from $495.9 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales totaled $19.94 billion, up from $16.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentonville, Ark.-based company's discount stores continued to perform 
strongly, with sales from stores open at least a year -- a closely watched 
measure of a retailer's strength -- rising 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Sam's Club warehouse division was hurt by continuing problems in 
that sector of the retailing business. Its sales from stores open at least a 
year -- also known as same-store sales -- were down 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were in the mid-range of Wall Street expectations. Wal-Mart's 
stock rose 50 cents to $24.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dayton Hudson reported a profit of $49 million, or 62 cents a share, in the 
quarter ended July 30, up from $24 million, or 28 cents a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales rose 12% to $4.8 billion, from $4.29 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis-based retailer's same-store sales rose 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's Target discount stores led other divisions in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Target performed better than expected, and Mervyn's and the department store 
division performed as expected," said Robert Ulrich, Dayton Hudson chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mervyn's is a clothing store chain. The department stores include Dayton's, 
Hudson's and Marshall Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson's results were in the high end of analysts' expectations, and 
the company's stock rose $1.75 a share to $85.25 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 * J.C. Penney had net income of $132 million, or 51 cents a share, on sales of 
$4.24 billion in the quarter ended July 30. That compares to $112 million, or 
42 cents a share, on sales of $3.96 billion in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales rose to $4.2 billion from $4.0 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Plano, Tex.-based company has been one of the nation's most successful 
apparel retailers and has done well since the recession, while many other store 
owners have had bumpy sales at best. 
</P>
<P>
 But second-quarter results were at the low end of analyst expectations, and 
the company's stock slipped $1.75 a share to $47.125 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atlanta-based Home Depot said it earned $178 million, or 39 cents a share, a 
32% increase over $134.5 million, or 30 cents a share, in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales at the home improvement retail chain totaled $3.3 billion, up 34% from 
$2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Results were at the high end of expectations, and Home Depot's stock picked up 
$2.375 a share to close at $44.375 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has opened 58 new stores and increased overall selling space by 
34% since the end of the second quarter of 1993.

<P>
 "It will definitely have a chilling effect," said Tommy Thompson, president of 
the National Assn. of Home Builders, referring to the rate increase engineered 
by the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday, the fifth this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 4.7% 
in July, the Fed announced the latest rate increase, which it said is designed 
"to keep inflationary pressures contained and thereby foster sustainable 
economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said the move is "expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to 
meet the objective of sustained, non-inflationary growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage rates mimicked earlier Fed moves, rising from an average of 7.14% in 
February, when the Fed first acted, to 8.62% in July. An increase in rates from 
7% to 9% would add $209 to the monthly payment on a $150,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without another rate increase, most analysts said, housing activity had 
already leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen the peak of housing activity for this business cycle," said Robert 
R. Davis, an economist with the Savings & Community Bankers of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson agreed. "The housing market is not moving ahead at a robust level and 
certainly not at the level of early this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second report Tuesday appeared to confirm the slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In its quarterly survey of regional real estate conditions, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. said the vigorous rebound in housing slowed over the 
summer, even though commercial real estate markets continued to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC's real estate index, based on a survey of 450 senior examiners and 
asset managers at federal regulatory agencies, registered 72 in July, down from 
the record high of 78 in April. Values above 50 indicate that more respondents 
thought conditions were improving than declining. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the Commerce Department said starts totaled 1.42 million at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate in July, compared to 1.35 million the previous 
month, when construction fell 9.4%. But that was down from an average 1.44 
million rate for the April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, starts jumped 14.1% in the Midwest to a 340,000 rate and 12.5% in 
the West to 361,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But they fell 10.3% in the Northeast to a 122,000 rate and 0.7% in the South 
to 592,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The July advance was concentrated in the often-volatile apartment sector, 
which jumped 18.7% to a 222,000 rate after plunging 35.7% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest-sensitive single-family sector rose just 2.5%, to a 1.19 million 
rate, the first increase in four months. Single-family construction represents 
about 85% of total housing starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, starts in the first seven months of the year were 16.3% above those of 
the same period in 1993. Starts totaled 1.29 million in 1993 and many analysts 
expected them to total about 1.40 million in 1994 if rates change little in the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for building permits, often a barometer of future activity, rose 
2.1% in July to a 1.34-million annual rate. But this advance also was 
concentrated in the multifamily sector. Single-family applications were down 
1.7%, the second straight monthly decline. Housing Starts

UNITED TO INCREASE WORK FORCE BY 1,700; AIRLINES: THE CARRIER SAYS MOST OF THE 
HIRES WILL BE FOR UNDERSTAFFED RESERVATIONS CENTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 United Airlines, turning against a layoff trend among its chief rivals, said 
Tuesday that it plans to add or recall about 1,700 workers nationwide by year's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest airline needs more people, partly to staff its new United 
Shuttle short-haul service that starts in California and other Western states 
Oct. 1. But the new jobs will largely fill employment gaps throughout United's 
system to help the carrier handle recent gains in passenger traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it imposed a hiring freeze four years ago, United said, it has become 
understaffed from attrition and layoffs. The airline has 75,500 employees 
worldwide, down from a peak of 85,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 United, the primary unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp., said it did not have a 
geographic breakdown of its hiring plans. But it said about 1,200 of the jobs 
will be in its reservations centers, one of which is in Los Angeles. United 
also needs to add 140 pilots and 240 flight attendants and plans to recall 175 
mechanics in San Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 United's announcement is one of the few bullish developments in an otherwise 
grim employment situation in the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always great news when an airline decides to hire people, particularly 
these days," said Michael Boyd, president of Aviation Systems Research Corp., a 
consulting firm in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other carriers, such as Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, have 
slashed jobs recently to cut expenses, mainly to better compete with 
flourishing low-cost, low-price rivals such as Southwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, United's Shuttle is aimed at helping the airline cut into Southwest's 
strong presence in California. United launched plans for its short-haul service 
after receiving major labor concessions from its pilots and mechanics. They and 
other employees, except for the flight attendants, in turn acquired 55% of the 
company's stock last month, making UAL the country's biggest employee-owned 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 But United signaled that it also was losing some customers because of service 
problems related to insufficient staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 While controlling costs is "still a priority, we can't afford the loss of 
revenue that results when staffing shortages make it difficult for customers," 
UAL Chairman Gerald Greenwald said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said United's reservations service in particular needs help. "If you like 
being on hold listening to elevator music, that's the number to call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 United spokesman Joe Hopkins acknowledged that there is "a lot of pressure on 
our reservations offices all over the country. We're trying to meet that demand 
by adding people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new pilots and flight attendants, meanwhile, will be needed to 
staff new aircraft United is receiving this year and next.

COMPUTER KEYPADS TO GET WARNINGS; CONSUMERS: TWO LEADING MAKERS WILL EMPHASIZE 
RISK TO ARMS, WRISTS. INJURY LAWSUITS MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday that it will put warning labels on computer 
keyboards directing people to read a safety guide that offers tips on avoiding 
hand and wrist injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. will also place warning labels on a specially designed 
keyboard it will begin selling in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies will become the first to state clearly that there is risk of 
injury from keyboard misuse or too much typing. There was no immediate sign 
that other computer makers would join them. 
</P>
<P>
 The labeling announcements raise the profile of a health issue confronting the 
computer industry. Dozens of manufacturers, including Compaq, are defending 
themselves in lawsuits brought by people who have suffered wrist or arm 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue in many of the suits is whether people were adequately 
warned about the potential for harm. Injuries can range from simple soreness to 
swelling that damages nerves in the wrist, a condition known as carpal tunnel 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 A partner in a New York law firm representing 2,000 plaintiffs in keyboard 
injury cases praised Compaq and Microsoft, but said the size and placement of 
the labels would make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact some of these companies may be waking up to the interest in warning 
people is a very positive development," said Robert Komitor, partner at Levi, 
Phillips and Konigsberg. "Time will tell whether these warnings are adequate or 
whether they're to avert litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq will place on top of the keyboard a sticker bearing the message: 
"Warning! To reduce risk of serious injury to hands, wrists or other joints, 
read Safety & Comfort guide." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which was the leading seller of personal computers in the first 
half of this year, has included a booklet of safety tips with each computer 
since 1991. It said it will have a new version of that booklet ready when the 
warning labels go out in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it visible to the user that there's a document there that they 
ought to see, or that they're missing and can request," said John Rose, senior 
vice president of Compaq's desktop division. He said the company was not 
reacting to litigation, and declined to discuss what the legal ramifications 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq earlier this year won a lawsuit brought by Patsy Woodcock, a Houston 
secretary who claimed that injuries caused by typing left her unable to work. 
Compaq argued that information available in 1988, when Woodcock began working 
on the keyboard, did not warrant such a warning.

BUCKING RISING MORTGAGE RATES; HOMES IN STATE MORE AFFORDABLE THAN 3 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Even with a recent rise in mortgage interest rates, housing in California is 
more affordable now than three years ago, with Los Angeles County showing the 
most improvement in the state, according to a study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical California homeowner now spends 43.9% of his or her gross annual 
income on mortgage payments, TRW Redi Property Data reported. That compares to 
46.5% in 1991. "Although home mortgage rates are increasing, they are still at 
lower levels than three years ago," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with the 
Riverside-based real estate data company. "That's helped affordability." 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors contributing to greater affordability include a reduction in 
home prices during the real estate downturn and rising income levels, said 
Nattagh, whose company tracked housing affordability in 47 California counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Los Angeles County is still one of the state's least affordable regions 
for home ownership -- No. 43 out the 47 counties surveyed -- the typical buyer 
in the county can expect to spend 43.2% of his or her annual income on a 
mortgage now, compared to 53.1% in 1991. That change was the biggest of any 
area surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County ranked 36th, with mortgage payments accounting for 41.0% of 
income. The size of an average mortgage, however, increased to $187,060 from 
$184,311 -- the largest in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to an average mortgage of $157,681 in the state now, up from 
$155,784 three years ago. The average mortgage in Los Angeles fell slightly to 
$172,249, compared to $175,886 three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Orange County, you will see that the average size of a 
mortgage is higher," Nattagh said. "But if you take into account the income 
levels, it becomes more affordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County ranked No. 41 in the new study, and San Diego County was No. 
42. In both areas, homeowners can expect to spend 42.4% of their incomes on 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Home ownership in the Inland Empire is much more affordable, TRW found, with 
San Bernardino County ranked No. 11 and Riverside County No. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous studies, the latest TRW report listed San Francisco as the most 
expensive place in the state to buy a home, with buyers there setting aside 
54.1% of their income for a mortgage. Still, that was a significant improvement 
from three years ago, when San Francisco buyers were spending 63% of their 
annual income on mortgage payments, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 If interest rates continue to rise, Nattagh said, California's housing 
affordability could quickly return to levels of three years ago, when the 
average statewide rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 9.25%. It is now 
7.98%.

UP AHEAD: DREAM MACHINES MADE TO ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine going to a vehicle-ordering booth, selecting the color, body style and 
features of your new car and returning three days later to take delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound far-fetched? Not in the brave new world of "agile manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers, armed with powerful computers capable of transmitting data from 
dealerships to the assembly line floor in a microsecond, are starting to talk 
about a new era in which flexible assembly operations would build highly 
specialized vehicles in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound like a car shopping fantasy, but in today's market of 
personalized license plates, individual greeting cards and fast-food 
restaurants that allow shoppers to have it their way, auto makers say the 
"virtual automobile" may be an idea whose time has finally come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agile enterprise concept seeks nothing less than to redefine the 
automobile and the automotive industry," Kenneth Baker, head of General Motors 
Corp.'s Research and Development Center, told reporters at a recent industry 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years of high-volume, long model runs or high-volume, long part runs are 
probably starting to go away," Baker said. "We're going to have to be more 
competitive at lower volumes." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current production system, car makers can alter a vehicle's 
appearance by adding a second pair of doors or tacking on a few options. But 
for the most part, buyers are limited to a handful of option packages that can 
be installed on a car without slowing the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by working closely with suppliers, Baker said, GM can expand the 
options to include things such as personalized seat covers, dashboard displays 
and an almost endless choice of colors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you're an avid tennis fan, you could have a picture of 
yourself playing tennis sewn right into the seat cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Baker said, most of the customizing choices would be confined to 
interiors. Over time, car buyers could have steering, suspension and braking 
systems tailored to their personal habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we get more software and computer control into the car, we can program it 
more personally in those areas that differentiate it," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But assembly plants would have to be extremely efficient to make sure all the 
parts arrived in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say for a moment that all Chrysler's component and assembly plants were 
tooled as equipped to handle this kind of flexibility," said Dennis Pawely, 
executive vice president of manufacturing at Chrysler. "We'd still have to rely 
on the supply community, which provides about 70% of content. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we realistically take suppliers who are on a just-in-time delivery 
schedule today and say that now you are going to deliver against a 'real time' 
order and inventory system and expect them to succeed? Probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 GM's Baker acknowledged that the "virtual car" is still more than a few years 
away, but he said some car makers are already offering personalized features in 
efforts to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's market, and in the future, you have to excite the customer about 
the product you sell," he said.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; DARWINIAN SOFTWARE BEING 
TESTED AS SURVIVAL AID IN INVESTMENT JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks, bonds or Treasury bills? Charles Darwin's theory of evolution -- of 
all things -- might just have some answers to this perennial investment 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment managers are experimenting with computer software that runs 
investment possibilities through a simulation of natural selection, complete 
with mutation, crossover and that all-time favorite, survival of the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
 The software uses a set of mathematical techniques known as genetic 
algorithms. Long employed in computer science and the development of artificial 
intelligence for military applications, they have only recently begun to 
trickle into the world of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bizarre-sounding stuff," admits Richard Bauer Jr., a professor of 
business administration at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, whose recently 
published "Genetic Algorithms and Investment Strategies" is the first book on 
the subject. "But the power of being able to search huge numbers of trading 
possibilities in an efficient manner is mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 The interest in genetic algorithms comes as Wall Street professionals are 
relying more and more on computers' processing power to develop market-beating 
investment strategies and new types of financial products. Many of these 
high-tech money management techniques carry big risks -- just ask Procter & 
Gamble, Bankers Trust and others that have lost hundreds of millions of dollars 
on computer-generated "derivatives" instruments. But there may be big rewards 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 First Quadrant Corp., a Pasadena-based investment firm, was one of the first 
to apply the computerized Darwinism, using the software to develop investment 
models for the approximately $5 billion in funds it manages. 
</P>
<P>
 David Leinweber, the firm's director of research, says genetic algorithms have 
made his clients an additional $25 million since he started incorporating them 
into his investment modeling strategy over the last year -- an incremental 
return of 0.5%. He estimates the algorithms have increased the predictive power 
of his model by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The genetic algorithm starts with your ideas and expands upon them and 
combines them in ways that produce investment forecasting models which are 
better than what we started with," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Rand Corp. scientist, Leinweber became interested in applying the 
algorithm software to finance when he was working at an artificial intelligence 
company in the early 1980s: "People started showing up from Salomon Bros. 
wanting to know what all this AI (artificial intelligence) stuff was about. 
They bought a ton of our software," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical use of the genetic algorithm might involve developing rules for 
building an investment portfolio. A series of different rules -- such as one 
designating all stocks with a price-earnings ratio of less than 15, or one 
picking stocks with an earnings growth of more than 40% over a given period -- 
are fed into the computer and played against each other in a first round of 
"natural selection," based on historical data. 
</P>
<P>
 Like successful genes in nature, the rules that do well in the first round 
gain greater power and influence in the second round. Then there is the 
mutation process, in which some rules are randomly zapped to diversify the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossover," the biological process in which a pair of chromosomes come 
together and then break apart, each taking part of the other, is also 
replicated in the program -- a process that aims to create new and better 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the population converges, leaving one rule that -- if all has gone 
well -- will be the single best rule of the millions of computer-generated 
possibilities. Darwinian selection might take millions of years, but the 
genetic algorithms can be played out in a few hours on a powerful personal 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast PCs and low-cost computer workstations are now being used to try out a 
wide variety of esoteric investment strategies based on computer science 
concepts such as neural networks, chaos theory and expert systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic algorithms have yet to be widely tested as an investment tool. But 
as to why and whether they work, Bauer takes the cosmic view: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's almost a fundamental question of life there," he muses. "To say why 
does the whole process of evolution seem to work as well as it does -- I don't 
know. It's really just a mathematical technique for finding solutions to large, 
complex problems. And whether it's an investment problem or an engineering 
problem or species evolution doesn't really seem to matter."

 Adams' e-mail address is printed on the daily strip, and he generally receives 
at least 50 messages a day. Dilbert is also distributed electronically on the 
Internet -- the first syndicated strip to be made available in this manner. 
</P>
<P>
 (Net users with Mosaic can go to the GNN 
URL:http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/GNNHome.htm. It's also available on America 
Online.) 
</P>
<P>
 While Dilbert's popularity arose from his acerbic take on engineers and 
technology, his merciless parodies target broader aspects of corporate life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What were the origins of Dilbert? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Dilbert originally was just a doodle. He was a composite of my co-workers 
at a big bank that I worked at in San Francisco. He kind of formed over time, 
with no thought that he would ever be a commercial enterprise. That came later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Had you done any kind of artwork before that or had any training in art? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was once turned down by the Famous Artists School, a correspondence 
course. They turned me down because I was 11 years old at the time and you had 
to be 12 years old to be a famous artist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long was it from the time that you started doodling to the time you 
decided, "Hey, I think these are marketable." 
</P>
<P>
 A: Dilbert kind of formed in 1986 or so. He started taking shape in 1988, and 
I just got the bug and decided I wanted to try to be a famous artist again. 
Really I just wanted to get one cartoon published in one place in a magazine. 
That was my whole goal, and I didn't know how to go about that. (Then) I saw a 
special on PBS on how to be a cartoonist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Literally? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Literally. I came in and turned it on just as it was winding up, but I got 
the host's name and where the show was made, and I tracked him down and wrote a 
letter and said I'd like to be a famous cartoonist. He wrote back and said buy 
a book called the -- I guess it was the 1988 Artists' Market Book at the time 
-- and it tells you that you make photocopies and send them off to the 
syndicates. 
</P>
<P>
 I put all my samples together and mailed them off to the big magazines, and 
they mailed them back as soon as they got them with rejections, and I kind of 
just put it all away. It was a year later that the cartoonist who wrote to me 
the first time, his name is Jack Cassady, wrote back, and I hadn't even thanked 
him for the first time he gave me the advice. He said he was going through his 
files and saw my samples that I'd sent him, thought they were good and wanted 
to make sure that I hadn't given up. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought, "Gosh, I'm not going to be rejected by these mere magazines when I 
can be rejected by major cartoon syndicates." So I put together my samples and 
sent them off to the syndicates, and actually after the first one rejected me 
and told me to take art classes, United Media called and offered me a contract 
over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The original name was Dilldog, actually, but I changed it for submission to 
the syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you put your e-mail address in your strip? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It had to do with my business school training, oddly enough. That is kind 
of the basic thing you need to do for any successful business -- you need to 
tap into your customers and change your product based on what they like and 
don't like. As a cartoonist, it's the only form of business I know where you're 
so far removed from your customer you have no feedback. I thought it would just 
be fun, but I also wanted ideas from people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So people are saying, "I like this, I like that"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, and they're also saying "I don't like this," and I listen to that as 
well. Right now I have the only interactive cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Dilbert can be quite cutting and, at times, almost subversive. Do you have 
any sense of wanting to bring a message or make a comment with Dilbert? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are kind of two questions there. One is my intent. My intent is to 
earn a comfortable living in a job that I can do in my pajamas. I'm not out to 
change the world or make anything better. I wouldn't ever want to claim that. 
There is, however, a philosophy or an underlying theme in everything that I 
draw, and the theme is that people are idiots, and I include myself in that 
category. Although we're all idiots, we're all idiots in somewhat different 
areas. I've got some few things which I can do well, but I'm a real idiot in a 
lot of other things. I just try to plumb that area where otherwise normal and 
intelligent people are idiots. It's really just that simple.

COMPUTER TRAINING FIRM IN SANTA ANA TO BE SOLD; TRANSACTION: NEW HORIZONS 
CENTER WILL FETCH $14 MILLION. THE INSTRUCTIONAL COMPANY BEGAN IN A STOREFRONT 
IN 1982 AND LATER SOLD FRANCHISES WORLDWIDE.

<P>
 A small Orange County company that trains business people to use computer 
programs said Tuesday that it is being bought out by a New Jersey firm for $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 New Horizons Computer Learning Center Inc., founded 12 years ago in Laguna 
Beach by Michael Brinda, has grown into a chain of computer instruction centers 
with total 1993 revenue of $22.8 million and 51 franchises worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinda, a former mainframe instructor for Sperry Univac, kept the original 
franchise and moved it to Santa Ana. It had revenue of $10.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the buyer, Handex Environmental Recovery Inc. in Morganville, 
N.J., said the company is looking to diversify beyond its environmental cleanup 
business, a field that is becoming increasingly competitive. John St. James, 
the company's chief financial officer, said there are no plans to move or lay 
off any of the 150 employees at New Horizons' Santa Ana office or at the other 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brinda, 40, the sale caps what he describes as an "exit strategy" he began 
when he started selling franchises in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Horizons offers training on personal computer programs such as word 
processing and spreadsheets, as well as networking and programming. Most of its 
students are enrolled by their employers, though last year about 10% were in 
government-funded retraining programs, Brinda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinda said he will stay on for a year as president of the company he started 
in 1982 after taking out a second mortgage on his house. He bought 10 IBM 
personal computers for $3,500 each, he said, and began teaching from a rented 
storefront in a strip shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has not had an unprofitable year, he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchises of New Horizons sell for about $250,000 each, with some variation 
depending on location. 
</P>
<P>
 Handex, which was founded in 1968 and began trading its stock publicly in 
1989, had 1993 revenue of $38.7 million.

 Cutting Interest Costs: To reduce interest costs of its Mello-Roos bonds, 
Orange County has quietly sold $240 million of low-interest debt to pay off 
high-interest debt sold by eight Mello-Roos districts in the southern part of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some of the bonds will pay for roads, fire stations and schools 
in planned communities in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the new arrangement slashes costs to the county by an estimated $11 
million, homeowners are not likely to see any initial tax relief, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello-Roos districts are created by local governments and impose an extra levy 
called a Mello-Roos tax on homeowners who live in the district. The money is 
used to pay for infrastructure improvements. Orange County has 16 Mello-Roos 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in Mello-Roos districts in Foothill Ranch, Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Coto de Caza and Mission Viejo should not expect to see a reduction in their 
payments, at least not yet, said Eileen Walsh, director of finance for the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in Coto de Caza might even see Mello-Roos rates go up because of 
the financing arrangement, said Peter Conlon, senior staff analyst for Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will have an eventual effect on their Mello-Roos taxes. But it will be 
different for each district, depending on several issues." Conlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bonds, sold on Aug. 5 at a 5.96% interest rate, will retire Mello-Roos 
bonds carrying interest rates of more than 7%, according to Securities Data Co.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; PROPERTY AUCTIONS REMAIN A POPULAR MARKETING TOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After gaining popularity during the real estate downturn, property auctions in 
Orange County continue to be an attractive selling tool during the recovery, 
brokers say. 
</P>
<P>
 SperryVan Ness, a Newport Beach real estate brokerage, announced Tuesday that 
it has combined forces with an Alabama auction company to sell retail, 
industrial, apartment and commercial properties, as well as undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auctions are becoming a viable marketing alternative that provides quick and 
efficient disposition of property, saves long-term holding costs and results in 
the best net profit for the seller," said Mark Van Ness, CEO of the brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 With Alabama partner J.P. King Auction Co., SperryVan Ness will hold its first 
auction Nov. 5 at the Sheraton Los Angeles Airport Hotel. About $50 million in 
property is expected to change hands.

LOOK IT OVER, US FACILITIES TELLS FIDELITY; ACQUISITIONS: HOSTILE BIDDER 
INVITED TO CHECK BOOKS AND MEET MANAGEMENT TO SEE IF IT WANTS TO SUBMIT A 
DEFINITIVE OFFER.

 US Facilities Corp. said Wednesday that it would allow hostile bidder Fidelity 
National Financial Inc. to review its financial records and meet with its 
management so Fidelity can decide whether it wants to submit a definitive 
acquisition offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But US Facilities' latest action in response to Fidelity's $79-million 
takeover bid, first made in April, was met with skepticism by Fidelity.And it 
touched off another dispute in the prolonged battle between the two Orange 
County companies. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities, a medical stop-loss insurer based in Costa Mesa, said in a 
letter to Fidelity that the Irvine-based title insurer would have 30 days after 
the delivery of its confidential financial information to submit a firm bid. 
George Kadonada, US Facilities' chairman and chief executive officer, said the 
board would carefully consider an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Willey, Fidelity's executive vice president and general counsel, 
said there were issues in the confidentiality agreement that came with the 
offer by US Facilities that need to be resolved. He declined to elaborate. US 
Facilities said it would not comment about its confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Willey also questioned whether US Facilities was sincere about addressing a 
shareholder resolution passed at its annual meeting in May to put US Facilities 
on the market, given that US Facilities' board concluded that a sale of the 
company at this time would not maximize shareholder value. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities' Kadonada said Tuesday that the board believes the company's 
value will be significantly enhanced in the future as it grows and 
restructures. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities' shares closed Tuesday at $12.50, down 43.75 cents in Nasdaq 
trading. Fidelity's shares were unchanged at $11.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

2 FIRMS ADOPT LABELS WARNING COMPUTER USERS ABOUT DANGER OF INJURY; TECHNOLOGY: 
COMPAQ, MICROSOFT ARE THE FIRST TO STATE THAT HARM COULD COME FROM KEYBOARD 
MISUSE OR TOO MUCH TYPING. SAFETY GUIDES PROVIDE USERS WITH TIPS. 
</P>

<P>
 Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday that it will put warning labels on computer 
keyboards this fall, directing people to read a safety guide with tips to avoid 
hand and wrist injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. also will place warning labels on a specially designed 
keyboard it will begin selling in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies would become the first to clearly state there is a chance for 
injury from keyboard misuse or too much typing. There was no immediate sign 
that others would join them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the labeling raises the profile of a health issue confronting the computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of manufacturers, including Compaq, are defending lawsuits brought by 
people who have suffered wrist or arm injuries. In Orange County, computer 
industry officials said the issue of keyboard design was not a main concern of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not something that's at the top of the list as far as things 
customers ask about," said David Dukes, co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc. in 
Santa Ana, one of the nation's largest personal computer and components 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dukes said he had "never encountered a single incident" of a customer 
expressing concern over stress related to keyboard use. "We talk to customers 
and focus groups, and we hear about features . . . like design and layout," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Ingram Micro and at Toshiba America Information Systems Inc.'s 
computer manufacturing division in Irvine said they have not faced any lawsuits 
from users alleging stress injuries related to keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue in many suits is whether people were adequately warned about 
the potential for harm. Injuries can range from simple soreness to a tissue 
swelling that harms nerves in the wrist, a condition known as carpal tunnel 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 A partner at a New York law firm that represents 2,000 plaintiffs in keyboard 
injury cases praised Compaq and Microsoft but said the size and placement of 
the labels would make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact some of these companies may be waking up to the interest in warning 
people is a very positive development," said Robert Komitor, partner at Levi, 
Phillips and Konigsberg. "Time will tell whether these warnings are adequate or 
whether they're to avert litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq's sticker will be on top of a keyboard with the message: "Warning! To 
Reduce Risk of Serious Injury to Hands, Wrists or Other Joints, Read Safety & 
Comfort Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, the leading seller of personal computers in the first half of 
this year, has included a booklet of safety tips with each computer since 1991. 
It will have a new version of that booklet ready when the warning labels go out 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it visible to the user that there's a document there that they 
ought to see or that they're missing and can request," said John Rose, senior 
vice president of Compaq's desktop division. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company was not reacting to litigation and declined to discuss 
what the legal ramifications may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq earlier this year won a lawsuit brought by Patsy Woodcock, a Houston 
secretary who claimed that typing injuries left her unable to work. During the 
trial, Compaq argued that information available in 1988, when Woodcock began 
working on the keyboard, did not warrant such a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq said Tuesday that there is still no scientifically established link 
between keyboard design and injuries. But it cited growing evidence, chiefly in 
news accounts, that typing with hands in awkward positions or for a long time 
can be harmful. So, the company said, it wanted to draw more attention to the 
safety guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodcock's attorney, Mark Collmer, said, "If nothing else, it is an 
acknowledgment of the problem and it is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has built a healthy side business in computer accessories, such as 
an ergonomic mouse control. It will soon sell an angled keyboard with a special 
wrist rest and slanted keys designed to be more comfortable. Its warning label 
will also direct customers to a safety guide, said Debra Johnson, a Microsoft 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, for years the leading maker of PCs, incorporates software with ergonomic 
information in its machines. It has no plans for warning labels, spokesman 
Peter Thonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other PC makers declined immediate comment on keyboard labeling.

PACIFIC NAMES SHERYL STAPLES TO CONCERTMASTER POST; MUSIC: CARL ST.CLAIR CITES 
A STRONG CONNECTION WITH THE 25-YEAR-OLD L.A. VIOLINIST, A 10-YEAR VETERAN WHO 
HOPES TO 'PUT A MARK' ON PSO. 
</P>

<P>
 Sheryl Staples, a 25-year-old violinist from Los Angeles, will take over as 
concertmaster of the Pacific Symphony on Oct. 1. Her appointment, announced 
today, fills a critical position left vacant when Endre( Granat resigned last 
year after 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 While not unprecedented, the appointment of someone of Staples' age is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though she is relatively very young, she has been playing concertmaster 
roughly half her life in various orchestras," PSO music director Carl St.Clair, 
who chose Staples, said this week from New Zealand, where he is conducting two 
programs with the Auckland Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair said Staples' 10 years of experience as a concertmaster most recently 
has included 4 1/2 seasons with the Santa Barbara Chamber Orchestra and two 
seasons with the Japan America Symphony in Los Angeles. Staples said she plans 
to step down from both positions to concentrate on her work with the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestra administrators would not reveal the length or other terms of her 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair said he picked Staples from nine finalists after a yearlong 
international search. Each finalist had been a guest concertmaster with the 
orchestra last season at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt a very strong musical connection with her," St.Clair said. "She 
has an uncanny ability to read the gestures of a conductor in a nonverbal way 
and communicate them to other musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking forward to the opportunity of working with the musicians 
and with Carl," Staples said from La Jolla, where she was playing in the 
Summerfest Chamber Music Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "A concertmaster or a section leader can put a mark on that section of the 
orchestra. That's something I hope to contribute to the violin section in 
particular." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A student of Robert Lipsett from the age of 9, Staples teaches violin at USC, 
where she received the first and, so far, the only Artist Diploma, a 
specialized performance degree, in 1991. Until a year ago, she was a member of 
the Southwest Chamber Music Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to playing with the Pacific in Costa Mesa last season, she joined 
the orchestra as concertmaster for one of its concerts at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre last summer and played in a Pacific chamber music program in 
February at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 She since has formed a trio with her colleagues for the museum program, 
pianist John Novacek and Pacific Symphony principal cellist Timothy Landauer, 
an association she plans to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be the 15-year-old orchestra's fifth concertmaster, having been 
preceded by Madeleine Schatz, John Sambuco, Israel Baker and Granat. 
</P>
<P>
 Staples plays a 1720 Guarnerius "del Gesu" violin, on loan from a private 
owner through an arrangement with the Stradivari Society of Bein and Fushi Inc. 
in Chicago.

CROSSINGS ON FOOT CONTINUE ON RAILS WHERE TRAIN KILLED 3 
</P>

 It was as if the gruesome deaths of three people hadn't happened a day 
earlier. Pedestrians on Tuesday were still taking the shortcut across a 
Metrolink track in Glendale, opting for convenience over safety, at the very 
spot where three members of a family were struck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit shaken," Rene Nettles, 27, said Tuesday as she made her 
way to work across the tracks where a 7-year-old girl, her mother and her 
grandfather were killed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sorry for the family," Nettles said. "But I just went ahead and took 
that chance. This way is faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 7 and 8 a.m., Nettles was joined by a dozen others who walked through 
a break in the fence designed to keep pedestrians off the tracks, which are on 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
 All made it across safely within a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Antonio Juan Pina, 79; his daughter, Maylem Blanca Villanueva, 
37, and granddaughter, Francis Villanueva, 7, were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the latest in a string of pedestrians killed by trains across the 
country as railroad use rebounds in crowded urban areas where it had faded from 
consciousness as a relic of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 523 pedestrians, joggers and bicyclists nationwide were killed by 
trains, 98 of them in California, more than twice as many as in any other 
state. In addition, 626 motorists were killed at highway rail crossings, 36 of 
them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, at least four people have been struck and killed by trains 
since April. Three were suicides and one was an accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
 On Easter Sunday, a thrill-seeking Buena Park teen-ager lined up on a trestle 
with friends, seeking to feel the rush of wind from a passing train. He died 
after he lost his footing and fell into the train. 
</P>
<P>
 The following month, in separate incidents less than a week apart, a 
28-year-old Laguna Niguel man and a 17-year-old Irvine girl committed suicide 
by placing themselves in the paths of passing trains. And last week, in Santa 
Ana, a woman killed herself by standing on a narrow railroad bridge and letting 
a Metrolink train strike her. 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable proportion of California's cases last year were ruled suicides. But 
the deaths have increased concern among federal officials over railroad safety, 
prodding Congress to address the number of rail-related fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians and motorists hoping to beat a train to a crossing often fall 
victim to the difficulty of judging the speed and distance of trains that 
travel at the pace of freeway traffic but appear to be going much slower, said 
Herschel Leibowitz, a psychology professor at Pennsylvania State University who 
has studied such accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make mistakes in judging large objects like trains," he said. "The only 
cue you have is the increase in size of the object," which appears to get 
bigger as it approaches, Leibowitz said. "And that really is a very poor cue. 
It increases very slowly, even at 60 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 And pedestrians often expect the trains to stop for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the responsibility on the trains. For some reason they assume the 
train will stop, but the train really can't do much about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a typical Metrolink train about a quarter of a mile to come to a stop 
from a speed of 60 m.p.h., Metrolink officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's accident, witnesses said, Pina, his daughter and granddaughter 
took the shortcut over the tracks to avoid the effort of climbing to a 
pedestrian overcrossing and then either ignored or did not hear the horn blasts 
of a southbound Metrolink train traveling at 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Although train horns are loud, the wind, surrounding noise or even an intense 
conversation can mask the sound of an approaching train, rail safety experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's doctor, Elizabeth Remedios, said Tuesday that the grandfather 
suffered from a recently broken hip, Alzheimer's disease and hearing loss, so 
he may have not known there was a train coming or could have been unable to get 
out of the way. Maylem Villanueva may have been distracted by the difficulty of 
dealing with both her father and her daughter, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine trying to get your father off the tracks. He might be listening to 
you but not following your instructions. And you are trying to get your little 
girl. And a train is obstructing your view," Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's deaths brought Metrolink-related fatalities to 21 since the service's 
inception in 1992. Nine of those deaths have been ruled suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials Tuesday stressed that their tracks are private property 
and that those killed while trying to cross them are trespassing. Since the 
rail service began, sheriff's deputies have issued about 3,000 citations and 
made 1,000 arrests, primarily for trespassing violations along Metrolink rights 
of way. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no warning signs are posted at the site of Monday's accident. The 
pathway across the tracks, leading from a sidewalk that runs right to the break 
in the fence, is virtually unobstructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is patrolled regularly, but keeping trespassers away is practically 
impossible, said Lt. Marc Klugman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department's Metrolink bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you fence the entire length of the track?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Metrolink erected a two-mile-long fence in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley to help prevent accidents along a seven-mile stretch where six 
fatalities occurred within 14 months. Since then, there have been no fatal 
accidents in that area, spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. But it has not yet been 
decided whether to expand the fencing project, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Fencing is not common in other parts of the country, according to the Assn. of 
American Railroads. Currently pending in both houses of Congress is legislation 
that would give incentives to local governments to close dangerous crossings 
and fund education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said Metrolink has been trying to educate the public in large part by 
distributing flyers to schoolchildren and residents living near the paths of 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are as best as possible trying to patrol the area and educate the 
community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Train accidents involving pedestrians or cars are sometimes ignored by 
national news organizations, which concentrate on more dramatic derailments 
even though non-derailment accidents account for 90% of all railroad-related 
fatalities, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derailments are very high-profile accidents," said the agency's Luis del Rio. 
"The daily story is actually the fact that every 90 minutes there's a collision 
between a train and a motorist." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Soper of Operation Life saver, a nonprofit organization based in 
Alexandria, Va., that promotes railroad safety, cited two accidents Aug. 3 -- 
an Amtrak derailment in New York with no injuries, and a collision between a 
freight train and a car in Wyoming that killed five teen-agers -- saying the 
derailment received more news attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and rail safety advocates blame many of the non-derailment 
accidents on a lack of attention to the issue in the news media and in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains are often portrayed in class and in the media as relics of the past, 
not as a mode of transport still in use, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all grown up with the railroads as part of our romantic and nostalgic 
past," with Rockwellian images of "a small boy with his dog walking along 
railroad tracks," Soper said."It tends to tell readers or viewers that this 
must be acceptable behavior."

KEY ASSEMBLY PANEL BACKS BERGESON'S 'ONE STRIKE' BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elbowing into a fray that has taken center stage in the governor's race, a key 
Assembly committee approved an Orange County lawmaker's bill Tuesday that would 
put first-time child molesters and violent rapists in prison for up to 25 years 
to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee endorsed the so-called "one strike" bill 
carried by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) on a 4-1 vote after a 
back-room deal was cut to tie the measure to sex-crime legislation carried by 
three Democrats and another Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, Bergeson was able to propel the measure through the 
Democrat-dominated Public Safety Committee, which has historically been a 
graveyard for GOP anti-crime efforts. The three Democrats, meanwhile, gained 
assurances that Gov. Pete Wilson will sign their measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her bill was watered down by the Public Safety Committee, Bergeson 
continued to portray it as the strongest effort to deal with sexual predators 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much relieved," Bergeson said. "I would like to have had a stronger 
bill, but under the circumstances, it's a very good bill and sends a tough 
message to sexual predators. It's probably the toughest in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson began carrying the bill at the behest of Wilson, who has made the 
measure a centerpiece of his election-year fight on crime. In recent weeks, it 
has sparked a bitter dispute between the governor and Democrat challenger 
Kathleen Brown over her support of the proposal -- or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aired a TV ad in late July portraying Brown as opposed to the "one 
strike" bill, which originally called for a blanket sentence of life without 
parole for nearly all perpetrators of sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown countered by calling Wilson's advertisement "a despicable lie," arguing 
that she dropped her opposition to the bill after it was narrowed in the Senate 
to affect only the most violent predators with a maximum sentence of 25 years 
to life. She aired two commercials accusing Wilson of lying about her position 
and "exploiting the pain of rape victims to cover up his failed record." 
</P>
<P>
 That war of words in news conferences and commercials grew out of an ongoing 
Brown attack on Wilson over her allegations that relaxed parole policies under 
the governor have improperly allowed dangerous criminals onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said he would sign a revised Bergeson bill into law if it passes 
this year but would continue to fight in the future for legislation that would 
send any convicted rapist to prison for life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 When first proposed, the bill called for a blanket sentence of life without 
the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses. That tough stance drew 
attacks from civil libertarians and other groups, including some district 
attorneys and women's organizations, who said the measure was so harsh it might 
actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 After an aborted attempt to push the measure through the Senate, Bergeson 
redrafted the bill to delete all references to life without parole, 
substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for most serious offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee narrowed Bergeson's bill still further Tuesday by 
requiring that only the most brutal sexual assaults -- those involving torture, 
mayhem, kidnaping or burglary with the intent to commit rape -- would result in 
a sentence of 25 years to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser crimes could still earn sentences of 15 years to life, but would have 
to include special circumstances, such as the use of a firearm or dangerous 
weapon, more than one victim or the administering of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 As now drafted, the bill applies only to "the worst of the worst sexual 
predators," said Gregory Totten, executive director of the California District 
Attorneys Assn., which threw its support behind Bergeson only after the measure 
was redrafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been substantially rewritten, critics continued to blast 
Bergeson's bill as overly broad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still is over-drawn," said Francisco Lobaco, American Civil Liberties 
Union state legislative director. "The courts currently do impose extremely 
long sentences" for sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, the penalties for various sex crimes range from three to 
eight years in prison, but many perpetrators are paroled after serving about 
half their sentence. Lobaco, however, argued that judges hand out sentences of 
more than 100 years for the most extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
 To push the measure through, Bergeson agreed to link her "one strike" bill to 
sex crime legislation authored by Assemblywoman Paula L. Boland (R-Granada 
Hills), state Sen. Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista), Assemblywoman Valerie Brown 
(D-Sonoma) and Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), the committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Assemblywoman Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) attempted to hitch a 
measure of her own to the "one strike" bill. Lee's legislation, which would 
require that state prisons offer rehabilitation to first-time nonviolent 
offenders, is opposed by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland lashed out at Lee, arguing that an attempt to link a measure opposed by 
Wilson to the "one strike" legislative package was "unfair, unconscionable" and 
"meant to kill this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee ultimately backed down, saying she had no intention of sabotaging 
Bergeson's bill, but wanted to "broaden" it some.

RAMS' HENLEY ENDS SILENCE ON INDICTMENT; INTERVIEW: PLAYER TELLS OF ANGUISH 
OVER DRUG CHARGES. HE INSISTS HE'S INNOCENT AND EAGER FOR HIS TRIAL TO BEGIN.

<P>
 They were there when he was 9 years old, the wind knocked out of him on the 
football field, crying. And they have continued to be there for him through 
high school, UCLA and on to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Saturday night, Darryl Henley had a request of his mom and dad: Don't 
come to my game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was terrified," said Henley, Ram cornerback and accused drug trafficker. "I 
didn't want my mom to sit up there and be subjected to whatever. My dad said he 
didn't care what people said, he had gone to all my games and he wanted to be 
there, but I couldn't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I was terrified about going to the stadium myself, about how people 
were going to react. I arrived, gave my name at the gate and looked at the 
people's expression. OK, it was positive, but how were the other 25,000 people 
in the stadium going to react? 
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of my car, there were people there for autographs. Do they believe 
you? Do they believe in you? 
</P>
<P>
 "The real true Ram fans sit in the end zone, just outside the tunnel, and I 
want to tell you, I felt fright. What were they going to say when I came down 
that tunnel? I remember coming out, there was nothing bad, and I know, because 
I was listening for everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted Henley last December on charges of cocaine 
possession and distribution. If convicted at his trial beginning Jan. 10, he 
could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum 
sentence of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains free on $200,000 bail. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue recently 
reinstated Henley, who had taken a leave of absence from football last October, 
and Henley signed a $350,000 contract to play again for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a negative thing with a majority of people," Henley said. 
"They're saying, 'How in the hell can this person look at himself in the 
mirror, not even give a reason to anyone for what has happened, and then just 
line up and play football like everything is OK?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to write with a can of paint on this big window: 'I am 
innocent.' I want to tell my story, but I can't. I feel that would be risking 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 10 months since Henley's problems became public, more than a year 
since the Rams became aware of his difficulties, and in all that time Henley 
has declined to explain himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has been made in the paper and I haven't said a word," he said. 
"Early on I kept asking my people, 'Can't I say something? Can't I? Let me 
explain to people.' But I had no idea how important it was for me not to say 
anything until it's time -- until the O.J. Simpson case. I wasn't convinced 
until then." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who faces two murder counts, agreed to speak with detectives without 
an attorney present early in the investigation. Legal experts say now that 
conversation might very well complicate his defense in next month's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew exactly what O.J. had to be thinking when he went in there and wanted 
to talk," Henley said. "That's what I wanted to do, but from a legal standpoint 
they criticized him, tore him up. Who knows what went on in there? Who knows 
what is going to be misconstrued? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what people say and I'd be just like that guy in Middle America who 
says, 'You got nothing to worry about if you're innocent.' But so many things 
you say can be misconstrued. I was eating in this restaurant and I ran into a 
judge who told me that he has had hundreds of thousands of people come through 
his courtroom. He said, 'I haven't seen one of them talk their way out of jail, 
but there have been several who have talked their way in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While in training camp, Henley continues to telephone his probation officer 
twice a week as well as meet him twice a month. Bail restrictions, which 
prohibit his leaving the federal Central District of California, will prevent 
him from playing in next week's exhibition game in San Diego unless the court 
rules differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorney, Roger Cossack, petitioned the court Tuesday to allow him to 
travel this season, and asked for a ruling before the Rams' game in San Diego 
Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's freedom and opportunity to play football raised the ire of attorneys 
for the other defendants in the case, who remain jailed, but Henley said he has 
received no special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told there are two reasons they don't give bail: If you're a danger to 
your community or a flight risk," Henley said. "I've never been a danger to the 
community, and now that God has delivered what I've asked, I'm not going to run 
from football. Why would I be so stupid after doing what I was supposed to do 
for the past 10 months?" 
</P>
<P>
 If Henley is not allowed to travel and play in half of the team's 
regular-season games, the Rams might have to release him. But then uncertainty 
has been a large part of Henley's life for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have I let people down?" he said, repeating the question. "I let myself down. 
This is what I worked for, then 30 days prior (to last year's training camp), 
it's almost smashed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let my parents down with the negative stuff. It doesn't matter what it is 
or in what context, they have to answer to it. I'm not saying by any means that 
I have done this, but it's just the implication -- it lets people down and 
hurts people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a federal affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana last October, 
federal drug agents said Henley and Tracy Donaho, a Ram cheerleader at the 
time, showed up on July 15, 1993, at the Atlanta airport to claim a suitcase 
containing 12 kilos of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Henley also allege that his Brea home served as a hub for 
a drug operation with distribution points in Atlanta and Memphis. Six weeks 
later Henley told Anaheim police that he was accosted at Rams Park by three 
men, one of whom displayed a gun. He said they took his car, which contained a 
loaded 9-millimeter pistol. Three men were later indicted on federal extortion 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "People believe what they read, but unfortunately believing what you read is 
not always the best policy," Henley said. "With the things that are written, 
it's hard to be objective. I don't blame people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared from the time I realized I was this person, this implicated 
person. But I also knew that, what with everything being said, they had the 
burden of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to work, he said, none of his teammates have asked if he is 
guilty or innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the coach (Chuck Knox) has something to do with that," Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because charges have been filed against him, he said, there will be many 
people who think there has to be some truth to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of overrides 'innocent until proven guilty,' " Henley said. "But 
then if this happened to somebody else, and I was paying money to watch 
football games and I thought football players were role models, I'd be saying, 
'What the hell is this person thinking?' That's what I would be saying without 
knowing any more details." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, he said, he had hoped to make this more than just a one-sided story. 
His trial had been scheduled for February, then postponed to May, again to 
August and now to Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was yelling at my attorneys, 'Why isn't this over? I need to get on with my 
life!' The only way for me to be functional every day was to hope I could come 
back and play football. Three times I tried to start working out, and I never 
could get past 10 days before quitting. I'd get myself ready and then the trial 
would be delayed, and it would just kill me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a friend, Ronald Knight, who would call every morning. 'Man, get up,' 
he'd say. And I'd tell him I don't want to get up. I would just sit in my 
attorneys' office. I had nothing to do. I tried blinking my eyes several times, 
but it just wouldn't go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley had been scheduled to go to trial next Tuesday, which would most likely 
have kept him from playing this season. The postponement to Jan. 10 was his 
first real good news regarding his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say if it never goes to trial you should be happy," he said. "I 
think in order for my life to go on, things have to happen in trial. Before, it 
was a day I wanted, but really didn't want. The reality of the situation is, 
hey, you can go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "After dealing with the reality and you have said you have not done this, then 
you have to be a tough . . . and fight this. I have to have that trial if I 
want to get things back to normal, well, halfway normal again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the government said for some reason, and God knows they won't, that they 
were dropping charges, that would do nothing for me. I don't want to risk my 
life going to jail, but this has to be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 If successful in defending himself, Henley was asked, will it be enough to 
restore his good name? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think historically it has ever been done," he said. "I've taken a 
sock in the ribs financially, but if I play well this season it can put me back 
where I was. I call that get-back, and it's a major motivation. For all the 
people that were hurt, including myself, I have a chance to get it back. But it 
has to be done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley will be an unrestricted free agent at season's end and, if he plays 
well and then is exonerated, he undoubtedly will command big money to play in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I can begin to piece my life together," he said. "Not put it back 
together totally, but piece it together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have stood by him from the beginning. They were aware of the possible 
charges against Henley in July, 1993, and allowed him to play on. He missed 11 
games after taking a leave of absence, but the Rams paid him his entire 
$600,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Shaw (Ram president) came to my room and told me, 'I know what you're 
going through. You're going to have good days and bad days. You're going to 
want to talk about it, but you can't. Period. Here's my home number, call if 
you need something.' That was July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "John told me it was going to happen. He looked me right in the eye and said 
it might not be what I want to hear, but the indictment is going to be handed 
down. He talked to me every week, and he said if my head was about to blow up 
and I needed time away he would talk with (Knox) and get me a day off. We 
weren't 14-2 or anything like that. He was taking care of me as a person. This 
wasn't some sort of football issue and that was important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the NFL reinstated Henley two weeks ago, he was free to sign anywhere in 
the league. He immediately came to terms with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Shaw after I was reinstated that you can pay me one dollar a week to 
play again. What he did was big. I had someone from another team, that was 
trying to sign me, said that any other team would have reacted the same way. 
Maybe on the surface, but there were things happening behind the scene. Chuck 
called to check on me, Joe Vitt, Rod Perry, George Dyer, all the defensive 
coaches called." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henley had kind words for his coaches, he concedes he returned to 
training camp with a chip on his shoulder. He blamed the media for listening to 
the government's side of the story, and took a confrontational approach with 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not function with all the emotions running wild inside of me," he 
said. "My mother was reading things about me in the paper. I was hating people 
for what they were thinking. That was my attitude: I don't care, I don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've learned a lot the past two weeks about handling situations I don't 
want to deal with. I'm not a jerk. I'm not walking around thinking this isn't 
any big deal and I'm gonna walk. No, no, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing everything within the confines of the (bail restrictions). The 
government people involved in this are not my enemies. People are just doing 
their jobs, and while that's not easy to accept, there's no reason for me to 
blast anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Assistant U.S. Atty.) John Rayburn went to my high school. When he graduated 
from college he got a law degree. When I graduated from college I became a 
football player. I'd rather have our paths cross at a Damien High School Alumni 
Assn. meeting, but that hasn't happened. These are the cards that have been 
dealt." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley said he was advised by friends and attorneys not to give this 
interview, but he said he wanted people to understand why things have happened 
as they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just like people to think about it," he said. "I want to address things, 
but if they were in my situation, and by God they don't want to be, they 
wouldn't do anything differently right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think, 'How the hell did I get myself into this?' But then that's a 
statement that can be misconstrued. Someone could come back in court and say, 
'What did you mean by that?' That's why I have to be careful. The safer version 
of that is, 'Why am I here?' That's it. Everything you've said you are held 
accountable for . . . there's so much I want to say, and I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he does get the chance to talk, though, he will do so for the benefit of 
12 people who will determine his fate: a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attorney says when I open my mouth about this case it will be to the 
people who count," he said. "But if any kid is going to get anything out of 
this, I'd tell them to beware, just beware. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just be careful. What does that mean? Just be careful."

ASSEMBLY APPROVES LIBRARY FUNDING BILL; LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE WOULD PERMIT 
LOCAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS, BUT REQUIRES VOTERS' APPROVAL OF LEVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County library supporters heralded Assembly passage Tuesday of a 
bill to provide a new funding source for their struggling institutions. The 
bill, which goes back to the Senate for final legislative approval before 
heading to the governor's desk, was adopted 45-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Library advocates said they will launch a new, aggressive phase of a 
months-long letter-writing campaign to persuade Gov. Pete Wilson to sign the 
bill into law. A similar measure last year produced an avalanche of supportive 
letters, but Wilson vetoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The present bill, authored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), 
permits local governments to set up special assessment districts for libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after voter approval would the library districts be authorized to levy 
charges on property owners. A typical library service charge on a single 
residence in Los Angeles County would amount to at least $20 to $25 a year, 
said Bill Siverling, Los Angeles County legislative representative. 
</P>
<P>
 In his veto message last year, Wilson said he refused to sign the bill because 
the library assessment would have amounted to an involuntary tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti agreed to several changes that he believed addressed Wilson's 
concerns. Among those was the requirement that the assessment district be put 
to the voters for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said the governor has not decided whether to sign the 
current version. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Betty Karnette (D-Long Beach), who led the effort for passage in 
the Assembly, said she believes public support exists for assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California State Library Assn., county libraries were among 
the hardest hit by the state's 1993 property tax shift away from counties and 
special districts and toward schools. A survey showed that many large county 
libraries throughout the state suffered a 50% loss in funding due to the 
property tax shift. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the shortfall in funding is expected to be around $32 
million this year, with costs exceeding revenues by that amount, Siverling 
said. Ten county library outlets, including a bookmobile that serves the 
farflung Antelope Valley, have shut down in the past two years. Some branches 
that used to be open all week are now open only 14 hours a week over two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down to the point where there's nothing left to cut," said David Flint, 
the county's assistant director for library finance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, while supporters await the outcome of the Roberti 
legislation, county officials have moved on another front in an attempt to 
obtain more funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system -- which serves 54 municipalities in addition to 
unincorporated areas -- is inviting cities to join the county in a separate 
community facilities district. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishing a community facilities district allows the county to levy a 
library services charge to homeowners without an election. Under such a 
district, homeowners pay $28.50 a year for libraries in their cities or 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 However, county officials prefer a countywide assessment district such as the 
Roberti bill allows, said Sandra Reuben, Los Angeles County's head librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the libraries considering the county's community facilities district was 
the branch in the City of San Fernando, where city officials decided this week 
against joining. Instead, they opted to put the matter on the ballot for an 
advisory vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Lancaster, on the other hand, approved joining the county in a 
community facilities district, said Reuben. It too, however, will put the issue 
on the ballot for an advisory vote.

HENLEY ASKS JUDGE TO EASE TRAVEL BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing his need to earn a living and avoid "a severe financial crisis," Rams 
cornerback Darryl Henley asked a federal judge Tuesday to ease a travel ban 
that restricts him to Southern California, so that he can play in games away 
from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion filed in U. S. District Court in Santa Ana by Henley's attorneys asks 
that he be permitted to travel to one preseason and eight regular-season games 
being played outside the local federal court district. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, indicted last December as the alleged leader of a cocaine-distribution 
ring that operated from his Brea home, signed a one-year, $350,000 contract 
with the Rams earlier this month, after the National Football League cleared 
him to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But a restriction of the $200,000 bail on which he remains free prohibits him 
from traveling outside the federal Central District of California, which 
encompasses Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In the motion being considered by U. S. District Judge Gary Taylor, Henley's 
attorneys said their client would suffer "dire (financial) consequences" if he 
is not permitted to play for the Rams this season. They have asked that Taylor 
rule on the motion before Aug. 25, when the Rams travel to San Diego to play 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Henley is facing a severe financial crisis because he was unable to 
compete last year," wrote attorney Gerald L. Chaleff. "If he is not allowed to 
work this year, he faces dire consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Henley was paid his entire $600,000 salary for the 1993 season, 
Chaleff said that Henley's inability to play in most of those games hurt his 
marketability this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "His value was diminished by at least $600,000 this year," Chaleff said. "You 
can ask anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U. S. Atty. Deirdre Z. Eliot said she will oppose Henley's motion to 
have the conditions of his bail modified. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we said before, we felt Darryl Henley's case was an appropriate one for 
detention from the outset," Eliot said. "We continue to believe that he is a 
danger to the community, and we would oppose his traveling with the team to 
ensure his future appearances in court." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Judge Taylor granted Henley permission to travel outside the district 
for four days to attend a family wedding in Waco, Tex., and prosecutors did not 
oppose the request. 
</P>
<P>
 But they did oppose another request by Henley to travel to Atlanta to oversee 
construction of a new home, because the indictment alleges that Henley arranged 
for a former Rams cheerleader to deliver a suitcase containing cocaine to a 
drop-off point in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys said they contacted a pretrial services officer last week 
about their client's latest request. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal motion quotes Jill McClain, the officer, as saying she had "no 
problem" with Henley's application to travel outside the district. McClain, who 
is handling Henley's case while his regular pretrial services officer is on 
vacation, declined to comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking permission for Henley to travel twice to San Diego, and once each 
to Atlanta; Tampa, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; Green Bay, Wis.; New Orleans; San 
Francisco and Chicago, Henley's attorneys said he typically will fly with the 
team from Los Angeles International Airport on the Saturday before the game and 
return on Sunday after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 For two of the games, however, he would have to leave on the Friday before the 
game and return Sunday. All trips are "highly regimented," the attorneys 
argued, noting they will be filled with team practices, meetings, games, 
curfews and bed checks. An Anaheim police officer travels with the team to all 
away games, they said.

HEALTH BILL MAY HIT HARD IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leading health plan being debated in Congress places a far weaker safety 
net under workers in Southern California than in other areas because it exempts 
the small businesses that account for an unusually large segment of the 
region's employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform proposal crafted by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) and endorsed by President Clinton exempts firms with fewer than 25 
workers permanently from any future mandates requiring businesses to help pay 
for health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Small employers are the primary engine of California's entrepreneurial 
economy, accounting for a greater share of the work force than in most states. 
They are particularly prevalent in Los Angeles and Orange counties, home to 
myriad tiny manufacturers, shops, restaurants, retailers and service firms, 
along with a growing legion of part-time and contingent workers who labor 
without health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation highlights a paradox of the health care debate: Often the 
workers who need coverage the most, because they have the lowest incomes, do 
not have insurance because their boss does not think that a small company can 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, such small firms frequently are unstable financially, 
often the newest companies with the most slender of profit margins and most 
likely to be staffed by low-paid Latino workers, according to the UCLA Center 
for Health Policy Research. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, many companies, both small and large, depend on part-time 
workers who are often ineligible for benefits, including health insurance," the 
center reported recently. "These conditions are becoming more widespread, and 
the trend has accelerated during the recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 31% of Los Angeles County residents currently lack health coverage, a far 
higher percentage than for the state (23%) and the nation (18%) as a whole, the 
center noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the center said, 24% of the population in 1991 and 1992 
lacked any sort of of health coverage. The Los Angeles County numbers are for 
1992 only. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton economist Anil Puri said that it makes sense that the two 
counties have more uninsured people than the national average: both have a high 
percentage of small businesses and self-employed workers who tend to lack 
medical insurance, and a low percentage of unionized workers, whose contracts 
usually guarantee health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles rate is probably higher than Orange County's because there are 
more poverty-level households in Los Angeles County, said Chapman University 
economist Raymond Sfeir. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the special nature of the Los Angeles economy, the fundamental 
objective of most health reform plans -- guaranteed coverage -- would be more 
of a wish than a promise for Southern Californians should Mitchell's plan 
become law. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a direct link between the size of a firm and the likelihood that its 
workers are covered. Compared to the rest of the nation, California workers are 
more likely to be self-employed or work at a small company and less likely to 
have health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles County firms with more than 100 employees, just 16% of workers 
lacked health insurance coverage in 1992. In sharp contrast, there was no 
coverage for 47% of the workers at the smallest firms, those with fewer than 25 
employees, according to the UCLA study. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Senate leaders and the White House to exempt small businesses 
from the mandate is a response to a hard-fought political offensive by 
small-business owners and their Washington lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Federation of Independent Business, with 600,000 members, has 
been an outspoken leader in the fight this year against President Clinton's 
proposal for employer mandates to guarantee coverage for all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the hottest fight in decades for the organization, federation President 
Jack Faris said recently. Federation opposition found strong, sympathetic 
support among many members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It now seems likely that this determined fight is tough enough to kill the 
House plan offered by Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), which makes 
all firms, regardless of size, offer health insurance -- with employers 
generally paying 80% of the cost of an average premium. Small companies, 
depending on their size and average payroll, would be forced to pay but would 
receive a financial subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to disarm small-business opposition, Mitchell then proposed that firms 
be given until the year 2000 to offer coverage on a voluntary basis. If that 
did not work, a mandate would take effect in 2002 in the states falling short 
of covering 95% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the mandate is triggered, firms with fewer than 25 workers would be 
left free of any government compulsion under his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the Mitchell bill had hoped that its voluntary approach, complete 
with financial subsidies, would spur even the smallest companies to provide 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 California already has been a pioneer among states with laws limiting rate 
hikes and forbidding insurers to discriminate against small firms. Yet the 
success of voluntarism in the state is modest -- about 250,000 previously 
uninsured residents get coverage each year, compared with a statewide total of 
5 million uninsured, according to Mark Weinberg, executive vice president of 
Blue Cross of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a voluntary system, and in a state that is still in a pretty 
disastrous economic situation, I think it is significant progress," Weinberg 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, through the Health Insurance Plan of California, offers low-cost 
coverage to firms with fewer than 50 workers. Tough negotiating by the 
insurance plan has helped drive down insurance premiums an average of 10% 
during the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 companies have joined the state insurance plan, and Blue Cross 
also has been signing up small groups at the rate of about 1,000 a month. But, 
disappointingly for those who hope for universal coverage without compulsion, 
only about 20% of the small firms working with Blue Cross or the public 
insurance plan are getting health insurance for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The uninsured in Los Angeles County are a large army, some 2.6 million people. 
And there is a great variation in ethnic groups, with 47% of Latinos lacking 
coverage, compared with 25% of blacks and Asians and 17% of Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
 A government mandate could guarantee that all these county residents are 
covered by insurance, but workers would pay the price in lost wages and 
sometimes in lost jobs. A law requiring companies to pay 80% of insurance costs 
could wipe out 100,000 jobs, while a 50% cost-sharing rule could eliminate 
60,000 jobs, according to a study by the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. 
think-tank, which will be published today in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when wages are already very low, in the range of $4.25 to $6.25 an 
hour, a mandate could actually wipe out jobs, the study said. The "working poor 
could end up paying most of the cost in the form of lower wages or lost jobs," 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 This situation creates a painful dilemma for policy-makers and members of 
Congress who want health care coverage for all Americans.

BIEHLS ARE BRIEFED ON PROGRESS OF SOUTH AFRICAN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South African justice minister and former boss of slain American scholar 
Amy Biehl briefed her family Tuesday on the trial of the three youths charged 
in her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Dullah Omar, who as the former director of the University of the Western 
Cape's Community Law Center oversaw work Biehl did on the rights of women and 
children, spoke to her mother, Linda, and sister, Kim, about legal issues 
surrounding the trial and amnesty laws he is drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman from Newport Beach, who was white, was stabbed and beaten to death 
by a mob of black youths shouting anti-white slogans while she was driving 
friends home to Guguletu township last Aug. 25, days before she was to return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Biehl came to South Africa as a Fulbright scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Biehl's family as "remarkably generous," Omar said: "They do not 
want revenge, they only expect that justice should be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Omar told the Biehls that he is writing legislation enabling perpetrators of 
politically motivated crimes to seek amnesty from prosecution and punishment. 
There has been speculation that Biehl's killers could qualify for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hearing Monday, the trial was recessed until Aug. 31, when Judge 
Gerald Friedman will announce whether statements the defendants made to police 
can be admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers contend that the defendants were assaulted and coerced into 
making statements implicating them in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manquina, 21; Mzikhona Nofemela, 22; and Vusumzi Ntamo, 22; all 
members of the black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress, have pleaded innocent 
to charges of murder, robbery and public violence in Biehl's death. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy will be tried separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men accused in the case were released on the first day of the 
Supreme Court hearing last November when a witness refused to testify against 
them. A friend who was in the car with Biehl when she was attacked testified 
against the defendants but then recanted after she was threatened. Two other 
young witnesses have failed to testify because of alleged intimidation.

FAMILY DOCTOR SAYS TRAIN VICTIMS WERE LAW-ABIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his later years, Antonio Juan Pina, 79, never lost his charm and 
thoughtfulness, even when his body and his mind faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Pina would visit his ailing wife in a convalescent home each and every day, 
according to his friend and longtime family doctor, Elizabeth Remedios. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she said, he had begun using a cane to steady himself when the long 
treks by bus and foot became otherwise impossible. He had broken his hip, had a 
hearing disability and increasingly debilitating Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Most times, he would be accompanied by his daughter Maylem Blanca Villanueva, 
who feared for her father's ability to fend for himself, and his 7-year-old 
granddaughter Francis. Too poor to buy a car, he had recently moved to a 
Glendale apartment next to that of his daughter so it would be easier for them 
to visit his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was to be an extra-special day: Not only was it Pina's birthday, but 
the birthday of granddaughter Francis as well, Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on their way to the convalescent home, the three were struck and killed by 
a Metrolink train traveling 60 m.p.h. Authorities said they apparently were 
trying to save time and effort by cutting across the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pina, his daughter and granddaughter never would have crossed the tracks 
had there been warning signs telling them it was illegal, or fences, said 
Remedios. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people, they were so tired of walking, they took shortcuts," said 
Remedios. "But how do they know it is illegal? There is no sign posted, they do 
not speak English and they are from a different culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Pina had come to the United States from Cuba, where people frequently cross 
train tracks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had there been a sign, they never would have crossed. And this never would 
have happened," Remedios said. "These are law-abiding people." 
</P>
<P>
 Remedios said she was upset by comments by Metrolink officials, who portrayed 
Pina and his family members as scofflaws trespassing on private property, where 
warning signs are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a stab in my heart," she said. "I loved these people."

INSIDE JOB; VALDIVIA ADAPTS TO ARENA SOCCER, THOUGH REAL MONEY IS OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia felt he had a future in professional soccer when his playing 
days at Cal State Northridge ended. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never expected his livelihood would depend on his ability to bounce 
balls -- and opponents -- off plexiglass walls in arenas throughout the 
country. Welcome to the Anaheim Splash of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia, however, has proved a quick study to the high-paced, frenetic game. 
Despite playing indoors for only two months, the first amateur selection of the 
Splash has made the transition well enough to become a contender for the CISL 
rookie-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the furthest thing from my mind," Valdivia, 23, said. "I was never 
really interested in indoors at all until this year. I've watched it on TV 
before, but I never pictured myself playing it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash, for the moment, is a good fit for Valdivia, one of three former 
Northridge players on the team. Steve McKenzie and Bobby Reyes are reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The CISL, in only its second season, has grown into the country's largest 
professional soccer league with 14 franchises. The Splash, formerly L.A. 
United, is one of the league's seven charter teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Matches are played on an artificial turf field with dimensions similar to an 
ice-hockey rink -- 200 feet long and 85 feet wide -- and surrounded by boards 
topped with plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike outdoor soccer in which teams consist of 11 players, indoor squads 
field six players. The game consists of four 15-minute quarters, and unlike 
traditional soccer that uses running time, the clock stops much like in a 
basketball game. The CISL ball is also smaller and lighter, measuring 25 inches 
in circumference, about three inches smaller than a traditional ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like black and white compared to outdoors," Valdivia said about the 
indoor game. "I still have tons of learning to do. The touch on the ball is 
different; you can't really kick it and you have to keep it close to you. 
There's a lot more individual defense and running nonstop." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 160-pound midfielder from Ridgecrest Burroughs High has 16 goals 
and 12 assists for the Western Division-leading Splash (15-6). He leads the 
team with two game-winning goals and three game-winning assists.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some players are better suited for indoors and I think he is," Splash Coach 
George Fernandez said about Valdivia. "He's got speed, skill and vision and he 
has a little bite in him -- the whole package. I believe he can be a superstar 
in the indoor game. It's just time, that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And money. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-paid players in the CISL earn between $2,000 and $3,500 per month 
for a 28-game regular season that runs from June through August. Reserves fare 
even worse, making as little as $75 per game depending on playing time. 
Valdivia, who has signed a one-year contract with the Splash, declined to 
reveal his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the outdoor American Professional Soccer League, players can earn as much 
as $60,000 for a 20-game schedule that runs concurrently with the CISL's. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries in Major League Soccer, a newly formed outdoor league that will make 
its debut in April with 12 teams, are expected to be higher than any previous 
professional league in this country. Valdivia, who is living in an apartment in 
Anaheim, said he is biding his time in the CISL in hopes of attracting an offer 
from the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main goal is to get to the MLS, but I'm comfortable right now and not 
complaining at all," Valdivia said. "There are a lot of doors that will open up 
if I continue to play well. There is tremendous talent in this league. Our team 
would make a great outdoor team." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia had offers from three professional teams in Mexico after his junior 
season at Northridge in 1992, but decided to return to Northridge at the urging 
of his father and Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret it," Valdivia said. "I stuck it out and that extra year of 
experience helped make me a better player."  
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia led the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation last fall with 20 assists 
-- ranking him second in the nation -- plus 17 goals and 54 points. He was 
chosen MPSF Pacific Division player of the year after leading Northridge (12-9, 
5-2) to its first Division I playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia, who is still a year away from a degree in kinesiology, left school 
after last season and moved to his birthplace of Guadalajara to pursue a 
professional career. He trained in Guadalajara with a club team for nearly two 
months without pay and wasn't offered a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great team and it's hard to get into," Valdivia said. "Most of those 
guys will be playing for the national team but I arrived in the middle of the 
season so they were reluctant to sign me." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia returned to Northridge in January after receiving an invitation from 
the U.S. National "B" team. He didn't play for the team, though, after it was 
learned that he is not a U.S. citizen. Valdivia moved to the United States with 
his family when he was 5 but only recently applied for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Mexico but I love this country and I would rather play here, 
indoor or outdoor," Valdivia said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Los Angeles Salsa of the APSL came knocking. However, the 
Salsa offered a two-year contract, and Valdivia, on the advice of Ass'ad, 
insisted on a one-year deal. Negotiations soon broke off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid is great and the bottom line is he can do things very few players in 
the U.S. can do," Ass'ad said. "God willing, everybody is going to see it. I 
told him don't tie yourself down or it will explode on you. It's a business and 
give yourself the freedom to look around after the season ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash had no objection to a a single-season contract and Valdivia's 
professional career began. His plans when the season ends?  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll sit down and talk," Valdivia said. "I love outdoor soccer, but indoor 
soccer has grown on me. I really didn't like it at first but I've tried to keep 
an open mind about it. It's been a lot better experience than I thought."

INITIALLY, O'LAUGHLIN SNEAKED UP ON NORTHRIDGE OPPONENTS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NOW 
HE'S GETTING ALL-AMERICAN CONSIDERATION.

 No sneaking up on anybody this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin appeared on the horizon less 
than a year ago, a gunslinger riding into a new town to prove he had the 
quickest draw. Didn't take long for him to make his point. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin, who transferred to Northridge from the University of Illinois one 
game into the Matadors' season, started playing the following week and picked 
up the offense on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fly could be the operative word this season. Behind O'Laughlin, named a 
preseason NCAA Division I-AA All-American by College Football Preview magazine, 
the Matadors possess one of the promising arms in the four-team American West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, latecomer O'Laughlin wasn't even mentioned in the media guide. This 
year, he's on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's healthy, he's the premier quarterback in the league," Northridge 
Coach Bob Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who welcomed 35 freshmen and transfers for orientation Sunday, 
begin two-a-day practices without pads today. The first practice in pads will 
be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors finished 4-6 in 1993 and tied for fourth in the AWC at 1-3. The 
opener is Sept. 10 at Boise State, another I-AA school. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin passed for 1,181 yards and nine touchdowns over parts of seven 
games before suffering a dislocated right shoulder and a rotator cuff injury 
Oct. 30 against Cal State Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent surgery to repair the rotator cuff Dec. 14 and wasn't given full 
medical clearance until July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 First order of business today is to gauge the arm strength of the 6-foot-3, 
200-pound senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says it feels pretty good -- and he's pretty reliable," said Burt, whose 
teams are 46-39 in his eight seasons. "When he said it hurt, it hurt. If he 
says it's OK, it's probably OK. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Burt will limit the amount of preseason throwing by O'Laughlin as 
a precautionary measure until the quarterback gets up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 AWC coaches, in a preseason poll, picked Southern Utah to win the conference 
title. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was selected to finish second, followed by Cal 
State Sacramento and Northridge. Southern Utah was co-champion with UC Davis 
last year in the conference's inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Davis is no longer in the conference.

CSUN LOSES WASHINGTON TRANSFER TO SAN JOSE STATE; BASKETBALL: MATADORS' CASSIDY 
SAYS ALLEN'S FAMILY WANTED HIM CLOSER TO THEIR HOME IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sam Allen, a University of Washington basketball player who said in April he 
was transferring to Cal State Northridge, has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He still is transferring -- but to San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Cassidy, Northridge's coach, said Allen's family wants him to attend 
school closer to home in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, but I understand his decision," Cassidy said. "I think he's 
doing what he is doing for the right reasons. I find no fault with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a 6-foot-7 forward, averaged 7.1 points and 3.6 rebounds in almost 16 
minutes a game last season. He started in nine of Washington's 27 games and had 
a best performance of 17 points and 14 rebounds in an overtime loss against 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 He must sit out this season in accordance with NCAA transfer rules and will 
have one season of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, 8-18 last season, almost took an additional hit of bad news. While 
on his honeymoon last month, forward Ruben Oronoz injured both of his knees in 
a jet-ski accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Oronoz, a 6-5 junior, missed all of last season rehabilitating from back 
surgery after transferring from Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy feared Oronoz's latest injuries also might require surgery, but Oronoz 
learned this week that would not be the case. Both knees were sprained. 
</P>
<P>
 Oronoz said he expects to be completely recovered by the time Northridge opens 
fall practice in mid-October. At Rancho Santiago, he averaged 16.2 points, 5.6 
rebounds and made 43.4% of his three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play exhibition games Nov. 19 and 22 before opening its 
regular season with a nonconference game Nov. 26 against UCLA at Pauley 
Pavilion.

THE SEVEN SEAS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BEACHES. LIKE MOM AND APPLE PIE, RIGHT?

 Behold! There, beneath a burned bush, in a charred swatch of scrubby 
landscape, lie an old towel and a partially melted zori. 
</P>
<P>
 Could these be signs of the elusive, possibly mythical Mentone Beach? 
</P>
<P>
 A trail marked with knobby motorcycle tracks leads through the skunk cabbage, 
yucca and rust-colored wild buckwheat to what may have been the shore -- a 
rocky mound overlooking a patch of jigsaw-puzzle mud, with fissures still moist 
at finger depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange dragonflies patrol the receding pool at eye level, while their smaller, 
iridescent blue brethren skim the scummy surface. Sheets of beige muck drape 
scraggly brush like furniture covers in the home of a long-hospitalized old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat pulses. Scan the horizon for other clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath big thunderheads, San Bernardino Mountain pokes up over rolling 
hillsides so dry they look as if they'll combust if two golden grass stems rub 
together. A head-high, gray flood control wall slices down the vast wash for 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the distance, Paul Bunyan, dressed in red shirt and blue cap, standing 30 
feet high, surveys the hodgepodge of rock and Gunite-covered levees, his 
12-foot-tall rooster friend perched on a nearby rooftop. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach, it might be said, is in the eye of the beholder, as much a languid 
state of mind as a swatch of sunny sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the search for Mentone Beach can be disorienting. 
</P>
<P>
 Head east on Highway 38, a few miles out of Redlands, and you begin to see 
equivocal indications: there's the Mentone Beach Christmas Tree Farm; there's 
the Mentone Beach Professional Building (a knickknack store and Jimbo's 
barbershop apparently its sole tenants). 
</P>
<P>
 Snapshots of locals preening with big tuna and bass cover the bulletin board 
at Green Spot Store, but the fish were all caught miles away, off better known 
California beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 On a post beside a case filled with slabs of beef jerky, faded fluorescent 
bumper stickers ask: "Where the Hell Is Mentone Beach?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have water and sand you have a beach," says Harvey Higgins, 46, from 
his bar stool at the town's cavernous Moose Lodge. "So what if Mentone's sand 
comes in boulder sizes?"  
</P>
<P>
 "A Brief History of Mentone" reports that the town, formed in 1886, "is just 
another gem that lends its luster to the thousands of others that make up the 
one and only California." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Higgins tells the tale -- "Shut up, Harvey" his pals interject from 
time to time -- Mentone has always been "the other side of the tracks" to the 
snootier residents of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the surf craze hit in the early '60s, some Redlands High students started 
getting tubed at Huntington and Laguna. The Mentone kids flocked to the 
percolation ponds that trap runoff, letting it soak slowly into the water 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, from March through May, folks from as far away as Yucaipa gather at the 
ponds to sunbathe, swim and drink beer. Jet Skis have even been spotted 
shredding the Olympic pool-sized ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 And the "beach" joke endures, finding its way onto refrigerator magnets and an 
entrepreneurial array of caps and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, Tom De Hart bought a joint called Dave's Place and turned it 
into the Mentone Beach Yacht Club, a friendly neighborhood bar with line 
dancing on the televisions, Van Morrison on the jukebox, and -- for a nautical 
touch -- an old oar over the door leading to the poolroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so often someone calls asking, "How much are your docking fees?" De Hart 
says. "I'll ask them, 'How big a boat do you have?' I'll lead them on for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 By midsummer, Mentone's percolation ponds vanish like mirages and beach-goers 
must quest farther up the massive wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the cops and cognoscenti know about the best beach spot now. 
</P>
<P>
 To get there, you hang a right at the old tractor, somewhere up near pro 
golfer Dave Stockton's spread, then wander a dirt road through orange groves 
watered from old concrete irrigation spigots. Down in the wash, a high dam of 
plastic sandbags holds back a deep pool, reached by an almost-elegant stairway 
of river rocks -- the work of local teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooking the pool, a palm-frond covered, lattice cabana the size of a bus 
stop shelters an old couch. Two beach chairs, a green velour chair with 
footstool, and a stone coffee table are arranged outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The weather today is as surprising as this little oasis. One minute, 
cottonwood leaves frolic in swirling dust devils. Then the wind that has been 
holding the smog bank back around San Bernardino delivers the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder booms. Raindrops the size of guppies pound down. The intoxicating 
scent of wet chaparral rises up and dominates the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Van Horn is an enthusiastic supporter of the self-defined beach scene. A 
yacht skipper by trade, his primary residence is Newport Beach. But his spread 
just over the Green Spot bridge is a local landmark of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer can in hand, the ruddy-faced yachtsman offers a tour, moving past the 
fiberglass bucking bronco and deer in the front yard into a tangle of rusting 
cars, trucks, trailers draped with old carpet and mattresses, motor homes, 
corrugated metal sheds, and a wooden barn decorated with everything from 
nautical memorabilia to the door of a CHP car. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the driveway, he points to a multilevel purple-and-white metal-flake 
rocket ship that was used in a Japanese movie. Nearby, an eight-foot-high 
Statue of Liberty head stares off toward the distant percolation ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge fiberglass rooster, he says, came from a topless-bottomless bar in 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stands on the leaky roof of his house, scanning the vast flood plain, 
Van Horn concedes that Newport is lovely. But Mentone Beach, he adds, is not 
without its advantages: 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine putting a 30-foot Paul Bunyan in your front yard down in 
Newport?"

COUNTY.) SOMETIMES THEY'RE HAVENS FOR STARS AND STARFISH, THE FISHING SET OR

<P>
 Day breaks on this reach of beach to the scuffing of joggers and rummaging of 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Bill Fischler shoves open the flaking door of tattered Patrick's 
Roadhouse and at 7:58 a.m., morning becomes official. 
</P>
<P>
 A jukebox that played in Ricky Nelson's den shuffles through a mongrel 
collection of 45s from "La Boheme" to Kid Ory and stops at Billy Eckstein. 
Fischler sings through an open window to deserted sand and his is a dreadful 
falsetto with a vibrato trapped in 72-year-old pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayend ooold man rivaah, he jest keeps roooling along. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The first customer is from a BMW and Malibu, headed for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good morning," greets Fischler. With a gentle bow. "Nice to have a rich 
person in the place. Tracey, dahling. Table number three on the right." 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes Jack Nicholson's daughter Jennifer, Mayor Riordan damp from 
mountain biking, and Hollywood Reporter columnist George Christy dictating 
morning items from a front booth and saying he didn't realize that Walter 
Winchell had the same habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, tourists from Italy, France and Ohio. In-flight magazines speak of this 
place. What the glossies don't say is that Fischler can chat them up in five 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 So unrolls every day at Patrick's, a dump diner that is Deux Magots in a tank 
top for Hollywood's lost and found generations; a mutt ugly hangout sharing 
local eminence alongside Musso & Franks, Lucy's Adobe, and Harold and Belle's. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a sacred relic of the solar-bleached, Hobie-riding, tummy-tucked, 
Vuarnet-wearing, volleyball-ing California beach scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Set where Santa Monica Canyon dribbles into the ocean, on PCH at the Pacific 
Palisades line, Patrick's metal is rusted black by decades of salt mists. Paint 
is gas chamber green. Misaligned building seams are tree rings. Here's where 
the old Red Car stop became Roy's Hot Dogs, which stretched into the Entrada 
Motel before being jumbled together by Fischler 20 years ago as Patrick's 
Roadhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Insides are no less chic. Furniture is antique and mismatched. Findings from 
Fischler's attic and leavings from estate sales form an eclectic decor that is 
early Sanford & Son with traces of Anglophilia. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu contradicts an area devoted to bodies beautiful and endocardial 
diets. The only salvation may be that Dr. Oscar Janiger, author of a book on 
alternative medicine, eats at Patrick's. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fare is 19 types of hamburgers with nobody holding the grease; 11 
sandwiches that will never see Wonder Light 9-Grain, and a short-order special 
of eggs scrambled inside a small hill of sauteed sausages, potatoes, peppers, 
mushrooms, onions, ham, tomatoes, bacon and whatever else the grocer delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 (Word to the unwise: This is called Bauernfraustuck, which means breakfast 
cooked by an Austrian farmer's wife. It is a passion of Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
friend of Fischler and the first person to lend a celebrity presence -- plus 
his mom's recipe -- to Patrick's.) 
</P>
<P>
 So food falls between boot camp and Denny's. Decor wouldn't slow those who 
brake for garage sales. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't explain what brought President Clinton here, and has Julia 
Roberts, Sean Penn, Ted Danson and Sylvester Stallone among its 
dressed-down-for-Sunday-brunch regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what the X-Factor is," says Mayor Riordan over orange juice and 
a banana cereal from South Africa. "Location? I don't think it's the food." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably is Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
 Part Curly Howard, part Noel Coward, Fischler is to Patrick's what Toots was 
to Shor's. Keeper of the protocol and personal secrets, Thalia and court 
jester. 
</P>
<P>
 Mein host likes to shock, likes to amuse. So he dresses in fluorescent 
T-shirts, baggy shorts and Fighting Irish knee socks. Hair is white bristles. 
Eyes always twinkle. 
</P>
<P>
 He fawns, but with irreverence. Not to be insulted by Fischler is to really be 
insulted. He never forgets a name and that makes unknowns feel like the famous. 
</P>
<P>
 And this blueblood from New York's Upper East Side, to California in 1962 via 
coffee plantation management in Africa, glows brightest at Patrick's, from 
opening to closing every day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking for the bathroom, honey? To the back, to the left, to the door marked 
'Pipi Room.' You do know how to spell, do you. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the jukebox is too noisy. If people have to talk real loud to be 
heard, they think they're having a good time. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He watches the eyes. He knows when to pull back, when to charm. He says he's 
never been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an exhibitionist, a frustrated actor," he admits. "To paraphrase 
Shakespeare: Patrick's is my stage and all my customers the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing gives me greater pleasure than standing by the 'to go' window, having 
strangers shout greetings and me waving like the Queen Mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I used to stand outside theaters on Wilshire Boulevard to see Zsa 
Zsa Gabor. Now she comes in here every Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the crisp character he has created, there is a private softness to 
Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
 After a divorce, he raised three sons and a daughter from nippers. He is never 
far from their successes or problems. Anthony and Clinton manage businesses. 
Tracey is lead waitress at Patrick's. Patrick, who gave the Roadhouse its name, 
is moving comfortably in show business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischler speaks great loyalty for the influential four who years ago added 
their push and presences to the place -- Ned Tanen, former head of Paramount; 
movie producer Steve Tisch; columnist Christy, and Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of them, a hot dog stand I bought for $2,500 just growed and growed," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischler excuses himself to greet an incoming quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 " Buenos dias. Como esta? From Mexico City? Where 4% of the population has 90% 
of the money. But what a good-looking sweater you're wearing."

<P>
 The cloud rolls in from the ocean like a long, thin tornado spinning 
maniacally on its side, wrapping around and stretching into the distance like 
the tail of a dark serpent. High above, a bird, possibly some sort of hawk, 
gracefully surfs the wind with awesome speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the serpent approaches quickly; the wind gathers intensity, 
pushing hard against my chest, and the temperature drops suddenly, practically 
stealing my breath. Cars pull to the shoulder as drivers are blinded by dust 
whipping across the Pacific Coast Highway at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The littoral serpent passes quickly, taking its lightning with it, and 
restoring the day to its morning calm. The ocean is a mysterious place. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know the ocean well. We are largely strangers, and I maintain a 
comfortable distance when I sit with a cup of coffee and read or write or watch 
for pelicans plunging into the surf. I did not grow up near so much water. I do 
not swim or surf or boat, so there is little chemistry between us, except that 
listening and looking at it prompts a sense of tranquillity, the same feeling I 
get when I lay upon the ground and see the stars above Colorado, where I am 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I live in Los Angeles, I sometimes drive to the ocean on Sunday 
mornings, when it is quiet and the streets are uncrowded. The quiet is why I 
go. From my apartment, I hear car alarms, sirens, helicopters and motorcycles 
that seem to scream in pain late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet of the beach is not silence, it is the music of leaves rustling in 
the night, a soothing song that flows gently from the harp. 
</P>
<P>
 At Point Mugu, there is a tiny beach reduced to the size of a small back yard 
at high tide. It is bordered by rocks good to sit on. Often there is someone 
fishing, which I find to be my only connection to the ocean. It is something I 
understand, and it brings memories to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up on a farm in Colorado, and when I was young and awakened to rain 
splashing against my bedroom window, I would anxiously rise to search out my 
father. If he was out in the fields, it meant not enough rain had fallen to 
stop our work. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he was digging worms, it meant the fields were too muddy, and so we 
went fishing. My father would drive, my mother would sit in the passenger seat. 
Because I was the youngest, I would be seated, without discussion, 
uncomfortably between my brother and sister in the back seat. I later learned 
that by feigning car sickness and threatening to vomit, I could sit in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we would fish streams and rivers, sometimes lakes. Our poles were 
old but for the most part functional, and we often caught fish. Only my 
father's pole was relatively new, and I remember thinking it was probably the 
most valuable thing our family owned. It felt good in your hands, like the 
steering wheel of a fast, new car. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the coast from Point Mugu, campers at Thornhill Broome Beach are packing 
up colorful tents as they wind down their weekends. Farther down, Mike Harris 
and Linda Geist are waiting for the waves to calm before recasting their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist grew up in Colorado. She, too, says she is connected to the ocean 
through fishing, but this is not fishing as I remember it. Geist and Harris are 
catching fish I have never heard of. Best bait, she says, is blood worms, mean 
and bitter creatures with sharp teeth. I have never heard of worms with teeth. 
There is strangeness to all this. 
</P>
<P>
 She wades into the water, casts, walks slowly backward and rests the pole 
against a forked stake pushed into the sand. This is the part of fishing that 
is most familiar to me: She sits in a chair behind the pole. And waits. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fish for trout with flies lay claim to artistic virtue, a sense of 
poetry and superior skill over those who fish with bait. It doesn't bother me 
that they think so, and perhaps they are right. But what I admire about those 
who fish from shore with bait is their patience. I think it is a form of 
meditation or at least introspection that has nothing to do with catching fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist, 34, and Harris, 39, have caught five fish since yesterday, one of which 
is the length of a finger and being used for bait. They are going to eat them 
when they get home. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris works in his father's business. Someday, he expects, it will be his. 
They sell and install communication systems in churches and truck docks and 
places like that. It's a lot of pressure being in business for one's self, he 
says. A lot of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Here he can unwind. Even if the fish aren't biting, it is pleasant and 
relaxing. Sometimes Harris and Geist play cards when the fishing is slow. They 
slept on the beach the night before and Harris worried about transients. Never 
had to worry about that when he was a kid. The world has changed, even here. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the beach, a man with bronze skin, big muscles and a tattoo is playing with 
his pit bull in the water. A woman with blond hair sits back by the rocks 
reading the newspaper. The man seems more interested in the dog than the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple guys with bodyboards are bobbing around in the water. On shore, 
umbrellas are springing up like colorful mushrooms, as the sky clears. 
Sailboats appear in the distance. Behind us, cars are arriving, their doors and 
trunks popping open practically before the cars are completely stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris and Geist say they will return home to Rancho Cucamonga before too 
long, after a couple more casts. Harris baits his hook and whips it toward the 
horizon, the lead weight breaking the surface with a silent plunk. 
</P>
<P>
 He backs away from the water, tightens his line and steadily holds his pole, 
the tip up high. He sits on the sand rather than the chair a couple feet behind 
him. In front of him is his pole, this mysterious ocean and many strange fish 
that are not hungry right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him is the rest of the world.

<P>
 I most certainly do call myself an Angeleno. But, I have to admit, I had to 
ask someone how to get to the beach -- more precisely, to the beaches where I 
spent cold mornings through much of high school, taking a run with one team or 
another, or simply taking five. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I know you just head west. . . . But I was looking for the exact spot, 
the lifeguard station, maybe a barbecue pit, something to summon something, to 
unlock some memory that would explain just why exactly I haven't put more than 
my tired feet in the sudsy surf in about 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reactions border on hot indignation. So why are you living here then? As 
if I'm taking up space from some unnamed soul who would love to have the ocean 
at his or her disposal -- on a whim or a dare. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach as summer ritual was never something I pined for. I don't sunbathe. 
But I love the water. I'm a swimmer who prefers the calmness of a pool just 
before dawn -- or, down to brass tacks, a mouthful of chlorine over the dirty 
surf. I've played volleyball, but I was recruited for my height rather than my 
prowess. And barbecue -- well the back yard or a grassy park, sans sand, will 
do, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Gliding along Vista del Mar, shooting off into the parking lot at Dockweiler 
State Beach, I find the strand with little problem, a parking place with even 
less. Monday, even during the summer, is a good day to come to the beach. It's 
relatively quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 I stick out like a toddler in a mosh pit. Under-schooled. Improperly dressed. 
Yes, in shorts and tank, but with socks and high-top cross-trainers. With a 
bag, yes. But not filled with sunscreen or a towel or a best-selling 
bodice-ripper . . . OK, it's my briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Making my way to a solitary spot near the birds, which seem to have scouted 
their places as carefully as the humans, I'd almost forgotten how 
self-conscious I feel parading past people lined up on their towels peering 
out. It's almost as if you are passing in front of the biggest screen on Earth, 
disturbing the show. 
</P>
<P>
 As I make my way north along the sand, sinking deeper with each step, it all 
starts to come back: walk on the wet sand and you won't sink so much.  
</P>
<P>
 Moving to the damp lip of the shore, I'm careful not to crush sand-kingdoms, 
not to get snagged in the tangle of beached seaweed, not to slide in jellyfish 
jelly, and to thread my way through Budweiser cans that have been resting in 
the sun so long that the labels have faded to yellow and green. 
</P>
<P>
 The scent of the water is metallic. Big freighters moored just south loom like 
a ship graveyard. Above, planes skid across airspace. But you can't see them 
until they are right above, like a sudden cloud burst. Then they disappear like 
a ghost under the cloud cover, a smear of noise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the way I remember this beach. Or the beach in general. I don't 
know if my memory makes it prettier. I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dockweiler was the place where Culver City kids would end up. Venice was sort 
of off limits to us for "competitive" (read: turf) reasons. The northern and 
often prettier beaches -- Malibu, Will Rogers, Zuma -- required wheels, steely 
determination and/or hubris to get there. The unspoken rule: take only 
electives first period; if you linger too long, little's on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more notorious coaches would require teams to take their morning 
runs in the sand. Dry sand. To build up those legs, the endurance. (Yes, I was 
one of those girls in unflattering striped gym gear chugging across the sand.) 
The memories? Trotting out at 7 a.m., inhaling all that brisk, salt air. The 
beach as backdrop to torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, I realize, when you went to the beach you were escaping the city. 
But now the city has found the shore and it has dug in, in all its glory. The 
buzz and silt of construction work. Congestion. Smog. Pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 As I grew older, the visits tapered off. Maybe a beach party. More frequently 
lunch on Ocean Front Walk. Trips with friends who make ritual swims, while I 
take a slow walk watching a woman standing with her eyes closed, spinning 
endless circles in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 While living in Northern California, I found that as a beach-goer, San 
Francisco probably suited me better. I went quite frequently with my roommate, 
both of us swallowed up in winter coats in August. Trips we always took near 
dusk. We'd take long walks into the wind, study the rocky water. The empty 
sand. Just us and the few "polar bears" in wet suits bobbing in the surf -- 
staring into forever. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way I best enjoy the ocean. Absent of activity. Late in the day, 
or very early in the morning. Quietly contemplating the edge of the Earth. I 
appreciate it as a stunning backdrop. Or a breathtaking view from someone's 
squeegee-clean picture window, framed by shaggy sagebrush and eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the sand (yes, I forgot a towel), I realized I stopped going as 
frequently when my drive to the shore protracted from five to 20 miles. I 
stopped going when life became much more complicated than trying to figure out 
a way to smarm my way out of first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Although my visits are few and far between, having that huge blanket of steely 
gray stretching ever westward is contemplation fodder. Sobering. Knowing that 
it's there, that I can smell it in the air after I cross Lincoln Boulevard on a 
good day, is more than reassuring. It's revitalizing. I'd feel claustrophobic, 
hemmed in without its broad drama. One doesn't have to see it to revel in it, 
to feel it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask that woman spinning in the sand.

 In the news: On the arrest of Carlos the Jackal, one of the world's most 
notorious terrorists: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Since it's now believed that he didn't do many of the violent acts 
attributed to him, terrorists had recently downgraded him from a jackal to a 
hyena." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tony Peyser 
</P>
<P>
 * "Carlos has been linked to Germany's Baader-Meinhoff gang, the Turkish 
Popular Liberation Front, and the Grand Slam Breakfast at Denny's." 
</P>
<P>
 * "He was caught when agents intercepted a piece of mail sent to him by Ed 
McMahon that said, 'Carlos the Jackal, you may already be a winner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Miller 
</P>
<P>
 * "It was a pretty easy capture. They gave his name to an Amway representative 
and the guy tracked him down." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Actually, Yasser Arafat apparently had Carlos' phone number on his MCI 
Family and Friends Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jay Leno 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos was able to stay in hiding because he was a master of disguise. For 10 
years, he played 'Uncle Charlie' on 'My Three Sons.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argus Hamilton 
</P>
<P>
 "My hard-of-hearing uncle was surprised Carlos was arrested in the Sudan. He 
thought a terrorist's preferred vehicle was the attempted coupe."

<P>
 In the nodes: Leno, on O. J. going to Cedars-Sinai last Thursday for a minor 
surgical procedure: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I think he may have hurt his case. When the doctor walked in with a 
scalpel, O. J. said, 'You call that a knife?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "It was nothing serious. Two hours of surgery to remove Robert Shapiro's 
hand from O. J.'s wallet."

 Also in the news: Bruce McNall, former sole owner of the Kings, is actively

reports that McNall has already admitted to lying about his weight on his 
driver's license.

 Officials at the Louvre in Paris insist they will not remove four centuries of 
dirt and grime from the Mona Lisa. Comedy writer Bob Mills says the officials 
fear that doing so might reveal the fact that Leonardo da Vinci actually used a 
paint-by-numbers kit.

 Hamilton, on the U. N. asking the United States to help end Bosnia's civil 
war: "It's taken the U. S. 130 years to get Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma and

N. thinks we can help end the civil war in Bosnia right away."

 On a recent Southern vacation, John Elfmont introduced his son, Daniel, to 
exotic dishes, including alligator and rattlesnake. The young man agreed to try 
both after being assured by his dad that they "taste just like chicken." Back 
home in L. A., when grandma asked about their trip, Daniel told her of eating 
alligator. She asked him what it tasted like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," he answered, "just like rattlesnake."

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; HABIT CHANGES MAY SIGNAL 'BACK-TO-SCHOOL JITTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The start of a new school year can bring on a case of "back-to-school jitters" 
in children of all ages. Parents should let kids know it's OK to be excited or 
nervous, a Purdue University professor says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jitters can occur whether a child is going to school for the first time, going 
to a new school or just looking forward to school starting again, says Judith 
Myers-Walls, a professor of child development and family studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Children may worry about living up to the expectations of their parents or 
teachers. They may worry about making new friends or continuing old 
friendships. They may also worry that old friends have moved away during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jitters can also occur when a child does not like school, perhaps because of a 
bad experience, Myers-Walls says. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms of back-to-school jitters vary. Children may be withdrawn or may be 
acting up in new ways, she says. Parents should look for changes in eating and 
sleeping habits, constant chatter about the new school year or complete 
avoidance of the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 If jitters are a problem, parents should focus on the positive and let kids 
know it's OK to be nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is for parents to be available to talk to kids about their 
feelings," Myers-Walls says. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease children's fears, Myers-Walls says parents can also: 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about the ways they got ready for a new school year when they were 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about another child's circumstances and ask, "What do you think 
so-and-so should do?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Make up scenarios and ask children how they would handle them. For example, 
a parent might ask, "What if it's recess time and no one is playing with you? 
What could you do?" Or, "What if you miss the bus after school? What should you 
do?" Self-Esteem Training May Help Daddy Cope 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the University of Illinois have studied a group of blue-collar 
fathers and discovered that if Dad had a bad day at work, he's probably going 
to be a bear at home. Self-esteem training for fathers, the researchers 
concluded, would pay off in the workplace as well as at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the fatherhood front, James Levine, director of the Fatherhood Project 
at the Families and Work Institute in New York, has identified a new strain of 
tension he calls "daddy stress." 
</P>
<P>
 It shows up most, Levine found, when pressure to pitch in at home runs up 
against extra work brought on by downsizing or intense scrutiny of personnel at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed to explain absences from work on the basis of family demands, many 
men lie, Levine discovered. They may say, for example, that they have another 
meeting -- even at 6 p.m. -- rather than saying they need to take their child 
to the dentist.

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; SOME HOUSEHUSBANDS FEEL THE STING OF EMBARRASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Get a job and contribute to the household income, or stay at home with the 
kids? It's a tough call -- for the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing numbers of men are opting to stay home to provide child care. They 
say that what causes them the most frustration is the isolation, the lack of 
money and the embarrassment of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost humiliating," said Peter Baylies, 37, a Massachusetts software 
engineer who decided to stay home with his infant son, now 2, after he was laid 
off more than a year ago. His wife is a teacher. "At work when you do something 
good, you get a pat on the back, a promotion and a raise. When you're working 
at home, you don't get any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 20% of children under 5 were cared for by 
dads at home in 1991, up from 15% in 1988. Statisticians are uncertain whether 
the jump represents a triumph of women's liberation or simply an economic slump 
that has left fathers with more time on their hands during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the dads are finding that it's not easy to break into the "old 
girls' club" of stay-at-home moms. "It's intimidating," said Steven Amaya, 37, 
of Thousand Oaks, who once found he was the only man doing the hokeypokey in a 
mommy-and-me class.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were a little standoffish at first," he said. "They felt as if they 
couldn't gossip as much as they would like to." 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya has cared full time for his daughter Avery, 3, since she was born. His 
wife works as a film distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also contends with assumptions that he is only baby-sitting or 
suspicions that he might harm other children if they come to play at his home. 
"There's this lurking cloud of molestation out there that is really unfortunate 
and it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Baylies said that at-home dads, unlike the moms, don't reach out for support 
or admit they have problems with parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to help at-home dads connect, Baylies has begun a quarterly 
newsletter, At-Home Dad. The second issue contains tips on starting a play 
group, recipes for tuna melt and Play-Doh and "One Dad's Diary." Dads can also 
share their E-mail addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 (Subscriptions are $12 a year and can be obtained by writing Baylies at 61 
Brightwood Ave., North Andover, Mass., 01845-1702.)  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Baylies has about 150 subscribers, most of them from California. Most, 
he said, are either disabled, have been laid off from work or are wary of day 
care. Some are tired of the dual-income rat race. For some, the deciding factor 
to stay home was that their wives were earning more money.  
</P>
<P>
 While some have no problem with untraditional sex roles, others are so ashamed 
they try to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
 A father of four from Fontana confessed in At-Home Dad that he used to let 
people think he was working at home, earning money with his computer, when 
actually he was a full-time homemaker living on a "generous allowance" from his 
wife. "I have slowly evolved to a point where I don't care what people think," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylies said the pressures for some men are so great, they eventually put 
their children in day care and go back to work. But others say the rewards far 
outweigh the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya said, "I get a hands-on experience of working on the future."

'90S FAMILY; SECRET LIFE OF KIDS; CHILDREN DELIGHT IN CANDY STASHES AND 
HIDE-OUTS -- THE THINGS ONLY THEY KNOW. A PROBLEM? NOT AT ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN BONKER / SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even now, seven years since she last dipped her toes into the forbidden 
midnight water, Dawna McVicker has not told her parents about her little secret 
jaunts. 
</P>
<P>
 On summer evenings as her parents slept, McVicker sneaked out of the family 
beach house to rendezvous with the sand, the moon and the waves. The first time 
she was 8 -- naive enough to think it a lark, but wise enough to keep it to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just sit there. I'd sing. I was never afraid of (the dark). It felt 
free. Completely free," says McVicker, 24. "I remember sitting there. The moon 
was so bright and small. And the clouds would just roll in. And I'd listen to 
the waves. It sounded so rad. If I close my eyes now, I can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Good sense eventually ended the secret walks, but not the secret of them. 
McVicker, of Huntington Beach, says they still feel like her thing. Her secret 
child world. 
</P>
<P>
 Children love and harbor their secrets. They are the stuff of hide-outs, candy 
stashes, clubs, imaginary play, rituals and crayon drawings stowed with the 
socks in the bottom dresser drawer. They are removed from the adult world. 
That's a particularly delicious ingredient, as anyone who has ever slipped 
beneath the sheets with a flashlight to read "The Secret Garden" or "The Boxcar 
Children" well knows. 
</P>
<P>
 And children need them. Secrets are generally a normal and healthy part of 
growing up, says JoAnne Pedro-Carroll, associate professor of psychology and 
psychiatry with the Primary Mental Health Project at the University of 
Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those benign kinds of secrets reflect a child's need for autonomy," 
Pedro-Carroll says. "It's, 'You don't know everything about me, parents. This 
is something I can set up for myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that carries risks. Every parent wants to uncover sneaky forays to 
dangerous places or know where their teen-agers really are at night. And abused 
children can bury horrible secrets in an emotional underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everything unsaid is a secret. It may just be that no one's asking 
children the right questions. Anne Soderman, a professor of Family and Child 
Ecology at Michigan State University, says she believes that happens too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "They experience things and they don't quite know what to make of them," 
Soderman says. "We don't do very much sitting and talking with children." 
</P>
<P>
 But childhood's gentle secrets are definitely worth keeping, Pedro-Carroll 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to step back and give them their room, their space to have 
those separate times," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping back is hardly the problem, many parents say. It's not that they're 
blind to their children's secret lives. But catching a glimpse can be like 
watching for a comet that whizzes by once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Rebecca Lascoe's 4-year-old daughter what she and her pal are doing in her 
mother's bedroom, and she'll describe a beautiful garden built for a wedding. 
But if Lascoe stands and watches, she'll be treated like the uninvited guest 
that she is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually they'll just kind of stop everything and just look at me, like, 
'You're bothering us,' " says Lascoe, of Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Constantino knows his three children have an adventurous and probably 
grubby world unto themselves in the wooded enclave of their Silver Lake home 
and the nearby lake. On occasion he gets a peek. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have secret hiding places for candy by the lake," he says. "That is 
their secret stash." 
</P>
<P>
 When they revealed it, he squelched a grimace but offered one thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you guys really think this is going to be any good?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantino says he believes his children's world is a healthy, creative 
outlet that adult trespassing would soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not know what they're up to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-year-old is glad his parents don't know what he's up to in the dirt of 
Adventure Playground in Irvine. In a city where planning and orderliness are 
nearly sacred arts, this playground is a haven -- albeit a planned and 
supervised one -- of muddy, messy and unstructured play. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one of the handmade forts that are the park's hallmark, he reveals his 
secret place to hide and eat candy. It's two tires wedged together to form a 
cozy seat, a 6-year-old's version of a La-Z-Boy. He swears he falls asleep 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shhhhh!!!" he tells a visitor who marvels a bit too loudly. "They'll find out 
it's here." 
</P>
<P>
 But his best secret, the reason you won't see his name here, is the big rope 
swing. His mother says it's off-limits. Too dangerous. He thinks it's glorious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeeee? Whaaahooooo!" he shouts as he pushes off from the tree trunk, his 
feet hooked around a knot as he swings in a wide arc. And what does he tell his 
parents after a day at Adventure Playground? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tell them I had fun," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretive? A little deceptive, even? Yes and no, Pedro-Carroll says. Children, 
all people for that matter, enjoy controlling a private corner or two of their 
lives. But children can seem secretive because they don't quite know how to 
share and understand feelings.  
</P>
<P>
 In the preschool years, imaginary friends, self-conversations and pretend play 
help out. Later, intense and frequent play with one best buddy, diaries and art 
often fill in. "Drawing and playing for children are ways that they work out 
their feelings," Pedro-Carroll says. "They can't always tell us in words and 
sometimes they don't always know exactly themselves how to put feelings into 
words. Fantasies and secrets feel safer." 
</P>
<P>
 The drawings in Amanda Benavidez's bottom drawer might have been secret 
forever if not for the fate of clean laundry. She was working on her drawings 
when Diana Benavidez whisked into her room with folded clothes. Benavidez is 
still surprised by the art she found. Amanda, 8, had filled several pages with 
drawings of houses. Each was an example of a house Amanda hoped they could have 
someday. As a military family, they have moved nine tines in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said they were the houses she would like if they ever let us stay 
someplace long enough to buy a house," says Benavidez, whose husband is a pilot 
stationed at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The added surprise was that each blueprint included a trophy room for Amanda's 
T-ball trophies. All three of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been damaged in the moves. The screws are wobbly. I guess that's 
frustrating to her. I didn't realize how important they were to her. She has 
only three, but that is like her pride and joy," Benavidez says. 
</P>
<P>
 The luck of the incident was that Amanda got to talk a little about how she 
felt and her parents had a chance to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 A secret worth sharing.

THE SEVEN SEAS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BEACHES. LIKE MOM AND APPLE PIE, RIGHT? 
WELL, SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ALL BEACH BOYS AND BABES, AS WE DISCOVERED DURING 
VISITS TO SEVEN WATERFRONTS. (CONSIDER THE OCEANLESS BEACH IN SAN BERNARDINO 
COUNTY.) SOMETIMES THEY'RE HAVENS FOR STARS AND STARFISH, THE FISHING SET OR 
BODYBOARDERS. OR THEY CAN BE A PLACE WHERE A LONGTIME ANGELENO HASN'T TAKE A 
DIP FOR MANY YEARS.; BODYBOARDERS RULE THE WAVES AT BOOGIE BEACH; SAN DIEGO

<P>
 At 3:15 p.m. on a recent Sunday, childhood buddies John Boyle and Scott Levin 
arrive on the sand, drop their backpacks near a fire ring, and head for the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:17 -- low tide -- they're in knee-deep salt water putting on swim fins. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3:20, they're soaked. 
</P>
<P>
 No time for bikini patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two paddle out, kicking furiously as their hands grip the top of their 
matching black-bottom bodyboards, they're oblivious to warnings: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bodyboarders, you need to stay at least 75 feet away from the pier," a 
lifeguard announces. 
</P>
<P>
 Low tide, meanwhile, creates bone-crushing waves. A medium-size swell treading 
shallow waters collides with the ebbing sea to create hollow "grinders." A 
riptide forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle (the blond one) and Levin (the tall one) paddle closer to old Crystal 
Pier, several yards away. "This is where all the best waves are," Boyle says. 
</P>
<P>
 The rip takes Boyle and Levin, both 20, even closer to the pilings. Now the 
fishing lines that customarily hang off the end of the creaking structure are 
visible. "A few days ago a bodyboarder got a line wrapped around his neck," 
Levin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was OK, but it didn't look too pretty," he says. "He had this big, red 
mark afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuring thoughts for a novice. 
</P>
<P>
 But these guys are pier-side pros: daily bodyboarders who have been at it for 
10 years. And they represent the fastest-growing segment -- hard-core 
enthusiasts -- of a fast-growing sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft, small bodyboards -- descendants of the Morey Boogie board invented 23 
years ago -- accompany almost every other towel here on south Pacific Beach, a 
small stretch of sand between the pier and the area's main lifeguard tower. 
It's Boogie Beach to city lifeguards, who cordon off the sea for nearly 4,000 
swimmers and soft-board riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Down a ways, Don Mullen caters to the other expanding breed: the first-timer. 
He is out of old bodyboards to rent, so he rips the cellophane off a couple new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen started his rental business 14 years ago by hiring out roller skates 
from the back of a leased van. Today, 75 bodyboards make up 40% of the take at 
his shack-like storefront, called Best at the Beach. (Rollerblades, wet suits, 
umbrellas and chairs make up the rest.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Bodyboarding is an easy thing to learn how to do," Mullen explains, slapping 
a pair of squeaking swim fins on his counter. "It takes you at least three days 
to learn how to surf. Bodyboarding only takes an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 That might explain the record number of people expected to lay their bellies 
on a bodyboard this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Star Surfing Co., a surfer's surf shop about a mile away, bodyboards 
are no boon. This is a place where classic, collectible longboards stand proud 
and nary a bodyboarder enters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the traditional rift between surfers and bodyboarders, however, that 
keeps the horizontal surf-riders away. ("Barneys," "sponges" and "doormats," 
surfers call them). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the discount chains like Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target. Their volume-fueled 
discounts on bodyboards make it hard for some small beachside shops to cut a 
profit. So longtime surf-shop owner Glenn Paculba misses the wave that will 
usher in sales of half a million boards this year. "I can't compete," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle and Levin float a few feet away from the pier, waiting for a freak set 
of waves to pop out of the choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle spies a nugget: "There you go," he says to Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got one?" Levin replies, craning his thick neck to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "There!" Boyle yells. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of seconds, Levin swings his slick-belly bodyboard under the 
frothing wave and, whoooosh, his prone body is swallowed up by a four-footer 
that cranks into the pier. He emerges unscathed, a smile on his wet face. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle is usually the one closest to the pilings. The wood doesn't bother him, 
but fish do. "A bat ray!" he cries. "I'm getting the (expletive) out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he can paddle away, another set forms and the two take off on the same 
wave. Boyle goes left, toward the pier, and Levin goes right. A lifeguard, 
sitting in an orange Nissan Pathfinder next to the pier, continues to wail on 
his public address system -- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The waves are too inviting for this pair of college students. "You drop in and 
you forget everything," Levin explains. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate tease is getting tubed, or covered by a breaking wave, as the 
bodyboarder jets across its face. Bodyboarders also get peer points for doing a 
360, surfing on a knee ("drop knee") and flipping over by using the wave's 
upward force ("el rollo"). 
</P>
<P>
 But there's also one other attraction: "I tried surfing," Levin says. "I

THE SEVEN SEAS; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BEACHES. LIKE MOM AND APPLE PIE, RIGHT? 
WELL, SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ALL BEACH BOYS AND BABES, AS WE DISCOVERED DURING 
VISITS TO SEVEN WATERFRONTS. (CONSIDER THE OCEANLESS BEACH IN SAN BERNARDINO 
COUNTY.) SOMETIMES THEY'RE HAVENS FOR STARS AND STARFISH, THE FISHING SET OR 
BODYBOARDERS. OR THEY CAN BE A PLACE WHERE A LONGTIME ANGELENO HASN'T TAKE A 
DIP FOR MANY YEARS.; A BEACH-BLANKET VERSION OF 'GODOT'; CORONA DEL MAR

 I came here to find a starfish, that craggy, rough-to-the-touch emblem of the 
lure of the deep and the childlike wonder of distant seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I found Martha and a pair of poodles in matching camouflage fatigues. 
My first question was not, why on Earth would a couple of poodles require 
camouflage gear, but why would they wear jungle green instead of the more 
appropriate sand color popularized in Desert Storm? 
</P>
<P>
 "The poodles like wearing them," Martha explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, this is a beach in need of a DMZ -- a line of demarcation to separate 
its elements: tide-pool investigators and cave dwellers, Boogie-boarding 
Valhalla dropouts and G-stringed sunbathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Look up from Little Corona -- the smaller of the Corona beaches -- and you 
will see the leering arches of Grand Floridian houses, the kind I'll always 
associate with that movie producer in "The Godfather" -- the one who wakes up 
with a horse head. 
</P>
<P>
 Look ahead and there are tide pools in moonlike craters and sun-drenched surf 
lilting against a rocky shore. A sign on the beach's edge warns children not to 
play in an adjacent stream because of contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The starfish search began, appropriately, in a tide pool full of children. 
Gerado Ruiz, 9, and sister Sally, 7, of Anaheim insisted that I don a headdress 
of kelp before they agreed to an interview. I acquiesced and was pleased to 
learn later that wearing kelp is something of a Corona del Mar tradition. At 
least, that's what I was told. 
</P>
<P>
 I came for starfish but instead, like Coleridge's ancient mariner, found that 
"slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, crabs. Gerado burst into laughter as a large one skittered 
around my sneaker and plopped into the water. "I thought I saw my grandfather's 
dentures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerado and Sally hadn't seen any starfish in their three trips to the beach 
this summer. "But we've gone into the caves," he said, pointing excitedly to 
the high cliff walls to the left. "You can go in there when the tide is low and 
there's all kinds of stuff in there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it scary?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 They nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Things that could survive a nuclear war" is how Dianne Petengale described 
the tide-pool assortment at our feet. Petengale, 28, just married to husband 
Rob, is an accountant in Newport Beach who studied marine biology in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Starfish could probably survive a nuclear war too. Let's face it: Nothing in 
those pools resides in the nosebleed section of the food chain. But I 
understood what she meant. We're touchy-feely and wistful about starfish in a 
way that we're not about most other denizens of the deep. 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled across something that looked like a combination cauliflower and 
tree moss -- which, all things considered, is not an appetizing mixture. The 
slightest touch and the sensitive creature recoiled into itself. It was a sea 
anemone. A young boy warned me that a man who stuck his finger in one got 
"squirted" and became numb. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up around here," Petengale told her husband. "I have this book from 
when I was little called 'A Child's Book of Discovery' and in there is a photo 
of me with my grandmother, and I'm pulling a giant starfish from one of these 
pools. They were just everywhere. It's really hard for tide pools to remain 
pristine so close to a city like Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the tide rising, my search was fast becoming a beach-blanket version of 
"Waiting for Godot." I decided to make a last-ditch effort. 
</P>
<P>
 I searched in dark, crooked corners beneath rocks, believing starfish to be 
afraid of the light. I leaped across formidable chasms -- made more so by 
carrying a pencil and note pad, not to mention my 6-foot, 4-inch frame -- to 
reach faraway pools, believing starfish to be shy of people. Finally, forlorn 
and starfishless, I sat down to watch the tide roll in. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy appeared again, the same one who cautioned me about the anemones. 
Twelve-year-old Jesse Gurule, who lives in Norwalk carried what looked like a 
miniature purple squooshball -- only it moved on its own from side to side. A 
sea urchin. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Jesse whether the ocean wowed him. "I like looking at all the 
different things," he said. "Sometimes, I think about going way deep and seeing 
the sharks and all these different fish -- green and yellow and purple." 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to conjure what the ocean was like when I was little -- the sandbars 
and jetties and boardwalks of the Atlantic City shore, the sea seemingly 
endless and the beach like the surface of some alien planet. I reached for the 
same Alice-in-Wonderland feeling that comes from returning to grade school 
after 10 or 20 years and seeing the once imposing world reduced to Lilliputian 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising ever higher, the tide would soon be impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, seemingly on cue, I saw it. Like some cartoon gremlin, it danced on 
the periphery of vision, careening on the crest of an incoming wave. I stood up 
on an outer rock, sea spray whipping me from all directions, and got in place 
to reach for the starfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be denied after all those long hours, I leaned forward and, helplessly, 
lost my balance, plunging -- note pad and all -- into the water. The starfish 
-- if that's indeed what it was -- had vanished and a small audience that had 
assembled on the beach started to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are those poodles when you need them?

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; WIELDING POWER WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE; JUSTICE LEWIS 
F. POWELL, JR.: A BIOGRAPHY BY JOHN C. JEFFRIES JR. ; SCRIBNERS $30, 690 PAGES

<P>
 The nuclear trigger may make the President the most powerful person in the 
United States, but even the chief executive does not enjoy the profound and 
highly personal influence over our day-to-day lives that is wielded by the nine 
justices of the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On so many questions that really count -- abortion, capital punishment, civil 
rights, criminal justice, free speech and freedom of religion -- five of the 
serving justices can make decisions from which there is no further appeal. And 
yet we know almost nothing about the men and women who serve on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 So we come to "Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr." a biography of the now-retired 
Nixon appointee who became the great centrist of constitutional law, with a 
certain curiosity. What will we learn from John C. Jeffries about the inner 
workings of the Supreme Court and the man whose swing vote made the difference 
in so many of its recent holdings? 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries, a former clerk to Powell, is a law professor at the University of 
Virginia, and he approaches his subject with good taste and good manners, a 
meticulous attention to detail, and the sense of discretion that we might 
expect in a friendly but scholarly biographer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of these nearly 700 pages, we discover that Powell was a quiet but 
principled conservative who refused to march in lock-step with his fellow Nixon 
appointees -- and thus made his mark on the often anonymous history of the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1907 to a Virginia family with deep roots but not much money, Powell 
elevated himself by dint of hard work and what nowadays might be called 
networking. During his college years, Powell was befriended by a young Edward 
R. Murrow, who presciently nicknamed him "Judge," and ended up in law school at 
Washington and Lee, then Harvard. His promising career as an attorney was 
interrupted by intelligence duties in World War II -- but he returned to 
Virginia and resumed the practice that ultimately elevated him to a name 
partnership in a prominent law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Powell's life experiences are eye-opening or hair-raising, and we come 
to understand that Powell was a rather unremarkable gentleman lawyer with 
strong will, high principles, a sense of civic duty but not much passion. 
</P>
<P>
 His life appears considerably more momentous once we follow him to Washington, 
where we glimpse his initiation into the inner circle of the high court. 
Suddenly, the patrician lawyer from the Old South was invested with oblique but 
ultimately decisive authority, and charged with the task of making sense of a 
country that rocked on the edge of political crisis and social disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was selected by Nixon precisely because he appeared to be politically 
reliable. But, to Nixon's surprise -- and to the relief of more progressive 
court-watchers -- Powell showed himself to be a principled conservative who did 
not hesitate to vote with the liberal minority. On the litmus-test questions of 
American politics -- abortion, for example, and affirmative action -- Powell 
quietly helped to rewrite constitutional law along humane and compassionate 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Powell steadfastly supported the constitutionalization of abortion," Jeffries 
writes. "Powell's support for abortion tied into his core ideological 
commitment to the rule of law. If, above all else, people had to respect the 
law, it followed that the law had to respect their beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffries livens up the account now and then with tidbits that allow us to 
glimpse Powell in a somewhat more intimate light. Powell, an honorary member of 
the University Club in New York, was once rousted from bed and threatened with 
the bum's rush by an officious clerk who declared that "he could find no record 
of membership, honorary or otherwise." And, back home in Washington, the 
reserved and soft-spoken Powell ended up with the exuberant and effervescent 
Hubert Humphrey as his next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else," Jeffries allows, "treated Powell 'with quite the same 
informality.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reader who pages through the book in search of sizzling scandals or dirty 
little secrets will be disappointed. Jeffries clearly cares less about Powell's 
idiosyncrasies, which were few, than about the way in which Powell wielded his 
considerable authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of Lewis Powell on the Supreme Court . . . is not a tale of 
strife and greed and conflict," Jeffries writes, almost apologetically. "It is 
the story of the paradoxical protection of a democratic people by their least 
accountable and most elite institution."

 An article in Friday's editions inaccurately quoted Ann Stone, national 
chairman of Republicans for Choice in Alexandria, Va. Defending Republican 
Senate candidate Mike Huffington's stand on abortion, Stone said the Santa 
Barbara congressman "is pro-choice not anti-choice. The worst liberal Democrat 
pro-choicers can say is that he is mixed choice."

 Ever notice how driving the freeways in this recession gives you the chance to 
fantasize about playing a real-life version of Monopoly? 
</P>
<P>
 In one bottleneck on the San Diego Freeway, we noticed a sign advertising the 
availability of an empty parking structure. (Just the place to store our two 
old Volkswagens.) On the Santa Ana, the Radisson Hotel's marquee -- once the 
source of a daily witticism -- now offers this sad commentary on the times: 
"HOTEL FOR SALE." 
</P>
<P>
 And, for commuters who prefer a building with more bed space, a sign on the 
Hollywood Freeway indicates there's still time to put in a bid on the old Queen 
of Angels Hospital. 
</P>

<P>
 Angels coming and going: A few months ago, the Hotel Intercontinental on 
Bunker Hill shut down its Angel's Flight restaurant. This followed the failure 
of another diner of the same name that inhabited a revolving room atop the 
Hyatt Regency Hotel Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But old-timers will be happy to hear that Angel's Flight, the cable car 
service, may be returning soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolley system, which billed itself as the world's shortest railway, 
ferried customers up and down Bunker Hill from 1901 until 1968 for a nickel 
apiece. Construction is due to begin this December on the new railway, which 
will parallel 4th Street. Service could resume as early as December, 1995, 
possibly using the original cable cars, Olivet and Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 No offense to the Hyatt and Intercontinental. But if we had to choose one 
Angel's Flight to have around, it would be this one. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 The marquee on a Malibu movie theater on Pacific Coast Highway has abbreviated 
the title of the film based on the Tom Clancy bestseller to read, "C & P 
Danger." Which is fine, except that just down the road there's another 
establishment known to locals as C & P. It's Carlos & Pepe's -- a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 No time for jokes: Drivers baking in a midday traffic jam on the Ventura 
Freeway near Hayvenhurst Avenue may have been too steamed too appreciate the 
irony that the cause was malfunctioning sprinklers.

 The butler of the '90s: Ivor Spencer of London, who runs an international 
school for butlers, writes to say that he'll be paying a visit soon to sell 
Hollywood on the new, updated Jeeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Butler Administrators will take a special course in karate, gun training 
and evasive driving," Spencer said. "For the first time, the rich and famous 
will be able to engage one person who is a highly trained all-arounder.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Butler Administrator will be able to serve all meals and book travel and 
hotels. He will have an intensive course from a top American show biz lawyer 
and a top American accountant specializing in contracts. And he will take a 
course in lighting, sound systems and understand the show biz scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeeves won't do all this for peanuts, either. "His salary will be $60,000," 
Spencer said, "and he will expect, at no charge, private medical care and use 
of a car, laundry and cleaning services." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think we'd argue with one of these Jeeves.
