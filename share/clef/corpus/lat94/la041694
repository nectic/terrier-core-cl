TUSTIN COUNCILMAN SOUGHT OTHER CITY'S INVESTMENTS; FINANCES: THOMAS SAYS HE 
DIDN'T KNOW MONTEBELLO WAS IN O.C. POOL. CITRON SAYS IT'S PART OF PLOT TO 
UNSEAT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 Tustin Councilman Jeffrey Thomas, who helped advise city officials to withdraw 
$4 million from an investment pool managed by Orange County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron, proposed a deal with at least one other county pool 
member that would have allowed the brokerage firm where Thomas works to manage 
some of its investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, also a campaign finance committee member for Citron's election rival, 
met with Montebello municipal officials earlier this year seeking some of that 
city's investment business on behalf of the Laguna Hills-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition would have required Montebello to remove some of its money 
from the Orange County-managed pool, city Finance Director Ted Nix said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same February meeting, Nix said, Thomas disclosed that he would be 
supporting a challenger to Citron in June. Costa Mesa certified public 
accountant John M. W Moorlach is running against Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally considered a low-profile post, the treasurer's office has become 
the focus of local political scrapping in recent days as the longtime incumbent 
has faced increasing criticism for his aggressive investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas acknowledged Friday that he met with Montebello officials but said he 
did nothing to influence them to pull away from Orange County. He said he did 
not know until he spoke with city officials that Montebello was a member of the 
Orange County pool and that city officials told him they were happy with their 
association with Citron and would not consider sharing business with Van Kampen 
Merritt, the brokerage firm where Thomas works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have wasted my time meeting with them had I known they 
were with Orange County," Thomas said. "Most people with Orange County are very 
happy. I'm not one to move money if people are happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, however, characterized Thomas' meeting with Montebello officials as 
further evidence of a sophisticated plan to unseat him, adding that Nix called 
his office about the meeting Thursday after reading of Thomas' involvement in 
the withdrawal of Tustin money from the Orange County account. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a political fact of life," Citron said Friday, "that a finance committee 
member of my opponent's campaign is an employee of a brokerage company. And it 
appears to me that he has a personal financial interest in the outcome of this 
election." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he only discussed his plans to support Moorlach for Citron's seat 
in the June 7 primary as a matter of "full disclosure" for those attending the 
Montebello meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I told them that, it was clear that they were Bob Citron fans and we had 
nothing more to discuss. It was like, 'Hey, we really have nothing to talk 
about, but can I have another martini,' " Thomas said, describing the luncheon 
meeting arranged by officials with Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The treasurer is facing the first opposition for his seat in more than two 
decades. Most of the criticism has centered on Citron's management of a 
$7.5-billion portfolio for 187 public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have taken issue with the treasurer's use of an investment strategy 
called "reverse repurchase agreements." Under the strategy, the investor 
typically borrows bonds against existing collateral and then sells them to 
invest in higher-yielding bonds. As long as the investor borrows at a lower 
rate than the return on the security in which the agency invests, the strategy 
remains profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Tustin officials cited Citron's "risky" philosophy for 
withdrawing $3 million of city money from the county-managed pool. That move, 
coordinated in part by Thomas, followed a $1-million Tustin withdrawal two 
months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Treasurer Ronald Nault said Thomas offered financial expertise during 
discussions with the city audit committee before the decision was made to 
remove the funds from the county pool. Thomas suggested leaving the pool and 
Nault made the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Chriss Street, a local business executive and Newport Beach 
contributor to Moorlach's campaign, said he is concerned about the safety and 
stability of the county's pool, specifically its management of $50 million in 
bonds borrowed by the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Street acknowledged that in several recent phone calls to Standard & Poors 
Ratings Group in New York, the Wall Street Journal and Forbes magazine, he has 
expressed concern about the safety and stability of the county's portfolio, 
managed by Citron's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Citron said he and his staff have worried that the criticisms 
could somehow damage the county's credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the treasurer suggested that Thomas' meeting with Montebello officials 
was part of political maneuvering to position the Tustin councilman's company 
for a piece of county business should Moorlach win in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "If John Moorlach won, I would not manage any money for the county pool," 
Thomas said. "I would never touch a dime of that money. It would be a conflict 
of interest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The minute you make a charge or a claim, he (Citron) is going to say it's all 
political. Bob is running for his political life right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that long before the current political season, he has railed 
against the treasurer's investment philosophy, fearing that a misstep along the 
way could lead to trouble for over-leveraged accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern, he said, led him to support Tustin's decision to leave the 
county pool after eight months and more than $100,000 in returns. He said 
Citron's investment decisions went against the city's "very conservative" 
investment philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, however, said city officials never expressed their concerns to him 
when they entered the pool last year or when they began withdrawing their 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed pretty comfortable with things when (Assistant Treasurer Matthew 
Raabe) explained it," Citron said Friday, recalling a meeting with Tustin city 
officials last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's withdrawal from the county pool has angered some officials, 
including Tustin Mayor Jim Potts, who said Friday that he is considering a 
proposal to return the money to the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said he also would consider a policy that would require such decisions 
be made in public with full City Council participation. He said he did not 
learn of the withdrawal until after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said the action and Thomas' support of it was "pure politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's been playing politics with the citizens of Tustin's money, he's going 
to have hell to pay," Potts said. "To me, it looks like he's playing politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this action, Potts said, he had never heard anyone in the city voice 
concerns about county investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Councilman Thomas R. Saltarelli, however, said he believes politics 
were not involved in the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has all kind of been blown out of proportion," he said. "There's no 
implication that we believe the county is doing anything improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Saltarelli, who was not involved in the action, said he is comfortable with 
the city's fiscally conservative approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't try to make a lot of money on our funds, we just want to make sure 
we don't lose it," he said.

IRVINE CO. FINE IN LION COUNTRY CASE OVERTURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual move, a judge on Friday overturned a 1993 lawsuit settlement 
requiring Irvine Co., Orange County's largest landowner, to pay $42.6 million 
in damages to the company that operated the now-defunct Lion Country Safari 
theme park in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing insufficient evidence to justify the jury's Nov. 5 verdict, Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Claude M. Owens granted a motion calling for a new 
trial in the case, which dates back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 United Leisure Corp., the former operator of Lion Country Safari, had alleged 
in its lawsuit that Irvine Co. undermined the business of the park operator by 
blocking it from making full use of the 300 acres it was leasing from Irvine 
Co. As a result, United Leisure alleged in its lawsuit, it was eventually 
forced to shut down Lion Country Safari. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury decided that Irvine Co. should pay about $37 million in damages to 
United Leisure and later awarded an additional $5 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In granting the motion for a retrial, however, Owens said "there is no 
evidence of loss of anticipated profits" from other projects planned by United 
Leisure for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter D. Zeughauser, the Irvine Co.'s general counsel, said in a statement: 
"We are gratified by what we believe is a proper result." Owens' action, he 
said, "strongly supports our view that Lion Country's award was built on 
groundless and misleading claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lysaght, a lawyer for United Leisure, said the company will appeal 
Owens' order for a retrial, no date for which was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Thames, a partner in the Irvine office of the law firm Allen, Matkins, 
Leck, Gamble & Mallory, said of Owens' action Friday: "Certainly this is 
unusual. You don't see a lot of judgments overturned." 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge decided the judgment that was entered was simply not supported by 
the evidence," said Thames, whose firm specializes in real estate litigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Lion Country Safari opened in 1969 as a drive-through wilderness park that 
allowed visitors to get close to exotic animals such as lions, elephants, 
zebras and giraffes. The park closed in 1984, citing a prolonged decline in 
attendance. United Leisure filed for bankruptcy reorganization two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was operating, Lion Country subleased about 100 acres for the 
construction of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and the Wild Rivers water park. 
Irvine Co. unsuccessfully sued to stop both projects, saying it wanted the 
property to be used for less-permanent attractions, such as a golf driving 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, United Leisure sued Irvine Co., alleging that the landowner had tried 
repeatedly to thwart plans for development of lucrative recreation projects and 
had "generally acted in such a way as to make it impossible to derive a profit" 
from the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a complete bailout for the Irvine Co.," Lysaght said Friday. "There's 
no question in my mind that the jury understood everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. owns Irvine Ranch, which covers more than 90 square miles and is 
one of the nation's largest planned communities. It includes 17,000 businesses, 
65,000 homes and has a population of about 175,000. At least 60,000 acres of 
the ranch remain undeveloped.

 TACO LOVER? In New York, The Donald may mean Trump, but here it's Irvine Co. 
Chairman Donald Bren, who's much more publicity shy. (D1) But Bren did have 
something to say this week about Taco Bell, which has been threatening to move 
out of its Irvine headquarters: "It is an important business in Orange County, 
and we are encouraging them to stay. I believe they will stay here." . . . One 
reason he's interested: If Taco Bell stays, Irvine Co.'s Irvine Spectrum office 
park is considered a likely new home.

 JUST BEAUTIFUL: When Susan Egan was a senior at the High School for the 
Performing Arts in Los Alamitos in 1988, instructor Ralph Opacic says he knew 
she'd succeed. "She not only had great talent, she had tremendous drive," he 
says. After a string of increasingly stronger roles, Egan has hit it big: She's 
Belle in the much anticipated "Beauty and the Beast," which opens Monday on 
Broadway. . . . Opacic, now director at the school, spoke to her recently: "You 
bet she's excited; this is a performer's dream come true."

 SHARP COACH: Maybe you've noticed on TV as Magic Johnson coaches the Lakers: 
He gets a little excited at the referees, and his threads look mighty fine. But 
it pays him to dress well. Johnson just signed with David Rickey & Co., based

Olshan: "Our clothes are for the man who wants to walk into the room looking 
like Cary Grant."

F-15S TRIED IDENTIFYING COPTERS ELECTRONICALLY; MIDEAST: BUT PENTAGON SAYS THEY 
GOT 'NO FRIENDLY RESPONSE' FROM TRANSPONDER DEVICES BEFORE FIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pilots of two U.S. F-15C jet fighters tried to identify a pair of 
Blackhawk helicopters electronically before firing their missiles, but they did 
not receive the proper signal in return before they mistakenly shot the 
choppers down, the Pentagon said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that 
the F-15Cs used their IFF equipment -- for Identification, Friend or Foe -- to 
"interrogate" the helicopters but received "no friendly response" from the 
Blackhawks' transponder devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more information is expected from an Air Force investigation now 
under way, officials said the failure of the helicopters' transponders to 
identify them as U.S. aircraft could have been a principal cause of Thursday's 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said there was no communication -- by radio or by other 
electronic devices -- between the helicopters and the Airborne Warning and 
Control System (AWACS) command plane that was flying nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The AWACS plane knew in advance that both sets of aircraft would be in the 
area, and its controllers were supposed to have coordinated their movements and 
to have helped prevent any misidentification, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's disclosure shed a potentially important light on the tragedy, in 
which two U.S. F-15Cs mistakenly shot down a pair of U.S. UH-60 Blackhawk 
helicopters over northern Iraq, killing 26 people, including 15 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But those knowledgeable about IFF procedures cautioned that they can be 
complex and that a failure of the helicopters' transponders to identify them 
definitively as American might not by itself have provided justification for 
the F-15C pilots to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the choppers' transponders also might have been turned off for a 
recent landing -- a common practice to prevent the "burnout" of IFF equipment. 
If so, the devices would not have replied automatically to the F-15Cs' signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The transponders could also have been set for a different code than was 
expected by the F-15Cs' IFF gear or they could have been malfunctioning, 
knowledgeable officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures underscored the complexity of the situation -- and the 
continued bafflement of officials trying to find out how the incident could 
have happened in the face of a battery of fail-safe procedures that had been 
established to prevent just such accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials declined to answer other questions about the case, pending 
completion of a high-level investigation being conducted at the crash site near 
the village of Irbil in northern Iraq and at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a hint that some human error was responsible, Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry specifically told reporters that the investigation was 
intended "to determine personal culpability, if any, whether systems failures 
or inadequacies existed and whether procedures were adequate." 
</P>
<P>
 "If our procedures need change, we will change them, and we will change them 
immediately," Perry said. "If individuals are found to be culpable, we will 
discipline them. But we do not -- we will not rush to judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he had suspended all U.S. patrol flights over northern Iraq for a 
day to give investigators time to visit the crash site and gather any evidence 
that might be available. But he said normal operations are expected to resume 
this morning.  
</P>
<P>
 As an added safeguard, he said, he had tightened the rules of engagement -- 
the procedures for determining when a fighter pilot may fire at a potential 
target over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither Perry nor Shalikashvili would say so publicly, defense 
officials said that pilots now will be required to obtain clearance from AWACS 
controllers before firing at another aircraft and no longer will be allowed to 
shoot solely after identifying them visually. 
</P>
<P>
 Under rules in force Thursday, the F-15C pilots could decide to fire on their 
own once they had identified the helicopters -- even though they had mistaken 
them for Iraqi aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Friday also disclosed the names of four of the 
15 Americans killed in the crash -- Army Col. Richard A. Mulhern, Air Force 2nd 
Lt. Laura Ashley Piper, Army Warrant Officer John W. Garrett and Barbara L. 
Schell, a Foreign Service officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulhern had been on his way to take command of an allied military coordination 
center in Zakhu; it is assigned to provide military advice and intelligence to 
the Kurds in northern Iraq. Schell was a policy adviser there. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper was an intelligence officer assigned to the allied air base in Ramstein, 
Germany, and Garrett was a helicopter pilot. It was not known whether he was 
flying or was a passenger. The names of others killed were being withheld until 
their families are notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Shalikashvili also made these points in their news conference: 
</P>
<P>
 * The helicopters apparently did not notify the AWACS plane when they took off 
after their previous stop at an Iraqi village, and the AWACS controllers did 
not radio the helicopters to warn them that the F-15Cs were in the area. "Had 
that procedure worked, there should not have been this accident," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The pilots of the two F-15Cs did not try to contact the helicopter pilots by 
radio after making visual identification -- a procedure that might have avoided 
the tragedy. Such contact apparently is not required but often is done as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials do not know yet whether the pilots of the F-15Cs asked the AWACS 
controllers to confirm whether the helicopters were friendly or whether the 
AWACS crew authorized the shootings. "The investigation will have to determine 
that," Shalikashvili said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also listed other questions he has asked the investigators to look into: 
Had the helicopters filed a flight plan? If so, had they deviated from their 
outlined route? 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all very good questions, and we do not have definitive answers . . 
. at this time," he said. But he added: "We will have . . . very shortly. That 
is what our investigation is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the helicopters' IFF gear to signal the F-15Cs was puzzling to 
military officers. Had everything been operating properly, the signals should 
have been transmitted automatically and the accident could have been averted. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili told reporters that the operation had been carefully and 
correctly planned and all involved had been properly briefed about it. But, he 
added, "what actually then happened, I cannot speculate on." 
</P>
<P>
 And Perry lamented that "there are half a dozen procedures that we have in 
place, any one of which . . . could have prevented this. . . . They didn't all 
have to operate," he said. "Just one of them had to operate and this . . . 
would not have happened." A Search for Answers 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry says military investigators will try to get 
answers to the following questions to explain why U.S. warplanes shot down two 
American helicopters in Iraq: 
</P>
<P>
 * Were the helicopters in contact with the airborne warning and control 
(AWACS) command plane controlling allied air operations? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did the AWACS attempt to contact the helicopters? 
</P>
<P>
 * Were the helicopters' IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) systems working? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did the F-15Cs ask the AWACS for confirmation before firing? 
</P>
<P>
 * Had the helicopters filed a flight plan? If yes, were they flying the 
planned route or had they deviated from the filed route? 
</P>
<P>
 * Were the AWACS and F-15Cs aware that two U.S. helicopters were in the area? 
</P>
<P>
 * Did the F-15Cs attempt to make radio contact with the helicopters? If not, 
why not?

SERBIAN GUNMEN POISED TO OVERRUN BESIEGED ENCLAVE; BOSNIA: MUSLIM GOVERNMENT 
DENOUNCES U.N.'S UNWILLINGNESS TO USE FORCE AGAINST GORAZDE'S ATTACKERS. 
PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN CRISIS AFTER OFFICER IS KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb forces crushed government defense lines around Gorazde in a 
massive attack Friday that killed a British special forces officer and plunged 
the U.N. mission into a crisis over whether to abandon the proclaimed safe area 
on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government accused the United Nations of signing Gorazde's death 
warrant and betraying the very people whom the peacekeeping mission was sent to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are scared to death of the thugs in the mountains. We are not," Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic angrily pronounced after Yasushi Akashi, the civilian 
chief of the U.N. Protection Force, made it clear that he was not prepared to 
use force against the Serbian gunmen poised to overrun Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic said he had been reliably informed that the U.N. commander for 
Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, had appealed for further NATO bombings 
after two British officers deployed as forward air commanders were wounded by 
the Serbian onslaught around 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But Akashi was in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale at the time and chose to 
pursue Serbian promises of a cease-fire instead, according to both Silajdzic 
and U.N. spokesman Dacre Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Rose ordered the evacuation of all U.N. military and relief 
workers from the besieged enclave. He then reversed course and told crews of 
two helicopters dispatched to Gorazde to bring out only one of the two wounded 
British officers. The evacuated soldier was later pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said the nine remaining U.N. troops were being left in Gorazde "for 
the moment" because the city was still in government hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial pullout order suggested that the U.N. mission was willing to risk 
a Serbian conquest of Gorazde rather than rile Bosnian Serb gunmen who have 
taken more than 200 U.N. troops captive in retaliation for air strikes by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde, a refugee-packed town of 65,000, is one of six U.N.-designated safe 
zones for the victims of the 2-year-old Serbian nationalist siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs are on the edge of town. The situation is very serious. It's 
possible the Serbs will take the town in the very near future," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports from U.N. and Bosnian officials indicated that an internal 
conflict has erupted within the peacekeeping mission, which earlier this week 
called in NATO air strikes against Serbian ground forces for the first time in 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 At a volatile midnight news conference that Rose called off after less than 
five minutes, Akashi praised the Serbs who had mortally wounded the British 
soldier for facilitating his evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic assured Akashi that his gunmen would hold 
their fire while the United Nations pulled its soldiers and aid workers out, 
the mission chief reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lt. Romain Kuntz, the French helicopter pilot who flew the evacuation 
mission, said his Puma aircraft was fired on as it lifted off from Gorazde. He 
told reporters at the hospital helipad here that he had seen heavy fighting, 
mortar and artillery fire across a wide arc near the enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, who has the final word on the military plans drafted by Rose, denied 
reports that he had rejected air strikes. He declined to answer when asked if 
the U.N. mission has become reluctant to resort to force again because the 
Serbian gunmen ringing Sarajevo might retaliate against U.N. troops taken 
captive over the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Since NATO jets destroyed two Serbian tank positions Sunday and Monday, 
Karadzic and his hard-line military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, have condemned 
the U.N. mission as an aggressor and announced that they are severing contacts 
with the peacekeeping force. The detentions and booby traps set up around U.N. 
facilities have provided the nationalist commanders with a human shield they 
apparently are counting on to deter further air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Rob Annink, chief spokesman for the 13,000-strong U.N. contingent in 
Bosnia, had acknowledged earlier Friday that the Serbs had likely nabbed U.N. 
personnel for their own protection. "We feel they want to have some sort of 
deterrence against another use of air force by NATO," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after a French NATO jet was hit by ground fire while flying a 
reconnaissance mission over Gorazde and the two British officers were wounded 
by the Serbs, U.N. officials said the mission commander continued to prefer 
negotiations over force. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's Southern European Command headquarters in Naples, Italy, reported that 
a French reconnaissance aircraft was hit in the tail by antiaircraft fire but 
returned safely to the aircraft carrier Clemenceau in the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. aid workers in Gorazde reported unrelenting shelling of the town, 
contradicting U.N. reports from the public affairs office in Sarajevo claiming 
that hostilities had died down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian radio claimed that Serbs were moving heavy artillery back into the 
12-mile exclusion zone declared around Sarajevo after a NATO ultimatum in 
February forced the rebels to pull back the weapons with which they had 
bombarded the capital for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesmen said they had no corroborating reports of such redeployments 
but confirmed a marked increase in small-arms and sniper fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After four civilians were felled by snipers firing on the city's recently 
reactivated central tram line, that transportation service was shut down again 
in a telling admission of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi had spent several hours in Pale in an attempt to resurrect peace 
negotiations that had dragged on for nearly two years and were ruptured by the 
Serbs in anger at being targeted for air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian media had been reporting an imminent breakthrough on a cease-fire that 
the rebels had proposed in hopes of freezing the territorial status quo, which 
would leave them with more than 70% of Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But after word of the intensified Gorazde offensive reached Sarajevo, the 
optimistic tone of mission officials evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi issued another appeal to the Serbs "to cease hostilities in and around 
Gorazde," but another U.N. civilian lamented that a peace settlement "has never 
seemed so far away." 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. source noted that the continued presence of U.N. forces in the 
battle zone gave the mission a stronger incentive to protect the enclave and 
that forward air controllers would be vital in the event further air strikes 
are called for. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council issued a non-binding statement Friday night, 
condemning the violence around Gorazde. But the world body did not mention 
punitive action or identify the Serbs as attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said that NATO stands ready to 
launch air strikes if the United Nations asks for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made it clear that we stand by our commitment" to launch air strikes on 
request, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said. "We have not had any 
request from Gen. Rose." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, U.S. officials sent strong warnings to the Serbs -- through the 
United Nations and Russia -- to call off their offensive or face retaliation. 
"There has been extensive diplomacy aimed at getting the Serbs to stop," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry refused to say what the United States might do if the Serbs took 
Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials said no major NATO military action was imminent. Nor did 
Clinton convene any meetings with top advisers. But a senior official said 
Clinton's foreign policy team began to discuss what to do next in a series of 
conference calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Through most of the day, Clinton and other U.S. officials sought to downplay 
the prospect that Gorazde might fall or that the fighting might escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has no interest in having NATO become involved in this war 
and trying to gain advantage for one side over the other," Clinton said at the 
White House. "So I'd say our position is to be firm but not provocative, and 
not trying to change the military balance. We need to get the negotiations back 
on track."

ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEE SAFE WATER ACT AS CLINTON TEST; LEGISLATION: ACTIVISTS 
SAY THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS ON THE MEASURE WILL DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE 
RELATIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Safe Drinking Water Act -- an arcane environmental law trickling through 
the legislative process on Capitol Hill -- would not seem the sort of measure 
that could color a President's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, with Congress slated to begin debate on the bill next week, the 
nation's principal environmental organizations are making the water act the 
bellwether of their future relations with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 If in the coming weeks the President joins their fight to protect water 
quality standards from compromises sought by many states and local water 
management agencies, environmentalists say that their relations with the 
Administration -- which got off to a rocky start -- will be amicable. 
</P>
<P>
 They reason that, after retreating in the face of opposition on so many of 
their cherished initiatives, Clinton will have drawn a line in the sand by 
taking a stand for the bill. A tough White House posture would scare opponents, 
rally environmentalists and set a new tone for a welter of environmental 
legislation to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But if, in their eyes, the President ducks the fight and allows Congress to 
lower drinking water standards, environmentalists say the future of relations 
may be irreparably harmed. And that, in turn, could prompt the nation's green 
groups to sit out Clinton's reelection campaign, as well as a few races that 
are seen as important to his fate -- like California's gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
 How did it come to this? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a measure of the current ferment in relations between the Clinton 
Administration and the environmental community that the reauthorization of an 
obscure law like the Safe Drinking Water Act has become a potential turning 
point for the nation's environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly a dozen major pieces of environmental legislation on the 
congressional docket, green groups are reassessing the state of their relations 
with the Administration, as well as the political strategies they have pursued 
since Clinton entered the Oval Office promising a new era in environmental 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of disappointment on both sides, because neither side has done 
what it really should have done," said Carl Pope, executive director of the 
500,000-member Sierra Club. "We environmentalists have not been on the agenda: 
We kind of assumed there was a basic level of support -- which there wasn't -- 
and that the Administration was in the driver's seat with regard to Congress -- 
which it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we were naive," added Pope in an admission increasingly heard from 
environmentalists. "We didn't go out to the hustings to organize political 
support and pressure for our agenda. Many organizations still think you can go 
to Washington and get it all done. And you can't." 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years of Republican administrations, when environmentalists found the 
White House door virtually closed to them, the first year of the Clinton 
Administration brought them access to the President and personnel appointments 
that surpassed their fondest hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, said Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of Conservation 
Voters, there is a "broadly felt sense" among the green groups that the Clinton 
Administration's rhetorical embrace of their causes has not translated into 
clear policy victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole lot better than nothing," said Maddy of the Administration's 
first-year environmental efforts. But, he groused, "it wasn't a good start." 
</P>
<P>
 That year began when Clinton, facing a storm of Senate opposition, withdrew a 
proposal to raise fees charged to ranchers for grazing their livestock on 
federal lands -- a hike that had been hailed by the green groups. 
</P>
<P>
 That pattern continued when Clinton backed down on imposing a broad-gauged 
energy tax sought by environmentalists after congressional critics balked. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues as varied as pesticide reform, greenhouse gas reduction and a plan 
to clean up the Everglades, environmentalists lament that the Administration 
has reached for politically expedient compromises that pose risks to the 
environment and public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration over the Administration's record led Maddy's group in early 
February to issue Clinton an environmental report card with a decidedly 
lackluster grade of C-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was stung by the mark, according to several senior Administration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt," said one frustrated aide in a leading environmental slot. "It hurt 
everybody" inside and out of the Administration, the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Administration's defense, officials pointed to the environmental 
stature of its appointees, the ambition of Clinton's agenda and the access and 
consideration accorded to green groups in Administration deliberations. But 
they also complained of the environmentalists' "overly optimistic view of what 
could be accomplished" and the depth of opposition many of the measures have 
encountered on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming months, Pope said, will be crucial in shaping the Administration's 
long-term relationship with environmentalists. "I do not believe that the 
disappointment has yet moved to alienation," Pope said. "It could, if it 
doesn't get better in the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no coincidence that the next six months also will be a pivotal time for 
an array of environmental initiatives in which the Administration will play a 
key role. The Safe Drinking Water Act is only one of almost a dozen bills 
making their tortuous way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That act would lay out new standards for the purity of tap water -- an 
environmental and public health issue on which green groups see the potential 
for a groundswell of popular support. Citing the expense of screening for many 
of the water-contaminants now regulated by the federal government, local 
water-management agencies and the National Governors' Assn. are arguing for a 
relaxation of some of the standards. At the same time, environmentalists are 
seeking tougher standards for certain contaminants that pose special dangers to 
children and pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft House and Senate bills differ, and environmentalists fear that nothing 
short of a high-level intervention by the Administration will head off changes 
to the safe water act that they charge could cause public health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pieces of legislation range from overhaul of the Superfund toxic waste 
cleanup program to mining reform and tougher regulation of agricultural 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the initiatives face opposition from a loose coalition of 
well-funded and well-organized special interests determined to slow what they 
see as the relentless march of environmental regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are groups dedicated to upholding private-property rights, heading 
off unfunded federal mandates and protecting the financial stakes of industries 
that could face stricter regulation under the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House's response, in the environmentalists' view, has been 
consistent and disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently citing the need to jump start a stalled political process, the 
White House has brokered one compromise after another with the opponents of its 
environmental initiatives. As they have done so, the environmentalists' initial 
wave of almost giddy excitement has turned to disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Clinton and (Vice President Al) Gore have hired people in important 
positions who have the exact right instincts," said Jane Perkins, president of 
Friends of the Earth. "The problem is that this Administration is driven by 
politics, not instincts. And politics is compromise. While we have a meeting of 
spirit and ideals, these initiatives are not playing out to produce measures 
that we can support." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting disappointment has prompted environmentalists to rethink their 
strategy of relying on Congress and the Administration to deliver the measures 
they hold so dear. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are hoping to rebuild their political clout -- not in 
Washington, where they have reaped modest results in recent months, but at the 
local level, where the environmental movement first gained its strength and 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know now that we need a new path. We know our current strategy is not 
working -- we're not winning," said Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness 
Society. "We've dropped the ball. We've forgotten about grass-roots. And we 
need to address that." 
</P>
<P>
 Complained one Administration environmentalist who welcomes the new strategy: 
"The crowd . . . fighting this legislation is out in the hustings organizing 
acre-by-acre, while the environmentalists are jostling to get into pictures 
with Al Gore. There is no power in Washington unless you can deliver back home, 
and that's what the environmental community needs to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George Miller, (D-Martinez), who has pressed the environmentalists to 
refocus their political efforts, said that the shift "will take muscle, 
organization, someone going to town halls and raising these issues to put them 
on the agenda back home." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be an especially challenging time to pursue that strategy, since 
membership in environmental groups has been sliding for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, opinion polls indicate that Americans' sense of urgency 
about environmental issues has lessened. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1993, just over one-fifth of Americans surveyed in a poll conducted by the 
Roper Organization identified themselves as active environmentalists, down from 
29% the year before. Americans' demand for further regulation was down, the 
poll found. And in a 1993 Harris poll, the number of respondents saying this 
country should be doing more to protect the environment dropped from a high of 
97% in 1988 to 82% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed grass-roots strategy, environmentalists said, is designed to 
achieve two related objectives: provide a counterweight to the growing 
political voice of groups seeking to slow and reverse environmental legislation 
and, more important, to convince the Administration and many lawmakers that 
environmentalists are a political force to be respected and feared, not just 
admired and stroked and invited to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 If the grass-roots efforts can do that, environmental strategists said, then 
Clinton and Capitol Hill lawmakers will think twice before rolling over on 
initiatives important to the green groups. Conversely, if politicians fight for 
environmental causes, the grass-roots will come out and fight for them at 
election time. And if they do roll over, the grass-roots will withhold their 
contributions, their organizational help and their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the threat that such a strategy implies, environmentalists within the 
Administration said they would welcome a political revival of the greens in the 
hustings. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials said that in negotiations, grass-roots pressure would help 
strengthen the hand of an Administration that has been battered by opposition 
to so many of its environmental initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all for that," said one Administration strategist of the 
environmentalists' back-to-the-grass-roots strategy. "Clearly the other side is 
better organized out there right now" than are the environmentalists. Those 
opposing much of Clinton's environmental reform "are well-funded and organized 
and they really let us know what they're thinking. Having a grass-roots 
constituency telling Congress that those are bad ideas would really help." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Perkins of Friends of the Earth: "There was this feeling that maybe we 
could 'just let Al (Gore) do it.' Well, there's a growing realization that Al 
needs help."

STATE MAKES BIG STRIDES IN TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Could it be that the state that produces more smog and more prison inmates, 
that suffered through the deepest recession and ran up the most expensive 
streak of natural disasters in the country, is suddenly showing signs of 
moderation? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not in all things. But for the past five years, Californians have been 
making less garbage. So much less that officials are predicting that the state 
will have lightened the load trucked off to landfills by 25%, or nearly 12 
million tons, by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 California still generates more garbage than any other state. Its 45 million 
tons a year is enough to fill a four-lane highway from Oregon to Mexico four 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the trend continues, the state's place atop the throwaway culture could 
be in peril by 2000. That is when waste management officials in Sacramento hope 
to see garbage tonnage reduced 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the reduction can be credited partly to the recession. People with 
less to consume have less to throw away. But that is only part of the story. 
Recycling, once a novelty, now is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, when the Legislature decided to launch a campaign against the 
rising accumulation of garbage that was threatening to use up remaining 
landfill space within 20 years, only 35 curbside recycling programs existed in 
the state. Today, there are 470 serving 4.5 million single-family households. 
The number includes about 580,000 households in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for change came from legislation passed in 1989 that created the 
California Waste Management Board and gave it the authority to require hundreds 
of municipalities to develop plans to reduce, reuse or recycle solid waste. The 
board was given the power to impose fines of up to $10,000 a day on cities and 
counties that did not submit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also was given the power of the purse to stimulate the creation or 
expansion of recycling businesses. It has authorized $7 million in low-interest 
loans to a score of businesses employing 300 people. These businesses are 
expected to handle about 800,000 tons of recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the board, nearly 21% of the state's solid waste -- from 
newspapers, grocery bags, glass bottles and plastic containers to uneaten food, 
lawn shavings, tin cans and tires -- is being recycled, putting the 25% 
statewide goal within reach by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, not every city and county in the state will meet the 25% 
goal, as envisioned by the 1989 law, said Jesse Huff, chairman of the waste 
management board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some communities are ahead of their counterparts," Huff said. "But there are 
some places in financially strapped rural areas that have asked the board for a 
reduced goal, and, in some instances, we have granted that."  
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups that keep an eye on the garbage issue are cautiously 
optimistic that the goals can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Integrated Waste Management Board is basing its prediction for 1995 on 
projections, not on hard data," said Lance King of the nonprofit Californians 
Against Waste. "We won't have the full picture until the end of this year when 
the data from around the state will be in." 
</P>
<P>
 But King pointed to several indications that the state will meet its 25% goal 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Local governments, private waste haulers and private industry together have 
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to achieve the goals set by the state," 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
 As further evidence, he pointed to the success of the 1986 bottle bill, which 
called for recycling 80% of all beverage containers. For the third year in a 
row, King said, Californians have exceeded the rate by recycling 11 to 12 
million bottles annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece of legislation, a 1991 newsprint recycling law, also is playing 
a key role in the campaign to cut down garbage, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which requires that 25% of newsprint be composed of recycled fiber, 
led to a $750-million investment in recycling facilities by paper mills in the 
West, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this shows people are squarely behind recycling," he said. "In 
California, it's safe to say you now have more people recycling than voting." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 529 communities required to submit plans for municipal recycling 
programs, only 30 have not complied, said Pat Macht, deputy director of the 
waste management board. 
</P>
<P>
 Macht said most communities have spent between $25,000 and $100,000 to prepare 
their plans. A few places, such as Los Angeles, have spent a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent $2.5 million to develop a plan for diverting solid waste 
from local landfills. In addition to curbside recycling for single-family 
homes, the city has set up a network of groups to provide businesses with 
information they need to recycle commercial and industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Macht said it is natural for Southern California cities to take the lead 
because half the garbage in the state is generated by Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Joan Edwards, the head of the city's solid waste management 
office, Los Angeles in 1990 was recycling about 21% of the nearly 5 million 
tons of garbage generated each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every reason to believe we are going to meet the 25% goal," Edwards 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said surveys by her office indicate that a majority of businesses 
contacted have begun to recycle waste. She also said the city's slow-starting 
household recycling program is making progress, adding that about 9% of the 
household garbage picked up by the city is being recycled compared to 1% four 
years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials are also optimistic about meeting the 25% goal, 
even though the county will have to nearly double the 2 million tons of garbage 
it was recycling in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Noyes, deputy director of the county public works department, 
cautioned that meeting the 50% goal in six years is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, we are going to have to have more involvement by business and 
industry," Noyes said. "The market for recycled material still isn't that good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still cheaper to produce an aluminum can than to make a new one from 
recycled aluminum."

20 MOST UNSAFE STATE BUILDINGS ARE IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years after voters approved bonds to strengthen government buildings, the 
Wilson Administration on Friday identified the 20 most seismically unsafe state 
buildings in California, including three in Downtown Los Angeles that it 
singled out for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other structures most in need of repair are a San Quentin prison block, 
a complex of nine buildings at Camarillo State Hospital and a prison 
administration building at Norco, according to the long-awaited report issued 
by the state Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rankings, State Architect Harry C. Hallenbeck sought to reassure 
the public as well as those working in the buildings, saying that none of the 
top-ranking buildings are unsafe to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that we have seen so far produces any imminent concern" for people 
who work in the buildings, Hallenbeck said. "However, we shouldn't delay" 
retrofitting or replacing the buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Legislature, the Wilson Administration urged lawmakers to 
immediately earmark $195 million in remaining bond funds to strengthen or 
reconstruct the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallenbeck said he does not believe that any of the state buildings identified 
on the list were damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. "None of them 
appear to have any significant damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When voters approved $250 million in bonds in 1990, authorities said the 
ranking of 14,000 state buildings would be completed in two years. But the 
process became mired in red tape and even now only 6,800 buildings have been 
inspected, Hallenbeck acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 As the state was preparing its rankings, lawmakers earmarked more than $50 
million for pet projects, including improvements to the Museum of Science and 
Industry in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 quake, state engineers scrambled to finish the report -- 
saying it would be completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the factors considered in ranking the buildings were location in 
seismically active areas, the number of people who occupy the building and how 
much the structure is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the three Downtown Los Angeles structures, tearing them down 
and rebuilding was deemed to be less costly than trying to retrofit and 
strengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first on the list was the Junipero Serra State Office Building on South 
Broadway, which was recommended for demolition at a cost of $40 million, 
including $32 million to relocate electrical and communications equipment. 
About 3,000 people work in that building. 
</P>

O.C. HOSPITAL ON STATE LIST OF SEISMIC RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years after voters approved bonds to strengthen government buildings, the 
Wilson Administration on Friday identified the most seismically unsafe state 
buildings in California, including one at the Fairview Developmental Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairview building, which houses 185 profoundly retarded patients, was the 
only one listed in Orange County. The cost of retrofitting it was set at $6.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Kohler, Fairview's executive director, said the ranking caught him by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've received nothing previously of any building being seismically unsafe 
here," Kohler said Friday night. "But as soon as we find out more about the 
report, we will do our own investigating about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other structures most in need of repair are a San Quentin prison 
block, a complex of nine buildings at Camarillo State Hospital and a prison 
administration building at Norco, according to the long-awaited report issued 
by the state Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rankings, State Architect Harry C. Hallenbeck sought to reassure 
the public as well as those working in the buildings that none of the 
top-ranking buildings are unsafe to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that we have seen so far produces any imminent concern" for people 
who work in the buildings, Hallenbeck said. "However, we shouldn't delay" 
retrofitting or replacing the buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview's building was given a risk rating of 4, with 7 being most dangerous 
(no buildings received higher than a 6). According to General Services, the 4 
rating indicates the building could suffer moderate structural damage in an 
earthquake and would need substantial repair. However, the report does not say 
what size earthquake would cause such damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview, one of seven centers for the developmentally disabled operated by 
the state, suffered only surface cracks in an earlier earthquake, Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did get an environmental architect out to check the buildings, even though 
we didn't have any problems with our buildings or systems," Kohler said. "Other 
than surface cracks and chips in paints, that's all there was. Repair after 
that quake was lath and plaster and paint. So, I'm wondering if it was put on 
the list for that or because it was built so long ago, in 1957." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohler said that Fairview has 1,015 patients living in 31 buildings. The 
building in question is four stories high and has 130,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Legislature, the Wilson Administration urged lawmakers to 
immediately earmark $194.5 million in remaining bond funds to strengthen or 
reconstruct the 19 buildings on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first and second were the Junipero Serra State Office Building on South 
Broadway and the Caltrans district office on Spring Street, both in downtown 
Los Angeles and both recommended for demolition. The report also recommends 
demolition of the South Hill Street parking garage in downtown Los Angeles and 
the San Diego State Office building on Front Street in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallenbeck said he does not believe that any of the state buildings identified 
on the list were damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. "None of them 
appear to have any significant damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved $250 million in bonds in 1990 for seismic strengthening of 
state buildings, and at the time authorities said the ranking of 14,000 state 
buildings would be completed in two years. But the process became mired in red 
tape and only 6,800 of the most heavily used and highest-risk buildings have 
been inspected, Hallenbeck acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, state engineers scrambled to finish the report. 
Among the risk factors considered in ranking the buildings were location in 
seismically active areas, the number of people who occupy the building and how 
much the structure is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, buildings on the list already were scheduled to be repaired or 
replaced as part of long-term state plans. Such work is likely to happen more 
quickly after being designated on the list released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains unclear how quickly any of the recommended work will get done. 
Faced with a list of specific structures in need of seismic strengthening, the 
Legislature will be under pressure to take action.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if lawmakers agree quickly to follow the recommendations and appropriate 
the funds, repairs could not begin much before next year, according to Greg 
Sandin, a spokesman for the Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature also could re-examine the list of projects and choose to 
allocate the bond money for work on buildings of higher priority for lawmakers. 
Even as the state was preparing its rankings, lawmakers earmarked more than $50 
million for pet projects, including improvements to the Museum of Science and 
Industry in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, planning funds have been set aside to replace a state office 
building damaged in the San Francisco district of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Influential legislators also have proposed using the bond funds to buttress a 
legislative office building near the Capitol, even though it is not in an area 
as seismically active as Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the three downtown Los Angeles structures, demolition and 
rebuilding was deemed to be less costly than trying to retrofit.  
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first on the list was the Junipero Serra State Office Building, which 
was recommended for demolition at a cost of $40 million, including $32 million 
to relocate electrical and communications equipment. About 3,000 people 
currently work in that building, and they would be relocated to other state 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Second was the Caltrans district office on Spring Street, which would be 
rebuilt on the site of the Serra State Office Building. The $77-million cost of 
the project would be paid from transportation funds, not seismic bond money. 
About 3,000 people work in the Caltrans building. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the structures recommended for a full retrofitting, which includes 
electrical and plumbing improvements, are two complexes at the Metropolitan 
State Hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Another complex of buildings at the Norwalk hospital was recommended to 
receive a less sweeping structural retrofitting, as was the Veterans Memorial 
State Office Building in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the prison building at San Quentin, two buildings at the Norco 
Correctional Institution are slated for structural retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 One Senate aide familiar with the ranking questioned why limited bond funds 
should be funneled to make improvements at prisons when the Department of 
Corrections already has a large prison construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Hallenbeck said he was not directed to distinguish among the types 
of state buildings at risk.

FRESH GRAVES, FEAR MARK APPROACH OF S. AFRICA VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apostle Mkezi's muscled workers, shirtless and sweating beneath the African 
sun, dug deeply into the rich black soil of Natal province Friday, preparing 
two dozen graves for the latest victims of pre-election violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cemetery is almost full," said Mkezi, the caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, the green hillside was rippled with fresh graves, humps of earth 
marked by numbered metal stakes. Nine of the new ones are for a family 
massacred two weeks ago by Inkatha Freedom Party supporters. Some of the others 
are for people killed by Inkatha's rival, the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is filling fast," Mkezi said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 With just 10 days remaining before South Africa's first free elections, the 
bloody province of Natal is gripped by deep fear and uncertainty. This week, 
eight young black men distributing election information pamphlets were tortured 
and then slain by Inkatha supporters in Ndwedwe. The daily killing, on both 
sides, continues, with an estimated 200 deaths since a state of emergency was 
declared in the province April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reconcile the lone holdout -- Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's 
Inkatha -- with the parties participating in the April 26-28 election have 
failed miserably so far. An international mediation team headed by former U.S. 
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger threw up its hands and decided to leave 
this week, two days after it had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the question facing many of the 6 million black people who live in Natal 
is not whom to vote for but whether to vote at all. With Inkatha demanding an 
election boycott, people in areas controlled by that party will be risking 
their lives just by being seen leaving their homes on the election days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to vote, but I don't think I'll be able to," said Patricia Mavundla, 
32, who lives in one of the rural villages that dot the hills and valleys west 
of Port Shepstone. "We can go to the voting place and back safely, but what 
happens during the night? What safety do we have?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lush valleys of the South Coast, just inland from the Indian Ocean, have 
long been among the bloodiest in the Inkatha-ANC war. The landscape is dotted 
with the empty homes of Inkatha, ANC and nonpolitical people who have fled. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, tit-for-tat violence has driven refugees into Port Shepstone and 
other coastal communities about 90 miles south of Durban. After a recent spate 
of attacks and counterattacks, more than 5,000 people began spending their 
nights hidden in tall weeds, in the sugar cane fields and on the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Political differences among Zulus have played a part in the violence in Natal, 
where 20,000 people have been killed over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other causes too. Many attacks stem from inter-clan rivalries, 
vengeance and generational battles between older chiefs and rebellious youth 
who reject the cultural traditions of their Zulu ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, a charity known as Practical Ministries has helped victims of 
violence on the South Coast from its offices in Port Shepstone. They have 
provided shelter and food for people forced to leave their homes as well as 
caskets and proper burials for victims of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Danny Chetty, who heads the charity and chairs the local peace 
committee, has sent 60 election workers into the field to try to forge better 
relations between the warring parties before the election. But he is not 
hopeful. In November, one of his assistants was killed. In February, one of his 
friends, another member of the peace committee, was also gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we're on the brink of civil war. Civil war is here already," 
Chetty said. "I'm scared. There is going to be a lot more misery and a lot more 
bloodshed. And I don't believe the police can control it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no party can claim to be above the violence, he said that Inkatha 
supporters in the region "have made it very clear how they will deal with 
people who dare to vote," Chetty added. "People are making the most outrageous 
statements and nothing is being done." 
</P>
<P>
 The local office of Inkatha, on the second floor of a run-down building in 
Port Shepstone, is headed by James Zulu, who has lost half a dozen members of 
his family in recent years to attacks by ANC supporters. He and his assistant, 
Sipho Gazu, whose home was burned down last year, walk the halls with pistols 
stuffed into the waists of their slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Inkatha's official position, Gazu and Zulu say they want the election 
date postponed, something that both the ANC and the government say is 
impossible. (Among other things, Inkatha is seeking pre-election guarantees of 
autonomy for the Zulu kingdom in Natal.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict a very, very big war," Gazu said Friday. "I'm very worried because 
the ANC doesn't want to listen. The ANC thinks it's already the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Gazu said he is urging Inkatha supporters to stay home on the election days: 
"We say forget about the election. How can you have a fair election when people 
are being killed?" 
</P>
<P>
 And, he warned, "if people go to vote, we don't know what is going to happen. 
They might come back to find their homes burned down." 
</P>
<P>
 The task of making the election work in South Africa belongs to the 
Independent Electoral Commission. But its job is especially difficult in Natal, 
where Inkatha-supporting chiefs have refused permission for polling stations in 
their villages, and police fear that they will not be able to prevent attacks 
on voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The election commission's office in Port Shepstone, now operating 24 hours a 
day, has nearly 200 employees. This week, the office scaled down the number of 
polling stations in the region, from 150 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are battling with the chiefs to get permission for the polling stations," 
said Eulalia Snyman, a commission spokeswoman in Port Shepstone. "But they 
don't want to talk to us. And we won't go into dangerous areas. If we feel the 
risk to our polling workers is too great, we are pulling out." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment," added Frank Taylor, the deputy head of Port Shepstone's 
elections office, "I think I've got an ulcer the size of a rugby ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials insist that there will be a safe place for everyone who 
wants to vote in Natal and that each polling station will be heavily guarded. A 
European observer mission has said that 65% of the people in Natal will be able 
to vote freely. But no one knows if even that is enough for the election to be 
declared free and fair in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem is likely to be transportation. The elections commission 
does not plan to provide rides for voters, and residents here say it is likely 
that taxi and bus drivers will choose to stay home during the election for fear 
of attacks on their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem will be protecting voters after they have voted. Many here 
worry that Inkatha supporters will be watching closely for people leaving their 
homes on the election days and may launch attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been considerable evidence of organized efforts to prevent people 
from voting," said Gay MacDougal, an American lawyer and commission member. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after a weeklong tour of Natal province, MacDougal said Friday that the 
commission was convinced that most residents there will at least have access to 
safe polling places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be difficult to come out. It may take more courage to vote here than, 
for example, in Philadelphia," she added. "But we're convinced that there are 
substantial numbers who want to vote, and I think we're all going to be 
pleasantly surprised by the turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. David Mthembu, who helps refugees from the violence on the South 
Coast, is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry," the 74-year-old pastor said. "This thing is going to cause a lot 
of blood all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Fisher, who runs a relief organization for refugee mothers and children 
south of Port Shepstone, also believes that violence is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be an exciting time, a period of big change in our country," 
Fisher said. "But we've all made up our minds that there's going to be trouble. 
It's all very, very sad."

<P>
INCREASE IN NATIONAL PARK FEES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the cusp of the peak vacation season, the National Park Service unveiled a 
plan Friday that could increase visitor fees at national parks to as much as $5 
per person and ease restrictions against the use of private or corporate funds 
on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, billed by the Clinton Administration as a reform of the park 
system, would eliminate congressional caps on park fees and give the Interior 
secretary, currently Bruce Babbitt, the authority to raise them unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Interior Department plan is approved by Congress -- in what promises to 
be an uphill fight -- it would abandon the system of charging fees by the 
carload and enable the department to assess an entry fee for each person in a 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the Death 
Valley National Monument in California could expect to pay $5 each, up from $5 
per carload or $3 per individual, if the plan is approved. (Sequoia and Kings 
Canyon are administered as one park and one visitor fee would be charged for 
entry to both.) 
</P>
<P>
 At some of the nation's most popular parks, like Grand Canyon National Park in 
Arizona or Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in Wyoming, individual 
entry fees would rise to $5, an increase of only $1. But the blanket $10 charge 
per car, which allowed inexpensive entry to larger groups traveling together, 
would be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Park Service would raise new funds by establishing higher 
user fees for camping, docking or use of horse trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said the proposal would increase overall revenues by $72 
million by 1996. In a significant departure from current practice, part of the 
money raised would be returned directly to the parks -- a reform that officials 
said would boost both the collection of the fees and the morale of overworked 
rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds would improve the rangers' ability to maintain park trails and other 
facilities, officials said, contending that rangers have increasingly had to 
cope with growing crowds and shrinking operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would also give broad authority to the Interior secretary to 
enter into cost-sharing and operating agreements with local governments, 
private organizations and corporations. Details were not spelled out.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe people are prepared to pay more" if they believe their park fees 
will improve the parks they visit, said George T. Frampton Jr., assistant 
secretary of the Interior. "This is the right way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan promises to stir controversy on Capitol Hill, where it would have 
to win approval before it could be implemented. Historically, Congress has been 
reluctant to give up authority over national park fees. 
</P>
<P>
 By giving the Interior secretary the discretion to set fees and seek the 
public-private partnerships, the plan would return park-management practices to 
those of the 1970s, before Congress established caps on entry fees. 
</P>
<P>
 National park booster groups hailed the proposal as a good start in upgrading 
the quality of the parks, but some environmentalists warned that fee increases 
could put the public lands out of reach of some citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to return a portion of the revenues directly to the parks also is 
likely to meet with opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current practice dictated by Congress, park funds are placed in a 
special account within the Treasury. The money, along with additional 
appropriations from Congress, is disbursed among the nation's 367 parks 
according to a formula submitted by the Interior Department and approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill proposed Friday would plow half of the newly raised revenues back 
into the parks directly. Park Service officials said that would give harried 
park rangers more incentive to collect fees -- a task that often goes undone 
while rangers deal with more pressing problems.  
</P>
<P>
 An Interior Department audit released Friday indicated that the government is 
losing as much as $105 million a year by failing to collect charges already 
authorized by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the audit, only $68 million in fees was collected in 1993 from 
273 million visitors to the parks, monuments and recreation areas -- an average 
of less than 25 cents per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said that while they would like to collect more fees, they 
often are forced to leave collection stations unmanned because they lack the 
funds to hire more collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the National Parks and Conservation Assn. -- an independent group 
of national park users -- estimated that the parks face a 
maintenance-and-repair bill of $2.2 billion -- a figure that continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Friday's proposal is approved, officials said, more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. George Miller (D-Martinez) and Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), both leading 
members of the House Natural Resources Committee, are working on a more 
comprehensive proposal to reform the Park Service and find new ways to keep up 
with long-term maintenance-and-repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "An increase of $72 million in fees isn't going to begin to deal with the 
backlog the National Park Service is now facing," said Kathy Westra, speaking 
for the National Parks and Conservation Assn. "The Congress is going to have to 
bite the bullet and look at budgetary solutions to these problems because fees 
are not going to do the whole trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Westra added that the association has deep reservations about proposals that 
would loosen the strictures against "partnerships" between the Park Service and 
private or corporate entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things that need to be looked at very closely before we go into 
that sort of thing," she said. "That leaves the door open to a lot of potential 
abuses that need to be thought about very carefully before rules are loosened." 
</P>
<P>
 While Park Service officials were vague about how those strictures should be 
loosened, they said the Administration would be careful to avoid the kinds of 
controversies encountered by the Ronald Reagan Administration when it proposed 
greater private-sector cooperation in the operation of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in this Administration wants to see 'Yosemite, Brought to you by 
Coca-Cola,' " Frampton said. Current Park Price List 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has asked Congress to impose $32 million in additional park 
fees, beginning next year. A look at the current system: 
</P>
<P>
 * Entrance fees: Charged at 136 national parks, monuments and historic sites. 
The entrance fees range from $2 a person to as much as $10 a carload at some of 
the most popular parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * User fees: Many parks and monuments also charge "user" fees, usually for 
special activities such as camping or guided tours. Parking is also considered 
a user fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Total revenue last year: $68 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Total visitors: 273 million 
</P>
<P>
 * Average charge per visitor: 25 cents

 Four years after voters approved bonds to strengthen government buildings, the 
Wilson Administration on Friday identified the most seismically unsafe state 
buildings in California, including three in Downtown Los Angeles that it 
singled out for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other structures most in need of repair are a San Quentin prison 
block, a complex of nine buildings at Camarillo State Hospital and a prison 
administration building at Norco, according to the long-awaited report issued 
by the state Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rankings, State Architect Harry C. Hallenbeck sought to reassure 
the public as well as those working in the buildings that none of the 
top-ranking buildings are unsafe to occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing that we have seen so far produces any imminent concern" for people 
who work in the buildings, Hallenbeck said. "However, we shouldn't delay" 
retrofitting or replacing the buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Legislature, the Wilson Administration urged lawmakers to 
immediately earmark $194.5 million in remaining bond funds to strengthen or 
reconstruct the 19 buildings on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first and second were the Junipero Serra State Office Building on South 
Broadway and the Caltrans district office on Spring Street, both in Downtown 
Los Angeles and both recommended for demolition. The report also recommends 
demolition of the South Hill Street parking garage in Downtown Los Angeles and 
the San Diego State Office building on Front Street in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallenbeck said he does not believe that any of the state buildings identified 
on the list were damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. "None of them 
appear to have any significant damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved $250 million in bonds in 1990 for seismic strengthening of 
state buildings, and at the time authorities said the ranking of 14,000 state 
buildings would be completed in two years. But the process became mired in red 
tape and only 6,800 of the most heavily used and highest-risk buildings have 
been inspected, Hallenbeck acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, state engineers scrambled to finish the report. 
Among the risk factors considered in ranking the buildings were location in 
seismically active areas, the number of people who occupy the building and how 
much the structure is used. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, buildings on the list already were scheduled to be repaired or 
replaced as part of long-term state plans. Such work is likely to happen more 
quickly after being designated on the list released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains unclear how quickly any of the recommended work will get done. 
Faced with a list of specific structures in need of seismic strengthening, the 
Legislature will be under pressure to take action.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if lawmakers agree quickly to follow the recommendations and appropriate 
the funds, repairs could not begin much before next year, according to Greg 
Sandin, a spokesman for the Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature also could re-examine the list of projects and choose to 
allocate the bond money for work on buildings of higher priority for lawmakers. 
Even as the state was preparing its rankings, lawmakers earmarked more than $50 
million for pet projects, including improvements to the Museum of Science and 
Industry in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, planning funds have been set aside to replace a state office 
building damaged in the San Francisco district of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Influential legislators also have proposed using the bond funds to buttress a 
legislative office building near the Capitol, even though it is not in an area 
as seismically active as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the three Downtown Los Angeles structures, demolition and 
rebuilding was deemed to be less costly than trying to retrofit.  
</P>
<P>
 Ranked first on the list was the Junipero Serra State Office Building, which 
was recommended for demolition at a cost of $40 million, including $32 million 
to relocate electrical and communications equipment. About 3,000 people 
currently work in that building, and they would be relocated to other state 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Second was the Caltrans district office on Spring Street, which would be 
rebuilt on the site of the Serra State Office Building. The $77-million cost of 
the project would be paid from transportation funds, not seismic bond money. 
About 3,000 people work in the Caltrans building. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the structures recommended for a full retrofitting, which includes 
electrical and plumbing improvements, are a receiving and treatment building at 
Fairview Development Center in Costa Mesa and two complexes of buildings at the 
Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Another complex of buildings at the Norwalk hospital was recommended to 
receive a less sweeping structural retrofitting, as was the Veterans Memorial 
State Office Building in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the prison building at San Quentin, two buildings at the Norco 
Correctional Institution are slated for structural retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 One Senate aide familiar with the ranking questioned why limited bond funds 
should be funneled to make improvements at prisons when the Department of 
Corrections already has a large prison construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Hallenbeck said he was not directed to distinguish among the types 
of state buildings at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The state review excluded structures in either of the state university 
systems, which have conducted their own reviews and are not eligible for money 
from this bond fund. The state also has prepared a separate list of local 
government projects eligible for $50 million from the bond funding.

RAMS TO SIGN 10-YEAR LEASE ON PRACTICE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing the specter of a court eviction, the Los Angeles Rams said Friday they 
were reluctantly agreeing to extend the lease for the team's practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement marks an abrupt reversal in the team's position and ends months 
of contentious negotiations, which have come to symbolize the turmoil between 
the Rams and Anaheim that heightened speculation the team is prepared to move 
to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically accepting a deal that we felt was unacceptable," said John 
Shaw, executive vice president for the Rams. He said he planned to sign the 
10-year lease late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram and city officials have been at loggerheads over the terms of the lease 
extension since the team's lease expired Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson said he was "just glad that we can finally put this 
issue aside and move on to the greater issue at hand of trying to keep the team 
here."  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' concession on the lease came amid eviction proceedings that were 
being pursued by the owner of the practice site, the Magnolia School District. 
Under a complicated arrangement, the city leases the property from the district 
and then sublets it to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Friday they were pleased that the protracted 
negotiations seemed to be settled, but they didn't want to get too excited 
until the deal is signed by the Rams and formally approved by the City Council 
at its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get overly enthused," said Paul S. Mercier, the 
superintendent for Magnolia School District. "This is good news and it's very 
encouraging, but I'll feel better when I see the signed papers. I want to be 
cautious. We've been through so much over this." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, and the deal is ultimately approved, district officials said 
they would drop the eviction lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if I can put this issue behind me and get on with 
educational issues," Mercier added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dissatisfied with the terms of the lease extension, the Rams also 
will be able to put the negotiations behind them and focus on two upcoming 
events critical to the team's success on the field: the annual draft of college 
players scheduled April 24-25 and the first mini-camp workouts April 28-May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting either without a fixed home base would have been difficult at best 
for a team that is trying to rebound from four consecutive losing seasons and 
hoping to compete well enough to maintain a fan base during what could be seen 
as a lame-duck season. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials Friday declined to say why they had reversed their position on 
the lease, which has five-year extension option. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the months of negotiations, city and district officials were 
stunned at the demands the team was making for the lease extension, especially 
since team officials openly admitted they are exploring the possibility of 
moving the franchise to a city with greater financial opportunities. Shaw has 
said he will exercise an escape clause in the team's stadium lease May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 City Attorney Jack L. White said he was perplexed by the Rams' reluctance to 
sign the lease extension because, in his view, the team had greatly improved it 
position over the previous lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lease extension, the city would subsidize about $3 million of the 
team's rent over the course of 10 years. The team would be able to break the 
lease at any time provided it gives at least six months' notice, pays $220,000 
and restores the practice site to its original condition. The city has agreed 
to pay about half of the estimated $1.2 to $1.5 million in restoration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the issue of the restoration costs and the penalty for breaking the 
lease that held up negotiations. Three times, the district set deadlines for 
the team to sign the lease or face eviction. Finally, on the third time, the 
district was unwilling to give the team any more time to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 City and school officials, however, said they thought the clauses were 
extremely fair, especially since the team was obligated to pay all restoration 
costs under the previous lease. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Rams yielded on the issues of restoration costs and the penalty 
to terminate the lease. Shaw, however, was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no renegotiation of any of the terms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw has also complained that the team's practice facility of 15 years is too 
old and needed to be improved. He said the city reneged on a pledge to spend $7 
million on improvements. City officials contend that such a promise was never 
made.

FIVE WORKERS' COMPENSATION JUDGES WARNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a report that instantly prompted calls for further investigation into the 
workers' compensation courts, state officials announced Friday that they have 
warned five of the system's judges about possible misconduct and vowed to 
tighten regulations to prevent any future wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up a yearlong inquiry, the state Division of Workers' Compensation 
found no evidence of criminal activity. But the agency concluded that three 
Orange County judges appear to have "unwittingly" violated ethics rules related 
to a trip to Hawaii while two other Southland judges broke state law by 
improperly accepting speaking fees from groups that appear before the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased that the most serious allegations proved to be unfounded rumor 
and innuendo," said Casey L. Young, administrative director of the Division of 
Workers' Compensation, referring to charges of bribery and money-laundering. 
"The most valuable lesson of this ordeal is the realization that the line 
between what is acceptable behavior and what is unacceptable is not always as 
clear as it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 But a key state lawmaker immediately called Young's promised 
regulation-tightening an inadequate response and said he would call for a 
criminal investigation, if Young does not take the action himself. Young had 
said he was not planning to refer the matter to authorities for a criminal 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmaker -- state Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), co-author of a workers' 
compensation reform measure passed last year -- argued that "strong 
accountability" is needed in the workers' compensation courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to statements that two judges "appear to have violated" state law 
and that three others "may have breached" the state code of judicial conduct, 
Leonard added: "It's weasel language that the public doesn't enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley R. Zax, chairman and chief executive of Zenith Insurance, one of the 
state's biggest workers' compensation insurers, added, "I don't think that 
Casey Young, who apparently found violations, can think that the matter is 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have a system where people are perceived to have violated the law, 
and there are facts to support it, and then it's excused," Zax said. "That 
doesn't equate to equal justice under the law to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five judges singled out in the report received "counseling 
letters," Young said, to clarify the applicable ethical rules and to warn them 
against doing anything that might create the perception of improper activity. 
He said the letters will become part of the judges' personnel records, adding 
that he could not release the names of the five judges because it was a 
personnel matter that, under state law, must remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division of Workers' Compensation began investigating last year after 
receiving a number of complaints about workers' compensation judges in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. By the time the inquiry was complete, Young said, 
the agency had reviewed numerous documents and interviewed dozens of witnesses 
related to 26 allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges included receiving bribes or improper compensation in the form of 
gifts, money and speaking fees from insurance company representatives, 
attorneys or doctors involved with cases pending before some of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also looked into the allegation that some members of the bench 
had outside business relationships with attorneys, lien collectors and 
physicians that created the potential for conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the inquiry centered on whether Ellen L. Flynn, the presiding 
judge of the Anaheim workers' compensation court, Adolph U. Molina, who heads 
the Santa Ana court, and at least two other Orange County judges, Andrew H. 
Nash and David L. Zimmerman, had improperly accepted a trip to Hawaii from a 
doctor whose cases regularly went before their courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges, who went to Hawaii to appear at a workers' compensation seminar, 
have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Molina has said that he paid for his own 
trip to avoid any conflict of interest, and Young noted that he has commended 
Molina for trying to follow proper procedures. Young wouldn't comment 
specifically about any of the other Orange County judges, but he called the 
trip to Hawaii inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors taking judges to Hawaii shouldn't happen," Young said. "It doesn't 
look good." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a summary of the investigation, only one judge reimbursed the 
doctor for all expenses related to the trip. Three others reimbursed the 
physician only for air fare and accepted hotel accommodations from him. In 
addition, the spouses of the judges accepted free air fare and accommodations 
paid for by the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators noted that the Fair Political Practices Commission had advised 
the judges they were under no obligation to report the trip on their 
state-mandated financial disclosure statements. But the FPPC also had warned 
the judges that if any of them received transportation or other gifts worth 
more than $250, they may have a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he would specifically recommend that the regulations be tightened 
for accepting accommodations and travel expenses from those involved in cases 
pending before workers' compensation courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Young said that the judges who went on the trip made an effort to 
ensure that they were acting properly and sought advice from the FPPC on 
whether taking the excursion would be proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Young blamed the conduct of the judges on ethical rules that are not clearly 
defined, particularly for speaking fees and conflicts of interest. "We need 
more standards to address these issues specifically," he said. "The law on 
conflicts of interest are too fuzzy. We are going to create these standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Young promised that his agency would draft a more specific code of conduct for 
workers' compensation judges with the help of the nationally known Josephson 
Institute of Ethics. The standards, he said, should be established by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation extended all the way up to the top judge in the workers' 
compensation system, Mark L. Kahn, who from his office in Van Nuys oversees the 
27 district courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, who carries the title of assistant chief of the Division of Workers' 
Compensation, was scrutinized for outside income he drew by giving speeches for 
a legal seminar firm he co-owns. Records show that in 1992, Kahn received 
profits of $70,000 from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kahn's lawyer, Fred J. Kumetz, said the judge was cleared of any 
wrongdoing and was not among the five singled out in the report. "My client has 
been fully vindicated," said Kumetz, who charged that insurance companies 
"instigated" the state investigation to intimidate judges that they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worker's Compensation Division is a unit of the state Department of 
Industrial Relations. Its statewide district courts resolve disputes between 
workers seeking benefits for on-the-job injuries and insurers and employers 
responsible for covering those costs.

COLUMN ONE; ADOPTING A TOUGHER POLICY; FOREIGN ADOPTIONS ARE BEING CURTAILED IN 
MANY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. ALARM AT CORRUPTION AND RUMORS OF RUTHLESS 
AMERICANS ON THE PROWL FOR TINY ORGAN DONORS ARE BEHIND THE CRACKDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to lurid rumors that keep popping up across Latin America, sinister 
foreigners are buying or stealing babies through bogus adoptions and taking 
them abroad to use as donors for organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Though never proven, such stories sometimes appear in print, raising waves of 
public panic and occasionally triggering violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, for example, Guatemalan villagers severely beat a woman from 
the United States who was rumored to have snatched a local child -- the 
youngster later turned up. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, these rumors give international adoption a bad name in this region, 
as do the bribery and fraud that sometimes accompany the adoption processes -- 
sticky strands in the complex web that has kept James Gagel captive here for 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Peruvian authorities arrested Gagel, a lawyer from New Jersey, in February, 
1992, and charged him with child trafficking. He spent a year in jail and is 
now barred from leaving the country as he awaits judgment on accusations that 
he headed a group that allegedly bought or kidnaped babies for Americans to 
adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel's Peruvian lawyer argues that there is "absolutely no factual basis" for 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel says he is the victim of persecution by corrupt, ignorant and xenophobic 
Peruvians. His trial has been repeatedly postponed by glitches in the judicial 
proceedings, which he likens to a fictional nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the middle, really, of a Kafka novel," he said over breakfast one day 
last month in a hotel cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, North Americans and Europeans have encountered controversy 
when they adopt babies in Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 While bribes are often useful and sometimes necessary to cut red tape, lawyers 
say, reports of falsification of documents and other fraud have triggered 
suspicions of baby buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions have also been fed by the recurring rumors of children being 
adopted by foreigners who want to exploit them not only for "spare parts" but 
as prostitutes or household servants. Gagel said a police commander who accused 
him of child trafficking claimed that adopted babies were sent to the United 
States for use in scientific experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel's case is symptomatic of a moral quandary faced today by many Latin 
American countries: International adoptions could save thousands of Latin 
American children from lives of misery or early death by neglect, but 
controversy and corruption raise troubling questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peruvian bureaucrats and judges, nervous about scandals, have sharply reduced 
the number of international adoptions in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Consulate in Lima, U.S. visas issued for children 
adopted here dropped from 620 in the 1991 fiscal year to 270 in 1992 and to 170 
in 1993. Since this fiscal year began Oct. 1, no Americans have been able to 
adopt Peruvian children. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, according to statistics compiled by CARE International, an 
estimated 68 of every 1,000 babies born in Peru die before they are a year old, 
compared to about 10 per 1,000 in the United States. Some Latin American 
countries have even higher infant mortality rates, such as neighboring Bolivia, 
with 89 per 1,000, according to CARE. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel, 37, reflected on such numbers as he finished a plate of sliced papaya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though adoption represents a small percentage, it does have its value to 
give a few of these children a good home, a good future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Peru and an increasing number of other countries of the region, 
sentiment against international adoptions and stricter new regulations are 
hindering the placement of babies in foreign homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Latin America is no longer as abundant a source of adopted U.S. 
children as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can say that there are fewer possibilities in all of these 
countries than before," said Heino Erichsen, executive director of Los Ninos, 
an international adoption agency in The Woodlands, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "An adopting couple has the simple idea of coming to the Third World, finding 
a child, loving it, raising it," Gagel said. "That idea meets with opposition 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, he said, includes nationalists who resent North Americans 
taking away children of the fatherland; leftists who see adoptions by Americans 
as Yankee imperialism; underpaid bureaucrats and judges with power over 
adoption paperwork who envy babies taken from the bottom of the social scale to 
foreign countries where they will live in relative luxury; some who envy 
adoption lawyers with new cars and cellular telephones, and others who carry on 
a long tradition of dislike for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of pleasure here in getting a gringo in your jaws and venting 
some of your centuries-old resentment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Peruvians who worry about international adoptions have anti-U.S. 
sentiments. Many merely want to prevent crooked deals that can result from a 
combination of unscrupulous lawyers, corrupt officials and foreign couples with 
money and a burning desire to be parents. "They combine to turn a child into an 
object of commerce, of deceit," a former juvenile judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peru, child-stealing rumors mesh nicely with a centuries-old folk myth 
about a diabolical being who drugs unwary people who venture out at night and 
extracts their body humors, or "greases." Called Pishtako in the native Quechua 
language of the Andean highlands, this bogyman was increasingly depicted as a 
white foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
 In 20th-Century versions, "greases" from the Pishtako's victims were exported 
to the United States to lubricate or fuel machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus, satellites supposedly were being fed by the 'grease' of Peruvians," 
said Luis Millones, an anthropologist and historian. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolving myth has fostered an antipathy toward adoption, Millones said. 
"The people are thinking, 'Why do they want these children?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The recurrent rumor of adoptions for "spare parts" was running strong in 1992 
when Gagel's arrest exploded in scandal on the front pages of Lima tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it must have seemed to some, was a real-life Pishtako caught in the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin American countries -- including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, 
Honduras, Paraguay and Guatemala -- have witnessed equally blustery storms of 
"baby-buying" and "baby-stealing" scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Guatemalan press right now is absolutely raving insane over this issue, 
in relation to using babies for body parts and for carrying drugs," said Gerry 
Fuller, an official in the State Department visa office. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman from the United States who was beaten in Guatemala last month was 
chased by villagers into a municipal building in the northern town of San 
Cristobal Verapaz and hit with machetes, clubs and metal pipes until she lost 
consciousness. June Weinstock, a 51-year-old environmentalist from Fairbanks, 
Alaska, remains in a coma and was airlifted to the United States on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last month, rumors of another U.S. woman's arrest for stealing a baby 
sparked disturbances in the Guatemalan village of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa. 
Villagers burned down the local police station and destroyed several vehicles, 
the Reuters news agency reported. It said at least 15 people were injured in 
clashes with police after rumors spread that the woman had paid several 
thousand dollars to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 In Honduras at the beginning of March, the government promised an 
investigation of unconfirmed reports that Honduran children were being sold 
abroad for organ transplants. Honduran police have reported raiding "fattening 
houses" where babies allegedly stolen or bought from poor mothers are cared for 
until they are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Honduras in January, 1987, that rumors of trafficking in children's 
organs were first published in a daily newspaper, according to a U.S. 
Information Service report. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1987, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published the Honduran story -- 
without noting that it had been denied by authorities. The Soviet news agency 
Tass sent the story around the world, and similar versions have been 
reappearing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 While such stories have raised public suspicions, clear evidence of corruption 
has been even more damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 In Peru, hardly anyone will deny that bribes have been paid to mothers, judges 
and other court officials, government attorneys and police. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people involved in this, in the child-trafficking 
Mafias," said Jaime Jesus, coordinator in Peru for the Stockholm-based Save the 
Children foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Peruvian adoption lawyer who asked that his name be withheld admitted that 
he has routinely bribed officials as a necessary means of making paperwork 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 He denied paying mothers for babies, but he acknowledged that he often gave 
women "gifts" after they gave up their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would give them enough to live on for two or three months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel, a 1982 Rutgers University law graduate with a record of public service 
in New Jersey and New York, denies that he ever gave gifts or bribes in 
exchange for a baby. In fact, he said, it was his refusal to pay bribes that 
led to his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Peru in 1989 on a Fulbright fellowship to help reform the criminal 
justice system and stayed on to start an international adoption service with a 
Peruvian lawyer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a tricky business in Peru, as in many Latin American countries. Red 
tape was massive. To get through, it often required bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel said the adoptions he handled were done in Peruvian provinces to avoid 
red tape and corruption in Lima. One of the papers required for an adoption was 
a police certificate to show that the baby was not a missing person. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel said Cmdr. Victor Prado, former head of the police missing persons 
bureau in Lima, charged $300 for each certificate, but Gagel refused to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same Cmdr. Prado who first accused Gagel and 22 Peruvians of 
operating a child-trafficking ring. The 22 included employees of Gagel's 
office, his lawyer-partner, foster mothers who took care of babies to be 
adopted and people whose names were "found in my card file, people I didn't 
even know," Gagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prado's police raided Gagel's home and office, confiscating papers and a 
computer. Prado himself arrested Gagel at 7:30 a.m. in his apartment, beating 
him and screaming obscenities, according to Gagel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagel pressed charges against Prado for a series of violations, but those 
charges were dismissed. The charges against Gagel, however, resulted in 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 The government attorney who brought the original charges said Gagel's "ring" 
had arranged thousands of irregular adoptions. Gagel said he arranged no more 
than 40, all by the book. He said a few Peruvian lawyers have reaped big 
profits from international adoptions but that he earned only a modest income 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
 The only biological mother who complained about one of his adoptions had been 
"reading stories about organ parts for transplants," he said. She was worried 
because she hadn't received a letter for several months from the adoptive 
parents, a professional couple in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, The Hague Conference on international law adopted a convention on 
adoptions that is intended to standardize legal processes from country to 
country, reducing red tape and guarding against irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries that ratify the convention must establish a central authority for 
overseeing adoptions and assuring that they comply with The Hague standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin American countries, including Peru, are preparing to ratify the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply, Peru has passed a new adoption law that empowers a Technical 
Secretariat for Adoption to determine the eligibility of children for adoption 
and to match them with eligible adopting parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began working in August, the new secretariat has awarded custody of 
children to 20 Peruvian couples and a single Canadian couple in the process of 
adopting. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer may private lawyers seek out mothers to give their babies up for 
adoption by clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the mother has to give it up to the government welfare agency, which they 
don't like to do," said Erichsen of Los Ninos, speaking by telephone from 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Valencia, a lawyer on the new Peruvian secretariat's board of directors, 
said some deceptive adoption lawyers used to induce foreign clients to spend up 
to $30,000 in fees and expenses for an adoption, including payments to 
biological mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are indications that there was a whole situation of corruption," 
Valencia said. "What we want to avoid is child trafficking -- that a mother is 
paid $500 for her child, or $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that adoption now is not "a fast process. You have to investigate. 
You have to publish notices." 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst observed that because officials no longer get bribes to speed 
things up, they naturally go slower. And because private lawyers no longer are 
permitted to shepherd paperwork through the bureaucracy and courts, the task 
falls to the secretariat's limited staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic observers say the secretariat has a tiny budget and that its few 
employees are underpaid and untrained. The secretariat operates only in Lima, 
so no adoptions can be done in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system now doesn't function," said Julio Lozano, Peruvian representative 
for the Spence Chapin adoption agency of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano said the only children his agency has been offered for adoption are 
more than 7 years old and have mental or physical handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is going to want to adopt a child with problems, especially at that age?" 
he asked, adding that the secretariat apparently does not want international 
adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretariat said its priority is to give babies to Peruvian couples ahead 
of foreign couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that about 100 couples in Lima are looking for babies and 
that only one adoption in 10 will be granted to foreigners until the Peruvian 
demand has been met. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't against international adoptions," Valencia said, "but we want them 
to be done under the strictest controls, the strictest judicial rules."

CSUN REPAIR ESTIMATES TOP $111 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first detailed breakdown of damage at Cal State Northridge from the 
January earthquake, a university consultant is estimating that repairing and 
rebuilding just 26 of the campus' more than 100 buildings could cost more than 
$111 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one-fourth of that amount, about $25.5 million, would go toward 
upgrading existing facilities or building new ones to comply with modern 
seismic safety and other codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not legally required to perform such upgrades as part of the repairs, 
Cal State and CSUN officials have said they intend to pursue that approach, 
particularly for heavily damaged buildings. But federal disaster officials have 
yet to detail how much money will be provided for that work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Chatham, CSUN's associate vice president for facilities planning and 
operations, said the first group of building-by-building damage survey reports 
by Law/Crandall Inc., a Los Angeles-based engineering firm, supports prior 
estimates by university officials that total campus damages could exceed $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chatham said four CSUN buildings with the most serious earthquake damage 
-- Oviatt Library, Administration, Fine Arts and South Library (now used as a 
computer center) -- will remain closed "more than a year." Engineering firms 
may take several months just to recommend repair techniques, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the final CSUN damage figure is in the $300-million range, as expected, the 
episode would become the costliest natural disaster ever for a U. S. 
university. With such high stakes, the university hired Law/Crandall, the West 
Coast operating arm of Atlanta-based Law Cos. Group, to manage the campus' 
earthquake damage assessment process. 
</P>
<P>
 The result thus far has been binder-sized reports for each major building on 
campus that detail structural, architectural, utility and other damage, as well 
as detailing the likely cost of needed repairs. The university made the first 
group of reports available for review this week, and more are expected in 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single items within the $111-million figure are replacement and 
rebuilding estimates for two facilities that the consultant has recommended be 
demolished because of severe quake damage: $27.3 million for parking structure 
C that partially collapsed in the Jan. 17 quake and $24.4 million for the 
high-rise University Tower Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they have not decided whether to follow the 
Law/Crandall demolition recommendation, nor whether the two structures would in 
fact be rebuilt if demolished. The reports for the two structures do not 
estimate what repair costs would be if the university were to pursue that 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Also factored into the cost estimates for all 26 structures in the first batch 
of reports -- 11 buildings and the 15 dormitories that make up the low-rise 
University Park Apartments on campus -- was a 20% overhead amount for "CSUN 
Administration." Law/Crandall officials said the university instructed them to 
use that amount in the estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the university overhead accounts for $2.5 million of the 
$15-million estimate for Oviatt Library and more than $1.5 million of the 
$9.4-million estimate for the Fine Arts Complex -- the most costly repair 
projects among the initial reports. Overhead typically would be the 
university's costs for managing the repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimates do not cover damage to movable contents within the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 And the consultant cautioned: "It should be stressed that the cost estimates 
contained in this report are conceptual and preliminary in nature. They are 
useful in preparing preliminary repair budgets. Actual repair costs may vary 
from these estimates." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the actual costs are different, the Law/Crandall reports give an early 
indication of the financial implications for the university if it ends up 
simply repairing many of its 20- to 35-year-old buildings, or takes the costly 
extra step of bringing them into compliance with modern safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least five buildings in the first batch of reports, the cost of 
bringing them up to current codes alone is more expensive than making the 
actual quake repairs. And, as a group, the $25.5-million amount Law/Crandall 
projected for code upgrade work amounts to 23% of the total estimated repair 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of the already upgraded Oviatt Library, Law/Crandall 
assumed code upgrade costs for all of the buildings in the first batch. But the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it will only fund such upgrades if 
structural damage exceeds certain levels. Law/Crandall did not assess the 
buildings using FEMA's standard. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's stance is crucial because the university is counting on the federal 
government to pay for 90% of the damages, with the state expected to fund the 
remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work with that right now," Chatham said of the code upgrade 
issue. "That's on the table. We'll be months or weeks or longer talking with 
FEMA about it." CSUN Repairs

$1.2-MILLION ANTONOVICH JUDGMENT SPURS ETHICS BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most politicians want to be remembered for their legislative accomplishments. 
But two bills pending in the state Senate would be a monument to Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's misconduct.  
</P>
<P>
 The bills, which recently hurtled through the Assembly with strong bipartisan 
support, would force politicians -- not taxpayers -- to foot the bill for court 
costs and damages that result from their illegal or unethical conduct. The 
legislation was inspired by outrage over the county's willingness to pay a 
$1.2-million civil judgment against Antonovich, who last year was found liable 
for conspiring to influence a judge on behalf of a campaign contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read that taxpayers could end up paying the $1.2-million judgment, I 
said, 'Wait a minute, why am I and my neighbors and my constituents paying for 
that?' " said Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), whose bill passed 
the Assembly on Thursday. "That's money that should be spent on law 
enforcement, libraries or lifeguards -- not to insulate an elected official 
from responsibility for his actions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowen's bill and a similar proposal by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Panorama City) would not apply retroactively to the Antonovich matter.  
</P>
<P>
 "It may be too late to do anything about the Antonovich case, but it's 
important to have ethics laws like these to let elected officials know up front 
what's not acceptable," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, whose 5th District includes all of the Antelope and most of the 
San Fernando valleys, has argued that he did nothing improper in telephoning 
Judge Eric Younger five years ago to offer a character reference on behalf of 
campaign donor Krikor Suri and his jewelry business partners, who were 
embroiled in a lawsuit with another partner. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign reports, Suri and his companies contributed $19,000 to 
Antonovich's campaigns from 1985 to 1989, loaned him $10,000 about a month 
before he called the judge and made a $3,000 contribution to his campaign four 
days before he spoke to Younger.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday, an Antonovich spokesman said the supervisor supports the proposed 
legislation because he believes it would help prevent what he considers 
nuisance lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as Mike is concerned, he played a 30-second role in a 13-year fight 
between Armenian businessmen," said Antonovich spokesman Dawson Oppenheimer. 
"The suit never would have been filed if it weren't for the county's deep 
pockets."  
</P>
<P>
 The reason the taxpayers could get stuck paying the bill for behavior that 
seemingly has nothing to do with Antonovich's elected duties lies in a legal 
doctrine that holds the government liable for any conduct that occurs within 
the course and scope of an employee or politician's official duties.  
</P>
<P>
 By agreement of all parties, county lawyers agreed to pay Antonovich's 
unspecified share of the $1.2 million in compensatory damages returned by a 
jury in exchange for a guarantee of immunity from punitive damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's bill, which the Assembly approved 56 to 8 earlier this week, would 
prohibit counties and other public entities from paying judgments for an 
elected official who is sued for trying to influence the outcome of judicial 
proceedings. Fourteen Republicans voted for it despite Antonovich's affiliation 
with the party.  
</P>
<P>
 The Katz bill, which passed 63 to 1 last month, is more broadly drawn and 
would apply to elected officials found liable for any inappropriate conduct, 
including sexual harassment. It would allow counties to pay judgments on behalf 
of an elected official but only after the official's financial resources had 
been exhausted. The measure was supported by 27 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elected officials should be held accountable for their behavior just like 
regular people," Katz said. "You shouldn't be able to hide behind an office and 
expect taxpayers to bail you out."  
</P>
<P>
 But one of the eight Republicans who voted against the Bowen bill accused Katz 
of targeting Antonovich to further his own political career. Assemblyman 
Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) said Katz could be positioning himself to run 
for Antonovich's seat on the Board of Supervisors -- a charge Katz vehemently 
denies.  
</P>
<P>
 "These bills are just a political shot at Supervisor Mike Antonovich," 
Mountjoy said.  
</P>
<P>
 But other Republicans who support the Katz and Bowen bills disagree.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't look at it as a partisan issue at all," said Assemblyman Nao 
Takasugi (R-Oxnard). "I just think it's the fair thing to do."

EUROPE; SEX EDUCATION IN CLASSROOM BECOMES POLITICAL IN BRITAIN; PARENTAL 
GROUPS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT A GRAPHIC PAMPHLET THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO CHILDREN 
AGES 9 TO 14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sex has once again become a political issue in Great Britain -- not senior 
officials caught in the wrong bedroom, but rather sex education in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of the storm is the Health Education Authority, a semiautonomous 
organization that among other things oversees the instruction pamphlets used in 
state schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major, already under fire 
from several fronts, is being accused by traditionalists of laxity in 
supervising how information about sex is taught to the nation's students. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began several weeks ago when the HEA, which underwrites 
publications in various health fields, gave its imprimatur to a pamphlet called 
"The Best Sex Guide," which included graphic descriptions of oral sex and other 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental groups immediately complained and urged a far-reaching review of all 
sex education leaflets -- insisting that they not be issued to schoolchildren 
until vetted by parents and school board governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the decentralized British system, the HEA can approve health education 
materials, but each local school principal decides which to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Best Sex Guide," which was designed for youths older than 16, was handed 
out at an afternoon school club for 9- to 14-year-olds. The book describes 
various sex acts, using slang words for genitals. However, there was nothing on 
the cover or inside the book to indicate that it was designed for those older 
than 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Another HEA-sanctioned book, "The Pocket Guide to Sex," was branded as 
"smutty" by Health Minister Brian Mawhinney, who banned it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the original dispute simmered, another booklet approved by the HEA came to 
light called "The 69 Bravest Sex Questions." It contained references to oral 
and anal sex, masturbation and vibrators. 
</P>
<P>
 It was accompanied by a computer disk called "The A to Z of Love and Sex," 
with graphics on sexual techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading member of the HEA, the Rt. Rev. Bill Westwood, bishop of 
Peterborough, who complained about the earlier publication, threatened to 
resign if the latest booklet and disk were not withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Morals campaigner Victoria Gillick complained: "This has opened up the market 
to every pornographer. If they can put HEA stickers on it, they will make a 
fortune. It is nothing more than a video nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Parliament also objected to the materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary John Patten said the government is planning new rules that 
would insist on more parental involvement in the content of sex education 
courses and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is much too much concentration on the plumbing and mechanics," he said, 
"and not enough on the relations of the emotions that are involved." 
</P>
<P>
 He said sex education should begin at home -- although almost every study has 
shown that most British parents are too embarrassed to explain sex to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Colombi, creator of "The A to Z of Love and Sex," countered that his 
publication "contains a message I very much want to get across -- that sex can 
be fun. It is not dirty or crude. It contains straightforward, factual 
information about sex for children, so they can decide what is right for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave a demonstration of the disk a few months ago at a sex education 
conference for parents, school governors and children, and they all seemed to 
approve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Family Planning Assn. Director Doreen Massey defended the distribution of sex 
guides to children, arguing: "Young people need information. If you look at the 
problem pages of any teen-age magazine, you will see much worse than anything 
in these books." 
</P>
<P>
 She and others point out that 44% of pregnant women in Britain today are 
unmarried -- and a large proportion are teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Margaret Morrisey, of the National Confederation of Parent-Teachers 
Assns., which represents 10 million parents, said: "This whole area needs 
re-examining. It is time to pull in every leaflet that goes out and start from 
scratch. Once children have been exposed to this sort of thing, we cannot erase 
it from their minds."

ASIA; BOAT FIRE THAT KILLED 24 TAIWAN TOURISTS STRAINS CHINA RELATIONS; 
INCIDENT EMBARRASSES BEIJING BY SPOTLIGHTING MOUNTING INSECURITY IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE.

<P>
 They came as cultural pilgrims, eager to see some of the fabled and sacred 
sites -- cloud-shrouded mountains and serene lakes enshrined in classical 
Chinese poetry -- that decades of hostility between Taiwan and China had 
previously blocked them from visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the package tour for 24 Taiwanese ended in fiery death on Qiandao 
(Thousand Island) Lake here in Zhejiang province late last month. Relatives who 
came to claim the bodies said mainland Chinese officials cremated the remains 
to hide what really happened in the March 31 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting outcry, joined by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui and other 
senior officials, has developed into a major setback to mainland-Taiwan 
relations after several years of gradual reconciliation between the Communist 
and Nationalist regimes. To the embarrassment of the Communist government in 
Beijing, the incident also spotlighted mounting insecurity in the Chinese 
countryside, where incidents involving armed gangs of brigands are increasingly 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Chinese government characterized the mid-lake fire -- which also 
claimed the lives of eight mainland Chinese crew members and tour guides -- on 
the pleasure boat as an accident. But under pressure from the Taiwanese 
government, mainland officials earlier this week reversed themselves, admitting 
that investigators had found "suspicious clues" pointing to the possibility of 
sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Taiwanese relatives who came to the mainland claimed that pirates 
had herded all of the tourists and crew below decks and then set the excursion 
boat ablaze. Other sources discounted the possibility of robbery as a motive, 
claiming that valuables were found on the charred bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If evidence confirms that the accident was staged," the official New China 
News Agency reported, "the culprits will be severely punished according to 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources here in Hangzhou, the scenic lakeside provincial capital, said 
Public Security Department investigators already have several suspects in 
custody. A spokesman for the provincial press office declined requests for 
interviews from a foreign reporter, claiming that the "incident is still under 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the extent of crime at popular tourist destinations was revealed in 
an April 11 statement by the provincial Ministry of Security Police in the 
official newspaper, Zhejiang Daily. The statement spoke of "frequent 
occurrences of major incidents in tourism areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Such admissions of uncontrolled crime are rare on the Chinese political scene. 
The ministry spokesman pledged that "security arrangements for scenic spots, 
tourism routes and sites will be reinforced" after the Qiandao Lake incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are several hundred million dollars in revenue that Taiwan tourists 
bring annually to the mainland. Last year, Taiwanese made 1.5 million visits to 
China, up from about 500,000 in 1989. The increase reflected the recent era of 
reconciliation. In 1993, Taiwanese visitors spent an estimated $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the principal destinations is this verdant land of rolling hills and 
lakes 100 miles southwest of Shanghai. The ill-fated Taiwanese tourists were on 
a typical excursion, beginning in the Huangshan (Yellow Mountains) in 
neighboring Anhui province, stopping in Qiandao for a cruise and overnight 
stay, and ending up here in Hangzhou on the banks of scenic Xihu (West Lake). 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the unexplained deaths and the anguish of relatives, the Taiwan 
Ministry of Tourism on Wednesday suspended all tours to the mainland beginning 
May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist mainland government attempted to smooth things over by holding 
an emergency meeting with Taiwan representatives with the Straits Exchange 
Foundation, which represents Taiwan interests on the mainland. In a statement 
issued Thursday, the two sides said they had reached an understanding that the 
investigation should be stepped up and the results made public. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Taiwan government made clear that it will not be satisfied with 
anything less than the arrest and prosecution of criminals it believes are 
behind the incident. For the Chinese government, struggling recently to 
maintain order in a sea of economic growth and political uneasiness, such an 
admission that it lacks control may be too high a price to pay. Tragic Trip 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese tourists' trip began in the Huangshan (Yellow Mountains) and 
ended in fiery death on Qiandao Lake.

ONASSIS IN N.Y. HOSPITAL FOR CANCER THERAPY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who is suffering from cancer of the lymph system, 
has been hospitalized for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is expected to be here for several days," said Myrna Manners, a 
spokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Manners would not say what kind of treatment the former First Lady was 
receiving or when she was admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy family spokeswoman Nancy Tuckerman did not return telephone calls 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis, 64, announced in February that she was suffering from non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma. Tuckerman said then that doctors thought they had caught the cancer 
in its early stages when it was diagnosed in January. 
</P>
<P>
 American Cancer Society statistics predict that 45,000 Americans will develop 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma this year and that 52% of them will survive for at least 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the subtype of lymphoma, it may be treated with chemotherapy or 
radiation, or with a combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Harmon Eyre, the society's chief medical officer, said in February that 
Onassis underwent only chemotherapy.

KING ASSASSIN WINS FIGHT TO CALL WITNESSES; LAW: A JUDGE RULES THAT JAMES EARL 
RAY CAN ALSO PRESENT EVIDENCE TO TRY TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE. PROCESS WILL NOT 
OVERTURN CONVICTION IN 1968 MURDER. 
</P>

<P>
 After 25 years, the confessed killer of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. won a 
judge's permission Friday to call witnesses and present evidence in court to 
try to prove his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 James Earl Ray has been trying unsuccessfully to take back his guilty plea and 
go to trial since shortly after he confessed in 1969 to murdering the civil 
rights leader on April 4, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal Court Judge Joseph Brown rejected Ray's latest plea for a trial but 
agreed to let his lawyers question witnesses and present other courtroom 
evidence to prepare an appeal of that rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's it been going on? A quarter of a century so far? A few more months 
won't hurt one way or the other," Brown said. "Let the historical record be 
cleared up." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a process will not overturn Ray's conviction or free him from prison, 
where he is serving a 99-year sentence. But it will give him his first chance 
since his guilty plea to compel witnesses to testify and to have that testimony 
under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he hopes to help clear up questions, including claims of a 
conspiracy, that have festered since King was shot and killed while standing on 
a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. House Committee on Assassinations looked into King's murder and 
concluded in 1978 that Ray was the killer but may have been helped by others. 
The committee's records are sealed until the year 2029. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he was bound by state law to uphold Ray's conviction and reject his 
plea for a trial. There was no evidence that Ray's confession was other than 
freely given, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer William Pepper said he planned to call up to 40 witnesses but 
doubted that Ray would be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, 66, contends he was duped into taking part in the assassination. He has 
argued that he was set up by a shadowy figure he knew only as Raoul. He 
admitted buying the weapon that authorities identify as the one used to kill 
King, but says he bought it for Raoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor John Pierotti said his investigators have found no evidence to 
support Ray's claim of new evidence proving his innocence.

BUSH CALLS CANING 'BRUTAL' BUT URGES RESPECT FOR LAW; SINGAPORE: HE DOES NOT 
PUBLICLY APPEAL FOR LENIENCY FOR AMERICAN YOUTH SENTENCED TO BEATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President George Bush said Friday that he considers caning brutal and 
would not advocate it for his country, but stopped well short of a public 
appeal for Singapore to reconsider caning an American teen-age vandal. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bush may have said behind the scenes in meetings with government leaders 
was not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 A Singapore court last month sentenced 18-year-old Michael Fay to six strokes 
of the cane, four months in jail and a fine of $2,000 for spray-painting cars 
and other offenses. A high court appeal of the sentence was rejected, and Fay's 
final option is an appeal to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong. 
</P>
<P>
 In his major speech here, a luncheon talk to 800 government leaders, diplomats 
and selected customers of Citibank, his visit's sponsor, Bush offered general 
praise for Singapore, saying: "You have much to teach us." 
</P>
<P>
 He did not raise the caning issue, and no questions about it were asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, however, in a talk to a much smaller group of students, 
Bush said: "Caning is brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 He said some people would say the death penalty is even more brutal, though he 
does support that for serious offenses such as drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 "You follow and respect the law of the country but that does not mean you have 
to agree with everything," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the students: "If one in public life wants to influence the 
government it is almost in every instance . . . better, more effective to do 
that with a government official through quiet diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, President Clinton told a news conference: "If he (Bush) decides 
to say something supportive of the absence of caning, I would certainly be 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times on Wednesday urged major U.S. companies with Singapore 
subsidiaries to press Ong to cancel the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But David Williams, assistant vice president and Asia Pacific zone manager of 
the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, said it should not be the 
responsibility of U.S. businesses to speak out against the caning.

BLOODSHED CONTINUES IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marauding gangs of youths armed with machetes roamed the bloody streets of the 
Rwandan capital again Friday, adding new bodies to the piles of decaying 
corpses already fouling the air. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Moctar Gueye said Rwanda's Hutu-dominated government and 
predominantly Tutsi rebels agreed to direct talks that U.N. officials hoped 
would lead to a cease-fire. But the two sides continued to duel for control of 
Kigali, the capital, with mortars and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 New reports of massacres emerged from the Rwandan blood bath, including an 
account of more than 1,000 men, women and children shot and hacked to death in 
a church where they sought refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people were still trying to flee Kigali, forming an 
eight-mile-long column of refugees, and thousands more remained huddled in 
hiding with little or no food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of thousands of people cut off from anything decent or 
human," Gueye said by telephone from Kigali. "People are starving to death in 
their own houses. Babies have starved to death in their own homes. People are 
in hiding and cannot find food. Hospitals are not functioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of people are estimated to have died in a week of fighting 
rooted in the decades-old feud between Rwanda's majority Hutu and minority 
Tutsi ethnic groups. Many have been hacked to death by gangs with machetes, 
knives and spears. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 12,000 people were under U.N. protection at Kigali's national stadium 
and at the main King Faisal Hospital. But Gueye said the lightly armed U.N. 
peacekeepers did not have the resources to cope with the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no safe refuge for people fleeing the ethnic slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian news media reported that nearly 1,200 Tutsi, more than half of them 
children, were massacred Wednesday at a church in Musha, 25 miles east of 
Kigali. It was the largest reported massacre so far in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gueye said the United Nations received reports of the massacre but had not 
been able to confirm it. "We have received many, many reports of that nature, 
but our forces are stretched to the maximum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gueye said that after the withdrawal of 428 Belgian soldiers protecting 
Kigali's airport, there would be about 2,090 foreign soldiers left in the 
country.

KIEV-MOSCOW PACT GIVES RUSSIA MOST OF BLACK SEA FLEET; ACCORD: AGREEMENT 
DEFUSES VOLATILE SITUATION. UKRAINE WAS APPROACHING A SHOWDOWN OVER THE 
DISPUTED ARMADA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week after their sailors came to the brink of armed conflict, 
Russia and Ukraine announced a tentative agreement Friday to give Russia the 
bulk of the disputed Black Sea Fleet and a leased naval base on Ukrainian 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastily drafted after a summit meeting of the 12-nation Commonwealth of 
Independent States, the accord was signed here by the Russian and Ukrainian 
presidents in a move to defuse the most serious military showdown between the 
Soviet Union's mightiest successor states. 
</P>
<P>
 At the summit itself, Commonwealth leaders declared their readiness to send 
peacekeepers to halt ethnic conflicts in Georgia and Azerbaijan and extended 
the mandate of a Russian-led force to defend the government of Tajikistan 
against Tajik rebels based in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 While those conflicts have taken tens of thousands of lives, it is the 
bloodless tension between Ukraine and Russia, both armed with Soviet nuclear 
weapons, that poses the most serious threat to stability in the former Soviet 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from certain that the draft agreement signed Friday by Ukraine and 
Russia will be hammered out in final detail or ratified by their Parliaments. 
Half a dozen earlier accords -- first calling for dividing the former Soviet 
fleet 50-50 and then giving it all to Russia -- were scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 What distinguishes this deal from the others is that Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk has agreed, for the first time, to lease at least one Ukrainian 
naval port to Russia. Returning to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, he indicated 
that the port would be Sevastopol, the fleet's headquarters, on the Crimean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousands of (Russian) officers live in Sevastopol, their children, their 
families," he told reporters. "If we say they must leave Sevastopol, we could 
not propose new housing for them" elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement between Kravchuk and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
the two foreign ministries have 10 days to divide half a dozen bases, 70,000 
sailors and about 300 aging warships and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine will take what it can (financially) support and what it needs, 
strategically, according to our military doctrine" and sell the rest of its 50% 
share to Russia, Kravchuk said. Both sides said that means Ukraine will keep 
about 15% to 20% of the fleet's vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 While the fleet is nominally under joint command, Ukraine has not paid for its 
upkeep since December and owes Russia more than $3.2 billion for oil and gas. 
Financial pressures, along with the election this year of a pro-Russian 
separatist leader in Crimea, underlie the conflict that erupted within the 
fleet last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, Ukrainian ships tried to intercept a Russian research vessel 
leaving the Ukrainian port of Odessa with $10 million worth of navigational and 
marine equipment in what the Ukrainians called an act of piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The next evening, Ukrainian commandos seized a maintenance base near Odessa, 
arrested three Russian officers involved in Saturday's incident and reportedly 
roughed up some Russian sailors and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Russian units of the fleet have gone on combat alert at three 
other bases and sent amphibious landing craft to pick up Russian service 
personnel and their families at Odessa. The Ukrainian navy has put the Odessa 
base and a river patrol unit of the fleet under its direct control. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk said the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministries gave orders Friday 
to "put an end to incidents . . . that could have a chain reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever suspicious of Russian domination, Kravchuk kept aloof from a summit 
agreement Friday to work toward a free-trade union among former Soviet 
republics. He agreed only to a vague "associate member" status. The 
Commonwealth encompasses all former Soviet republics except the three Baltic 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the one-day summit enhanced Russia's leadership and ambitions to 
police the region. Yeltsin, looking healthy and robust after winter bouts with 
the flu, won the other leaders' assent to chair the Commonwealth for the rest 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pushed through resolutions calling for Commonwealth peacekeepers, 
which would be dominated by the Russian army, to intervene if necessary in 
Georgia's embattled breakaway province of Abkhazia and in the war between 
Azerbaijan and the ethnic Armenians of that nation's province of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 12 foreign ministers, in a separate meeting Friday, resisted a 
proposal that would give Russians living in other Commonwealth countries 
special status, including citizenship in two countries, to protect them from 
ethnic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Yeltsin said the meeting had drawn the 12 nations closer -- a 
high priority of the nationalist forces now ascendant in Russian politics. For 
example, he hailed an agreement among Russia, Ukraine and Belarus to coordinate 
their border guards as a step toward restoring "a single guarded border" around 
the former Soviet perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Commonwealth is a reality," he told reporters. "The Commonwealth is vital 
for our peoples and states. Today, it is becoming clear that the Commonwealth 
is a priority direction in our policies." 
</P>

 A man chasing his pet cockatoo plunged over a 40-foot cliff to his death. 
Anthony W. Piper, 31, had spent much of Thursday chasing his escaped pet and 
was trying to reach the bird with a net when he apparently lost his footing and 
fell, striking his head on a rock, a sheriff's deputy said. The bird was not 
recovered.

DEDICATION DISTINGUISHED COPTER VICTIMS; ARMED SERVICES: ONE OF THE AMERICANS 
KILLED IN IRAQ INCIDENT HAD BEEN CITED FOR HEROISM. ANOTHER EARNED A MEDAL FOR 
MERITORIOUS ACHIEVEMENT DURING PERSIAN GULF WAR.

 Americans killed when U.S. warplanes mistakenly shot down their helicopters 
were described by relatives and friends Friday as dedicated professionals who 
had earned commendations for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 While a complete list of the 15 Americans killed was not expected to be 
released until their remains are officially identified over the next few days, 
the first sketchy details about four of them showed the personal dimensions of 
the tragedy over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara L. Schell, for example, was a veteran Foreign Service officer serving 
as an adviser to the commanding general of Operation Provide Comfort, the 
relief effort for northern Iraq's Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 She was cited for heroism 15 years ago for helping Americans evacuate Iran in 
the weeks before Iranian militants occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 
52 U.S. citizens hostage for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another victim, Army Warrant Officer John W. Garrett, 33, had served in the 
Air Force during the Gulf War and earned a medal for meritorious achievement. 
He trained for a helicopter pilot's job in the Army after the Air Force told 
him that he was too old to fly, according to his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even then, he just squeaked through (helicopter school) because he was over 
30, but that's what he wanted," his father, John Garrett Sr. of Columbus, Ohio, 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that two others killed aboard the Army Blackhawk helicopters 
were Air Force 2nd Lt. Laura Ashley Piper, 25, of Venice, Fla., and Army Col. 
Richard A. Mulhern, who was recently selected for a high post in the military 
coordination center in Zakhu, Iraq, headquarters for U.S. and allied officials 
helping to protect the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon did not release the hometowns of Schell or Mulhern. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulhern was said to have been en route to his first meeting with leaders of 
the Kurdish minority that the allied operation was supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper was assigned to the 7454th Tactical Intelligence Squadron at Ramstein 
Air Base in Germany, officials said. No other information on them was 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Schell, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry called her "an 
independent, adventuresome person who had very much wanted the job that she was 
serving in. She had been very excited by the challenge that this job offered 
and she was known to her friends as someone with a dry sense of humor and a 
very warm spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry told reporters that Secretary of State Warren Christopher had met 
Schell last August when he was in Alexandria, Egypt, where she was serving as 
consul general in the U.S. Embassy before assuming her duties in northern Iraq. 
"The secretary, along with many others here in the department, have been in 
touch with Barbara's family to express their deepest condolences," McCurry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schell, 50, had also held posts in Chad and Damascus. She was accomplished in 
languages and spoke French, Farsi and Arabic. She is survived by her husband, 
father and a brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Garrett, talking about his son, said that he had been in charge of 
the communications unit of a C-130 transport aircraft during Operation Desert 
Storm, helping to save pilots' lives as a link between fliers and ground 
personnel. He did not know whether his son had been a pilot or a passenger on 
the ill-fated helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that here he was in a dangerous situation and ended up being shot 
down by his own plane," he told the Associated Press. "It's hard to believe."

VETERAN PILOTS STUNNED AT MIX-UP; AVIATION: SEVERAL STRESS THAT WITH ALL THE

 A day after Air Force F-15Cs shot down two U.S. helicopters over Iraq, killing 
26 people, the proud community of pilots who fly the world's most sophisticated 
fighter planes were stunned and dismayed, utterly at a loss to explain how the 
right stuff went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are saying, 'Thank God that's not me,' because I don't know how 
those guys will live with it," said Lt. Gen. Ted Rees, a longtime F-15 pilot.

half ago, Rees flew often with the F-15 squadrons based in Bitburg, Germany, 
where he said the pilots involved in the accident were based. "I probably know 
them, which makes it worse," Rees said. The Pentagon has not yet disclosed 
where the jets were based. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees spoke with admiration of the skill, talent and commitment of the new 
generation of fighter pilots, calling them "the finest group of young people" 
he had ever encountered. Air Force pilots are selected because they are at the 
top of their classes in ability and intelligence and have the confidence and 
independence to fly their sophisticated machines and make split-second 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of their brethren in this elite community are at a loss to explain how 
the accident could have occurred. Until it gets the results of a thorough 
investigation, the Pentagon is not judging who is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 But Defense Secretary William J. Perry, speaking on a morning television show 
Friday, did not hide his opinion that the fault could not lie with equipment 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were errors," Perry said. "There were human errors, probably, and there 
might be process or system errors as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots, who were patrolling the "no fly" zone over northern Iraq, 
mistakenly identified the helicopters as Soviet-built Hind helicopters, which 
are flown by Iraq; they tried to communicate with them electronically to 
determine if they were friend or foe and did not receive a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Some F-15 pilots stressed that with the little information released it is 
impossible to determine where the responsibility lies. "Without looking at 
films you can't say it was the pilots' fault," said Maj. Curtis Elkin, an F-15 
test pilot. "There's so much that goes on up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Several veteran fliers said that, with all the safeguards in place to prevent 
"friendly fire" accidents, more than one miscalculation had to be made before 
such a tragedy could occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole series of mistakes had to be made before the final mistake -- the 
visual determination that the helicopters were not friendly -- was made," said 
Robert Ettinberg, a former vice commander for testing at Edwards Air Force Base 
in California, who flew 100 missions in Vietnam and later flew F-15s. 
</P>
<P>
 Although military officials have said the Blackhawks were equipped with extra 
fuel pods, which makes them look something like Hinds, "it's very easy to tell 
the difference between a Blackhawk and a Hind, even my old eyes can tell the 
difference," Rees said. "F-15 pilots worldwide are shaking their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 The radar command plane, with which the fighter pilots were in contact, also 
should have been able to identify the helicopters as U.S. aircraft. And the 
helicopters should have been in communication with the command plane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what, the pilots will live with the consequences of their 
decisions for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees said that he got the first taste of other pilots' shock over Thursday's 
incident over Iraq when he attended a monthly dinner with a group of retired 
Army and Air Force general officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Army guys were nice but I felt like I myself had let them down, because I 
was part of that (F-15) community and I don't know how that could happen," Rees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the F-15C pilots, some fellow fighter pilots and analysts argued 
that a faulty identification was not implausible given the difference between 
the speeds the helicopters and F-15Cs probably were flying. While the fighter 
would typically be flying 500 m.p.h., the helicopter would be moving at less 
than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 With that speed differential, a mistaken identification would not be out of 
the question, especially if the planes were flying above the helicopters at 
some distance. The F-15C pilots may have avoided getting too close because of 
the possibility of hostile action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't live in a risk-free world in peacetime," said Justin Chretien, an 
aviation lawyer in Washington who used to fly F-7s, a fighter that has now 
largely been retired. "In a hostile environment, when you're dealing with 
machines that weigh 40,000 to 50,000 pounds and travel 500 miles an hour, it's 
just a matter of time before mistakes will be made that cost lives -- it's 
tragic, but inevitable. These guys are human. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every fighter pilot considers himself to be the best pilot in the service," 
Chretien said. "But those who fly F-15s fly specific missions for air 
superiority. It gives those fighter pilots an extra feeling of confidence. But 
it's not cockiness. Most of these guys are pretty quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 F-15s ruled the skies over Iraq during the Gulf War. They were credited for 36 
of the 69 U.S. Air Force air-to-air victories.

GUNMEN IN CHIAPAS KILL SOLDIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen fired on an army roadblock near the capital of Chiapas state, killing a 
soldier in an hourlong clash Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first attack on the military since a Jan. 12 cease-fire ended two 
weeks of fighting with Indian rebels who rose up New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Defense Secretariat said the attack was not connected to the 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no claim of responsibility for the shooting, which occurred on a 
highway just west of Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Defense Secretariat said a "small group of unidentified 
civilians" was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting heightened tensions in Chiapas, where angry landowners blocked a 
state attorney general's office this week to demand that authorities prosecute 
peasants who have seized land since the rebellions.

U.S. ENVOY SOOTHES INDIA, PAKISTAN; DIPLOMACY: STROBE TALBOTT ASSURES BOTH 
NATIONS THAT CLINTON ADMINISTRATION DESIRES IMPROVED RELATIONS. BUT RECEPTION 
TO ARMS CONTROL SUGGESTIONS IS MIXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Historians record that one Pakistani prime minister visited New York just as 
the National League pennant-winning Giants, with Willie Mays in center field, 
blanked Cleveland in the 1954 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proves that the Indians are overrated," Mohammed Ali quipped to his 
hosts in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Like baseball, the neighboring nations of India and Pakistan have 
traditionally seen their troubled relations, which have led to three wars, as 
having one winner and one loser. 
</P>
<P>
 What was good for Pakistan was bad for India, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Into those set and suspicious ways walked Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott, who visited the countries this month to try to persuade them that the 
United States wants improved relations with both. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want a zero-sum game," Talbott stressed in Pakistan. "When American 
officials come here in the future, we don't want people in India thinking that 
it's to the detriment of India's national interest, and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 The reception given to U.S. suggestions for arms control in the subcontinent 
was mixed and inconclusive. But on Talbott's broader agenda -- persuading India 
and Pakistan that the Clinton Administration had not forgotten about them -- 
the bespectacled former journalist seems to have done well indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visit cleared the atmosphere and got the countries back to substance," 
said Pran Chopra, research professor at the Center for Policy Research, an 
Indian think tank. "He (Talbott) said things like, 'I've come to consult,' 
'I've come to ask,' 'An invitation has been extended,' instead of it being 
presented, as it had till then, as a sort of summons." 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistanis were pleased too. 
</P>
<P>
 "His coming was an important signal that South Asia is on the agenda of the 
Clinton Administration," said a senior Foreign Ministry official close to the 
talks in Islamabad. "It was not just a non-proliferation trip that failed. 
Talbott wanted to say to us and the Indians that the zero-sum game was over in 
terms of relations with the U.S. He used the same words in both capitals: The 
zero-sum game is over. The U.S. wants equally strong and equally profitable 
relations with both Pakistan and India." 
</P>
<P>
 When Indians, irritated by a series of what they believe to be provocative 
statements from Washington and the possibility of U.S. warplanes being 
delivered to Pakistan, suggested that the United States was resuming a 
pro-Pakistani "tilt," Talbott rejected the notion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no American tilt toward any specific country in this region," he 
emphasized at a news conference in New Delhi. "I'd suggest the very word tilt 
belongs to the past, and specifically, to the vocabulary of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers in India and Pakistan said Talbott's main success was in instilling 
or reviving good feelings about the Clinton Administration's intentions, with 
any concrete achievements still in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 official in the State Department secured Prime Minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao's agreement in principle to visit the United States, and the 
Indians promised a speedy reply on the U.S. request to approve Defense 
Undersecretary Frank Wisner as ambassador-designate to New Delhi to fill a 
year-old vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Pakistanis, they and the Americans issued a joint statement 
expressing shared commitment to "pursue the goal of capping, then reducing, and 
finally eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in South 
Asia." The Clinton Administration has proposed the release of 38 F-16s in 
return for a verifiable freeze on Pakistan's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a large area of disagreement, but both sides desire progress," 
I.A. Rehman, chairman of the Pakistani Human Rights Commission, who met with 
Talbott, said afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 Indications were that U.S. diplomats in Islamabad were working hard to flesh 
out the proposals carried by Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they can be sure about is that we will not accept a unilateral 
arrangement," one Pakistani Foreign Ministry official cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 How to lure the Indians into accepting the same restrictions on their nuclear 
activities as Pakistan may be the rock on which the U.S. proposal founders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Chopra said, India rejected a formula advanced by the United 
States for a five-nation disarmament conference to be attended by Pakistan, 
India, the United States, Russia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 India's comments after Talbott's departure showed that the Americans have 
their work cut out for them in transforming happier feelings into concrete 
decisions. Rao warned that allowing delivery of the nuclear-capable F-16s to 
Pakistan "can lead to an arms race in the region," and he called any suggestion 
to restrict India's nuclear options "unacceptable and unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. proposal floated to the Indians, Chopra said, calls for a 
nine-member conference: the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council 
plus Germany, Japan, India and Pakistan. One of India's nettlesome questions is 
whether under such a formula, China would have to cap its nuclear program as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether India will or won't go to this meeting, and it probably will, it will 
ask for much more clarification," Chopra said. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that India may insist that three nuclear states created by the 
Soviet collapse -- Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- also take part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feathers have now been smoothed," he said, summing up the results of 
Talbott's visit. "But now we must see where this leads."

SUSPECTED HAMAS ACTIVISTS DETAINED; ISRAEL: CRACKDOWN TARGETS RADICAL 
PALESTINIAN FACTION THAT HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR TWO RECENT SUICIDE 
BOMBINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a campaign to neutralize the Islamic fundamentalist threat in Israel, 
authorities have arrested dozens of suspected activists of the radical 
Palestinian faction Hamas in a continuing sweep of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin also demanded that neighboring Jordan crack down 
on Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for killing 12 Israelis in two 
suicide bombings on buses in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan on Friday rejected Israel's request to close the group's office in 
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin asserted in unusually harsh language that Hamas was using its 
headquarters in the Jordanian capital for logistic support to armed activists 
in the Israeli-occupied territories, as well as a propaganda tool. He said 
Israel "very gravely" views what he called Amman's role as "a paradise for 
Hamas activity." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Jordanian official called Rabin's statement "rash, baseless and not 
conducive to the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin refused to rule out military action to stop Hamas activities in Jordan, 
a nation that borders the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a key mover behind Israel's peace 
process with Jordan who joined Rabin in the hastily arranged Thursday night 
news conference, attempted a more diplomatic line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The call was made not out of ridicule for Jordan and its relations with 
Israel," Peres said. "But there is not one instance in foreign relations in 
which a country that is striving for peace will allow in broad daylight a 
representative of a murderous organization to appear and say his organization 
carried out the murder and that they intend to carry out three more." 
</P>
<P>
 In leaflets, Hamas on Friday repeated its vow to continue attacks against 
Israel. Mohammed Nazzal, the group's spokesman in Jordan, also took 
responsibility on behalf of Hamas for a suicide bombing Wednesday in the 
northern Israeli town of Hadera and a similar attack in the Israeli town of 
Afula about 35 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic group called on all Arabs to avoid traveling on Israeli buses and 
"to stay away from places where many Israelis gather" in coming days "so they 
will not be hit in our upcoming operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Arab women who lived in Israel were killed in each of the two suicide 
bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Rabin and Peres were confronting Jordan -- which Rabin said 
had ignored Jerusalem's private requests for action for 10 days -- Israeli army 
and intelligence units were moving to arrest suspected Hamas members in raids 
from the Gaza Strip to the northern West Bank villages where the suicide 
bombers lived. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four youths were arrested Friday in Yabad, the sleepy mountainside 
village that was the home of Ammar Amarneh. He blew himself up along with five 
Israelis on a packed commuter bus in Hadera, Israeli authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen other suspects were picked up in the nearby village of 
Kabatiya, which was home to Ra'ed Zakarneh, who, Israeli authorities say, drove 
a car packed with 350 pounds of explosives, propane tanks and nails into a 
commuter bus as it picked up children in Afula on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Palestinian sources said Israeli authorities arrested more than 70 
suspected Hamas activists in the last several days -- more than half in Gaza 
and the remainder from the West Bank, particularly in the occupied villages 
closest to sovereign Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israeli towns where the suicide bombings took place are near those West 
Bank villages, across the "Green Line" separating sovereign Israel from the 
territories. Both Palestinian villages are near the Jordanian border to the 
east. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the several dozen suspected Hamas members arrested in the villages of 
the northern West Bank, the Israeli army has also detained without explanation 
Mohammed Abdullah Nassar, Ra'ed Zakarneh's father. He has said in several 
recent interviews that he is a taxi driver with no political affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came after Israeli negotiators -- who are attempting to complete 
an agreement on implementing a peace plan for Palestinian autonomy, beginning 
in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho -- said this week that they would 
never agree to Palestine Liberation Organization demands that Israel release 
Hamas prisoners, along with those from other Palestinian factions. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO will attempt to govern all Palestinians when it assumes self-rule 
under a final agreement, which negotiators will again begin discussing in Cairo 
on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, diplomatic efforts were under way late Friday to defuse growing 
tension between Israel and Lebanon after rocket attacks on northern Israel by 
the Islamic group Hezbollah, based in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the rocket barrage, which came after the South Lebanon 
Army, Israel's surrogate in its 440-square-mile "security zone," shelled the 
southern Lebanese port city of Sidon. The artillery attack was in apparent 
retaliation for a Hezbollah roadside bombing that left three SLA soldiers dead 
and five more injured earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents of northern Israeli villages spent the day in bomb shelters for 
the first time since a fierce exchange of rockets, artillery and air strikes 
eight months ago that Israel dubbed Operation Accountability.

WILDER MOVES TO ENTER SENATE RACE IN VIRGINIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder is ready to run for the U.S. Senate 
as an independent if Democratic incumbent Charles S. Robb and Republican Oliver 
L. North win their party nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder, who announced in January that he would not challenge Robb, said Friday 
that he had changed his mind at the urging of supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are disheartened over what they see as an issue-less campaign," Wilder 
said. "People have said to me since January: 'You've done a pretty good job of 
trying to help Virginia have a better image.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder said he has authorized supporters to collect signatures on petitions to 
put him on the ballot. They would need 15,000 signatures of registered voters 
by June 14, the same date as the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, who is seeking a second term, is running against Richmond lawyer Sylvia 
Clute, state Sen. Virgil H. Goode Jr. and Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. follower Nancy 
Spannaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans will choose between North and James C. Miller III, a former budget 
director in the Ronald Reagan Administration, at a June 4 convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for North and Miller said they were gleeful over Wilder's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug Wilder takes votes from Chuck Robb, period," said North spokesman Dan 
McLagan. "We just have to fasten our seat belts. It's sure going to be an 
interesting race." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller spokesman Jonathan Baron said: "It would be one solid conservative 
against two Democrats engaged in a vicious fight." 
</P>
<P>
 A Robb spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call.

CLINTONS PAID $62,670 IN U.S. TAXES FOR 1993; FINANCES: FIRST FAMILY EARNED 
$293,757 AND GORES PAID $153,744 ON INCOME OF $453,999. RATES WERE HIGHER THAN 
IN '92 FOR BOTH FAMILIES BECAUSE OF NEW LAW. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President and Mrs. Clinton released their 1993 federal tax return Friday, 
showing that they paid $62,670 in taxes on total income of just under $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore and Tipper Gore paid $153,744 in taxes on a total 
income of $453,999. In addition to Gore's salary as vice president, he earned 
$310,084 in royalties on his book, "Earth in the Balance," which yielded a 
similarly large amount of royalties in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons and the Gores were taxed at a higher rate than the year before 
because of a tax hike on the wealthiest Americans that the Administration 
succeeded in pushing through Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Clintons' assets were all placed in a blind trust in July, their 
return shows little information about their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's income of $293,757 included nearly $2,500 in residual payments 
for their appearance on the Arsenio Hall show during the 1992 campaign. They 
paid $288 in California state income tax on the residual income. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd twist, Hillary Rodham Clinton received $12,000 in income from a 
previously unknown 1912 will that set up a fund to provide annual "pin money" 
to the First Lady. The bequest did not become effective until the death of the 
last heir of the man who set it up, an event that occurred in 1989. After that, 
several years of court proceedings took place before the White House was 
notified of the existence of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they knew little about the man who established 
the fund, a Philadelphia resident named Henry G. Freeman Jr., who died in 1928. 
Their first knowledge of it was when "we received a letter from a bank" 
informing them of the bequest, Special White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 In his will, Freeman wrote that "the reason I make this fund," which he 
specified would be known as the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, "is 
because I feel the President of the United States receives such a miserable 
pittance for a man holding the greatest position on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton intends to donate the $12,000 to charity, White House 
Communications Director Mark D. Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money from the Freeman fund and the Arsenio Hall residuals, 
the Clintons' income included the President's salary of $189,167 -- a 
partial-year amount because Clinton did not begin drawing his $200,000 annual 
salary until Inauguration Day in late January -- as well as just over $20,000 
in interest and dividend income, mostly from their blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons also realized a $40,553 capital gain when they sold assets to 
transfer them into the trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton had no wages in 1993, the first year since the couple married 
that she earned less than her husband. In 1992, the Clintons paid $70,228 on 
income of $290,697, mostly from Mrs. Clinton's work at the Rose Law Firm in 
Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also received $38,683 from the Presidential Transition Planning 
Foundation to cover his payments to United Van Lines for moving expenses from 
Little Rock to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they had no explanation for the size of the 
moving costs except to suggest that some expenses beyond the ordinary were 
incurred because of the security concerns involved in moving and storing the 
goods of the then-President elect. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for the move came entirely from privately raised funds for the 
transition, Gearan said. Under federal tax laws, Clinton was required to report 
that money as income but was also entitled to take a tax deduction for the full 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the deduction for the moving expenses, the Clintons also took 
deductions of $17,000 for gifts to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some past years in which the couple took deductions for gifts of items, 
such as old clothes, the 1993 contributions were all checks to established 
institutions, such as hospitals, churches here and in Little Rock and the 
couple's alma maters -- Georgetown, Wellesly and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also took a $4,659 deduction for their share of the mortgage 
interest on the Little Rock home that they own jointly with Mrs. Clinton's 
mother, Dorothy Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons overpaid their taxes by $7,982 and chose to apply that sum to 
their 1994 taxes rather than to receive a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's Arkansas state tax returns are not due until next month.

U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT BASTIONS SLOWLY SETTLE TURF WARS; REFORM: A JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT GROUP IS FOSTERING COOPERATION AND ROOTING OUT WASTEFUL DUPLICATION 
AMONG FIERCELY PROTECTIVE AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to halt the seemingly endless turf battles and jealousies among various 
U.S. law enforcement agencies is an acutely sensitive task.  
</P>
<P>
 When the job was given to the head of one of those agencies -- FBI Director 
Louis J. Freeh -- rather than to an official unaffiliated with any of the 
agencies, some senior officials in other agencies complained that the fox had 
been sent to guard the chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh was chosen last November to head the Justice Department's new Office of 
Investigative Agency Policies. His mission was to bring about cooperation and 
end wasteful duplication among four Justice agencies: the FBI, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Marshals Service and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The first meeting of representatives of those agencies offered stark proof of 
the problem. "We walked in there with open hands and everybody's coming at us 
with clenched fists," said James R. Bucknam, a former federal prosecutor in 
Manhattan whom Freeh brought with him to the FBI and who serves as chief of 
staff of the new office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Freeh recalled "a lot of apprehension, a lot of tension 
and a lot of mistrust" at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, five months into the effort, the walls are beginning to crumble. To 
the relief and surprise of the other agencies, more than once the group has 
recommended against FBI preferences in resolving conflicts involving drug 
intelligence, violent crime approaches, budgets and radio communications -- the 
areas addressed so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh's Office of Investigative Agency Policies is made up of two 
representatives from each of the four agencies, along with one from the Justice 
Department's Criminal division and one from the U.S. Attorneys' Advisory 
Committee, which advises Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys general dating back to the Richard Nixon Administration have vowed 
to end struggles between federal law enforcers. Such conflicts have included 
attempts to freeze others out of operations so that sole credit can be claimed 
for successes and competition over who will target federal fugitives. At their 
worst, these struggles run such dangers as exposing undercover operations or 
revealing secret wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the rhetoric of previous attempts to change the system did not 
measure up to what was accomplished. If the effort succeeds this time, it could 
curtail law enforcement competition and perhaps eventually reach beyond the 
Justice Department to other federal enforcement agencies, notably Treasury 
Department agencies: the Secret Service, Customs, Internal Revenue Service and 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hostility and tension at the first sessions of the new 
coordinating agency, Freeh addressed one of the touchiest subjects that has 
divided the FBI and DEA for the past dozen years -- consolidating drug 
intelligence files. Each agency had its own files and was "competitive in that 
they did not talk to each other electronically or manually and had been 
operating (like that) since the early 1980s," Freeh noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts had been made to link up the systems so they could share data on 
suspects, trafficking rings, travel and the like. But each agency resisted, 
saying that it did not want the other "roaming" in its intelligence base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this is 1994, and I don't feel comfortable telling the attorney general 
and the American people that we've got the two agencies charged with federal 
drug law enforcement maintaining separate, but non-communicative intelligence 
bases and we've got to fix this," Freeh told the agency representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 To Freeh's question of how long it would take to draft a proposal for 
integrating the intelligence bases, the agencies provided estimates of up to 
two years. Freeh said that he was thinking of four to five weeks, which drew a 
near universal reaction of "impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh resolved the deadline issue by giving the DEA and FBI representatives at 
the Dec. 6 meeting until Jan. 31 to come up with a solution "or I'll fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an extreme amount of griping, particularly in my own agency," Freeh 
said. "It can't be done, we shouldn't take these risks, we can't trust the 
other agency," he recalled opponents complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the deadline, the "technical wonks" of the two agencies got 
together and came up with a system that, once the computer software 
modifications are made, will be operating by September "on a fully integrated, 
talking and safeguarded basis," Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing something now in federal drug enforcement that we haven't done in 
12 years -- the most basic requirement and that's sharing information and 
intelligence," he said. And the system is being equipped with safeguards to 
discourage a corrupt FBI or DEA agent from gaining access to intelligence and 
compromising it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really broke the ice and a lot of the mistrust," Freeh said. Other moves 
have been done with more efficiency "because there's more and more confidence 
that nobody's going to get screwed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In ruling against FBI representatives, the Freeh group recommended that FBI 
agents should join their counterparts from other agencies in staffing the El 
Paso Intelligence Center -- a tactical drug intelligence center that the FBI 
had long shunned. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the progress, many highly sensitive issues remain, including the 
proposed growth of FBI activities overseas in the face of established DEA 
operations in foreign lands and consolidating training of DEA and FBI personnel 
in common areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeh estimated that joint training could save taxpayers $25 million to $30 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 His optimism about the new office is shared by Eduardo Gonzalez, director of 
the U.S. Marshals Service, and former DEA Administrator Robert C. Bonner. But 
skeptics remain. Some senior managers at DEA, for example, have concerns that 
"the process has the potential to disenfranchise us." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, none of the member agencies have exercised their right to 
appeal recommendations by the coordinating office to the deputy attorney 
general or attorney general.

TAPES SHOW LBJ DOUBTED SAME BULLET HIT KENNEDY, CONNALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even while the Warren Commission was preparing its report on the assassination 
of President John F. Kennedy, there were disagreements over whether the same 
bullet had struck Kennedy and John B. Connally. Among the dissenters: President 
Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Johnson asked Warren Commission member Sen. Richard Russell (D-Ga.), 
"what difference does it make which bullet got Connally?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arguments over the same-bullet theory continue more than 30 years after the 
attack in which Kennedy was killed and Connally, then the governor of Texas, 
was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's conversation with Russell was included among tapes released Friday 
by the National Archives and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes reviewed in Austin disclosed that Connally called Johnson on March 
2, 1967, to discuss claims that Cuba was involved in the assassination. In 
other phone conversations, Johnson told aides to keep up with New Orleans 
prosecutor Jim Garrison's investigation into the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison's theories and writings about the assassination formed the basis for 
Oliver Stone's 1991 movie, "JFK." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, however, said he did not believe the CIA-Cuba theory. In a Feb. 18, 
1967, conversation with then-acting Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, Johnson said the 
Cuban theory was as preposterous as if he were told that his wife, Lady Bird 
Johnson, "was taking dope." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's conversation with Russell, about the bullet that hit Connally, 
occurred on Sept. 18, 1964. They discussed progress in preparing the report on 
Kennedy's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator noted some members of the commission headed by Chief Justice Earl 
Warren believed that "the same bullet that hit Kennedy first is the one that 
hit Connally." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Johnson's musing, Russell said, "Well, it don't make much 
difference." He added: "Well, I don't believe it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't either," Johnson responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said the differences among the commission members were to be noted in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Connally, riding in the front seat of the presidential limousine, was wounded 
when Kennedy, in the back seat, was slain in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators agree that three shots were fired, but through the years 
conspiracy arguments have turned on whether the same bullet could have passed 
through Kennedy's upper back and hit Connally. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were struck almost at the same instant. If the same bullet could not 
have wounded both men, there had to have been a second bullet -- and therefore 
a second gunman, according to those who believe in a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Connally died last summer, researchers asked to recover bullet fragments 
from his body to help resolve the issue, but the request was turned down.

JAPANESE STUDENT SHOT IN DENVER BY CARJACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Japanese college student was shot in the chest and seriously wounded Friday 
in what police said was a carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Kouichi Takemoto, 26, had pulled into his apartment parking lot and was 
sitting in his car at about 1 a.m. when he was confronted by two masked men, 
police said.He turned over his money and was getting out of the car when he 
apparently yelled for help and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemoto, a student at National College in Denver, was listed in serious 
condition at Denver General Hospital with a bullet wound in the left shoulder, 
Police Detective David Metzler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemoto's car was found abandoned in suburban Aurora later in the day. No 
arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the assailants as black but police said they saw no racial 
motivation in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting came less than a month after two students from Japan were shot 
and killed in a carjacking in Los Angeles.

WAVES OF CUBAN RAFTERS MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARD U.S.; REFUGEES: RECORD NUMBERS ARE 
UNDERTAKING THE RISKY JOURNEY. THE FLOW IS CREATING PROBLEMS FOR CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION, CARIBBEAN NATIONS.

 They arrive here almost daily now -- thin, sun-stricken, in shock from both 
the voyage and the realization that they have survived. Palms upturned, Sixto 
de la Riva Linares shows the open blisters he got from two days of rowing. "We 
felt like it would never end," he said. "But hope was the last thing we wanted 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees from Cuba are rafting across the Florida Straits in record numbers. 
The Coast Guard has picked up or assisted 295 Cubans so far in April, including 
52 on Friday, and 1,401 since the first of the year. And the summer sailing 
season has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now through December, we expect at least 5,000 will come," said Arturo 
Cobo, who directs the Transit Home for Cuban Rafters -- the first stop for 
those either picked up by the Coast Guard or washed ashore in the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cobo: "We get babies, just 28 days old, and we've had grandmothers of 82. 
Wouldn't you have to be desperate to put them on a raft?" 
</P>
<P>
 De la Riva, 44, formerly a baker in Guanabo, Cuba, said he could no longer 
feed his family in the face of worsening economic conditions on the island. So 
one night earlier this month he climbed aboard a raft fashioned from four truck 
tire inner tubes and, with 10 others, entrusted his fate to the ocean currents 
and the southeast wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty hours later, after the balseros (from balsa, or raft) were spotted by a 
volunteer air patrol, the Coast Guard brought the Cubans into Marathon, Fla. 
They were just one of three separate groups of rafters to arrive at the Transit 
Home within the space of two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The quickening rate of defections from Cuba -- unequaled since the Mariel 
boatlift in 1980, when 125,000 refugees came to the United States -- has 
presented the Clinton Administration with a new challenge to its immigration 
policy. For years, Cubans who sailed directly from the island to the United 
States have been admitted and immediately released to relatives or resettlement 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a surprise move last week, the Administration tried to close an 
increasingly popular back-door entryway by intercepting at sea a boatload of 19 
Cubans headed for Miami from the Bahamas. They all were returned to Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bahamian government allowed the return of those Cubans, the next 
day Prime Minister Robert A. Ingraham said no more would be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bahamas, a country made up of 700 islands, is already home to thousands of 
Haitians hoping to get to the United States, and officials are clearly worried 
that more Cubans will begin to use the country as a stepping stone to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 Cubans are known to be stranded on various Bahamian islands now. Many 
are being sustained by supplies dropped by small private aircraft flying rescue 
missions over the Gulf Stream. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department spokesman had no official comment, other than to encourage 
Cubans to apply for visas through the normal channels in Havana. But he said 
U.S. and Bahamian officials are continuing to discuss the situation and hope to 
work out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Defecting Cubans are also entering the United States by obtaining visas to 
travel to the Dominican Republic and then making their way to Mona Island, a 
U.S. territory 50 miles west of Puerto Rico. Last week, U.S. Border Patrol 
agents complained that they were being used as a "cab service," ferrying Cubans 
from Mona Island to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, more than 5,000 Cubans -- most former political prisoners -- were 
granted visas to enter the United States and arrived through normal channels, 
usually by air. But hundreds more came on travel visas and simply never went 
home. A record 3,656 Cubans entered the United States by raft or boat in 1993, 
according to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United States has no diplomatic relations with the government of 
Fidel Castro, no Cubans are deported. Under the terms of a special 1966 law, 
all are eligible for permanent residency after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge, along with the growing hardship of life in Cuba, fuels the 
dangerous raft voyages. "Many more want to come, more than in Mariel," de la 
Riva. said. "People see no future in Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 300 Cubans who arrived at the Transit Home between Jan. 15 and March 10, 
69% were men, with the largest group being between 21 years old and 30 years 
old, according to a survey conducted by the Miami Herald. Most arrivals were 
employed in Cuba, and 64% said they had relatives in the United States, most in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Machin Castillo, 27, is typical. A machine-shop worker, he also 
recently made the crossing from Guanabo, on his third attempt. He said he spent 
three years in jail after being caught on a previous try. "I left my whole 
family," he said, having showered and wearing a new pair of jeans and a T-shirt 
but still feeling seasick hours after his arrival. "But from the deepest part 
of my heart, I just wanted to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Cobo, 53, a Key West businessman who was jailed in Cuba after being captured 
during the failed Bay of Pigs invasion 33 years ago, says he thinks that for 
every four Cubans who attempt the crossing -- which can be as short as 90 miles 
-- one perishes at sea. On the walls of his office are hundreds of messages 
from Cubans in the United States who have telephoned to say that their 
relatives never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see my people coming here in rafts like this," said Cobo, who 
devotes most of his time to the Transit Home while his wife runs his 
armored-car business. "But they are desperate. It's been 35 years now (since 
Castro took power in Cuba), and we are still looking for freedom. That 
motivates me." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of operating the Transit Home runs about $20,000 a month, Cobo says. 
Located in a warehouse district on Stock Island, just west of Key West, the 
refuge is being expanded to provide sleeping quarters for up to 90 people. But 
few rafters stay here for more than overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome," says Cobo to each group of bedraggled, dazed arrivals. "We are 
Cubans, just like you, and we will help you. Here you can bathe, have something 
to eat, rest. We will help you get in contact with your family, and tomorrow 
we'll take you to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not important what you did in Cuba, your job, or whether you were a 
Communist. What is important is your humanity. You are here, and we will not 
abandon you."

LOOKING FOR A BABY, TWO COUPLES FOUND FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandi Zeman and Tim Timmons are the legal guardians of Peruvian boys they want 
to adopt. But deceitful or incompetent lawyers and changes in Peru's adoption 
system have left them in a legal limbo that keeps them from finishing the 
adoption process. 
</P>
<P>
 Their two cases are examples of how complicated and frustrating adoption can 
be in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Peruvian adoption we have seen or heard of has a horror story of its 
own," said Timmons, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife came to Peru from their home in Lithonia, Ga., last June. A 
U.S. adoption agency had promised them a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded good," Timmons recalled. "They told us it would be four to six 
weeks, maybe eight weeks at the most." 
</P>
<P>
 They were not told that the baby had suffered respiratory distress syndrome 
and was disabled. They rejected that baby and received guardianship of another. 
But their lawyer did not tell them that such custody was illegal before the 
baby was declared abandoned under recently changed laws administered by a new 
Technical Secretariat of Adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretariat refuses to proceed with the adoption, and the judge who 
granted guardianship refuses to finish the adoption process, Timmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we're like a Ping-Pong ball between the two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now with his fifth lawyer, he is waiting for a break in the case while he 
takes care of year-old Andrew in a modest boardinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been here taking my wife's place the last (four) months," he said. 
"She was here four months." 
</P>
<P>
 Timmons is a graphic designer, and his wife is an insurance claims examiner. 
He said he will lose his job if he does not return to it soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so desperate," he said. "We've done just about everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeman, 37, is in the same predicament and in the same boardinghouse, where she 
cares for 11-month-old Brandon. She already has lost her job as a schoolteacher 
in Greenwood, Va. Her husband, a contractor and carpenter, has been back and 
forth several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zemans also had to give up the first baby in their custody. Their lawyer 
apparently had given the baby's impoverished mother money and food to hand the 
baby over, but the mother "didn't understand she was putting it up for 
adoption," Zeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her second lawyer charged her $6,700 "and we weren't even halfway 
through the process, but she kept assuring us everything was going to work 
out." It didn't, and the Zemans are now paying another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a judged ordered the Timmonses and Zemans to give up the babies 
in their custody. They did so but moved into an orphanage with them. Zeman said 
the bathrooms had no running water and the beds had bedbugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My baby got an infection," she said. They were given custody of the babies 
again after an outbreak of chickenpox in the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeman fears that she and her husband will have to sell their house if the 
process drags on much longer, but she said her love for Brandon and thoughts of 
the squalid orphanage keep her from considering the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we give up, what kind of a future does he have?" she asked.

<P>
 A former aviation commissioner and a prominent airport businessman were 
sentenced to prison Friday for a corruption scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Jackson, former Aviation Commissioner and city councilman, was sentenced 
to 3 1/2 years in prison.Prosecutors said he used his influence to win 
favorable deals for airport businesses in which he secretly held an interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was convicted Jan. 22 of 83 counts of mail fraud, 43 counts of 
accepting bribes and four counts of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Paradies, majority owner of a company that operates shops at Hartsfield 
Atlanta International Airport, was sentenced to 2 3/4 years in prison. He was 
convicted of 83 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to bribe 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Paradies remain free on bond pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal trial cast a shadow on the city's political Establishment -- 
especially as testimony implicated municipal officials not charged.

TORNADOES TEAR UP TRAILERS, CHURCH; 4 DIE; STORMS: FUNNEL CLOUDS TOUCH DOWN IN 
FOUR STATES IN MIDWEST AND SOUTH. NEAR HOUSTON, AT LEAST 17 PEOPLE ARE INJURED 
AT MOBILE HOME PARK.

<P>
 Tornadoes struck across parts of the South and Midwest on Friday, smashing 
mobile homes and flattening a church near Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Four deaths were blamed on the stormy weather, one in Kentucky, one in 
Tennessee, one in Ohio and one in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas tornado also injured at least 17 people as it plowed through a 
trailer park near Crosby, 25 miles northeast of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like it just sat down on the trailer park and wiped it out," said 
Jim McCall, a resident of the nearby Indian Shores subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado flattened the Community Baptist Church and destroyed most of the 
Heathergate trailer park, where about 60 mobile homes were parked. "Probably 
about two-thirds of the trailer park was wiped out," McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 69-year-old woman pulled from the rubble died later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 members of the Community Baptist Church gathered in the dark, puddled 
parking lot for a prayer service. The 14-year-old church has about 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really just a building, it can be replaced. People can't," said 
Associate Pastor Robert Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross was told to prepare emergency shelter for about 500 people. 
Crosby has a population of about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Ed Richman, 57, was found beneath his collapsed mobile home in 
Chattanooga, Tenn. His daughter, Tina Taj, was found in a field surrounded by 
the rubble of her mobile home about 300 yards from where it had sat, across the 
street from her father's. She was believed dead until emergency crews detected 
a faint pulse, said G.A. Bennett, spokesman for the Hamilton County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 9-month-old son, Joshua Ben Taj, was found about 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if the child was in her arms when it hit, but it's a miracle 
either one is alive at all," said Bruce Garner of Hamilton County Emergency 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj was hospitalized in critical condition. Joshua was in fair condition with 
a broken leg, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado seemed to touch down first just northeast of Chattanooga in the 
Birchwood community. It then hit northwest Bradley County, southern McMinn 
County and southern Meigs County. At least 10 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner said the storm destroyed 21 mobile homes and 20 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A roof of a concession stand and several bleachers near the Meigs-McMinn 
county line were damaged behind Riceville Elementary School, where 640 children 
were huddled in hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like God was looking over us today," one parent said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kentucky, the most severe damage was in Bowling Green, where a thunderstorm 
spawned a series of small tornadoes, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm shattered a glass dome at the Greenwood Mall, the city's largest. "I 
was just coming in the door and I heard glass crash, and the wind started 
blowing and I just hit the floor," said Frances Graham, who works at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Three skylights over the mall's atrium "just exploded from the inside out. You 
can just see where the vacuum pulled it all out on the roof in millions of 
little pieces," said Charles Spicer, a roofer who surveyed the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall was evacuated because of a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 As the storm advanced eastward across Kentucky, trees were snapped and power 
lines downed, creating scattered power outages across western and central 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 High wind overturned a mobile home and killed a woman in Hardin County, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind damaged mobile homes and injured two people in an overturned camper in 
Illinois, and scattered tornadoes in Indiana damaged trees and farm buildings 
and injured three people, state officials said. Scattered blackouts were 
reported in Chicago after thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms packing funnel clouds rolled across Ohio, downing trees and 
interrupting power. The roof was blown off a trailer in southern Ohio, killing 
a man when he was struck by debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. said power to about 7,000 customers in 
southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky was restored by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms also raked parts of Missouri early Friday, peeling off roofs, 
downing power lines and tree limbs, and pelting some areas with golf ball-sized 
hail. No injuries were reported. Possible tornado damage was reported along a 
20-mile swath southwest of St. Louis.

ASTRONAUTS USE RADAR TO STUDY FLOODING IN MIDWEST, GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA pushed Endeavour's advanced, new radar to the limit Friday in an attempt 
to survey flooding in the Midwest and in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists managing the radar equipment aboard the shuttle had not planned on 
mapping those areas until the floods struck this week.Any information gleaned 
about the terrain and overflowing rivers, while of no immediate use, could help 
in predicting the course of future flooding, project scientist Diane Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radar is really the ideal sensor because of the cloud cover associated with 
the thunderstorms that are being seen," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronaut Michael Clifford reported "tremendous" lightning over the Midwest as 
Endeavour soared across the central United States at an altitude of 135 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said researchers are not sure if the radar can reach the flooded areas 
from Endeavour's orbit as the shuttle passes over Oklahoma, but are trying 
anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
 Radar sweeps over northern Europe also are being extended to try to include 
overflowing rivers in eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar in Endeavour's cargo bay is the most advanced ever sent into space 
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The U.S., German and 
Italian radar instruments have been scanning Earth's environmental hot spots 
since the mission began last Saturday. The mission is expected to end Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, 93 of the 183 radar data-recording tapes aboard the shuttle had 
been filled, representing nearly 50 hours of information, NASA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rewarding to see that our experiment is going so well and that 
we're really bringing back the information about our environment that we came 
to get," astronaut Thomas Jones told high school honor students during the "CBS 
This Morning" program.

THUNDERSTORMS, TORNADOES LEAVE 3 DEAD

<P>
 Thunderstorms packing tornadoes blew across parts of the South and Midwest on 
Friday, smashing the glass dome of a Bowling Green shopping mall and damaging 
residential neighborhoods in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Three deaths were blamed on the storms, one in Kentucky and two in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severe damage in Kentucky was in Bowling Green, where a thunderstorm 
spawned a series of small tornadoes, the National Weather Service reported. 
Weather service officials could not confirm whether the tornadoes touched down. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm shattered a glass dome at Greenwood Mall, the city's largest. The 
mall had just opened when the storm struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just coming in the door and I heard glass crash, and the wind started 
blowing and I just hit the floor," said Frances Graham, who works at the mall. 
"It broke all the car windows out of our cars out front, and I really don't 
know what the extent of the damage is." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall was evacuated because of a gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm caused damage in other business and residential areas of Bowling 
Green, overturning cars and mobile homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere across Kentucky, thunderstorms downed trees and power lines and 
damaged homes and farm buildings in several counties. 
</P>
<P>
 High wind overturned a mobile home and killed a woman in Hardin County, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was found dead underneath his house after a string of tornadoes swept 
across southeastern Tennessee. Another body was found in a nearby field, a 
spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind damaged mobile homes and injured two people in an overturned camper in 
Illinois, and scattered tornadoes in Indiana damaged trees and farm buildings 
and injured three people, officials said. Scattered blackouts were reported in 
Chicago after thunderstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms also hit southwestern Ohio at midday, but no funnel clouds 
touched down. Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. said about 7,000 customers were 
without power in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms also raked parts of Missouri early Friday, peeling off roofs, 
downing power lines and tree limbs, and pelting some areas with hail. Possible 
tornado damage was reported along a 20-mile swath southwest of St. Louis.

FLOODWATERS BEGIN TO RETREAT IN MIDWEST; WEATHER: DESPITE STORMS IN MISSOURI, 
MOST SWOLLEN RIVERS AND STREAMS FALL BACK FROM THEIR CRESTS. BUT OFFICIALS 
REMAIN ON ALERT IN ILLINOIS.

 Flood-weary residents watched Friday as the Meramec River dropped more than 
two feet from its crest, pushing a layer of muck into many homes and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms that moved across much of Missouri on Friday -- producing 
damaging wind, tornadoes and hail -- failed to reverse the downward trend of 
the Meramec and other swollen streams in eastern Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other streams that flooded this week from Oklahoma up the Ohio Valley 
also were receding, but National Guard troops remained on duty in Illinois, 
where some streams continued rising. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Park's Sacred Heart Church, where hundreds of flood evacuees had 
gathered in recent days, the roadway in front of the building was dry Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the night before, as the Meramec crested at 37.4 feet, or 21 feet above 
flood stage, several feet of water had covered the road about 50 feet away. By 
Friday morning, the river was down to 35.1 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Wagner said she was anxious to find out how her first-floor apartment 
had fared. She, her husband and their teen-age son had moved there two months 
ago from St. Louis, about 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite water up to the ceiling at the flood's peak, Wagner said she plans to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out here it's nice to lay in bed at night and hear the trains go by," she 
said. "In the city, we'd lay in bed at night and hear gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 But James Hutching, who was forced out of his apartment Tuesday along with his 
wife and two small children, said he had finally had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here 30 of my 35 years and this is it," Hutching said. "I'm not 
coming back. I don't know where I'm going to go, but it's going to be someplace 
high and away from water." 
</P>
<P>
 The Meramec was forecast to fall below the 16-foot flood stage at Valley Park 
by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Missouri, the Missouri River was falling or cresting from 
Jefferson City to St. Charles, just above where it joins the Mississippi River 
north of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The only river still rising in or around the state was the Mississippi south 
of St. Louis. It was expected to crest at 11 feet over flood stage near Ste. 
Genevieve during the night to nine feet above flood stage at Caruthersville in 
the Missouri Bootheel on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's stormy weather aggravated problems for flood-weary residents in 
southern Illinois. About 100 National Guard troops helped sandbag, monitor 
rising rivers and watch for looters along the Sangamon and Embarras rivers in 
central Illinois and the Cache River in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rough and it's raining like a son of a gun," said Buddy Warren, a 
resident of Miller City who planned to stay at his home, which was threatened 
by high water. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 families had been evacuated from the Miller City area since the 
Mississippi broke through a levee late Wednesday, said Alexander County Sheriff 
Buddy Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some families that didn't want to leave, but they finally decided 
to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers reported no new evacuations Friday, following 
earlier evacuations of about 40 people from elsewhere in southern Illinois, 
where the Mississippi and Ohio rivers backed up into the Cache River.

REPUBLICANS STAGE ANTI-TAX RALLY; POLITICS: ABOUT 50 OF THE PARTY FAITHFUL, 
INCLUDING SEVERAL JUNE PRIMARY CANDIDATES, HOLD PROTEST AT O.C. POST OFFICE.

 What better day to express outrage against all taxes than on April 15, the 
deadline to mail federal and state income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
 And so for a while on Friday, local Republicans forgot that Gov. Pete Wilson 
had supported state tax increases in recent years and aimed their anger at 
President Clinton and his fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 Republicans -- about 10 of them candidates in the June 7 primary -- 
lined Sunflower Avenue in front of the Santa Ana Main Post Office and rallied 
against tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want lower taxes? Vote Republican," was one of the placards waved at 
motorists lining up to deposit their tax returns at the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa resident Jacquelyn Thomas, 66, held a sign that read: "Empty 
promises, empty wallets, empty future." 
</P>
<P>
 The retired school librarian said the protest would serve as a warning to 
voters to study the backgrounds of candidates and their political promises 
before electing them to office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have paid more taxes this year than I ever paid, and we are not earning any 
more money, and I am dumbfounded," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar protest was registered by Santa Ana resident Barbara Bricken, 30, 
who said she lost her job last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am single and I paid a good portion of my income toward taxes this year," 
Bricken said. "I have been unemployed and I still had to pay more when it was 
all said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally also served as a forum for Republican candidates -- particularly in 
the 70th Assembly District race, where the three contenders are trying to outdo 
each other on the issue of fiscal conservativism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the candidate that paid the most taxes. . . . I am the only candidate in 
the campaign that owns a business," candidate Marilyn Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond, the second candidate in what is one 
of Orange County's hottest primary battles, toed the party line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, these people will remember in November that the Republicans are 
the ones that wanted to reduce taxes and reduce spending," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third candidate, attorney Thomas G. Reinecke, helped organize the second 
annual anti-tax rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people are mad as hell," Reinecke said. "They would not have 
voted for Clinton if they knew they were going to be paying more taxes."

STRAWBERRY FIELDS ENDEAVOR; UC POMOLOGIST GAMBLES IN TRYING TO CREATE THE 
PERFECT PRODUCT FOR GROWERS -- BUT IF HIS LABORS BEAR FRUIT, HE MAY BE WITHOUT 
A JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fruit scientist extraordinaire Kirk D. Larson, Ph.D, perched himself atop a 
wooden stool in a furrowed field of stubby, green plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he lifted up a plump, red fruit, studied it keenly, and offered some 
wisdom about his quest to create the "super strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 For Larson, 40, it is the ultimate challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breeding strawberries is like breeding Thoroughbred racehorses," Larson said. 
"It's all in the bloodlines. You try to mate high-quality, high-performance 
plants with each other. You wouldn't pick a beat-up, old horse that's never won 
a race to breed with a promising mare, would you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Larson should know. 
</P>
<P>
 The pomologist, or fruit scientist, has created more than 12,000 strains of 
strawberries since coming to the University of California South Coast Field 
Station two years ago. The station is a 200-acre research center in east 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In his search for edible perfection, Larson picks two strong, productive 
"parents" and then "acting like a bee," he transfers the pollen from selected 
plants, hoping that it eventually produces firm, tasty offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the super strawberry plant would yield a large number of firm, sweet, 
big and disease-resistant fruits from January to June. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson's work is especially vital for Orange County's strawberry industry, 
which in 1992 harvested 50,000 tons and earned more than $40 million at market. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County produces 15% of the state's strawberries, according to the 
California Strawberry Commission, and the state produces 85% of the 
strawberries consumed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, county growers are working feverishly to harvest ripe fruit. The 
strawberry season in Orange County runs from January to June, but peaks in 
April when the longer, warmer days increase the plants' production of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, this year's harvest is a complete turnaround from a year ago, when 
heavy rains drowned the sensitive crop. Although last year's figures are not 
available, 1993 may have been the worst year in the county's strawberry 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With Larson's research, which also includes studies on how strawberry plants 
react to certain pesticides, growers hope to learn how to increase their 
production, ensure plant health and, of course, achieve the elusive super 
strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As growers, we are always looking for a strawberry with good taste and (one 
that) ships well," said A.G. Kawamura, who runs the family-owned business, 
Western Marketing Co., of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firmness, size and sweetness are key characteristics we look for," said 
Kawamura, who sends his strawberries to Philadelphia, London and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Larson's effort is aimed at making Orange County growers more 
competitive within the state. Although strawberry growers harvest crops from 
San Diego to Watsonville, subtle temperature and other environmental 
differences alter the quality and nature of the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Larson has bred thousands of different strawberry plants and some 
have been planted by local growers, he said few, perhaps a dozen or so, have 
the right stuff to challenge the industry's longstanding favorite: the Chandler 
strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced nearly a decade ago and patented by UC, the Chandler is grown and 
sold worldwide, and has long been revered by growers for its firmness, 
consistency and size, although some experts say it could be sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes five to eight years of research and testing before you can introduce 
a new variety to growers," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the parent plants have good qualities, each plant has eight 
chromosomes and creating the perfect fruit is like "rolling 30 dice and trying 
to get snake eyes," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Larson came to the 35-year-old South Coast Field Station, legendary 
pomologist Victor Voth ran the strawberry program, developing several varieties 
now being used in Orange County fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson's project, funded by UC and the California Strawberry Commission, is 
one of nearly 50 ongoing fruit and plant studies at the field station. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the field station developed several hybrids, including the 
Gwen and Wetshel avocados and the Toro Turf used on golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Working closely with growers, the strawberry project has traditionally 
attempted to create fruit that is not only firm, shapely and tasty, but also 
bug- and disease-resistant, Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also tried to find a strain of strawberry that will produce a lot of 
fruit during the typically slow months of January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 As his research continues, Larson is both hopeful and fearful of what he may 
discover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to create the perfect strawberry," Larson said, "but if I do, I'll be 
out of a job."

 The daughter of U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said her White House wedding to 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother is "going to be a kick." 
</P>
<P>
 The wedding of Nicole Boxer and Anthony Rodham will be the first to be held in 
the White House since Tricia Nixon married Edward Finch Cox on June 12, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuptials are set for May 28, but a lot of the details have yet to be 
worked out. The invitations have not even been mailed, said Nicole Boxer, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll be pretty excited when the day comes, but I've been really cool 
about it so far," she told the Marin Independent Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Boxer, of Marin, is vice president in charge of development at Fried 
Films in Los Angeles. Rodham, 38, works for the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will be performed by Judge Peter Capua of Miami; a Methodist 
minister and rabbi also will take part. President Clinton and the First Lady 
will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a post-wedding reception for the 250 guests, but the couple 
"haven't gotten to a menu yet, because the White House just changed chefs," the 
bride-to-be said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have events at the White House you are not allowed to bring food in 
from the outside, ever," she added.

FEDERAL COURT CLEARS WAY FOR EXECUTION; CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: SHARPLY DIVIDED 
PANEL RULES THAT TRIPLE-MURDERER IN WASHINGTON MAY BE HANGED WITHIN 42 DAYS. 
APPEAL TO SUPREME COURT IS PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sharply divided federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Friday that a 
Washington man may be hanged within 42 days, even though he is entitled to 90 
days to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 decision came as the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the 
final appeal of triple-murderer Charles R. Campbell, who has been on Death Row 
in Washington state for more than a decade. He sought further review by all 26 
9th Circuit judges, a process that is theoretically possible but never has been 
carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the 9th Circuit, also by a 6-5 majority, rejected Campbell's 
claim that execution by hanging violates the U.S. Constitution's bar against 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 After it upholds a death sentence, the 9th Circuit Court usually grants an 
automatic stay to allow an appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the court's 
majority said that "exceptional circumstances" justified different treatment in 
this case, noting that the 9th Circuit was criticized by the Supreme Court two 
years ago for failing to resolve Campbell's appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under a duty to ensure a prompt resolution of the matter," said the 
majority, led by J. Clifford Wallace, the 9th Circuit's chief judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt, joined by four colleagues, issued a 
blistering dissent. "Our decision demonstrates once again that in capital 
punishment cases, the current federal judiciary is less concerned with rules of 
law and constitutional principles than with ensuring that defendants are 
executed speedily," Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "By our decision, we pronounce our willingness to hang Campbell first and 
submit the serious constitutional issues he raises" on cruel and unusual 
punishment to the Supreme Court for decision later, Reinhardt wrote. "So the 
9th Circuit returns, at least for now, to the rough Western justice of frontier 
days: Hang 'em first, ask questions later." 
</P>
<P>
 James Lobsenz, Campbell's attorney, said he will appeal to the Supreme Court 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that either Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who 
handles emergency appeals from the 9th Circuit, could grant Campbell a stay, or 
that the full court could issue a stay if five of the nine justices vote to do 
so. But legal observers said a stay is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 39, Campbell was convicted of slashing the throats of two women and a 
child in Clearview, Wash., in 1982. The women had testified in a 1976 trial in 
which Campbell was convicted of attacking and sodomizing one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a stay of execution in effect since March 28, 1989, because of 
appeals on various issues. The Supreme Court has declined to review the case 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely pleased that the 9th Circuit has finally cleared the way" for 
the execution, said Paul D. Weisser, an assistant attorney general in 
Washington who has been critical of the lengthy appeal process. This will allow 
"justice to be done at long last," Weisser added. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said 9th Circuit officials told him that the stay of execution 
will be lifted immediately. Under Washington law, that would permit the 
execution to be conducted "within 30 judicial days," meaning an execution date 
of May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate that there is going to be a flurry of activity between now and 
that date as Campbell concocts various mechanisms to try to forestall that 
date," Weisser said. "We will do whatever we have to do to ensure that the 
execution occurs on time, without further delay." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority opinion noted that the 9th Circuit's action does not prevent 
Campbell from seeking a further stay of execution with the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "However," Reinhardt objected, "that should not ease the conscience of any 
member of this court or serve as an excuse for anyone's failure to perform his 
or her duty properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt said the 9th Circuit was obligated to issue a stay unless Campbell 
made a frivolous claim or appealed solely to delay matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's claim that hanging constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, 
Reinhardt said, clearly is not a frivolous claim for a variety of reasons, 
including the fact that Washington is one of only two states that permit 
execution by hanging. The other is Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington law gives a condemned individual the choice of death by hanging or 
lethal injection. But Campbell declined to choose, and under the law, that 
means execution by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola University criminal law professor, said Friday's 
majority opinion "is a clear indication that the 9th Circuit got the message 
from the Supreme Court and will move to expedite death penalty cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson said Campbell faces an uphill battle in his attempt to gain a stay 
from the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson also said Friday's opinions reflect the continuing deep divisions 
within the 9th Circuit on all aspects of the death penalty. All six judges in 
the majority were appointed by Republican presidents. The five dissenters were 
appointed by President Jimmy Carter.

MAN LIBELED AS KENNEDY KILLER GETS $1.1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica Superior Court judge awarded a Bakersfield farmer $1.1 million 
in damages Friday after ruling that a supermarket tabloid had falsely named him 
the true assassin of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard Harris ordered the Globe, which had never lost a libel suit, to 
pay Khalid Khawar the judgment after finding that the paper had failed in the 
test of whether the story was accurate and neutral.The judge was especially 
critical of the photo accompanying the article, which had a large black arrow 
pointing to Khawar and identifying him as the assassin. "I'm thankful I can now 
be recognized as Robert Kennedy's admirer and not his murderer," said Khawar 
after the judge's ruling, which upheld a jury's March 28 recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Khawar, at the time working as a free-lance photographer, was standing next to 
Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel only minutes before the senator was killed by 
Sirhan Sirhan. The Globe printed a story in which conspiracy theorist Robert 
Morrow suggested that Khawar was the true assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Glassman, the Globe lawyer, said he was "shellshocked" by the judge's 
ruling, which centered on the picture with the arrow rather than the story. 
Glassman said he did not know of another case in which a picture was ruled 
libelous. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ruling is unsupported by law or evidence," said Glassman, who said the 
Globe will immediately appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Pizzulli, Khawar's lawyer, said he hoped the outcome "will prove to be 
a watershed on the insidiousness of reckless tabloidism on responsible 
journalism."

FEDERAL OFFICIALS WILL INVESTIGATE DEPUTY'S SHOOTING; ORANGE COUNTY: JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT WILL ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEATH DURING A TRAINING 
EXERCISE WAS ACCIDENTAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One month after the Orange County Grand Jury refused to issue a criminal 
indictment, federal officials have stepped in to review the circumstances 
surrounding the Christmas Day shooting of a veteran sheriff's deputy by a 
fellow officer during a training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether grounds exist to indict 
Deputy Brian P. Scanlan under federal criminal civil rights law, Justice 
spokesman Myron Marlin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, launched in Washington, will try to determine whether Scanlan was 
simply negligent or intended to harm his fellow officer, Deputy Darryn Leroy 
Robins, 30, who died of head wounds inflicted by a single gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 The review may answer criticisms from Orange County minority groups who have 
insisted that the district attorney's office was too close to the Sheriff's 
Department to fairly investigate the volatile case. These critics have also 
questioned whether race played a part in the shooting, because Robins was black 
and Scanlan is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups had prodded the Justice Department to reopen the case after 
the grand jury made a rare rejection March 10 of a prosecutor's request for a 
manslaughter indictment against Scanlan. The district attorney's office, which 
conducted the investigation, said the 32-year-old deputy was "grossly 
negligent" in training with a loaded weapon during an impromptu exercise that 
led up to the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the two deputies were running through a mock car-stop behind a 
Lake Forest movie theater, with Robins playing the suspect and Scanlan the 
arresting officer. Scanlan maintained in an interview with investigators after 
the episode that he shot Robins accidentally after he was startled to see him 
pull a handgun from the visor of his car. Robins was apparently imitating a 
technique used by gang members to get the jump on police. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin said FBI agents have been dispatched to gather evidence weighing 
whether Scanlan broke a federal statute that bars anyone from depriving a 
person of his civil rights. But to lodge such a charge, officials would have to 
demonstrate that the deputy wanted to harm Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors were skeptical about whether that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three days of testimony and 14 witnesses, the Orange County Grand Jury 
was unwilling to indict for aggravated, reckless and grossly negligent 
behavior. So is it likely the feds will indict? I don't think so," said 
Assistant Dist. Atty. John D. Conley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan and his attorney, James B. Stotler, could not be reached for comment. 
Undersheriff Raul Ramos said his department will cooperate with the federal 
investigation, but he said the FBI and other federal officials have not 
notified them formally about the review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, this thing has lingered on and on," said Ramos. "My heart goes 
out to the families of the affected officers as it gets prolonged into another 
investigation. On the other hand, the facts are pretty straightforward and 
there's nothing to hide. So if somebody else looks into it, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of various community groups praised the Justice Department's decision 
to review the case, arguing that federal investigators will have a more 
independent perspective than the district attorney's office, which works 
closely with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way uneasiness will be laid to rest," said Amin David, a 
Latino activist with Los Amigos of Orange County, who met with members of the 
grand jury weeks ago to discuss this and other cases of minority interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene M. Wheeler, president of the civic group, 100 Black Men of Orange 
County, said the federal investigation probably would have been unnecessary had 
local authorities investigated the incident in a more open fashion to begin 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have prevented all this embarrassment," said Wheeler, whose group 
has consistently complained about the process. "They should do their job. Their 
explanation was not satisfactory as to why the case went to the grand jury when 
the district attorney indicated that charges should have been filed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the local investigation, prosecutors relied heavily on information provided 
by Scanlan. They say there were no other witnesses to the shooting because two 
other deputies on the scene were waiting around a corner for their turn to run 
through the exercise.

SCHOOLS SUED FOR BARRING SIKHS WEARING CEREMONIAL KNIVES; COURTS: MERCED COUNTY 
DISTRICT OFFICIALS SAY THE SYMBOLIC WEAPONS REQUIRED BY THE CHILDREN'S RELIGION 
COULD CAUSE INJURY. THE ACLU COUNTERS THAT THEY ARE NOT WEAPONS. 
</P>

<P>
 The ACLU on Friday sued a Merced County elementary school district on behalf 
of three Sikh children who were denied the right to wear ceremonial knives to 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, two brothers and a sister ages 7, 8 and 10, have been barred 
from school since January because their religion requires them to wear the 
knives beneath their clothing 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Livingston Union School District say the knives, known as 
kirpans, could be used as weapons and thus are forbidden on school grounds. 
Carried in a wooden or metal sheath, the kirpans have blades that are three to 
four inches long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern is for the safety of all our schoolchildren," said Henry Escobar, 
assistant superintendent at the rural school district. "These kirpans are 
daggers, with steel blades. In the wrong hands they could be very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The children's parents say the kirpan is one of five sacred symbols that must 
be worn at all times -- even while bathing or sleeping -- by baptized Khalsa 
Sikhs, who, like Orthodox Jews, follow strict religious traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The kirpan, which represents a Khalsa Sikh's duty to defend the weak and 
oppressed, is worn on a shoulder harness fastened at the waist by a sash. The 
other four symbols are long hair, a comb, a steel bracelet and special cotton 
undergarments. A Khalsa Sikh agrees to wear the symbols, known as the "Five 
Ks," the day he or she is baptized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kirpan is not a weapon," said Stephen V. Bomse, a San Francisco attorney 
handling the case for the family and the American Civil Liberties Union. "It is 
a religious symbol. Wearing it at all times is as important to Khalsa Sikhs as 
wearing a yarmulke is to Orthodox Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Bomse argued that the kirpan is far less dangerous than other common school 
implements readily available to children, items such as scissors, pens and 
baseball bats. He said there have been no reported incidents of violence 
involving kirpans on school grounds in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools unquestionably have legitimate concerns about violence," Bomse said. 
"But Sikh children are well trained in their religious obligations. They know 
the kirpan is neither a toy nor a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fresno, claims that the school 
district's action violates the children's religious freedoms under a federal 
law passed late last year. The lawsuit seeks a policy change allowing pupils 
and their parents to wear kirpans while on school property, and requests money 
damages from the district for depriving the children of their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other California school districts recently adopted rules permitting 
kirpans under certain guidelines. In Yuba City, Supt. Lee Brittenham said 
officials have "disarmed the kirpan" by requiring it to be riveted to its 
sheath, which must have a blunted, enclosed tip. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this modified state, it is not a weapon," said Brittenham, whose student 
population is about 12% Sikh. "We've managed to deal with the very critical 
safety concern and avoid infringing on people's basic religious rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Two districts -- in Live Oak, north of Sacramento, and Selma, near Fresno -- 
have adopted similar policies. A spokeswoman for the state Department of 
Education said she knew of no school district except Livingston that had banned 
kirpans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikhism, which began in about 1500 in present-day Pakistan, was founded by 
Guru Nanak and grew out of Hindu culture. Today, there are about 500,000 Sikhs 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the plaintiffs -- Rajinder Singh Cheema, Jaspreet Singh Cheema and 
Sukhjinder Kaur Cheema -- several other Sikh children have been sent home for 
wearing kirpans in Livingston schools. The others, Escobar said, have returned 
to school wearing miniature, symbolic kirpans around their necks.

MOLESTER PAROLED OUTSIDE SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials decided Friday to parole convicted child molester Thomas Max 
Hetherington to an undisclosed area outside San Diego County, acknowledging the 
right of his victims to keep Hetherington at least 35 miles away from them.  
</P>
<P>
 Three of Hetherington's victims, backed by officials here, had pleaded with 
Gov. Pete Wilson to honor the victims' right, saying they became hysterical at 
the thought of him being paroled near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 By state law, no violent felon can be paroled within 35 miles of a victim if 
the victim seeks such protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetherington, 78, convicted in 1982 of repeatedly molesting eight children at 
a day-care center in a rural area northeast of San Diego, will have daily 
contact with parole agents, who will monitor his whereabouts electronically. He 
also will be required to undergo psychological counseling, said Christine May, 
spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentenced to 21 years in prison, Hetherington was released Friday under a law 
that gives time off for good behavior. State officials declined to disclose his 
whereabouts, saying only that it is outside the county.

VOICES RAISED OVER LIBRARY FURNITURE COSTS; RENOVATIONS: PALOS VERDES GROUP 
CHARGES THAT $1,983 LEATHER CHAIRS AND $344 TRASH CANS ARE TOO HIGH. TRUSTEES 
CALL THE EXPENSES CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER SYSTEMS SPEND. 
</P>

<P>
 On the upscale Palos Verdes Peninsula, some residents may be used to nothing 
but the best. 
</P>
<P>
 But many affluent residents draw the line when it comes to furnishing the 
newly renovated Peninsula Center Library with $1,983 leather chairs and $344 
trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers were about to deliver the chairs, tables and sofas, but the 
library district's board of trustees decided Thursday after an acrimonious 
meeting to try to slash the $1.3-million furniture budget by about $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to bargain-hunt after furniture has been ordered will be expensive. One 
manufacturer, Westfall Interior Systems Inc. of Long Beach, said it would 
charge $32,000 if the order for its furniture is canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too late to cancel $274,000 in artwork, including two bronze cheetahs, a 
carved column, stone and mosaic works and etched glass. And furniture for the 
first phase of the project -- which one trustee estimates will cost $104,357 -- 
will arrive in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture orders have ignited a bitter debate on just how opulent a 
library the peninsula needs. Critics say the library can find chairs and tables 
that are cheaper, just as durable and as aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is the opportunity to get the same quality for a lower cost," 
said library trustee Harold Jesse. "Instead of buying a Lexus, we got a 
Rolls-Royce." 
</P>
<P>
 But other trustees who helped plan the project defend their selections, 
calling them consistent with what other libraries recently built or renovated 
have spent. Los Angeles County furnishes libraries at $25 per square foot while 
Peninsula Center will cost $20.71. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the Taj Mahal of (library projects) by any means," trustee Janet 
Smith said. "It's incumbent upon us to furnish it, finish it and do it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations to the library, which has remained open, are expected to be 
completed by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may not have been so up in arms over love seats and study carrels 
three years ago when voters passed a $16-million bond issue to fund a portion 
of the project, which will more than double the size of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, faced with cutbacks in state funding, the library was forced to 
cut hours and staff, and nearly closed its only two branches, at Miraleste and 
Malaga Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the community watchdog group Save Our Libraries has been highly 
critical of how money is spent in one of only a handful of special library 
districts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 District board meetings, once of interest only to die-hard patrons, have 
turned into sometimes heated sessions with standing-room-only crowds. And the 
district's November elections overshadowed other races on the peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of Save Our Libraries argue that needs at the two branches were 
ignored so that a palace-like main library could be built. They dispute claims 
that furniture spending is not excessive, and have conducted their own survey 
of state library projects to show it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grander they can make the project, the grander they are going to be," 
said Palos Verdes Estates resident John Dixon, one of the organizers of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on furniture has been the group's most recent target. Their 
most-mentioned example is the $1,983 leather seats. The district has ordered 31 
of the chairs from Eastman Inc., a furniture manufacturer, and plans to place 
them in lounge seating areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture plans also call for 36 stools at $277 each, four $1,108 love seats, 
a $1,519 rocking chair, four $1,691 dictionary stands and four trash cans for 
$344 each, according to lists from some of the library's contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials say the group has unfairly chosen the most expensive 
examples and ignored cost savings elsewhere. The project's interior designer, 
ZGF Partnership in Portland, came in $50,000 below budget, library officials 
said. In addition, Library Director Linda Elliott said in December that the 
amount of furniture planned for staff offices could be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Although $344 for a trash can may sound expensive, they are meant to last for 
20 years, Elliott said.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustees decided several years ago that $274,550 in artwork was reasonable to 
ensure that the facility did not overlook the need for an art component, 
Elliott said. The bronze cheetahs, one of which will greet visitors to the 
children's area and another that will be a centerpiece in that room, are being 
finished by artist Gwynne Murril. She also is making a carved column that will 
feature endangered African animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely in this world does paying less guarantee higher quality at better 
value," trustee Janet Smith said. "The only way to save such vast sums, in my 
opinion, is to accept poorer quality at lower cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents suggest that the district should hold off on buying much of the 
new furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like someone who lost their high-paying job and now works at 
McDonald's," said Robin Stevens, a Rolling Hills Estates resident, told the 
trustees Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he goes out and buys a Cadillac."

LAPD ADDS 2 PSYCHOLOGISTS TO AID OFFICERS; POLICE: CITY COUNCIL APPROVES 
HIRINGS, PROMPTED BY A SHARP RISE IN DEMAND FOR JOB-RELATED STRESS COUNSELING. 
HEAVIER WORKLOAD IS ALSO LINKED TO THE SHUTDOWN OF UNION'S THERAPY PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 A sharp increase in demand by Los Angeles police for psychological counseling 
has led the Police Department to hire two additional psychologists to assist 
officers afflicted by job-related stress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Friday agreed to hire the psychologists, 
bringing the counseling staff to nine, after receiving a report that LAPD 
therapists conducted twice as many therapy sessions in 1993 as they did three 
years earlier and handled nearly four times as many suicide threats by 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing workload for the Police Department's Behavioral Science 
Services Section is partly a result of a reported increase in stress among 
officers, but also to the shutdown more than two years ago of the Police 
Protective League's psychological counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Police Department's expanded psychological staff also will 
be needed to cope with the increasing number of officers who will join the 
force as Mayor Richard Riordan and Police Chief Willie L. Williams continue 
with their five-year plan to beef up the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police officers feel they are going out every day and putting their lives on 
the line, getting shot at and stabbed and then seeing themselves criticized 
when they go home and watch the evening news," said Debra Glaser, acting chief 
of the police psychological unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser said police work has always been stressful, with higher rates of 
alcoholism and divorce than in the general population. But she and others in 
the department said they have noticed a striking increase in a sort of blue- 
Angst since the beating of Rodney G. King more than three years ago. The deluge 
of criticism after the incident, and the subsequent conviction of two officers, 
alienated many police, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers feel that the pressure and anxiety on the job has been nearly 
relentless ever since, heightened by a triad of disasters -- the riots, 
wildfires and earthquake, said Fred Tredy, a director with the police union. 
Police have been further disillusioned, he said, because they have gone without 
a pay raise or a contract during roughly the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling of isolation for officers was exacerbated in late 1991, when the 
police union's counseling program was disbanded after the city pulled $300,000 
in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 City executives and the union said they hope that the program will be revived 
as a part of ongoing contract negotiations. But in the meantime, it is believed 
that many of the 1,000 officers a year who had used the union program have 
turned to the in-house Behavioral Science Services Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even if all those officers had shifted from the union's program to the 
department's, they would only account for a portion of the surge in requests 
for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department had requested the addition of five psychologists, as 
well as action to fill a vacancy for an executive to head the unit. The City 
Council agreed to hire the two psychologists -- who will make $58,000 a year -- 
and city officials said they will track the unit's workload and consider adding 
more therapists later. 
</P>
<P>
 The counseling unit was the first of its kind when it was founded 23 years ago 
by psychologist Martin Reiser. It occupies a suite of offices in a Chinatown 
bank building. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists conducted 1,834 counseling sessions in 1990, a figure that had 
jumped to 3,700 by 1993, according to a report from the city administrative 
officer. The number of emergency calls, ranging from officers involved in 
shootings to those who witnessed traumatic events such as suicides, jumped from 
75 in 1991 to 160 last year. The number of calls from officers contemplating 
suicide jumped from 14 to 60 annually over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual suicides by officers and police retirees have held fairly steady over 
the last decade, with a total of 15 suicides during that time, a Police 
Department spokeswoman said. The most in any year was five suicides in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we never had to keep statistics on suicides," Glaser said. "Now we 
get calls like that all the time."

DEMOCRATS START THEIR CONVENTION AMID DISCORD; POLITICS: BATTLE CONTINUES OVER 
JOHN GARAMENDI'S CHARGE THAT KATHLEEN BROWN HAD ADVANCE NOTICE OF QUESTIONS AT 
A CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSN. FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California Democrats, who excel at backbiting and arm-twisting election year 
conventions that can leave their candidates wounded, thought they would try 
something new at this weekend's gathering in Los Angeles: unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. The elaborately planned love fest turned nasty Friday within minutes of 
the convention's opening, at its very first event, which was supposed to be a 
genteel celebration of the party's women. 
</P>
<P>
 The battleground was the continuing brouhaha over whether state treasurer and 
leading gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown tried to gain unfair advantage 
over other candidates by procuring in advance questions that were to be asked 
at a January California Teachers' Assn. forum. 
</P>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi alleges that Brown arranged to 
receive the questions from Alice Huffman, the union's political director and a 
Brown partisan. Huffman has acknowledged giving Brown briefings before the 
forum, and Huffman's political action committee received $175,000 from Brown's 
campaign this year. But Huffman has said she did nothing wrong, and on Friday 
she publicly retaliated against Garamendi's wife, Patti. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation occurred at Friday's women's caucus lunch, as Huffman 
accepted a Democratic party award. She was on the dais while Patti Garamendi 
was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patti, you tell John this: They were ill-advised and they were dirty tricks," 
Huffman said of John Garamendi's charges. "And you tell him that it's one thing 
to be a candidate; it's another one to try to destroy a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman demanded an apology and added another threat: "So Patti, you tell John 
that if he doesn't watch out, not only will we reach out, but we will do it 
with style. And you tell him that when he has hit women the way he has hit us 
two women, that when he finishes, he's just going to be chopped liver, baby, 
because we ain't stopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Garamendi said she was stunned at Huffman's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it condescending and I found it insulting for women," Garamendi said. 
"If she has something to say to John Garamendi, then she should confront him 
herself. John Garamendi is an outstanding man and he did what was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached later, John Garamendi called Huffman's attack "pretty sad . . . but 
this isn't about Alice Huffman. This is about Kathleen Brown and whether she 
cheated." 
</P>
<P>
 Declarations of war notwithstanding, party Chairman Bill Press insisted that 
unity is still the watchword for the weekend. "Alice is not an officer of the 
Democratic Party," he said, adding that "she was not speaking for a political 
party. She was speaking for what happened to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the outburst could not come as good news to Press, who has gone 
to extraordinary lengths to maintain a veneer of friendliness at the three-day 
annual convention. Although the Democrats can endorse a candidate for governor, 
the prospect of a messy contest horrified party officials. So Press decreed 
that no endorsement for the state's highest office will be awarded. Requests 
for a candidate debate were also quashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to emphasize our differences," Press said. "We wanted to 
emphasize the one common goal, which is getting rid of Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Press' quest for unity is broadly seen as benefiting Brown, who hopes that the 
convention will give her a boost after weeks spent shaking up her campaign. 
Neither Garamendi nor the third Democratic candidate for governor, state Sen. 
Tom Hayden, were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the democratic process is to allow candidates to discuss 
their views on issues, but our process has devolved into conventions as light 
entertainment and campaigns as merchandising," said Hayden's campaign manager, 
Duane Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention also will highlight the importance that President Clinton and 
the national Democratic Party have placed on California. The Westin 
Bonaventure, site of the convention, will be awash in Administration officials. 
Chief among them is Vice President Al Gore, who will speak today. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton has his eye on California for 1996, Brown's effort is current, 
and it is she who may have the most on the line. After spending much of the 
past year lauded as the probable Democratic nominee, Brown has recently been 
criticized within the party for failing to suitably impress the state's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who favor Brown, such as Press, consider a prospective race between 
Brown and incumbent Wilson to be a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has very effectively used the fact of his incumbency to make this 
a horse race," Press said. "People discount him because he is wooden and bland 
and he is -- but he knows how to punch key issues and craft a message that may 
be simplistic, may be superficial, but that resounds with the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Reilly, who assumed control of Brown's campaign two weeks ago after she 
lost confidence in her earlier team, said the treasurer will use her speech 
Sunday before the delegates to say "some very substantive things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and Garamendi each asked that the party arrange a candidates debate 
during the convention, but Press refused. Each, like Brown, will be allotted 10 
minutes for speeches Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for other statewide offices will also speak to delegates, and 
endorsements in those races will be voted on Sunday.

D.A. CONSIDERS POSSIBLE CHARGES AGAINST FATHER IN BOY'S SUICIDE; SHOOTING: 
POLICE SAY THE 10-YEAR-OLD KILLED HIMSELF IN A SCHOOLYARD WITH A PISTOL THAT 
BELONGS TO HIS FATHER. PROSECUTORS ARE ANALYZING WHETHER THE PARENT CAN BE 
CHARGED BECAUSE THE WEAPON WAS ACCESSIBLE TO A MINOR.

<P>
 The district attorney's office is deciding whether to file charges against the 
father of the 10-year-old boy who shot himself to death in a South-Central Los 
Angeles schoolyard after being suspended from class for misbehavior, police 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol that Jorge Licea used to fatally wound 
himself belonged to his father, Jorge Ramiro Licea Aguilar , according to 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the boy had found the weapon hidden beneath a mattress, then loaded 
the pistol with ammunition that was stored separately, on the top shelf of a 
bedroom dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Children's Firearms Protection Act, which took effect in 1992, an 
adult can face up to three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine for keeping 
a loaded weapon that is accessible to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's office is taking a look at that, and analyzing the 
case, to see if there is enough there to press charges," said Detective John 
Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department's Newton Street station. "They 
won't have an answer until sometime next week." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the family home, Jorge's parents said they did not know 
anything about possible charges, and were more concerned about what could have 
led their son to take his life. As friends and neighbors arrived with food and 
condolences, they grappled with possible reasons, frequently breaking down in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents said Jorge recently brought home several notes suggesting that he 
was having problems in class and that each time, they signed them and came in 
to school as requested. 
</P>
<P>
 In the conferences, they were told that "Jorge didn't answer questions fast 
enough when he was called on," said his mother, Maria Franco Luna. "And the 
notes would say that when he copied things, he was slow." 
</P>
<P>
 One note dated March 28, which was signed by Jorge's father but was not 
returned, said the child was "having problems respecting" teachers and other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jorge was very sensitive," his father said, adding that the boy was upset he 
had to apologize in front of the class. "It was really hard on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we had no idea how hard. My son swallowed his problems. This is so hard. 
As close as we were, he didn't tell me," Licea said, breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Garcia said Licea told police that he was investigated by the LAPD 
four or five years ago for possibly abusing the boy. Licea said that he did 
strike Jorge once when he was in first grade, but that after he spoke with a 
detective, the matter was not pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it had any relevance in this case," Garcia said. "He didn't 
beat the child; it was more of a one-strike type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The detective said he has not yet determined whether there was a child abuse 
investigation, or what its outcome might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Garcia said he does not believe that the child was driven to 
suicide by fears of punishment by his father. "Quite frankly, I doubt it," the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said a teacher at the 49th Street Elementary School suspended the boy 
on Tuesday, reportedly for using profane language in his fifth-grade class, 
although Jorge's parents said their son never mentioned this to them or showed 
them a note. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Lemuel Chavis said the boy was sent home with a note that asked his 
parents to come with him to school on Wednesday to discuss the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the boy apparently stashed the pistol in his backpack before his 
father drove him to school Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 a.m., as his fellow students filed past him at the front door of 
the school, the sobbing boy pulled out the pistol, pressed it to his temple and 
pulled the trigger, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than four hours of surgery at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center, the boy never regained consciousness. On Thursday afternoon, moments 
after he was removed from life-support systems, Jorge Licea died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I think he did it?" Garcia asked. "I've spoken to the teacher briefly, 
and I think the boy was upset about being suspended. . . . That was his 
behavior when he got in trouble, he'd go home crying, upset. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to his father, his mother, his older brother, they're all telling 
me the same thing," Garcia said. "They don't understand why. If anything, 
they're blaming the pressure school puts on a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, the school principal, said Wednesday it was difficult for him to 
believe that the note from the school was sufficient to create the sort of 
anxiety that would lead to suicide, "unless there was something else bothering 
him in his personal life or home life." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Navarro, a lawyer advising the family, reacted strongly Friday to Chavis' 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is solely concerned about liability," Navarro said. "They are 
least concerned about the truth. They are least concerned about the grieving 
process that this family is going through. (Those are) nothing but speculations 
on their part that (there are) problems going on at home."SUICIDES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; LEARNING SPANISH IN SMALL DOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-grade teacher Persida Himmele waved and then walked out her classroom 
door, saying, " Adios, estudiantes. " 
</P>
<P>
 Her students responded: " Adios, Mrs. Himmele." 
</P>
<P>
 Himmele was conducting a Spanish conversation lesson at Laurel Elementary 
School, where everyone is learning to speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel recently started its new Spanish Conversation Program, the only one of 
its kind in the county. The program involves 15-minute sessions in which all 
students, teachers and administrators are to converse in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 It was created by Laurel Principal Tim Harvey and the school's bilingual 
coordinator, Carmen Brias, as an enrichment program for the school, which has a 
49% Latino student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey and Brias said the program does not take the place of other subjects 
and is integrated into the curriculum. Teachers conduct the 15-minute Spanish 
conversation lessons, which they helped create, twice or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons are helping all the school's 322 kindergarten through sixth-grade 
students learn to converse in Spanish with their classmates, Harvey said. He 
said the program is not mandatory. None have refused to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Laurel students already speak Spanish and the program is developing 
"self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment," Brias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pupils who demonstrate thorough comprehension of the day's lesson are 
designated as tutors. Each class has about six or seven tutors who make sure 
small groups of classmates learn the lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, first-grader Nestor Galvez, 7, drilled five students on 
the names of colors. Holding a blue sheet of paper, Nestor asked Brian Seo: 
"Que color es este?" (Spanish for, What color is this?) 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, 7, enthusiastically answered, "Azul! (Blue)" 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby fourth-grade class, teacher Kim Thornsen placed six sheets of 
colored paper on the board and had students point to the different colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be hard to learn Spanish, but it's not," said John 
Manansala, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 His classmate, Joana Serna, also 10, said she likes the program: "I'm teaching 
Spanish to the kids that don't know it. It gets me excited because we talk in 
my (first) language. Makes me feel proud." 
</P>
<P>
 The program was designed to be simple, Brias said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy, fast and fun, yet comprehensive at the same time, and the kids 
don't even realize they are learning the language," she said.MIMI KO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA CRESCENTA; HEART 
DISEASE, NOT BASEBALL, BLAMED FOR BOY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Crescenta boy who died several hours after he was hit in the head with a 
baseball had a fatal heart condition, officials said Friday, confirming his 
parents' suspicions that the accidental blow did not contribute to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy results showed that Timothy Richard Herman, 9, had an enlarged heart 
and that several tumors were present in the heart muscle, said Scott Carrier of 
the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy died just before midnight Wednesday, several hours after he was hit in 
the head, just below his helmet, with a pitched ball. The fourth-grader 
continued to play the game -- pitching for several innings and garnering three 
hits for his team, the Jasco Jammers. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning home Timmy complained of pain in his leg, and he was found by 
his mother several minutes later, lying unconscious in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an autopsy showed a "bruising of the scalp present on the left side 
of the head," no skull fractures or brain injuries were noted, Carrier said.

<P>
 Volunteers for the South County Safe Rides program will be thanked in a big 
way with a banquet at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 students and adults who participated in the program that 
provides transportation home for teen-agers who have been out drinking will be 
honored at the event, sponsored by the Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials credited the program with helping prevent teen-age deaths due 
to alcohol-related accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, there was not a single student fatality due to drinking and 
driving" in South County, said Dr. Thomas Shaver, who heads the medical 
center's trauma unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Rides is an outreach program of the Explorer Division of the Boy Scouts 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who are too drunk to drive can get a ride home on Friday and Saturday 
nights by calling the hospital at (800) 273-RIDE. Volunteers staff the phones 
and respond to the calls for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Rides program will be bolstered by a $15,000 donation that will be 
presented at the banquet by a representative from the discount clothing chain 
T.J. Maxx. FRANK MESSINA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; BEVERLY 
HILLS WEEKLY CEASES PUBLICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Post, a weekly newspaper with roots on the Westside since 
1928, ceased publication this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tabloid-sized publication fell victim to the divorce of its owner, 
Margaret (Peggy) Harris, and her husband, Walter, who could not agree on its 
disposition in their settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees were told on Thursday that talks had collapsed and Friday's edition 
would not be published. The Post, which was distributed free, was also hurt by 
weak advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Post was the final survivor of a newspaper group based on 
Robertson Boulevard that once printed publications serving West Hollywood, 
along with the Pico-Robertson and Century City districts of Los Angeles. The 
Post's demise leaves the Beverly Hills Courier as the city's only newspaper.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 INDICTED 
IN TAX CASE LINKED TO PROBE OF DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury returned indictments Friday against a former Los Angeles 
police officer and a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, charging both 
with making a false statement on their 1987 federal income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 The two former officers, Stephen W. Polack and Christina Townley, were married 
at the time and filed a joint income tax return that year, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty.Mark A. Byrne, who is prosecuting the case. According to 
prosecutors, the couple's return falsely reported far less income than the two 
actually earned that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The case grows out of a prolonged investigation of sheriff's deputies, 21 of 
whom have been convicted on charges including stealing money seized from 
narcotics suspects and failure to report that money on tax returns. In other 
cases, Polack faces conspiracy and civil rights charges, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Any income, even illegally earned income, is subject to taxes and failure to 
report it is a criminal offense. If convicted, Polack and Townley face up to 
three years each in prison and fines of as much as $100,000.

LAWYERS ORDERED TO DISCUSS DEAL FOR MENENDEZES; COURTS: JUDGE TELLS DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS AND PROSECUTORS TO MEET FOR PLEA BARGAIN TALKS TO AVOID A COSTLY 
RETRIAL OF THE BROTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that plea bargain talks would be prudent, the judge in the Menendez 
brothers murder trial ordered the prosecution and defense Friday to discuss the 
possibility of a deal that would end the high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently hoping to save the millions in taxpayer dollars and the many months 
that a retrial of Lyle and Erik Menendez would consume, Van Nuys Superior Court 
Judge Stanley M. Weisberg directed both sides to sit down for settlement talks 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he is not trying to pressure the prosecution and defense to 
strike a deal. Instead, he noted that most criminal cases end in a plea bargain 
and said: "This case should be no exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg added: "If you approach this like you approach any case, you'll be 
doing your clients, all your clients, a service." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy 
entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47. The sons shot the parents in 
the TV room of the family's Beverly Hills mansion.  
</P>
<P>
 At their first trial, which lasted six months, the brothers admitted the 
shootings, but said they fired in fear and self-defense after years of 
physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Prosecutors contend that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial ended in January, when separate juries, one for each brother, 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. Both brothers remain 
in jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 When that trial ended, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said a plea bargain was out of 
the question. He insisted that the brothers were guilty of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys responded that no jury would ever convict the brothers of 
that charge.  
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg said Friday that the end of the trial had produced "bombast (and) 
rhetoric on all sides." But that was then, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, it is time for negotiation. "That is something that is 
appropriate in any case and certainly appropriate in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, the lawyers said they willing to talk to each other. But no 
one volunteered optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 If no deal can be struck, Weisberg said he will set a trial date at a June 27 
hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 The start date for a retrial depends on whether one jury or two will hear the 
case, and on whether the brothers will be tried together or separately. 
Weisberg said he will take up those issues June 27.

SVORINICH SEEKS APOLOGY FROM FORMER AIDE; POLITICS: ONETIME MEMBER OF 
COUNCILMAN'S STAFF, WHO ACCUSED HIM OF IMPROPER CONDUCT, REFUSES RETRACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After enduring weeks of blistering criticism, Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. has demanded that a former staff member retract allegations that 
the lawmaker engaged in improper conduct, including the acceptance of 
unreported campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand came in a letter sent to John Barbieri,one of six former Svorinich 
aides to leave the councilman's office three months ago. The exodus, described 
by Svorinich as a reorganization, led the former staffers to level various 
accusations against the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the accusations were reported by several newspapers, Svorinich's 
attorney, Skip Miller, said in an April 4 letter sent to Barbieri: "We have 
reason to believe that these false and spiteful statements were made with 
malicious and malevolent intent and that you had knowledge of the falsity of 
each of them when made." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri on Friday refused to issue the apology demanded by the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudy has managed to defame his own character just fine without the help of me 
and many others," Barbieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich could not be reached for comment about the letter. Miller claimed 
Barbieri's comments were prompted by revenge stemming from disappointment that 
he no longer was working for the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the source of the ugliness, the rumors, the innuendoes, the 
falsehoods," Miller said. "We want him to stop his smear campaign. It is 
totally unwarranted. . . . It is just the age-old story of a disgruntled 
ex-employee." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the letter implies a lawsuit for slander could be filed against 
Barbieri, Miller said no decision has been made about such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Svorinich has strongly denied the allegations by Barbieri and 
others that campaign contributions were brought to Svorinich's San Pedro office 
and that he and an aide have done work for his Wilmington paint store on city 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations have been under investigation by the city's Ethics Commission 
and the county district attorney's office.

READ HER LIPS: YUCK!; STUDENTS BECOME BOOKWORMS, PRINCIPAL TAKES THE BAIT AND 
KEEPS HER PLEDGE BY EATING SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a promise that Shirley DiRado, principal at Colfax Avenue Elementary 
School, knew she couldn't wiggle out of. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks ago, she vowed to eat a live worm in front of students who read at 
least two books in this year's Read-a-Thon. On Friday, it was time to pay up as 
about 350 students -- more than half the school's population-packed the 
auditorium to see if DiRado would really do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the administrator gobbled not one, but three squirming mealworms 
-- one for the Channel 11 crew, who said they might have to leave early, one to 
make good on her promise and one to spur children to read one more book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been an educator too long to be nervous or scared," DiRado said between 
her first and second grub. But, she confessed, patting her stomach, "it's still 
in there and I'm trying not to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The principal took on the challenge after the Read-a-Thon chairwoman told her 
that interest in the program was flagging. DiRado decided worms would be the 
perfect bait to get children hooked on reading. 
</P>
<P>
 DiRado the performer took over from DiRado the principal as she selected the 
"fattest, juiciest" worm from a silvery platter. The school nurse jokingly 
stood at the ready with a stretcher to heighten the drama of the stunt. Someone 
played a drum roll. Television cameras from local stations also rolled. 
Children from kindergarten through sixth grade gasped, laughed and cheered as 
DiRado gulped the invertebrate. A moment later, in a sleight of hand that would 
have done Houdini proud, the principal -- putting on a look of bafflement -- 
pulled yards of colorful streamers from her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of DiRado's pledge, the number of students who participated in the 
Read-a-Thon doubled this year, said program chairwoman Paige Gage. Proceeds, 
from sponsors who pledge money for each book a child reads, help fund the 
federal Reading Is Fundamental program at the school, which encourages children 
to read by distributing free books and sponsoring other activities, including a 
poster contest and a bookmark-making activity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Read-a-Thon, sponsors pledge money for each book that a child reads. 
Kindergarten pupils, first-graders and special-education students can get 
credit for books read to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mealworms -- which are not true worms but are beetle larvae -- were chosen 
because they are bred in bran and are less likely to have germs than 
earthworms, Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, the stunt was a success. Students said that they read so they 
could attend the assembly, and that they intended to keep on reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that reading was fun. It was cool," said Kandyce Rolon, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mrs. DiRado is) being like a child, she's relating to us," said sixth-grader 
Daniel Cerny. "It's like fun and learning combined."

AL MARTINEZ: THE LAST LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A low ceiling and dim fluorescent lights cast the room in a funereal glow. 
Faint illumination from bluish computer screens contributes to the unsettling 
effect. Sounds are muted, voices low. Urgency lives here. 
</P>
<P>
 We're four stories below ground in City Hall East behind vault doors and 
concrete walls a foot thick. There is no sunlight here, no fresh air, no 
flowers . . . only wall panels with trees painted on them. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in an odd way, this a place of life despite its somber milieu and the 
disquieting proximity of death; it's one last chance, a final link. It's where 
the 911 calls come. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here wondering about the people who handle these calls and what it does to 
them. How often can you hear screams without screaming? How much pain can you 
absorb without hurting? How many nightmares can one person ride before the ride 
goes on forever? 
</P>
<P>
 They get about 12,000 calls a day at what is officially known as the Police 
Department's Communications Division Center. Capt. Tom Elfmont is its 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every call is laced with anguish. Lonely people want someone to talk to. 
Confused people order taxis. Angry people shout obscenities. Kids giggle and 
hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the voices that come to those who take the calls come with 
problems too great to handle alone. They hear footsteps in the night, they 
don't want to live anymore, their child is missing, they've been hurt, they're 
running . . . they're dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things you hear," one of the listeners says, "that you're just 
never going to be able to walk off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her name is Brenda Hickie. As a police service representative, she's been 
working this room for 14 years, both as a dispatcher and as a 911 operator. 
It's a long time to absorb so much pain, she says; maybe too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Counseling is available for those who can no longer bear the sounds of death 
in their ears, but sometimes even counseling isn't enough. The echo lasts a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could be talking to an officer and suddenly hear shots," Elfmont says. 
"Then they hear, 'I'm hit, I'm hit' . . . and it could be the officer's last 
words. They've got to sit there and listen to a human being die." 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, sturdy woman of 42, Hickie still thinks about an incident early in her 
career when a mother and daughter were fleeing from the woman's husband, who 
was threatening to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in one car and he was in another, chasing them. She kept calling 
from different phone booths, but I had no one to send out. That night I heard 
on the news that both the woman and her daughter had been shot." 
</P>
<P>
 A divorced mother of two, Hickie tries not to think about the situations she 
handles daily. The baggage, she says, is just too much to carry and can confuse 
the roles of mom and 911 operator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was finding it hard to take my kids' troubles seriously after listening to 
real stuff all day," she says. "I had to separate the two and realize their 
problems were important too." 
</P>
<P>
 But still . . . a scraped knee isn't the last sounds of life: "A suicide asked 
me once, 'Give me a reason to live. No one cares.' I said, 'I care.' But he 
pulled the trigger. I heard gunfire." She takes a deep breath, remembering. 
"You have to tap into something deep to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "911 operator 458." Her voice is calm but authoritative as she takes calls at 
her console. Operators must retain their equilibrium, even if the situation 
involves them personally. Once in awhile it does. A house fire proved to be the 
home of the operator who took the 911 call. Only after doing her job did she 
head for home. 
</P>
<P>
 I listen in on a dozen or so of Hickie's calls. A knife fight is in progress 
on the Westside. Two burglars are being held at gunpoint in South-Central. A 
woman is being beaten by her boyfriend in the Valley. A child is missing in San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 For about two hours I'm packaged into this place underground, a 
non-participating element of the drama that never ends. The voices are garbled 
with terror, breathless with urgency or torn by pain. Hickie calms them, cuts 
through the turmoil, identifies the problem and dispatches the units. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't always know how the drama ends and rarely asks. "I can't carry 
that around," she says. "It would destroy me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another call from San Pedro. "I still can't find my boy!" the father shouts, 
on the verge of tears. "He's only 2!"  
</P>
<P>
 "Help is on the way, sir," Hickie says evenly. Only when the man hangs up does 
she betray the intensity of her feeling. She says tightly, and mostly to 
herself, "Find that baby!"  
</P>
<P>
 I leave with the drama still being played out. I hope they found the kid. 
Brenda Hickie hopes so too.

RIOT DEFENDANT TESTIFIES FOR PROSECUTION; COURTS: HENRY WATSON, CONVICTED IN 
REGINALD DENNY BEATING CASE, DENIES NAMING THE MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY FIRED SHOTS AT 
FLORENCE AND NORMANDIE AVENUES.

<P>
 Henry Keith Watson, one of the defendants in the Reginald O. Denny beating 
case, was back in court Friday, testifying for the prosecution in the final 
criminal trial stemming from attacks against motorists at Florence and 
Normandie avenues during the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watson, who is on five years' probation for two misdemeanor convictions 
involving assaults at that intersection, was not a friendly witness for the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristling on the witness stand, he denied a prosecutor's contention that he 
gave a statement naming Lance Jerome Parker, 28, as the man who rode a 
motorcycle into the infamous intersection on April 29, 1992, as Denny was being 
beaten, and fired a shotgun at the gas tank of Denny's gravel truck, then at a 
woman at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a former semiprofessional football player, is charged with two counts 
of discharging a firearm with gross negligence. If convicted, Parker faces a 
15-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony Friday, Watson repeatedly denied that he ever said he saw 
Parker fire the gun at the truck or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not be budged from that account, even after Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin 
McCormick showed him the statement, which McCormick said Watson gave to him and 
two detectives April 8 at his parents' home in the presence of his mother and 
father. It had been signed by Watson's father Friday morning, McCormick said. 
Henry Watson did not sign the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Watson acknowledged that McCormick and the officers were at his 
parents' house for about 10 minutes on April 8, but insisted that he told them 
nothing. He said he was in court Friday only because he had been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's father later testified that he was not sure whether McCormick or his 
son had named Parker as the gunman during the interview at his house. One of 
the police officers who was present at the meeting then testified that she 
heard Watson make the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Martina Villalobos acknowledged that neither she, McCormick nor the 
other officer tape-recorded Watson's statement or took notes. 
</P>
<P>
 During Watson's testimony, a minor stir was caused when Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti sat among spectators for about an hour. Garcetti said later that he 
was there to see McCormick in action and frequently sat in on trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's attorney complained in court about Garcetti's presence and later told 
reporters he believed the district attorney was there to remind Watson that he 
is on probation and could be sent to prison if he is not cooperative.

DESPITE MANY OBSTACLES, THE CHAPEL HAS BECOME A RAY OF HOPE IN ONE OF L.A.'S 
GRITTIEST NEIGHBORHOODS.

 The Rev. Philip Lance is out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a world away from the gothic cloisters of great cathedrals, or his 
walled seminary in New York. Even the well-manicured Episcopal parishes of Los 
Angeles seem strangely distant. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the gritty, crime-ridden MacArthur Park district, Lance's 
storefront office and chapel look out on a tableau of human hope and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Children skip gleefully up the sidewalk, oblivious to ominous-looking 
strangers. A man leaning aimlessly against a wall comes to an uneasy alert as 
an LAPD horse patrol approaches and passes by. The routine of the street 
resumes -- stealthy exchanges of money from runner to dealer, from palm to 
palm, as fluid as water passing over rock. A woman with a lithe figure and an 
incongruently hardened face holds a dollar bill in her outstretched arm and 
waives it at passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Philip Lance, "the padre," is out of place -- and right where he wants to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 After 2 1/2 years leading the small Episcopal mission of Pueblo Nuevo, he has 
built up a congregation of 25 families and started two businesses that help 
support the chapel and provide a living to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The successes, measured in changed lives and newfound hope, have been won in 
the face of riots, meager funds and initial skepticism from church leaders who 
wondered how this blue-eyed, decidedly Anglo priest from an old Pasadena family 
could possibly succeed. Lance said he has never had second thoughts about his 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do believe that the place the church is needed most is in 
neighborhoods like this one," Lance said. "Christians really are called to seek 
out the darkest corners and try to shed some light." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the light of pious thoughts or "I'll pray for you" spirituality. 
If the Word is validated by a life lived, then Philip Lance is living among 
those that Jesus was said to love -- the poor, the afflicted, the outcasts.  
</P>
<P>
 It is midmorning and the Padre, his light brown hair falling across his 
forehead and looking every inch a yuppie, is hard at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he tells someone on the telephone, "it depends when I can get gravel 
delivered, but probably tomorrow morning." He is lining up another job for 
Pueblo Nuevo Enterprises, an employee-owned, profit-making property maintenance 
cooperative that grosses about $12,000 a month and employs nine members of the 
mission, five of them on a full-time basis. Its core customers are banks that 
contract with the cooperative to maintain property that has been repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Lance is on the phone again, this time talking with the office of Los 
Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez. Lance is hoping the councilman will 
show up on a Saturday to listen to their plans for launching another business 
-- this one called Business Incubator -- that will require a city use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a kind of indoor bazaar or swap meet where MacArthur Park 
residents can rent booths to sell their goods and earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 When the time came, Hernandez did show up, and one of his aides, Jose Gardea, 
was upbeat. "Any time a group of people take the initiative to get together to 
work on a project of this kind, it's always positive," Gardea said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bazaar, scheduled to open this fall, is backed by the separate nonprofit 
Pueblo Nuevo Development Corp., which is controlled by members of Lance's 
mission, who sit on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission, near 7th Street and Burlington Avenue, draws most of its $10,000 
monthly income from a thrift store next door. The rest comes from donations 
from All Saints Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills ($1,000), the women of St. 
Cross Episcopal Church in Hermosa Beach ($125), and the Episcopal Diocese of 
Los Angeles ($360). The mission also enjoys enthusiastic backing from Bishop 
Frederick H. Borsch, and St. James Episcopal Church on Wilshire offers 
scholarships so that children of the mission can attend its day school. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance, 34, said he started the mission 2 1/2 years ago after he lost his 
position as associate rector at St. Athanasius Episcopal Church in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was familiar with the central city area and speaks fluent Spanish, 
Lance said, he wanted to remain in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Lance was holding Eucharistic services in MacArthur Park 
and finding ways to support his fledging mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of an entrepreneur," he said. "I have that ability to take risks." 
His idea raised eyebrows at diocesan headquarters and among potential 
supporters at other parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit, it did seem like overwhelming odds," Lance said. "How can 
you start a new Episcopal congregation? Usually you look for some land in the 
suburbs, raise $300,000 and look for 40 or 50 middle-class people," he said 
with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 There were unexpected problems. "How do you get someone to a job (requiring) a 
vacuum cleaner when they don't have a car?" Another was the time that a recent 
immigrant was sent to a house-cleaning job. She had never seen an automatic 
dishwasher. She put regular soap in the machine. Before long, soap suds were 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he said, is a lack of education and joblessness that translates 
into powerlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working on training leaders. It's important to our organization for those 
here to become leaders of others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the mission opened its own chapel, Lance held services wherever he 
could. The congregation was kicked out of the chapel at the headquarters of the 
Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese because an archdeacon happened by on a Sunday to 
discover that children were running wild throughout the three-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had nowhere to go, so we landed in the park. We were homeless," Lance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the trials, he said, the priesthood is better than he had imagined. 
"It turned out much better, but differently," he said. "Every year I feel more 
like a priest even though I'm doing less of what a priest traditionally does." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lance, the rewards are the testimonies of changed lives. "When I came (to 
MacArthur Park)," one woman told The Times, "I felt very sad because I didn't 
know anybody. I didn't know where to go or who to tell I didn't have a job or 
anything to eat. You feel very much alone." 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, she worked in a garment factory earning just $60 a week to help 
support herself and three children. Then she turned to selling broiled corn on 
the cob from a sidewalk stand -- only to be told by police that such vending 
was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 After affiliating with Pueblo Nuevo Mission, she said, she found a steady job 
through the mission's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance told of another woman who came to the park one day expecting to attend a 
meeting about jobs. It turned out to be an outdoor Eucharist celebrated by 
Lance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She counts that as a turning point in her life and thinks in a very special 
way about the presentation of the Host," Lance said. "I think . . . she 
perceived in that moment a community that might offer her something new and 
different -- and a way out of a life she had fallen into where there was no 
escape from addiction, abuse, violence and lack of employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lance said he sometimes gets angry when he hears well-heeled Episcopalians 
asking what his mission is doing in MacArthur Park. "Isn't that where all the 
drunks are?" he quoted one woman as asking. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance said there is a very definite place for traditional ministries. Suburban 
churches, he said, are extremely important. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do get irritated sometimes when I hear week after week of sermons in 
suburban churches which are very much (aimed) at an individual, interior 
spirituality. That's just the beginning of what being a Christian is about.

EVANGELICAL GROUP PUTS FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENT; ECOLOGY: NEW COALITION SPARKS 
SERIOUS DISPUTE. SOME CHURCH OFFICIALS SAY IT HAS EXAGGERATED EXTENT OF EARTH'S 
POLLUTION AND THAT STRICTER REGULATIONS WOULD HURT ECONOMY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of focusing strictly on the needs of the human spirit, 
evangelicals are beginning to be concerned with the human habitat as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they make their way through this new terrain, the path is marked by 
uncertainty, apprehension and sometimes discord. 
</P>
<P>
 When evangelicals clash on the environment, the disagreement has more to do 
with differing views on science or the economy than on theological issues. Some 
evangelicals even question the reality of the so-called environmental crisis, 
citing a lack of conclusive scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is painted against the backdrop of the newly formed 
Evangelical Environmental Network, a joint venture of World Vision, a relief 
and humanitarian agency, and Evangelicals for Social Action, a coalition of 
theologically conservative activists involved in a broad range of public policy 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which is based in suburban Philadelphia, released its first 
statement, "An Evangelical Declaration on the Care of Creation," in March. 
</P>
<P>
 These evangelical environmentalists have sparked some serious disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Dugan, head of the Washington office of the National Assn. of 
Evangelicals, refused to sign the declaration and resigned from its advisory 
council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a concern that this issue is going to balloon into something of 
greater importance to the churches than it needs to be," Dugan said. "I 
appreciate their calling attention to the problem, but it must be kept in 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Dugan is not the only one who believes the Evangelical Environmental Network 
exaggerated the environmental crisis and neglected the negative impact on the 
economy that stricter environmental laws will create. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extremist views like these promote destructive policies that will reduce the 
consumption of energy," said E. Calvin Beisner, an expert in public policy and 
environmental issues at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 He has advised fellow evangelicals to stay clear of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a growing anti-environment backlash" in the evangelical community, 
warned Richard Wright, an environmental scientist at Gordon College in Wenham, 
Mass., and the academic dean of the Au Sable Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics fear that "if people begin taking environmental issues seriously, 
it will lead to costly governmental regulations for small business and industry 
which will stifle our economy," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 But caring for the Earth does take priority over economic considerations 
because "environmental problems affect human beings" and human beings are the 
most important part of creation, insisted Cliff Benzel, the group's director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth has intrinsic value because God created it," he said. "It is not 
our job to stamp it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Wenger, a biology professor at Covenant College, also was invited to 
sign the environmental statement but declined because of its strong wording. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many statements were put in such extreme terms, I felt they should be a 
little more moderate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the average person reads EEN's information, they get the idea that 
everything is so bad," Wenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusions about the state of the environment are usually based more on 
personal ideas than on scientific evidence, he said.

CHURCHES TURN TO SALES TOOLS

 The Rev. James Carpenter isn't waiting for new members to follow the Holy 
Spirit to the doors of his Noblesville church -- he's using a full-scale 
marketing blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Christian Church spent $1,750 on four-color mass mailings to every 
resident in the area's ZIP code before both Christmas and Easter.The church 
also advertises in a local newspaper, subscribes to a monthly listing of new 
homeowners and sends personal letters about the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Carpenter said 462 first-time worshipers came to the church last 
year, the first time the church tried direct marketing. That's an average of 
almost 10 new worshipers each Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's (the mailings) one of the largest single items in our budget," said 
Carpenter, the church's senior pastor. "We feel like it's money well-spent. 
Like they say in business, you have to spend money to make money, and it's like 
that in church too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fishers Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) turned to The Phone's for 
You, a church development company, and door-to-door visits to fill seats at its 
newly formed church north of Indianapolis, the Rev. Terri Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 callers spent four nights a week for five weeks trying to drum up 
interest after being trained by the development company, which provides 
information on where to obtain phone numbers and supplies scripts, said Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishers Christian Church's first service, held March 20, drew 80 worshipers, 
Gomez said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just based on statistics, the numbers work in marketing, whether you're 
marketing a house or a church," she said.

 A new book on homeless families in Los Angeles debunks some common assumptions 
about homeless people and describes their uphill battle to maintain 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeless Families: The Struggle for Dignity," by Donald Miller, professor of 
religion ethics at USC, and his former USC colleague, Barry Jay Seltser, now a 
senior social science analyst with the General Accounting Office in Washington, 
D.C., was partially inspired by the work of Miller's friend, Alice Callaghan, 
an activist Skid Row priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaghan -- an Episcopal priest and former Catholic nun -- in 1981 founded 
Las Familias del Pueblo, a drop-in social service center on the edge of Skid 
Row for Downtown garment district workers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our project began when she decided to try to start a shelter for families," 
Miller said. "We found 100 homeless parents to interview and she found the 
money to conduct the study the book was based on. But nobody wanted homeless 
people in their neighborhood," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview subjects ranged from a former registered nurse to a runaway 
ex-juvenile delinquent. "Our research found the typical homeless person to be a 
minority single woman with one or two small children, who has made some bad 
decisions or been subject to some very difficult circumstances in life," said 
Miller, whose academic specialties are religious ethics and the sociology of 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors pored over transcripts of the narratives evoked by interview 
questions and found some common threads. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless find that welfare employees and many members of society at large 
assume that "they are on drugs, expect handouts and are not trying," when 
actually physical or sexual abuse, desertion by a man, a medical crisis or a 
late paycheck is the reason for homelessness, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason you and I won't end up on the street is that we may have a credit 
card, relatives willing to help out or some other backup system," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 What results is an almost overwhelming assault on the essential human dignity 
of homeless people, he said, when their sense of autonomy, stability, 
accomplishment and community is eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moral theme that runs through our book," he explained, "is that all 
government, church and private institutions must honor the dignity of the 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 The book concludes that "It is not only . . . the dignity of the homeless 
themselves that is undermined by their continued (lower) status and treatment, 
it is our dignity as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The 154-page book, published in December, 1993, by the University of Illinois 
Press, is available in hardcover and paperback.

ARE THE SERBS HUMILIATING NATO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The United Nations has made a catastrophic mistake," Bosnian Serb political 
leader Radovan Karadzic said last week of last Sunday's NATO air strike against 
Serbian forces besieging Gorazde. "We have won. That is why they are angry with 
us. With this they have put their last card on the table. Now they will have to 
send land forces to fight with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, over Serbian radio, was a preemptive rhetorical strike. The 
Serbs may, in fact, be terrified of a sustained NATO air onslaught. But they 
know the Americans are loath to begin a ground war. By equating air war with 
inevitable ground war, Karadzic sought to stop both at once. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Friday, the tactic was working. U.N. officials in Gorazde were 
reporting imminent Serb victory there. But U.S. officials, refusing to accept 
the U.N. reports, said that no NATO strikes were in prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs do take Gorazde, they will have humiliated NATO as well as the 
United Nations and, in the bargain, mocked the Russians, whose negotiator, 
Vitaly Churkin, had claimed as recently as Wednesday, "I got assurances from 
the Bosnian Serb leadership that it was not in their intention to conduct 
offensive operation in the Gorazde area or shell the town." That Bosnian Serb 
mockery of Russian mediation will permit Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the 
militarist Russian right to mock President Boris N. Yeltsin and call for a more 
aggressive stance toward the West. NATO, its lack of resolve laid bare, will 
deter such moves less effectively. The United States will also be seen as 
weaker outside Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, ironically, the official U.N. commission on war crimes in the 
former Yugoslavia concluded in its final report that the Serbs had committed 
genocide against the Muslims in northern Bosnia. The Serbian goal, to quote a 
Serbian election slogan, is "Mobilization and Homogenization. " That call for 
homogenization constitutes a death sentence against non-Serbs not 
metaphorically but, as the U.N. report proves, literally. With death by ethnic 
cleansing their only alternative to death in a guerrilla war, the Bosnian 
Muslims are likely to fight on as long as they have a bullet left to fire. 
Nothing NATO does or fails to do will change that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, offended by NATO's action last Sunday, has backed away from President 
Clinton's NATO-adjacent Partnership for Peace. A Russia-NATO partnership -- if, 
against the odds, one could be forged in the crucible of this moment -- could 
surely impose a cease-fire in Bosnia and dictate terms that none of the parties 
could reject. But with or without Russia, NATO would be wise to call Karadzic's 
bluff, abandon the pretense of neutrality, step into the breach opened by the 
besieged, conflict-ridden and collapsing United Nations and sharply escalate 
the air war against the Serbs. By now, the situation may be lose-lose, but the 
greater loss will be what now impends: capitulation to a band of thugs trying 
in every way to conceal their vulnerability to open-ended air war.

SAVING THE HOPI CULTURE -- FOR PENNIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The conflict currently pitting the Hopi tribe against the Peabody Western Coal 
Co. over the use of ground water in northern Arizona is the kind of conflict 
classically called, with a sigh, "a parable for our times." The sigh implies 
tragic inevitability. But it need not be so. At stake is an ancient way of 
life. And Southern Californians, for a few pennies each, could help preserve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily populated Southern California receives its electric power from several 
sources; one is the Mohave generating station just east of Laughlin, Nev. 
Peabody mines coal owned jointly by the Hopi and the Navajo from the Black Mesa 
mine and sells it to the Mohave station. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Hopi tribe and the Navajo nation are heavily dependent on the revenue 
from the mine. Both rely on ground water, but the smaller Hopi tribe is 
exclusively dependent for drinkable water on the aquifer from which Peabody 
draws its water; the Navajo have other sources. The Hopi want Peabody to make a 
change in the way it transports the coal from the mine to the power station. 
Without the change, Hopi springs and wells are in danger of running dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than ship the coal by truck or rail, Peabody pulverizes it and mixes it 
with drinking-quality water. The mixture, called slurry, is then delivered to 
the 278-miles-distant plant by pipeline. Northern Arizona is a desert. Water 
for the slurry, 1 billion gallons a year, comes from beneath the ground. The 
Hopi, pointing to scientific studies, report that their springs and wells are 
running dry and claim that if nothing is done, their ancient way of life will 
be finished in a few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Peabody's permit is up for renewal by the Interior Department, which is also 
officially responsible for Native American welfare. The Hopi have asked the 
Interior Department to make renewal of the permit conditional on the 
construction of a pipeline from Lake Powell in Utah to Black Mesa and that the 
department allocate lake water under federal jurisdiction for this purpose. The 
Navajo support this solution in principle. Without admitting that its operation 
is depleting ground water, Peabody is cooperating with the Navajo in a 
feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pipeline, costing $30 million to $40 million, is built, who will pay? 
California utility customers will. However, the pennies-a-month increase in 
their utilities bills must be considered indeed tiny if it staves off death by 
thirst for the thousand-year-old Hopi culture. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to renew Peabody's permit only 
if the company agrees to build the Lake Powell-to-Black Mesa pipeline. With a 
little goodwill from all the parties concerned, this is one parable for our 
times that can have a joyous ending.

MEXICO'S PRI AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * For The Times, a major American newspaper, to hail the PRI's autocratic 
nomination of a presidential candidate ("A Vote for Continuity," editorial, 
March 30) in the name of building a "modern economy" is disgusting.  
</P>
<P>
 Under President Porfirio Diaz (1871-1880), the finances of Mexico were 
stabilized and the country experienced an unprecedented economic development. 
Foreign capital, especially, American, was invested in the exploitation of the 
country's mineral resources;: mining, textile and other industries were 
expanded; railroad, ports, telegraph lines were constructed, and foreign trade 
increased about 300%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, foreign investors drained a great part of the country's 
wealth. Large numbers of Indians were deprived of their ancient communal lands, 
and these lands were concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of 
landowners. Poverty and illiteracy were widespread. Manifestations of the 
resulting social discontent were suppressed with an iron hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Accumulated dissatisfaction, however, burst forth in the revolution of 1911. 
Are the seeds of another revolution in the making? Your editorial shows an 
ignorance of history and the recent Chiapas revolt. It is about time we stop 
exploiting the indigenous peoples of Mexico and recognize their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times should promote a grass-roots democratic selection of the PRI 
presidential candidate to bring about economic justice in Mexico.

 * Jorge G. Castaneda ("The Last Gasp of a Moribund System," Commentary, April 
1) yearns for what he calls Mexico's last "successful presidency," that of 
Adolfo Lopez Mateos, from 1958 to 1964. For those of us who took advantage of 
Mexico's policies of patronage and protectionism, those were great times. But 
for most Mexicans, they were hardly the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, Mexico imported from the United States nearly all the flux used in 
automatic welding. That year, I built a plant in Mexico City to produce it 
locally. Once the factory was in operation, I persuaded the Mexican government 
to shut the border to U.S. flux producers, effectively rewarding me a monopoly 
and ending the lucrative market for U.S.-based manufacturers. The United States 
and Mexico both suffered. I made money. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Miguel de la Madrid, Mexico's most underappreciated president, who kept 
Mexico's nose above water when it was in danger of drowning in debt and who 
began to turn around Mexico's economy. He and his successor, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, operated within a political system that cries out for 
reform. But good economics makes good politics. Not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 It may well be that the ghost of slain presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio will hang over Mexico's election. But the only ghost that can haunt 
Mexico's future is an over-romanticized view of a past that never was.

RACIAL BIAS IN FIRE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Bias Against Any Race is Unacceptable," by Michelle Eun Joo 
Park-Steel, Commentary, April 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I have worked with the Stentorians, an African American firefighter's 
association, for several years and I can attest to the fact that racism and 
discrimination are alive and well in the department. While it is not totally 
impossible any longer for African American and other minority applicants to get 
into the department's employment ranks, all other things being equal, 
promotions and opportunities for advancement remain few and far between. Double 
standards and subjective judgments as to new hires and promotability still 
serve as an effective bar against equal opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, I read with dismay and disagreement L.A. Fire Commissioner 
Park-Steel's column in which she denounces the 1974 consent decree between the 
City of Los Angeles and the Justice Department. Commissioner Park-Steel claims 
not to know "what a minority is" any longer and expresses great concern about 
the exclusion of 5,000 white applicants from a firefighter's test. She goes on 
to assert that the application process has gotten "bogged down in a 
bureaucratic maze and is fundamentally unfair." She cites as evidence that the 
consent decree, which required long-range goals of integration in the 
department, has resulted in "the percentage of Caucasian firefighters reduced 
from 93% to 67%." Given the percentage of Caucasians among the citizenry, this 
30% drop in their domination in 20 years is hardly radical or unjust. 
</P>
<P>
 What has not been taken into account is that African Americans and other 
minorities were confined to "all-Negro fire stations" until the mid-'50s and to 
long waiting lists, despite many vacant positions. African American and Latino 
numbers in the department were minuscule and every excuse in the world was used 
to bar access. And those days are not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the Los Angeles Fire Department has an overall total of 3,064 
employees, of which only 330 are African Americans and 689 are Latinos. Only 33 
of 552 captains are African Americans and 80 are Latinos, and of the 87 chief 
officers, four are African Americans and six are Latinos. The department has 
1,654 firefighters -- 217 African Americans, 453 Latinos and 984 Caucasians. 
Although Caucasians make up 63% of employees, only 37% of the Los Angeles 
population is Caucasian. We only need to walk through City Hall East (LAFD's 
administrative offices) to see who dominates the administrative ranks and 
decision-making.  
</P>
<P>
 The consent decree has and continues to serve a valid and much-needed purpose 
in rectifying historical and institutionalized racism. Perhaps it has to be 
reviewed in some respects and updated, but let there be no question that this 
legal mechanism to address clear and ongoing disparities among the rank and 
file and in management positions of the department has ongoing viability.

 * This article was right on the money. I am so tired of having to be 
politically correct. In the city we live in it is becoming more and more insane 
to "protect" certain people simply because of their race. That is 
discriminating against all others, in this case 5,000 well-intentioned would-be 
firefighters. Is it not also demeaning to those groups deemed in need of 
assistance, could they not get along on their own merits? And now, why would 
the white firefighters have any respect for their minority co-workers, who are 
known to have gotten their jobs because of their minority status? Practices 
such as these are demeaning toward the "minority" groups benefiting and 
discriminatory against all others.

OFFICIALS DEFEND COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your article regarding Compton ("A Wealth of Woes," March 26), The Times 
provided its readership with a distorted image of our city. "Blight, crime and 
mismanagement" are not unique to Compton, nor do they present a fair depiction 
of our community. 
</P>
<P>
 As you properly pointed out, over the past two decades, elected officials have 
attempted to provide the city with a much-needed economic face lift. You 
attributed some of our failed projects to "bad timing, bad management or bad 
luck." However, you failed to mention the problem of insurance redlining, 
which, for years, served as a deterrent to many potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, we are progressing in Compton. In the 1980s hundreds of young, 
middle-class families were drawn to our community by new, attractive affordable 
housing complexes. Our central business district was also revamped into a 
successful new Towne Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of our projects have indeed been unsuccessful, we are embarking 
on new and better ones. For example, we are now negotiating to transform our 
auto plaza into a diversified regional commercial center, which will increase 
revenue to the city and provide hundreds of new jobs for our residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, crime and gang violence have dropped precipitously in 
Compton. Few other cities in Los Angeles County can boast of such a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of your recent revelations, to date neither the FBI nor the U.S. 
attorney's office has informed our management or elected officials of an 
ongoing investigation of Compton. Furthermore, it should be stressed that, even 
according to your reports, neither the current mayor nor any sitting 
councilperson has been accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton is a relatively close-knit community of taxpaying, law-abiding, 
churchgoing citizens of diverse incomes and ethnic backgrounds. In light of 
this, we do not understand why our community and its citizens appear to be of 
little interest to The Times except in your reporting of isolated allegations 
of political improprieties.

<P>
 "What do you want from me?" went the title refrain of one of the new songs 
Pink Floyd's David Gilmour sang Thursday night at Jack Murphy Stadium -- the 
band's first Southern California concert in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a 1994 touring season stocked with famous, middle-aged rock attractions 
returning for another glorious campaign or another big score (take your pick), 
it seemed like a fair question to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 What do we want from the likes of Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Traffic and the 
Rolling Stones -- bands that can trade successfully on their history even if 
their new output proves feeble by comparison? 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing we should want from veteran superstars is that they be fired 
up by the idea of making music, whether it's old or new. We want conviction and 
passion and delight in the delivery -- a sense that our old heroes aren't just 
riding the gravy train. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pink Floyd sunk the first half an hour of its sold-out show in utter 
tedium, a different refrain suggested itself: wish you weren't here. Wish you'd 
get on with the old stuff instead of force-feeding second-rate recent material. 
Wish you'd give us something really spectacular to look at, instead of the same 
old lasers and elaborate haze of lights that every other big-budget tour has 
(true, nobody else has housed it all under a huge, arched canopy that looks 
like the top half of a Conestoga wagon). 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes wishing helps. Or at least waiting does. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Pink Floyd did play what leader David Gilmour dryly referred to as 
"tons of old rubbish": selections from the band's peak '70s era that began with 
the "Meddle" album and stretched through "Dark Side of the Moon," "Wish You 
Were Here" and "The Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Pink Floyd delivered them with professional aplomb and a 
bit of spectacle worthy of the band's reputation. It was nothing revelatory, 
but it met the minimum requirement of retrospective rock, which is to remind us 
of the lasting appeal of the music being played. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour's voice sounded thinner, lower and rougher than it did when Pink Floyd 
returned to touring in '87. But his guitar playing remains a treat with its 
instantly recognizable balance of lyricism, economy and dramatic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage presence was never part of Pink Floyd's equation -- hence all the props, 
gadgets and lights. (With his black suit, his reserved mien, his full face and 
his thinning, graying hair, Gilmour has come to resemble Anthony Hopkins 
playing the butler in "Remains of the Day" -- not that most of the 50,000 
attendees would know that, given the lack of video screens for close-in 
viewing.) 
</P>
<P>
 With chances virtually nil that Pink Floyd's technical juggernaut will be 
reprogrammed by a single note, fans attending the band's concerts at the Rose 
Bowl tonight and Sunday need not be in a hurry to get there on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Show up half an hour late and you'll still catch everything that's worth 
hearing and seeing. On the visual side, that includes two menacing (but this 
time not airborne) inflated pigs, the well-conceived, enigmatic video backdrops 
to songs from "Dark Side of the Moon" and "Wish You Were Here" (with 
surrealistic allusions to Salvador Dali and Lewis Carroll), and the mirrored 
ball contraption that rises on a lift in the middle of the stadium, then opens 
to reveal a crazy diamond of light. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the things latecomers will miss is an unforgivably limp show-opening 
rendition of "Astronomy Domine." That 1967-vintage Syd Barrett composition 
deserved better; the first song on Pink Floyd's first album, it remains, at 
least on record, a striking psychedelic conception of a strange and chillingly 
impersonal universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent songs from "A Momentary Lapse of Reason," the 1987 comeback album 
Pink Floyd released after its acrimonious split with lyricist and conceptualist 
Roger Waters, and the newly released "The Division Bell" were like the Queen 
Mary: stately as you could wish, but going nowhere fast. During the first five 
songs of the set, the biggest cheers were for laser beams shooting over the 
stadium's rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters' key contribution was to give Pink Floyd's albums and shows an 
overarching vision or thematic thrust. With help from outside lyricists, 
Gilmour and comrades are at least trying on "The Division Bell." The new album 
contains a lot of aural wallpaper, but it does hold together loosely as a 
chronicle of alienation and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "High Hopes," the best of the new songs, fit nicely into a post-intermission 
stretch of material from "Dark Side" and "Wish You Were Here," in which the 
band constructed a continuous mood of elegantly etched world-weariness overlain 
with mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 More than simply re-creating the past, this most-evocative segment of the show 
suggested that old songs don't stop meaning something just because they are 
old.

 Dutch saxophonist Candy Dulfer calls her band Funky Stuff, but funk isn't its 
strong suit. Instead, the best moments of Dulfer's two-hour-plus performance 
Thursday at the Coach House came during more pop-oriented numbers and ballads, 
when her 10-piece ensemble depended less on tough beats and more on musical 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, funk is the band's mainstay, even though its funk material was hindered 
by a lack of strong, rhythmic direction. At fault were bassist Dimitri 
Veltkamp, drummer Edwin Delano Rath and percussionist Martino Latupeirissa's 
and their overly ambitious timekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 If the band has a good foot, it never quite got on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunes such as the Average White Band's "Picking Up the Pieces" and Dulfer's 
"Jamming" were spirited enough but lacked the kick a more direct attack might 
have given. At times, the band was tight and on the money. Other times, Dulfer 
and her two supporting horns were hard-pressed to find common ground with the 
rhythm section. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulfer's own playing was competent, if not overly exciting. Her alto solos, 
played with a hint of David Sanborn's tonal quality but little of his spark, 
followed a predictable path to a climax of sustained, high-register notes, 
before bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's apparent she's been listening to the likes of Sanborn and Maceo Parker 
(with whom she's recorded) but doesn't yet have their technical skills. Still, 
she has a good sense of development and drama. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who owns up to trading on her good looks, Dulfer often made an 
unattractive impression from the stage, squinting painfully while playing and 
dancing awkwardly. This lack of presence was especially apparent when the group 
was joined by singers Tryntje Oosterhuis and Chris Ballin (the only non-Dutch 
member of the band), as Dulfer faded into the background while the vocalists 
took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best moments came on the ballad "I Can't Make You Love Me," when she 
softened her tone and played more thoughtfully. That she has a strong melodic 
sense was apparent as she played backed only by the rhythm section. 
Surprisingly, she didn't lose sight of her narration as the tune progressed and 
she was joined by tenor sax, fluegelhorn and vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's strongest suit are its arrangements, most written by guitarist Ulco 
Bed. Filled with surprising twists, turns and brass accents, Bed brings a sense 
of playfulness to the otherwise straightforward numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picking Up the Pieces" slowed to a sultry crawl after Dulfer's solo, a touch 
that brought new interest to the familiar riff. Miles Davis' "So What" moved to 
a shuffle beat and featured nicely timed punctuation from saxophonist Peter 
Broekhuizen and trumpeter David Rockenfeller. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed's own "Mr. Marvin" hinted at various Marvin Gaye themes while providing 
nicely framed space for improvisation. The guitarist also was the evening's 
most engaging soloist, coaxing an array of sounds from his instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Dulfer wants to continue playing on "sax/sex" themes (the show's 
closing number was the title tune from her latest album, "Sax-A-Go-Go"), the 
band needs to work on the bread-and-butter beats that drive funk straight to 
the libido. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them, Dulfer's music will remain no more than a tease.

 Get Your Tickets: The frenzied public sale of Barbra Streisand concert tickets 
last month was over in a flash, but it only marked the beginning of a slow and 
laborious process for six area charities. As many as 500 prime seats for each 
of the six shows May 25 through June 4 at the Pond in Anaheim were set aside to 
be sold by the organizations, providing a chance for each to make as much as 
$325,000. But some of the charities are worried that sales are going too 
slowly, and they blame difficulty in publicizing the tickets' availability. 
"Getting the word out is hard and none of us wants to spend tens of thousands 
of dollars on advertising," said Richard Walden, president of Operation USA/LA 
Earthquake Relief, which holds 450 tickets to the June 2 concert. Each of the 
charities was given the chance to pay face value -- $350 -- for the tickets, 
which then could be sold for as much as $1,000 each. The charities' profits 
would be tax-deductible to the ticket buyers. The following charities have 
tickets available: for May 25, the National Resources Defense Council/Pesticide 
Campaign, (310) 996-1188; for May 27, the Alliance for Children's Rights, (310) 
393-5600; for May 29, Girls' Voices Women's Lives, (310) 478-3002; for May 31, 
the Legal Aid Foundation, (310) 477-0672; for June 2, Operation USA/LA 
Earthquake Relief, (310) 559-6370; for June 4, United Friends of the Children, 
(213) 651-2988.

 * Warhol's Estate: Andy Warhol's estate is worth about $510 million, nearly 
$300 million more than its executors had declared, a New York judge said. 
Thursday's ruling means the Warhol Foundation, the estate's principal 
beneficiary, could owe the estate's former lawyer, Edward Hayes, at least $5 
million in legal fees. Hayes and the foundation have been fighting over the 
value of artwork, real estate, cash and other property the late pop artist left 
when he died Feb. 22, 1987. Hayes, whose fee is 2% of the estate's total value, 
claimed that the estate was worth at least $700 million. The foundation, 
relying on appraisals by Christie's art auction officials, said it was worth 
$220 million. Surrogate Judge Eve Preminger, after saying it was "difficult, if 
not foolhardy" to try to put a dollar value on Warhol's property, estimated its 
worth at $510 million.

 * 'Falstaff' Feud: Soprano Angelina Reaux and baritone Michael Sokol have been 
replaced in Long Beach Opera's production of "Falstaff" in the wake of a 
disagreement between Reaux and the production's director, Moshe Leiser. While 
an opera spokeswoman said Reaux was dismissed for unreasonable artistic demands 
(and her husband, Sokol, then quit), Reaux has filed a police report saying 
Leiser verbally threatened her and flung a book of sheet music at her, hitting 
her in the chest. Through the spokeswoman, opera general director Michael 
Milenski said that Leiser does not deny throwing the book, but the opera 
considers the disagreement an insignificant "rehearsal room spat" that did not 
affect their decision to dismiss Reaux. Leiser could not be reached for 
comment. PEOPLE WATCH

Attorney's office. . . . And actor Lou Diamond Phillips said he'll tie the knot 
soon. The star of "Young Guns" and "La Bamba" announced on a friend's radio 
show in Philadelphia that he will marry model Kelly Preston on April 24 at his

JAZZ REVIEW; DULFER NEVER FUNKY ENOUGH, BUT STRONG ON POP, BALLADS

 Tunes such as the Average White Band's "Picking Up the Pieces" and Dulfer's

MUSIC REVIEWS; PIANIST PRATT IN UCLA RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bold and relentless, the pianism of Awadagin Pratt goes even further: It 
strains the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 At his second Southern California recital, Thursday night at UCLA's Schoenberg 
Hall Auditorium, the American pianist brought a high-aiming -- some would say 
pretentious -- program, and dispatched it in what could have been record 
time.He certainly hit all the high points in two late sonatas by Beethoven and 
in a group of Bach-inspired pieces by Busoni and Liszt. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not deliver the acknowledged other side of these masterworks: the 
contrasts, subtexts, inner workings and genuine integrity in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old Pratt might be compared to his elder Russian colleague, Lazar 
Berman. Like Berman's, Pratt's performances are exuberant, passionate, musical 
in sweep and consistently too loud. Where mezzo-forte would tell the story, 
forte becomes the medium of rhetoric; when forte could suffice, both players 
offer fortissimo with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not only offensive aesthetically; it actually distorts the composers' 
music. And in the case of both the old Russian and the young American, neither 
offers the comfort of dynamic contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 In a program starting with Beethoven's Opus 109 and Opus 110 and ending with 
the famous Busoni rendering of the D-minor Chaconne by Bach, Pratt occasionally 
dipped below mezzo-forte. But never for long, and each time without the 
alleviations of tone-variety, nuance or dynamic layering. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, what a large and enthusiastic audience in Schoenberg Hall heard was 
a monochromatic performance. Pratt has developed his technique to a high gloss, 
making him capable of producing the big musical gesture with authority. Now he 
needs to develop the subtle, and far broader, reaches of that technique. DANIEL 
CARIAGA.

 As part of its plan to establish a statewide group health plan for artists, 
the Artist's Alliance of California is asking that all artists statewide 
complete a survey to help implement such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based organization believes that the more completed surveys 
it receives, the stronger its bargaining position will be to obtain a low-cost 
health plan.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SALONEN CONDUCTS CHAMBER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esa-Pekka Salonen illuminated the works of two 20th-Century greats but let the 
music of an earlier giant slip into the shadows of misunderstanding Thursday at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in his account of Berg's Chamber Concerto for Piano and Violin, 
Salonen also had the passionate advocacy of pianist Jeffrey Kahane and, 
especially, violinist Thomas Zehetmair. In Richard Strauss' "Metamorphosen," he 
had sensitive contributions from several first-desk players, including 
concertmaster Sidney Weiss and principal cellist Ronald Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Mozart's great C-minor Serenade, K. 388, he had the limelight 
essentially to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Zehetmair is the kind of violinist who must get his whole body into his 
playing. Here he lunged and rocked back and forth as he sought -- and achieved 
-- increasingly intense expression from a deliberately chosen frail, private 
and meditative beginning. Yet his music-making was never out of control or 
misjudged technically or conceptually. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahane played with full, rounded tone, rolling phrasing and fleet accuracy. 
Not for him the notion that 12-tone music is supposed to be acerbic, 
aggressive, impersonal, unlikable and generally nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Except from some gymnastic hops and hyperactive arm-beating, Salonen appeared 
to be the cool head in charge of it all. Yet virtually every flick of a wrist 
or shape in the air brought an immediate and appropriate response from the 
soloists or the 13 alert wind players. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mozart's Serenade, however, the conductor concentrated on getting crisp 
articulation of rhythm without paying much attention to shaping phrases 
expressively. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered little give and take, light or shade, contrasts in gesture. 
Inevitably, sheer beauty and evenness of sound, it seemed, became an ideal, at 
the expense of drama and character. The virtues of this kind of approach 
consist in a certain transparency of texture and balance in ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 But surely it is possible to have that and much more, besides. It was hard to 
accept such bubbling-brook Mozart in one of the composer's most personal 
outpourings of grief, anger and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 All was redeemed, however, with a devastating performance of Strauss' 
war-influenced "Metamorphosen" to close the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Salonen had been rigid, even martinetish, in controlling Mozart's music, 
he was expansive in letting Strauss' long lines breathe, unfold and blossom, 
and also succumb to the weight of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 He propelled the playing through all potential pitfalls, kept the textures 
lush without being cloying, dense without being obscure, and never wavered from 
honoring the composer's purposeful design. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the Second Viennese School holds no terrors for him, nor does the 
twilight of post-Romanticism. Mozart, on the other hand, remains an 
inexplicable problem. CHRIS PASLES

HOW CAN HE FIND NO REASON TO LIVE AT 27? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is it about being 27 years old, extremely talented and having no reason 
to live? Scientists must have an explanation. Somebody has to have noticed the 
pattern by now. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read about Kurt Cobain's suicide I was extremely saddened ("Cobain's 
Widow Reads Parts of Suicide Note at Seattle Vigil," Section A, April 11). When 
I read the pain in his wife's words at the candlelight vigil, I had to write. I 
do not know Cobain or Courtney Love. I have never bought one of Nirvana's CDs. 
But I do recognize that ominous pattern, that familiar frustration in talented 
people. It's cloaked in being true to one's self. It's convincingly explained 
as having lost the passion. But it really means the soul needs a refill. It's 
simply out of gas; overused, abused and overadmired. It means you have to dig 
deeper for more answers to life's questions. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm lobbying for a warning label on the bottle of Talent. It must read, 
"May cause extreme drowsiness at peak dosage. May diminish your gift or passion 
for an extended period of time, but will regain full capacity as dosage is 
regulated. Do not take any other drugs while taking this medication. If 
symptoms persist, consult your physician, nutritionist or spiritual adviser. A 
temporary change in character may occur while taking this medication, and 
judgment may be impaired. Do not commit suicide or perform any other 
dismemberment activities while taking this product. " 
</P>
<P>
 I was 27 once, accomplishing a torrent of creative activities. Life knocked me 
to my knees, then pushed me down the stairs to the basement. There is no way to 
describe the utter helplessness down there. There is no way to describe the 
utter frustration from up here -- now. I'm 38, and when I heard about Cobain's 
suicide, I actually remarked to my husband, "How can anybody so uniquely 
talented think life isn't worth living?"  
</P>
<P>
 I feel hypocritical for even saying such words, knowing full well that that 
could have been me 10 years ago. So hear me out, all you fans of Nirvana, who 
are buried deep in confusion and grief, and hear me out all you talented people 
on the edge who don't think you can possibly go on because your passion and 
trueness are in jeopardy. The biggest creative buzz of your life comes from 
saving yourself, and filling up with gas for the next run.

 Whether he liked it or not, Cobain was indeed the spokesman for his/my 
generation, and his death leaves an aching void. 
</P>
<P>
 His songs weren't merely entertainment. They were a vicarious form of 
primal-scream therapy. When you heard Cobain's pure-id howl, you could feel his 
pain, which was also your pain. And the cathartic effect was undeniable. The 
power of his voice, lyrics and music somehow made you feel better -- especially 
if you turned it up loud. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, whenever I hear his voice, it only fills me with sadness.

<P>
 Although it is not likely that Cobain reached for the ultimate of that of a 
Buddhist monk, the irony is still there. Edwin Luther Copeland published a book 
in 1963 titled "Christianity and World Religions." In the chapter on Buddhism, 
he describes nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 " Nirvana , the state in which desire is extinguished. Buddhists insist that 
nirvana is not the negative experience of 'nothingness' or 'annihilation' but 
the positive experience of 'freedom' or 'emancipation.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A monk may reach the experience of enlightenment and entrance into nirvana in 
this life. For him, all craving is gone. He knows the impermanence of self, so 
there is nothing about him to be born again, to live again, or to die again. 
Full nirvana comes to him at death when the constituents of the self are 
finally dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This concept of nirvana suggests two things: First, the desire to cling to 
individual existence as a person must be extinguished. Second, there is an 
impersonal reality into which one can be absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The layman cannot hope to reach nirvana in this life, but he can amass merit 
for a next existence which will be more favorable for attaining the ultimate 
goal."

 It's sad, tragic really, that Cobain took his own life. But Robert Hilburn now 
wants to lump Cobain with Bob Dylan and John Lennon (!) ("A Poet for the 
Dysfunctional Age," April 9). It's like comparing Michael Tuck with Walter 
Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow; Shannen Doherty with Bette Davis and Ava 
Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain was an interesting guy and wrote some cool songs. Dylan and Lennon 
changed us -- for the better. I hope Cobain rests in peace. However, there's no 
benefit to any of us left here to promote him above his worth. I'd say he had 
the impact of . . . Kurt Cobain.

 In response to Cobain's death and the despair of his generation, I asked 
myself why those of us born in the '60s and '70s think we've had such a 
difficult life. Those born before us had wars, the Depression and the struggle 
to make a new life in a new country. What made our struggles so much more 
difficult that we can't seem to grow up or function? 
</P>
<P>
 We were the comfort kids; nice neighborhoods, Brownies and Cub Scouts. We 
thought it would never end. We watched TV and believed it to be the truth as 
our parents got drunk and fought.  
</P>
<P>
 We are still children looking for the Brady Bunch and, at the same time, 
someone to blame that we didn't get it. We choose image over substance every 
time and wonder why our lives seem hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain did define his generation. Like Pinocchio but in reverse, he chose to 
be a dead icon rather than live like a real boy.

 Just to numb ourselves in drug abuse would only increase and not decrease the

 The generation that cries out that they are the victims of all the mistakes of 
our parents' generation has lost their icon. We have been labeled the "X 
Generation" -- lost and confused, constantly soul-searching. For what? I guess 
that is the problem. We do not actually know what it is we are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Being 24 years old, I am tired of Cobain being held up as a spokesman for my 
generation. I am embarrassed to be coupled with a selfish individual who could 
be such a coward and take his own life, leaving behind his wife and his child.  
</P>
<P>
 We cannot afford to have Cobain be our spokesman; there is too much at stake. 
It is time for this generation to reintroduce the concepts of virtue, family, 
commitment and life and end this selfish soul-searching that has been 
attributed to us.

CABARET REVIEW; RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER WEILL IN 'BERLIN TO BABYLON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news about the opening performance of "Berlin to Babylon" at the 
Cinegrill last Saturday night is that it revived some very lovely songs by Kurt 
Weill and Friedrich Hollaender. The bad news is that Cameron Silver -- the 
show's only performer -- didn't appear to have grasped either the subtleties or 
the symbolism present in many of the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver opened the evening on a dark stage, shining a flashlight on his face in 
a feeble emulation of Joel Grey's classic Weimar imagery. He sang the first 
number, Weill's "Berlin Im Licht" in German (and thanked his dialogue coach), 
then reverted to upbeat, smiling presentations of material that obviously 
demanded far more complex renderings. Of cabaret theatricality, there was 
little to be seen, other than a bare trace of movement choreography and an 
occasional smidgen of atmospheric lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the songs might have sustained the performance, had Silver fully 
appreciated the potential they possessed for interpretive nuance. But he ran 
roughshod over almost everything. Weill's (and Ira Gershwin's) "My Ship" was 
sung with no apparent awareness of its metaphoric significance in "Lady in the 
Dark." "Nanna's Lied" and "Two Hearts" disintegrated into the kind of jovial 
readings one might expect from the juvenile lead in a '30s musical. 
</P>
<P>
 If the show, which was directed by Jeremy Lawrence (who also provided some of 
the English-language lyrics), ever had a script or a structure beyond the 
assemblage of a disconnected sequence of songs, it was nowhere evident. Worse, 
Silver's sporadic efforts to provide context were nearly always off base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shickelgruber," a bitingly satirical send-up of Hitler by Weill and Howard 
Dietz, was introduced with an unrelated story about Hollaender's escape from 
Berlin; Hitler was never mentioned. "Nanna's Lied" was identified, too 
thoughtlessly, as a typical Weill song "for a whore" (neglecting to note that 
the words were by Bertolt Brecht). 
</P>
<P>
 The real mystery of "Berlin to Babylon" is why Silver chose to explore tunes 
that were so inappropriate for his upfront, effusive performing style. Valuable 
as it may be to hear this captivating music, it's a shame that it could not 
have been presented in a framework that better revealed its many fascinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Berlin to Babylon: The Songs of Kurt Weill and Friedrich Hollaender," 
Cinegrill, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood Blvd. 8:30 and 10 p.m. 
tonight . $10, plus $10 food and beverage minimum. (213) 466-7000. Running

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CRY OF LOVE AT TROUBADOUR: A SOUTHERN ROCK SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The North Carolina blues-rock act Cry of Love rolled into the Troubadour on 
Thursday to mine musical territory familiar to anyone who listens to 
classic-rock radio. It was also a concert balanced by some searing, 
contemplative moments of Southern grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Cry of Love is committed to the heavy finesse of that old Southern rock sound, 
even if singer Kelly Holland performs in a strutting tone closer to British 
blues-rocker Paul Rodgers than to the anguished moan of fellow-Southerner Gregg 
Allman. Arriving on stage in a Robert Johnson T-shirt and his leather 
"whiskey-drinkin' hat," Holland also tossed convincing bits of lyrics from 
Chaka Khan ("Tell Me Something Good") and Stevie Wonder ("Livin' in the City") 
into the quartet's surprising mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often band members were trapped by their own extended jams, with guitarist 
Audley Freed unassertive behind a simple, throbbing rhythm. Cry of Love is not 
a band of virtuosos, so these long solos on guitar, bass or drums rarely took 
the music anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band just as often coalesced into a tight unit, weaving soaring pop 
melodies with blues integrity, as on the unreleased song "Broken Toy." It was 
at these moments, when Holland played rhythm guitar to provide added muscle and 
texture, that Cry of Love approached the level of its divine blues-rock 
forefathers. STEVE APPLEFORD

MADONNA'S PATHETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone still believes that Madonna possesses any veritable wit or charm, 
one only had to witness her pathetic "bad girl" persona with David Letterman. 
She was not only unattractive physically but personally and intellectually as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 What is most pathetic, however, is that she apparently believes she is acting 
clever by using the F-word or licking her lips repeatedly in a ribald and banal 
fashion, or delivering (for 35 minutes) third-rate adolescent sexual humor. 
Even sixth-graders at recess or high school football players in the locker room 
would have been more inventive and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not talking about having my sensibilities insulted. Rather, I'm wondering 
how such behavior could pass for astute entertainment when it is sophomoric, 
banal and desperate.

PLAZA DE LA RAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Morning Report's "Plaza to Lose Leader" (March 26) about Gema 
Sandoval leaving her post as executive director at Plaza de la Raza, The Times 
states that she leaves "during a period of turmoil." The Board of Directors of 
Plaza de la Raza takes exception to that statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza de la Raza has never been more prolific in its programming, more active 
in its community and more visible in the arts and culture area. We service more 
than 600 children a week through our after-school program. We are in the midst 
of the second annual Nuevo LA Chicano MusicWorks Competition, which had brought 
in more than 100 entries in four musical categories. We are putting the 
finishing touches to a stellar summer season, our third annual "Con Sabor 
Latino" presenting series. We are beginning a thorough, much needed, upgrade of 
the whole facility. And we have just recruited four very capable and respected 
board members who would not have lent their names and reputations to the 
organization if they had felt that we were "in turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 We are grateful for Sandoval's years of service, and we recognize the tenacity 
of her vision, which has helped to poise Plaza as a national leader in 
community arts programming. And, although she will no longer be an employee of 
Plaza, because she is a Chicana artist of this community, her relationship with 
us will continue throughout the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Our employees are pursuing the issue of organizing themselves through a union. 
The board of directors has recognized their union and is going through careful 
negotiations with their representative. We hardly consider that turmoil. What 
we are worried about, however, is the erroneous perception that The Times has 
given with its inaccurate reporting and the repercussions that will have on the 
credibility of Plaza de la Raza. 
</P>
<P>
 I, as chairperson of the board, must always ensure that I maintain an unbiased 
view toward the organization, one that serves the needs of the organization as 
well as protects the rights of the employees. I know that you, too, seek that 
level of impartiality. I, therefore, ask that you print this letter so that we 
are allowed to write our own history and dispel any doubts about the future of 
our organization.

ART REVIEW; SOCIAL ISSUES FIND HOME IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day while waiting in line to get on the freeway, I spotted a 
grizzled old derelict holding a hand-scrawled cardboard sign. The sight has 
become so familiar it's almost invisible. This was a little different. Instead 
of the usual pathetic plea about willingness to work for food, this guy's 
placard read: "I won't lie. I need a drink." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out the incident was a perfect introduction to the largest of three 
inaugural exhibitions at Cal State Long Beach's new University Art Museum: the 
traveling show "Homeless; Portraits of Americans in Hard Times," the result of 
a yearlong project by photographer Howard Schatz. It includes a selection of 
oversize prints taken from the 76 duotone plates reproduced in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In lighting, pose and texture Schatz creates a vision of today's homeless as a 
ragtag band of heroic individualists, often the last of the cultural renegades 
to cleave to the trashed idealism of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric K. von Richter wears a black T-shirt reflecting his nickname, "Blacky." 
He's 53 but looks a decade older as he peers longingly at an unanswering sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm a dreamer from the past," he says in a biographical rumination. 
In San Francisco's Haight during the Summer of Love, he knew everybody from 
Janis Joplin to Jim Morrison. He says he's now too old to get a job. He won't 
accept welfare or food stamps. He hopes to die in Golden Gate Park. "I love 
this park," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Smith from San Antonio is only 25, but her drug addiction has already 
wrecked a profitable career as a call girl. She poses in punk mufti, tattooed 
arms pocked with needle bruises. In the eight months preceding the photograph, 
she saw five friends die of AIDS and other complications of street life. "The 
only thing that I really, really want," she says, "is to know true happiness 
and to have a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilee Hasty hangs out in the redwood country up north around Arcata. He's 21 
and thinks that homeless is a misnomer, " 'cause I own the ground that I stand 
up on and that's what gives me strength and faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz perpetuates an American admiration for the underdog that stretches from 
Tom Paine to the Beat poets. There's a romantic idealism at work here that 
can't quite deal with the fact that being down on your luck is normally neither 
literary nor glamorous. This work is not the whole truth, but then nothing is. 
It has the overriding virtue of reminding us of the individuality, humor and 
resilient intransigence it takes to survive the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted Belgian artist Marie-Jo Lafontaine looks at the phenomenon of race on a 
changing planet. Her installation encompasses monumental portraits of six young 
women of mixed racial origin. Its French title is awkwardly translated as "To 
Know, Hold on to, and Secure that which is Sublime." 
</P>
<P>
 The young women have a kind of otherworldly beauty. They are no longer easily 
identifiable as members of this or that race. They told Lafontaine they 
regretted that. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafontaine's project has a courageously idealistic subtext. It wonders about 
the wisdom of rigidly cleaving to old ideals of racial identity in a world 
currently fragmented by retribalization. It contrasts separatism with the idea 
of healing through a natural process of hybridization with its biological 
promise of enhanced vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with the third exhibition that wouldn't be cured by 
being somewhere else. Called "Wall Works," it consists of perfectly harmless 
multiples from Cologne's Edition Schellmann. These tend to be interactive art 
projects carried out by the buyer following written instructions from artists 
like Sol LeWitt or Damien Hirst. 
</P>
<P>
 Resulting works on view are both fun and an instructive way of schooling 
people in arts basics. Unfortunately, placed alongside the sociological works 
of Schatz and Lafontaine, they look like rococo dalliances from a decadent 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Cal State Long Beach museum opened March 1 and is a bracing bit of 
cultural enhancement in an era of draconian educational budget cuts. Just 4,000 
square feet, it's nonetheless sleeker and more accessible than the old campus 
digs. It allows Director Connie Glenn's ever-professional exhibitions program 
to glow in a new way.

by Ken Sagoes (he also plays Uncle Bo Henry) is about two families -- one white 
and one black -- whose lives are unavoidably linked by generations of shared 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 As Floyd, Lumbly is a gifted woodworker with a deep love for his wife (Juanita 
Jennings), young son Jim Jam (Golden) and the land that was promised to Floyd's 
father by the late white owner, Mr. Appletree, "a man of integrity." But Mr. 
Appletree's ugly-minded son Albert (John M. Jackson) and daughter-in-law 
(Ivey), have prevented the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on exploiting Floyd's talents as a furniture craftsman, Albert uses 
Floyd's hope for the land as both stick and carrot. That hope vanishes when Jim 
Jam is responsible for the death of Albert's mother's spoiled little dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the grief and trouble that ensue also jolt Albert's mother (Plowright) out 
of her self-involved acceptance of the black-and-white status quo. When Jim 
Jam, who has his own integrity, tries to make amends for the loss of her dog, 
the result is genuine friendship and justice served. 
</P>
<P>
 The clarity with which Sagoes and director Joan Tewkesbury balance character, 
empathy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s tenets of non-violence against a 
racist society's casual slurs and slights, underscores the ludicrousness of 
using color as a gauge of superiority. * "On Promised Land" airs Sunday at 7 
p.m. on the Disney Channel.

TV REVIEWS; HONORING EDITOR'S PASSION FOR JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With few exceptions, such as "Driving Miss Daisy" and the TV series "I'll Fly 
Away," on-screen female role models of modern-day struggles for racial justice 
don't readily come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Seymour has narrowed the void with a spirited portrait of a woman in the 
Deep South who did make a difference, although it cost her dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Passion for Justice: The Hazel Brannon Smith Story" dramatizes the lonely, 
frightening vigil for racial equality waged by a flamboyant, white female 
editor of a small newspaper in rural Mississippi in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel Smith, who in 1964 became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for 
editorial writing "in the face of great pressure and opposition," is a natural 
TV movie subject. And how refreshing to find a heroine who's neither a TV 
anchor megastar or an abused wife and vengeful mother. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the throwaway pleasures in this movie is that the heroine's 
marriage to a Yankee (affably played by D.W. Moffett) is a rich, loving union 
rarely portrayed in movies anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour -- co-executive producer with her husband, James Keach, who also 
directed -- revives a little-remembered Southern heroine whose human scale and 
beaming demeanor are welcome respite from righteous, intense movie stereotypes 
normally associated with courageous activists like herself. 
</P>
<P>
 A backwoods idealist who epitomized a fast-dwindling breed of print journalism 
role models, Hazel Brannon Smith is an unlikely pioneer. Under an array of big 
floppy hats and sophisticated fashions, Seymour's Smith is a daring, 
unconventional doyenne of cultural life, a kind of Zelda Fitzgerald or Auntie 
Mame in radical clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of place in Rama Laurie Stagner's teleplay is evocatively captured 
by cinematographer Ross Maehl. Sandwiched between squeaky clean bucolic charm 
and lifelong friends who dump her (such as Richard Kiley's civic leader), Smith 
trashes local bigots in her newspaper column and literally loses all her 
friends in the storybook hamlet of Lexington, Miss., circa 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 In a milder variant of "Mississippi Burning," her visits to the local beauty 
parlor turn spiteful, a black colleague in her print shop is murdered, her 
office is firebombed and she nearly loses her life. 
</P>
<P>

Channel 7 at 9 p.m. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; SERPENTINE HOSKINS IN 'THE CHANGELING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noble romantic stirrings and the ideal of courtly love come down to pure lust 
in the rarely staged post-Elizabethan tragedy "The Changeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Seething and simmering through smoky, murky passageways in a Spanish castle 
tremulous with repressed tension, the BBC production throws co-stars Bob 
Hoskins and Elizabeth McGovern into a viper's nest of sex, shame and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level it's a soap opera told through a very clouded glass. But 
playwrights Thomas Middleton and William Rowley, who penned this play in 1622, 
touch a psychological pulse that transcends melodrama and provides Hoskins and 
McGovern with an operatic tour de force. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the minor playwrights' uneven verse is not remotely Shakespearean, 
you can't help but feel the ghosts of "Macbeth" and "Othello" (written just a 
few years earlier than this play). 
</P>
<P>
 Lust hovers in the dank and dark chambers, exchanged in whispery liaisons most 
poisonous between a repressed, peevish mistress (McGovern) and her lurking, 
sex-crazed servant, his face despoiled by a horrible birthmark (Hoskins). 
</P>
<P>
 "These foul chops may come into favor someday," the servant pines in one of 
the show's numerous interior monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, opportunity strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In collusion with his nefarious but naive lady, he commits murders for her 
and, in return, brushing aside her offer of gold, demands she submit to him -- 
which she does. The production's ripest achievement is the sexually cloistered 
McGovern's unexpected and growing attraction to the serpent in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play's best line, McGovern, all curls and heaving bosom, chillingly 
intones, "Vengeance begins. Murder, I see, is followed by more sins." 
</P>
<P>
 Having been lured by the drama's teeming lust and psychological truth, a word 
of deep caution: Adapter Michael Hasting cut out the entire comic subplot, 
which is set in a mad house and counterpoints the play's theme while 
underscoring the meaning of the title, which otherwise makes no sense (not to 
be confused with the old George C. Scott movie about a ghost, "The 
Changeling"). 
</P>
<P>
 More detrimentally, director Simon Curtis opens up with a scene that's a 
certified disaster when it comes to grabbing viewers. Staged between two 
courtiers, the first moments are so stilted and incomprehensible in their stagy 
speech patterns they're certain to send viewers spinning off to other channels. 
</P>
<P>
 But patience is rewarded. Passions are so willful and tantalizing the 
production gathers steam even as you lean forward to untangle the verbal 
cadences. Don't worry if you miss some of the words -- it makes no difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody payoff, when McGovern and Hoskins are most full of life, breathes 
air into their sin. Throughout, Hoskins -- a veritable satyr -- is terrific. * 
"The Changeling" premieres today on the Bravo Channel at 5 p.m. and again at 
9:30 p.m. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; DISEASE A PIGMENT OF TOWN'S IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS' "Children of the Dark" isn't the horror movie its title might suggest, 
but it does contain moments of horrifying behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 After preschool-aged daughters Jamie and Sheri are diagnosed as having a rare 
genetic disorder, the Harrison family is ostracized and persecuted by the 
denizens of their small Illinois town. It is wrongly believed that the 
Harrisons can infect others with xeroderma pigmentosum, a sometimes fatal 
disease where exposure to sunlight can cause skin cancer, blindness and mental 
retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children of the Dark" intends to illustrate how ignorance can stir irrational 
fears and hatred. But the overwhelming majority of townspeople are so cruel or 
insensitive that you begin to wonder just how much this true story was 
exaggerated for the purpose of dramatic effect. Only a co-worker of husband Jim 
(Peter Horton) comes to the family's defense. Even after their home is defaced 
with graffiti and a Molotov cocktail is hurled through a window, the Harrisons 
still fail to garner sympathy. The film doesn't even allude to investigations, 
which should have followed in the wake of these criminal incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons are understandably rattled by the cold stares and hostile 
comments they receive in public. Yet they make no attempts to educate the 
community about the facts surrounding xeroderma pigmentosum. They seem resigned 
to living rather isolated lives. Eventually, the financially strapped family 
moves to Northern California in an attempt to rebuild their lives and to find 
the one medical expert who might help. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives "Children of the Dark" the little momentum it has is the 
frighteningly strange nature of the disease afflicting 5-year-old Jamie 
(Lindsey Haun) and 3-year-old Sheri (Analise Ashdown). Because extended 
exposure to normal, everyday light can cause excruciating pain and disastrous 
long-term effects, the girls find themselves prisoners in their own home. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that director Michael Switzer and the film's three writers 
didn't choose to make the movie more from the perspective of Jamie and Sheri. 
What is it like for two young girls to be endlessly cooped up in a dark house 
without friends or outside stimulation? And how will the disease impact their 
ability to live fulfilling lives as they grow older? In an apparent attempt to 
avoid a dour conclusion, the makers of "Children of the Dark" opt to skirt 
these troubling questions. * "Children of the Dark" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on 
CBS (Channels 2 and 8). JON MATSUMOTO

DO-IT-YOURSELF; PERIOD PIECES RISE OUT OF QUALITY KITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Annie Wachtel of Hancock Park was touring the historic Gamble House in 
Pasadena when the small fern table caught her eye. She fell in love 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quintessential Craftsman furniture -- mahogany with a green Italianate 
marble top and little ebony pegs and just the size for a fern. But it was roped 
off, so I couldn't even touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Wachtel was amazed and delighted when she saw an ad in American Bungalow 
magazine for a kit. For $150 and some hours of assembly work, she could have an 
exact copy of the Gamble House table. The kit came pre-cut with all the pieces, 
fasteners and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a carpenter," says Wachtel, a garden consultant and designer, "but my 
sister helped me and we put it together ourselves. Now it's sitting in my 
living room, next to a black leather chair. It looks so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Wachtel typifies a new trend in the do-it-yourself furniture world. 
"Knock-down" furniture, also known as "RTA" (ready to assemble) has been around 
for years in the form of particle board bookcases and kitchen tables for young 
people in first apartments and others on tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, people with their eyes on the upscale are buying kits to build 
reproductions of mission-style dining sets, Chippendale garden benches, Shaker 
writing desks, Queen Anne lowboys and Colonial grandfather clocks.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the new way to buy quality furniture," says John Brinkman, editor of 
American Bungalow, published in Sierra Madre and dedicated to the Craftsman 
movement. The magazine went into the kit sideline after a staff member built a 
fern table and everyone who saw it wanted one, Brinkman says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's also a reaction to the electronics age," he says. "There's a 
fascination with the natural textures of real, honest wood." 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkman says elegant kit furniture typifies the '90s interest in home and 
hearth with a touch of frugality thrown in. A kit saves up to half the retail 
price of assembled furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make reproductions of museum pieces in kit form for customers who have an 
interest in Early American furniture but can't afford antiques," says Andrew 
Smith, president of Cohasset Colonials in Highham, Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small niche kind of business -- our customers get a very high-quality 
piece of furniture and have the fun of putting it together. We encourage them 
to identify pieces with their name so people will remember that Uncle Wilbur 
built that desk." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love telling people I made it myself," Wachtel says. "This is the 
period of interest in homes, and if you love your home, why not make something 
for it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are levels of complexity, depending on the piece of furniture, 
most kits can be assembled by any amateur with enough patience to read 
instructions very carefully.  
</P>
<P>
 And the kits are tailored for people who don't have woodworking tools but want 
the pride of craftsmanship. Patricia Metropolis, a New Mexico writer and editor 
who says, "I've never used my hands," recently built a slat-backed teak chair, 
cocktail table and a bench for the patio of her new home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed a little help, but not much, and I really enjoyed it," she says. "I 
could build another chair. And I saved a lot of money. I'm very pleased with 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her kits came from Wood Classics in Gardiner, N.Y. "Our furniture is not 
inexpensive," says founder Eric Goodman. "Many people who could afford whatever 
they want buy kits. It's one way to work out frustrations on the weekend -- 
lovingly and carefully building something." 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees that part of the pleasure is the wood. "Wood has character, and it's 
not like stone or concrete. You don't have to apprentice for a long time, and 
you don't need strength." 
</P>
<P>
 What you do need, he adds, is patience. "If the kit is $600 and the assembled 
furniture is $1,100, you have to do something for that $500." 
</P>
<P>
 But in most instances, patience will pay off. Today's furniture kit 
manufacturers have done all the hard work, says Frank Coffee, author of a new 
book, "The Best Kits Catalog" (HarperCollins). 
</P>
<P>
 Quality kits come with all wood parts pre-cut and ready to assemble and 
finish, Coffee says: "Where rabbets, miters, dovetails or mortise-and-tenon 
joints are called for, they will have been machined at the factory." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, most companies offer 800 numbers for technical assistance, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Ernst at Coppa Woodworking in San Pedro, which sells Adirondack chair 
kits, links the interest in building furniture with a yearning for a simpler 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the yuppie thing -- searching for nostalgia," he says. "With everybody 
getting computerized, it's nice to do something with your hands. Something that 
gives you personal satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Cabanillas, 36, an aerospace engineer for Rockwell International, has 
built a stereo cabinet and the Craftsman fern table. "It's possible that things 
are not quite as excessive as they were in the last decade," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for things today that give them more human connection." 
</P>
<P>
 He treasures the childhood memories of helping his grandfather, who had a 
woodworking shop in his attic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope eventually to have a house with an attic and do the same thing," 
Cabanillas says. "For now, I have to make do with kits."

NEW LEAF ON LIFE; HOUSEPLANTS FROM '70S ARE AS POPULAR AS EVER, BUT TODAY THEY 
PROVIDE HUES, ACCENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you haven't been in the houseplant section of a nursery since the '70s, a 
fresh visit might feel like deja vu. All the foliage plants you associate with 
the avocado-pit-rooting-on-the-windowsill era are there: philodendrons, rubber 
plants, mother-in-law's tongue, false-aralia (the marijuana look-alike), 
Chinese evergreens, pothos. And, yes, even Boston ferns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasn't anything changed in two decades? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, and no. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has truly gone out of style," says grower Mark Stansbury of Newport 
Greenhouses. "Except maybe Creeping-Charlie. All the rest of the classic '70s 
houseplants still sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The way plants are used in the home, though, has changed considerably. While 
some plant lovers still favor the relaxed, indoor garden look of earlier times, 
the use and the role of houseplants have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, indoor plants are more often used to provide dramatic accents rather 
than to create a microclimate. A room is more likely to have single, large 
plants in it rather than scores of smaller plants; and most plants reach for 
the skylight rather than trail from hanging planters. Whereas variations on 
green seemed color enough in an earlier time, now houseplants are likely to 
bring bold splashes of color indoors with them. 
</P>
<P>
 People want living color in their interiors today, just as they do in their 
landscaping, Stansbury said. They're scooping up blooming outdoor plants in 
small pots -- things like azaleas, begonias, cineraria, cyclamen and kalanchoe 
-- and bringing them inside to enjoy while they're in flower. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest in indoor blooms has become so strong, in fact, says Stansbury, 
that many interior plant growers have switched from specializing in foliage 
plants to exclusively providing indoor seasonal color. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Amling, manager at Armstrong Garden Center in Newport Beach, sees the 
same trend. Anything in bloom in the interior plant section of his nursery 
sells, he says, and four-inch pots sell particularly well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are buying several at a time and combining them with small foliage 
plants like maidenhair fern, just as they would with outdoor seasonal color in 
containers," says Amling. 
</P>
<P>
 Though theoretically these plants could be transplanted outside after 
blooming, most people treat them as long-term centerpieces and dispose of them 
after they flower, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One increasingly popular way to provide long-term color indoors is with 
orchids; their blooms typically last a minimum of two months. Orchid prices 
have dropped significantly since the '70s, most dramatically in the case of 
cymbidiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that long ago that cymbidiums were priced according to how many 
flower stalks were in bloom," Amling says. "But that's no longer the case. And 
prices are much lower, usually $29 retail, versus the $39 to $49 price tags of 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The price of cymbidiums came down because of faster methods of propagation and 
more growers entering the market, and the same thing will happen soon with 
phalaenopsis (moth-orchids), Stansbury predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas cymbidiums are generally retired to a patio between bloom seasons, 
phalaenopsis qualifies as a true houseplant and remains indoors year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "All phalaenopsis requires is good light -- morning sun or filtered light all 
day long -- temperatures consistently above 55 degrees, and regular 
fertilizer," says Steve Kawaratani of the Laguna Nursery. "They're pretty easy. 
My wife has about 30, and there's always at least one in bloom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bromeliads are another option for indoor color, says Kawaratani. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flowers last up to four months," he says. Nurseries used to offer only one 
variety, he says (you've seen it; the flowers are bubble-gum pink), but dozens 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a parent plant will produce only one flower during its lifetime, many 
people treat bromeliads as disposables. But you could also move them outdoors 
after they finish blooming and let them produce offsets, which, with a bit of 
luck, will flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Advances in tissue culture technology are directly responsible for most of the 
new bromeliads, says Stansbury. (The same thing is true of orchids and 
anthuriums.) Because a laboratory has the ability to produce clones of an 
original plant in a test tube every few weeks, it no longer takes years to 
propagate enough of a new hybrid to bring it to market, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Tolley, lab manager at Twyford Labs in Santa Paula, provides a dramatic 
illustration: 
</P>
<P>
 "We cloned some marigold hybrids for a seed company a while back," he says. 
"We started with something like five plants and produced a half-million by the 
end of the year. With traditional propagation methods, you'd get maybe 600." 
</P>
<P>
 Tissue culture technology has affected the traditional houseplant market, too. 
Take another look at that philodendron in the nursery. Chances are it's not 
really the same plant you grew in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like buying something that they have had good luck with before but 
that's a little bit different," Amling says. For example: a trusty philodendron 
but a cultivar with burgundy-tinted leaves this time around, for instance, or a 
variegated rather than a regular Ficus benjamina. "In fact, anything variegated 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferns are different too. 'Dallas,' for example, has pretty much supplanted 
'Boston.'  
</P>
<P>
 "It needs less light, less humidity and less room because it stays compact 
rather than cascading," Amling says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visit a nursery that makes interior plants one of its specialties and you'll 
find differences from the '70s that are more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The very size of the plants, for one thing. Houseplants as big as small trees 
have become almost commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two reasons, according to Kawaratani. One is that current 
architecture encourages it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ceilings are higher, and there's more glass and skylights," he says. "Spaces 
like that call for larger plants that were used in the past, and they provide 
enough light to support them." 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is aesthetic. People are buying fewer plants -- no more 
windows totally obscured by greenery in macrame hangers -- and instead opting 
for bolder ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying architectural-looking plants with strong, graphic shapes -- 
the emphasis is line rather than mass -- and treating them like just one more 
element in the decor," Kawaratani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Palms, still the top sellers among tree-size interior plants, are a good 
example. Stately Kentia or fishtail palms can soften an empty corner between 
two windows, serve as a backdrop to a wingback chair, or flank a handsome 
archway, drawing attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, columnar-shaped plants, like dracenas or euphorbias, can substitute 
for sculpture in an entryway or other narrow space. 
</P>
<P>
 Euphorbias, though expensive because extremely slow growing, are excellent 
houseplants for people who don't like to fuss, Kawaratani says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since they have virtually no leaves, they need little water or humidity. 
Their main requirement is sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant bird-of-paradise is a relative newcomer that's become very popular. 
Though common as an outdoor plant, it's also been found to do well indoors when 
provided with ample light. And it is a striking example of the current 
philosophy of less is more. A six-foot-tall plant might consist of just four or 
five enormous leaves -- a dramatic contrast to the thousand-leaved Ficus 
benjamina that would likely have filled its place in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>

 Speaking of the '70s, two large plants from that era that weren't seen much of 
in the '80s are experiencing a comeback. One is Dracaena fragrans 
'Massangeana,' commonly known as the cornplant; the other is Ficus lyrata , the 
fiddleleaf fig. Like the other large houseplants mentioned already, these two 
are decidedly structural in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for a plant six feet tall or larger, you'll most likely need 
to visit what the trade calls an "interior scaper." Instant Jungle of Costa 
Mesa, a provider of plants for restaurants, hotels and shopping centers as well 
as for spacious interiors, is one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Large Kentia palms are our specialty," says vice president Andy Blanton, "and 
they're still my favorite plant. They're graceful, versatile and classic. They 
seem to work with any interior. I think they'll always be around." 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy customers' constant demand for the unusual, however, Instant Jungle 
has sought out lots of new palms as well. Triangular palm, named for its 
wedge-shaped trunk, is an outstanding example. In addition to a strong, 
architectural shape, this tree features a trunk washed in beautiful lavender, 
gray and eggplant tones. Grass palm from Mexico, which looks like a cross 
between a giant festuca and agave -- looks spiky but feels soft -- is another 
interesting example. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very architectural," Blanton says. "And that's what people seem to want 
today. They want a specific shape for a specific space, not just a generic big, 
bushy plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Other exotics stocked by Instant Jungle are giant aloes, ponytail-palm 
(actually a succulent) and various bamboo with patterned canes, an interesting 
alternative to dracaena where a columnar-shaped plant is desired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In summary, everything you grew in the '70s is still out there. Even spider 
plant is back. In fact, some stores can't keep it in stock since the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration published research citing it as one of the 
most effective plants for air purification. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of exotic new things are, too. And the majority of these plants are 
available at prices that are positively retro. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, houseplants just may be the bargain of the '90s.  
</P>
<P>
 "What else can you think of where prices are actually lower than they were in 
the '70s?," Stansbury asks.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: SEALANT KEEPS MOLD OFF BRICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have two red brick patios and every spring I'm faced with a 
buildup of black and green mold on the bricks, primarily under the patio 
covers. I remove it, but the problem always returns. Is there any way to 
inhibit the growth of mold? 
</P>
<P>
 S.L. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "You may want to try using a silicone-based sealant on the brick," 
says Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. "This is a fairly new product 
and it's designed for use in areas where mold is a problem. And it's 
translucent so there's no change in color after it dries, and it's also 
waterproof. First you'll need to clean the brick, scrubbing off any dirt or 
mold so it's as sparkling as you can make it. Then you'll need to completely 
rinse it off; you don't want to leave any detergent or mold spores. Then let it 
dry out thoroughly for a few days. You can then use a simple paint roller and 
tray to roll on the sealer." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We recently bought a house with ceramic tile on the kitchen countertops 
that had been installed two years ago. Supposedly, a sealer had also been put 
on the grout, but we're finding that the previously white grout is now brown 
and spotted. Grout cleaners and brushes don't seem to work. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 W.E. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 A: "White grout has more problems with staining than any other color, probably 
because everything stains it," says Gidon Adlan of Bob's Shades & Linoleum in 
Orange. "And a sealer, even a good one, is only effective for about six months, 
since the area is constantly being washed with soaps and cleaners, which eat 
away at the sealer. The easiest solution is to re-grout the area, or to have a 
tile installer coat the grout lines with a pigment used to make grout, which 
brings it back to its original color." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're thinking of doing some remodeling in the kitchen this summer and have 
been looking at sinks. Which is a better sink, stainless steel or cast iron? 
</P>
<P>
 S.N. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "With cast iron, you can match the color of your appliances, which gives 
you a more cozy look," says Rich Haagsma of Faucets 'n Fixtures in Orange. 
"Stainless steel, at least good 18-gauge stainless steel, is extremely durable 
and chip-proof. It's often the choice of gourmet cooks, since they can drop big 
pans in one and not have to worry about damaging it. You should first look at 
all kinds of sinks to get a feel for which would suit your needs, and which 
would look best with your new kitchen. Surprisingly, good-quality stainless 
steel costs more than cast-iron, so that has to be taken into consideration as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm looking to find a window treatment, preferably a horizontal or vertical 
blind, that will keep out the heat from a room that gets a lot of direct 
sunlight. Is there one that works best? 
</P>
<P>
 R.V. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You may want to look at cellular shades, which have a honeycomb shape," 
says Heidi Benson of Wells Interiors in Laguna Hills. "They're available with 
varying forms of light shading, from sheer to block out some light to a 
blackout shade. The back on cellular shades is white to reflect heat; the front 
can be ordered in any color to match your decor. You can also go with a pleated 
shade that has a metal backing. However, good quality mini and vertical shades 
will also give you good protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last summer I started painting some of my wood lawn furniture and applied a 
primer, then for various reasons the project got set aside and I never 
finished. The furniture was left out in the weather with just the primer coat. 
Should I put a new coat on before finishing the job? 
</P>
<P>
 C.F. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Give it a good washing with soap and water, rinse it off and let it dry," 
says painter Rod Young of Santa Ana. "If it looks as though the primer is still 
adhering to the wood, you can give it a top coat. If not, sand the loose paint 
off, re-prime, then paint."

HOME MAINTENANCE; STICK TO THESE HINTS WHEN SELECTING GLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember when all glues were practically the same and it didn't seem to matter 
which you used? Remember also how poorly most of those glues held and how 
difficult they often were to apply? 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. Nowadays, store shelves overflow with a variety of sticky 
stuff, making choices difficult. But the good news is that modern glues adhere 
better and generally are easier to apply than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a guide to choosing the right glues and some hints on applying them: 
</P>
<P>
 For general household repairs and craft work involving china, glass, 
porcelain, wood, metal and plastic, white all-purpose glue remains a good 
choice. Technically, this type of glue is called polyvinyl acetate, or PVA 
glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply it by squeezing it from the container directly onto the work, or spread 
it with your finger or a brush. Pieces must fit closely together without gaps. 
Clamp them together while the glue sets. Setting takes one to eight hours, 
complete curing usually takes about 24 hours. Clean away excess glue with water 
before setting begins. PVA glue dries clear. 
</P>
<P>
 For repairs to wood, especially furniture, use aliphatic resin glue, better 
known as carpenter's glue. This adhesive looks and behaves virtually like white 
glue but generally is yellow in color, drying to a translucent white (a brown 
version is available for mending dark wood). 
</P>
<P>
 Clamp pieces within five minutes after applying glue. Setting takes about an 
hour, complete curing about 18 hours. The sign of a strong glue joint on wood 
is a uniform line of excess glue along the entire seam between glued pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although excess glue can be wiped away with a wet cloth or sponge, doing so 
can cause glue to enter any bare wood surrounding the joint, making finishing 
difficult. Experienced woodworkers usually let the excess glue harden and then 
carefully scrape it away with a knife or chisel. 
</P>
<P>
 Select epoxy when joining metal, china, glass and dissimilar materials and 
when a waterproof bond is needed on wood. Epoxy is a two-part adhesive 
consisting of a liquid resin and a hardener that solidifies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Epoxy is extremely strong, takes from five minutes to overnight to set 
depending on type and does not require clamping. In fact, it even fills gaps 
between ill-fitting pieces. However, epoxy must be mixed carefully to the 
proportions listed on the label and is difficult to remove after setting has 
begun (use acetone, found in some nail polish removers). Removing epoxy is 
virtually impossible after it's fully cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional clear cellulose cement is still a good choice for mending many 
lightweight objects of wood, china and glass, and also for most fabrics and 
some plastics. For extra strength, apply a thin coat to each surface being 
joined, wait a few moments for the glue to become gummy, and then apply a 
second thin coat before joining the pieces and clamping them. Setting takes 
about two hours, full curing about two days. Use tape to clamp awkward objects 
such as dishes; for support, insert them partway in a bowl filled with sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Better than cellulose cement in most cases is cyanoacrylate, or super glue. 
Two kinds are available; use the gel variety for porous materials such as wood 
and fabric, the liquid for non-porous materials such as plastics, rubber and 
metal. Both kinds set in 10 to 30 seconds, forming an extra-strong bond that 
dries clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Because super glue hardens so quickly and is so strong, avoid getting glue on 
your skin. Do not point the container toward your face when opening it. Quick 
application of acetone may remove super glue, but once hard, super glue cannot 
be dissolved.

HOUSEPLANTS MUST HAVE PURPOSE, DESIGNER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When interior designer Sheldon Harte looks at a room from the standpoint of 
adding houseplants, he asks himself three questions: 
</P>
<P>
 "What will work with the style of the room? What will thrive in the location? 
And what role do I want the plant to play?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's the last question that tends to separate the amateurs from the pros. Most 
of us buy a houseplant the way we might a puppy; it just happened to be the one 
we fell in love with. But for a designer a plant must have a purpose -- just 
like every other object in a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Plan your plant purchases by studying the entire room, defining the spaces 
that could benefit by the addition of plants, and then deciding on what shape 
plant would best complement each space, advises Harte, of Harte-Brownlee in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you want a fan-shaped plant, like a Queen Sago palm, to fill a corner or 
serve as a backdrop to a handsome piece of furniture? Do you want a 
columnar-shaped plant to complement a vertical architectural feature or to fill 
an awkward narrow space? Or do you want something weeping and graceful, like 
the Ficus nuda tree, to soften hard edges? Determine what you need before you 
shop, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Harte's next piece of advice is to invest in big plants. "Most people buy 
undersized plants," he says. "Big plants provide more punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't use too many varieties either, he suggests. Staying within a few plant 
families -- palms in every room, but different cultivars, for example -- 
provides continuity just as staying with a certain color palette throughout an 
entire house does. Since plants within the same family tend to have the same 
cultural requirements, it simplifies upkeep as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a green thumb, consider hiring a plant service to maintain 
your houseplants, Harte advises. "Plants are an investment; maintenance is 
insurance."  
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Harte says, don't pass up the opportunity to make plants part of 
your indoor environment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Californians tend to use more neutrals in our interiors because you can see 
so much more of the outdoors from our rooms, and we don't want to compete with 
the views," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houseplants -- especially the exotic ones only possible out here -- emphasize 
that fusion of indoor/outdoor living. They're part of what makes our decor 
unique. They're a celebration of the California lifestyle." SHARON COHOON

DESIGN; EXHIBIT EXAMINES ART OF PACKAGING A DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK DENNIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Push a cart down market aisles, read magazine advertising or watch television 
commercials: No doubt you will find stacks of products proclaimed to be the 
"newest" or "latest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This siren call of "progress" has pervaded American society for decades, 
imploring you to buy, buy, buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you may not need to. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's all so obvious that we are oblivious to it. An exhibit at the 
Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design in New York City, though, uses this 
idea to take a sharp look at the evolution of 20th-Century American product 
design and its broader societal implications. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk through "Packaging the New: Design and the American Consumer 1925-1975" 
is a walk through the iconography of America's recent consumer past. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entryway there's an Art Deco Saks Fifth Avenue store window, circa 
1928. From there, displays progress through the years to 1975 by way of: 
</P>
<P>
 * A streamlined office; 
</P>
<P>
 * A recreation room with pool table, recliner and television; 
</P>
<P>
 * A shopping market with such familiar products as Crest toothpaste and Cheer 
laundry detergent, and grocery carts; 
</P>
<P>
 * A 1960s Formica "carousel" kitchen replete with timesaving appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation ends with an evolutionary display of toasters -- 
stylistically different, yet functionally the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit looks at the work of five giants of design: Donald Deskey, Norman 
Bel Geddes, Walter Dorwin Teague, Henry Dreyfuss and Raymond Loewy -- Time 
magazine's Man of the Year in 1949 -- and analyzes how they shaped America's 
consumer tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is more than a display of items most Americans will have no trouble 
recognizing from their day-to-day lives. It is also a social, economic and 
environmental commentary, part of Cooper-Hewitt's mission to "educate all 
people on the impact of design on our daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that obsolescence, as practiced by manufacturers and industrial 
designers, has long been one of the key factors driving our economic system," 
says exhibition curator Gail Davidson. "This exhibition questions the value of 
styling for profit as the chief goal for design, particularly in light of 
current social and environmental concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit explores the design roots behind the proverbial "keeping up with 
the Joneses." It chronicles how, in the depth of the Great Depression, 
industrial designers, advertisers and manufacturers orchestrated economic 
stimuli using consumer demand driven by style. 
</P>
<P>
 It examines how product design, embodied in the nearly 200 items displayed, 
fueled a burgeoning postwar economy, yet also helped create wasteful 
consumption based on perceptions of not what is essential, but what is desired. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers highlighted in "Packaging the New" helped solve a problem of the 
1930s: the Great Depression's stagnant economy. But, according to the exhibit, 
they have created a new set of problems and priorities that today's designers 
and manufacturers must address. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on a culture of waste created by "old wine in new bottles" brings 
the exhibit in line with today's environmental movement, implying that this 
culture of design helped create Americans' consumer appetite -- the most 
voracious on earth -- which is contributing to the degradation of the global 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the exhibit, the role of today's designers is to address the 
often conflicting priorities of economic growth and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 This message brings two levels of interest to the exhibit: You can enjoy 
looking at objects from an aesthetic or design perspective while pondering the 
broader implications of designing the new when the old is not necessarily 
obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is in the stately Carnegie mansion -- home to the Cooper-Hewitt -- 
providing irony and contrast: transitory consumer goods displayed in the 
timeless elegance of the 19th Century mansion's architecture. This duality is 
silent yet strong testimony to the sometimes illusory progress the exhibit 
views with a critical eye.

INTERIORS; A PERFECT PLACE TO AIR THE HEIRLOOM LINENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An old-fashioned linen closet is reminiscent of a time when linens were a part 
of gracious living. Now, with renewed interest in heirlooms, the linen closet 
is the perfect place to show off -- or to store -- Granny's damasks and Aunt 
Emma's embroidered pillow shams. 
</P>
<P>
 In an older home, the linen closet is usually near the main bathroom, but any 
closet will do. Or, lacking a closet, consider an antique linen press or 
armoire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key requirements are a dark, dry and reasonably well-ventilated area," 
says Ric Barbatelli, who with his wife, Stephanie, owns a Madison Avenue linen 
shop in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moisture and sunlight are both enemies of fine fabrics," Stephanie Barbatelli 
says, "so avoid selecting either a damp basement or attic as a place to store 
linens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barbatellis, who live in a small apartment where closets are at a premium, 
store their linens in a small armoire. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the space, it is easier if all the linens are in full view. If there 
is a light, so much the better. That way you won't unfold a queen-size sheet 
when you're looking for a single. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the efficiency of having everything in its place, wrinkle-free and 
ready to use, neat and tidy arrangements are satisfying as a decorative 
element. For the nicest look, bundle each set of sheets and towels with a 
ribbon or cording. Place the piles on the shelves by color. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet aromas are a staple of the old-fashioned linen closet. Lavender is the 
traditional fragrance. However, any fragrance you like is fine. Sachets, 
pomanders or other containers filled with potpourri can supply the fragrance 
and can be refreshed with a few drops of essential oils when the aroma starts 
to fade. Do not allow the oils to come into direct contact with linens, 
however. They can stain. 
</P>
<P>
 Treated or painted wood can also lead to discoloration or deterioration of the 
fabric, so line wood shelves with paper or quilted padding. The padding lasts 
longer and looks prettier than shelf paper. Look for it in white and floral 
prints at housewares shops. 
</P>
<P>
 You can add a decorative fabric edging to the shelf to complete the look. 
Consider lace or ribbon from a fabric shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Barbatelli suggests that keeping a small sewing kit in or near the 
linen closet so that when something needs repair it's a simple matter to take 
care of it. 
</P>
<P>
 If linens are stored in a closet, they do not have to be wrapped, even if they 
are seldom used. If you do wrap them, do not use plastic, which can trap 
moisture and lead to mildew. Natural fiber materials such as cotton, linen and 
silk need to "breathe." Instead, use acid-free tissue paper. That way, there is 
no danger of chemicals reacting with linen fibers to discolor or break them 
down, Stephanie Barbatelli says. Acid-free papers are available in closet shops 
and closet accessories departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Examine heirloom linens, such as baby christening gowns and rarely used table 
linens every year or so at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, after a period of a year or more, especially in a humid climate, 
linens when not used can develop brown age spots," Stephanie Barbatelli says. 
"These spots can be avoided easily with regular laundering. Periodic laundering 
keeps fabrics supple."

WAYS TO CARE FOR FINE LINENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Careful, regular laundering will keep even the oldest and most cherished 
linens looking fresh. So, if they have to be washed, they might as well be 
enjoyed and used often. 
</P>
<P>
 Just remember that fine and heirloom linens should be handled with more care 
than everyday linens. Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Place small items in a lingerie bag in the washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * If there is space, hang linens to dry. If not, use low heat in a clothes 
dryer and remove them while they are still slightly damp. 
</P>
<P>
 * While the linens are still damp, iron them on the wrong side. For extra 
delicate fabric, press over a towel. Shiny linens, such as damasks, should be 
ironed on the right side to bring up the shine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hang table linens over a padded hanger or bar to avoid creases. Folded 
linens may develop a line along the folded edges, so refold them occasionally. 
Or, better yet, give a party and use them before laundering and refolding.

INTERIORS; BED-MAKING RULES COME UNTUCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the military or on our own, many days of our lives start with making the 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army still has strict standards -- beds made so tightly you can 
bounce a quarter on them -- but most young people today aren't nearly so fussy 
as Uncle Sam. In fact, most probably never heard of a hospital corner, the 
precise 45-degree angle created by tucking a flat sheet under the mattress 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank heaven, then, for the comforter. Big and fluffy, pull it up over the 
sheets, plump up the pillows and you have a socially acceptable alternative to 
the made bed. A good thing, too, considering a recent survey by Roper Starch 
Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 500 women surveyed, making beds is something younger women 
don't do all that much. The survey in the April issue of Good Housekeeping 
magazine found that only 45% of women under age 45 make their beds every day. 
That compares with 71% of older women who make the bed daily. Don't count on 
men to pick up the slack and pull up the bedcovers: 60% of the women say their 
mates never make the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 And 85% of respondents said they felt no guilt or only a mild unease at 
leaving a rumpled bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Seliger, deputy editor of Good Housekeeping, which commissioned the 
poll, says that lack of guilt was good news to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel that making beds is a good use of my time," says the 
fortysomething editor. "My mother would die if she didn't make her bed every 
day. Enough of her training lingers so that I would close the bedroom door or 
quickly fluff up the comforter and throw on a quilt. I am enormously grateful 
for down comforters and quilts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of bedspreads have been on the decline since the mid-1970s as the 
looser-looking bed became the standard at all price levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bedding industry sells significantly more comforters than bedspreads," 
says John Fraley, vice president of the Martex division of Westpoint Stevens 
Home Fashions in New York. "Comforters, because of their practicality, will 
continue to be the major product focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday's bed with thin, flat spread precisely pulled up over tightly tucked 
sheets and a couple of flat pillows may look neat, but it also looks 
uncomfortable. Compare that with a puffy down comforter casually tossed over a 
fitted bottom sheet and a sea of plump pillows in a variety of sizes and 
shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks inviting," Rose Gerace, speaking for Westpoint Stevens, says. "In 
photography for new bedding lines, we even show beds with the sheets turned 
down at a 45-degree angle. The photography also shows how to mix and match 
different patterns of sheets." 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Not only do beds have that unmade look, sheets do not even need 
to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ensembles, the top sheet is different from the bottom sheet," Gerace 
says. "For example, a large floral for the top sheet and a small floral pattern 
on the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 The unmatched look started to show up about five years ago in expensive 
designer lines, she says. Now, it is an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of military standards? 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Army still wants beds made so tightly you can bounce a quarter on 
them," Mike Griffin says. Griffin is public affairs officer and former drill 
sergeant at the U.S. Army Training Center at Ft. Jackson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard operating procedure for bed-making on the base is hospital 
corners at 45-degree angles for both sheets -- white and flat -- and two 
government-issue blankets, Army green, of course. Even here, though, things are 
not what they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been some lapsing," Griffin admits, "because the emphasis is not on 
whether a soldier can make up his bunk, but on what's between his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "All hell doesn't break loose if the bunk is on the wrinkled side."

GARDENING; LAVENDER'S VERSATILITY IS SOMETHING SPECIAL TO SAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention lavender, and most of us immediately think of a color. But gardeners 
and floral crafters around the world also identify lavender as a popular plant. 
</P>
<P>
 As you'd expect from its name, lavender typically has light or dark 
blue-violet flowers, although some gardeners also cultivate rarer pink-and 
white-flowered varieties. Garden centers often describe lavender as a shrub 
since it grows 12- to 30-inches tall and has a number of branches topped with 
spikes of flowers and greenish-gray leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lavender has long been popular both fresh and dried, many gardeners 
and crafters prize lavender for its delightful and long-lasting fragrance. In 
past generations, lavender held several symbolic meanings. In the Victorian 
era, for example, lavender signified loyalty and devotion. In other times, it 
indicated distrust. 
</P>
<P>
 English lavender, the most common variety in the United States, works well in 
both herb gardens and flower beds. You'll see it planted as a low hedge, in the 
middle to front of a perennial garden and in rock gardens. Because it tolerates 
light and heat reflected from paving, many homeowners use it for edging walks 
and driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavender prefers full sun and moist, well-drained soil fortified with organic 
matter. Prune off about half of the top after the plant blooms or just before 
growth begins in the spring. Potted lavender placed in a cool room with a 
southern exposure can survive indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 To use fresh lavender, pick it when about half the flowers on the spike are 
open. If you want to dry the lavender and use the entire dried spike, pick the 
spikes when the flowers have just begun to open. However, if you plan to remove 
the dried lavender flowers from the stems, pick spikes that are nearly in full 
bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 To air-dry, hang bunches of spikes or lay individual spikes or flowers flat. 
Either way, lavender normally dries in about two weeks. If you plan to use just 
the dried flowers, remove them from the stem by holding the spike over a bowl 
and gently rubbing between your hands. Store the loose lavender flowers in an 
airtight jar. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavender rates high in versatility, and even finds its way into recipes, 
cosmetics and mild sedatives. For floral crafts, it's especially well-suited. 
The flower spikes add color and fragrance to arrangements and wreaths, and 
loose lavender becomes a fragrant and colorful addition to potpourris, sachets 
and wands.

EXTERIORS; HOW TO DRESS UP A BACK-YARD DECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A back-yard deck can be a delightful outdoor getaway. But not if it's too hot 
and sunny, if seating is uncomfortable or if the deck is just plain boring.Here 
are a few ideas for decks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Accent with color. Paint the deck or furnishings in colors that complement 
your home. Cushions and pillows upholstered in splashy fabrics add color and 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illuminate. Low-voltage lights create a pleasant evening ambience. Build the 
fixtures into steps or railings, install them under benches or tuck them into 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add a roof. Create a shady sanctuary by roofing part of your deck. For sheer 
bliss, suspend a porch swing from a roof beam. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vary textures. A deck doesn't have to be all wood; varying textures creates 
visual excitement. Use metal or painted plastic pipe for railings, add a canvas 
canopy or insert glass-block or tile at intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Step up. If you have enough space, build a deck of many levels. For safety, 
be sure that at least two steps separate the levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add water. Nestle a fountain, hot tub or lily pond into a corner of your 
deck or create a distinct level for water features.

DOMESTIC PARTNERS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Domestic Partnership Registration Bill, introduced by Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Los Angeles), promotes responsibility and security for 
committed but unmarried couples. The bill will enable all committed couples in 
the state to register as "domestic partners" and assume certain 
responsibilities and limited benefits, provided they live together, share 
expenses and meet other basic requirements.They'll have family visitation 
rights in the hospital, legal preference to administer each other's affairs 
should one partner become incapacitated, and the ability to use a standard 
legal form to will each other property. These basic humanitarian rights are 
currently denied to committed but unmarried couples, no matter how longstanding 
their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 U.S. Census showed almost 500,000 unmarried couple households in 
California. Thousands of them have children. The security and integrity of 
those families is at risk under the current legal code. Domestic partnership is 
no substitute for the full legal benefits of marriage, but in a medical crisis 
it will help. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of civil rights for lesbians and gays may oppose this bill because 
it includes same-sex couples. But only the coldest of hearts would deny a 
couple, straight or gay, the right to care for each other in times of grave 
illness. It would be tragic if homophobia were allowed to derail a bill meant 
for all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time we recognize, support and protect all families.

'3 STRIKES' OFFENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article " '3 Strikes' Count Unfair, Suspect's Girlfriend Says" (March 
25), sympathizing with Mario Rodriguez's girlfriend, is just another example of 
The Times' liberal reporting.This guy is an obvious repeat offender who 
routinely disregards the law. I think it is fantastic that he is "shocked" and 
"stunned" to learn he faces a possible life sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 Although, surely, it was not The Times' intent, front-page publicity of 
tougher sentencing has the exact effect of deterring such unlawful behavior. 
Keep up the good work in reporting how "sad" and "unfair" the "three strikes" 
law is.

DODGER FOIBLES SHOWING IN LOSS; BASEBALL: THIS TIME THE LITTLE THINGS CAUSE 
TEAM TO LOSE TO PITTSBURGH, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 16,510 stand and cheer, the noise level is no less effective than from a 
stadium packed with 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At least not to Henry Rodriguez, who struck out Friday night to resounding 
roars, or to Manager Tom Lasorda, who watched his team go down with Rodriguez. 
And certainly not to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who were delighted to have such a 
large crowd at Three Rivers Stadium see them win their fifth consecutive game, 
a 6-4 victory over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all enough for Lasorda to resurrect his horse-racing story -- the one 
about how it doesn't matter what you do in the beginning, but where you finish 
in the end. Still, when a team loses its seventh of eight games and is settling 
into third place in its division -- behind the Colorado Rockies -- what can a 
manager say? 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the players in spring training that you can't give the opposition 
runs, especially when you are not hitting," Lasorda said. "You can get away 
with it if you scored eight or nine runs, but when the game is close you can't 
afford to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have won only three of 10 games this season, and two of the 
victories came against the Florida Marlins. Starting pitching, the area of 
concern during the spring, has been adequate. Their bullpen is suspect, and 
their lone left-handed pitcher, reliever Gary Wayne, is more effective against 
right-handers. The defense has been poor, and that's not because of Jose 
Offerman, who has been fielding smoothly. He has made only one error this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday night the Dodgers made three errors, and they were costly. They have 
made 13 so far, and rank near the bottom of the league in fielding overall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dodgers also are losing because of deficiencies that don't appear in 
the box scores or in statistics. Wednesday night they didn't communicate in the 
field, Thursday night a couple of veterans helped give the opposition a 
five-out inning and Friday night, they merely couldn't catch the ball. The 
Dodgers might not be hitting, but neither are the San Francisco Giants, and yet 
they are winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obviously not playing well, but we can't sit around and pout about it, 
we just have to go out and play," Eric Karros said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest calamity for the Dodgers came in the eighth, after they had rallied 
in the the inning to tie the score, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne (0-1), who relieved Kevin Gross to start the inning, gave up a leadoff 
single to left-handed batter Andy Van Slyke. Dave Clark followed with a 
sacrifice bunt back to Wayne, an easy out if Karros catches Wayne's throw. But 
Wayne's throw was a hard one to catch.  
</P>
<P>
 "He threw me a cutter and I didn't catch it, but it's not like I haven't 
caught them before," Karros said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Wayne walked left-handed batter Orlando Merced to load the bases with 
none out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott relieved Wayne to pitch to pinch-hitter Brian Hunter, who lined 
Gott's first pitch over a drawn-in infield and the outstretched glove of 
Offerman. Cory Snyder's throw to the plate was on line, but took a high bounce 
over the glove of Mike Piazza and sailed to the backstop. The Pirates went 
ahead, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get that guy (Clark) out at first base and it changes things around," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss spoiled another good game for Tim Wallach, who was two for four with 
a two-run homer in the fourth inning that put the Dodgers ahead, 2-1. Piazza 
also broke a three for 35 slump, going two for four, including a line-drive in 
the eighth inning that sent home Delino DeShields to tie the score, 4-4. He 
scored in the second on Wallach's homer, his third in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 After reliever Rick White (1-0) struck out the pinch-hitting Rodriquez, what 
was on Lasorda's mind was not that his team was finally scoring, but that they 
were giving runs away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am worried when we give up runs like that," Lasorda said.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; TIME TO STOP PLAYING MUSICAL QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Fouts was playing a little game with his son the other day: Match the NFL 
team with the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started in the NFC Central," said Fouts, who used to play a little 
quarterback himself. "After a few minutes, we quit. We couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, this is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other words to describe what has been happening in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb. Desperate. Damaging.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last 14 months, 19 of 28 teams have hired or fired starting 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of those teams have hired and fired quarterbacks twice . 
</P>
<P>
 In only the last three months, nine teams have changed quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In one day, Wednesday, three Pro Bowl quarterbacks changed teams. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so long ago that the thought of Warren Moon, Mark Rypien and Bernie 
Kosar changing teams in the same 24-hour period would have been unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the football powerbrokers shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how you do business in our league now," said Charley Casserly, 
Washington Redskin general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Since when does doing business mean robbing the fans of the only player many 
will ever identify with? 
</P>
<P>
 Since when does doing business mean that the most visible and important person 
on a team suddenly gets passed around the league like a bad penny? 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons let Wade Wilson leave and hire Bobby Hebert, who has been 
let go by New Orleans, which hires Wade Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? Read on. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 12 months later, the Falcons fire Bobby Hebert and hire Jeff George, 
who has left Indianapolis, which hires Jim Harbaugh, who was fired by Chicago, 
which has hired Eric Kramer, who was not re-signed by Detroit, which hires 
Scott Mitchell, who was let go by Miami, which hires Kosar, who was fired by 
the Cleveland Browns in the idiotic move that began this nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a disaster," Fouts said. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the craziness, look no further than the map in the Newport Beach 
office of agent Leigh Steinberg. He represents 22 quarterbacks, whose photos he 
affixes to the map in the cities where they play. 
</P>
<P>
 This minute, four of those players are in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a wonderful thing for the game? No," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sid Gillman, who is consulted by teams who need help with their 
quarterbacks: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am tickled to death I'm not coaching anymore. I would not want to wake up 
every day and wonder who my quarterback is." 
</P>
<P>
 Fouts spent all of his 15 years with the San Diego Chargers. Roger Staubach 
spent all of his 11 years with the Dallas Cowboys. Jim Hart spent 18 years with 
the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 That the New Orleans Saints have had three quarterbacks in three years must be 
funny to Archie Manning, who once was their quarterback for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem, of course, is the salary cap -- along with owners and 
players who don't understand how to adjust to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypien could have stayed in Washington, and perhaps been a savior if their 
first-round draft pick messes up, if he had taken a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon could have stayed in Houston if the Oilers had listened to his request to 
take a pay cut. But instead of keeping him around for less money and great 
insurance, they will now go with a kid or an unknown as Cody Carlson's backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply because there is suddenly free agency doesn't mean there are suddenly 
quick fixes. Especially not with quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "As great as Joe Montana was, he did not take the Kansas City Chiefs to the 
Super Bowl last year, did he?" Fouts asked. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had, he would have been only the third quarterback to lead a team to the 
Super Bowl in his first year with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 The last one to do it was Craig Morton with the Denver Broncos in the 1977 
season. The only other one was Daryle Lamonica of the then-Oakland Raiders in 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Two in 28 Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all seeing how long it takes quarterbacks to get used to the system," 
Saint Coach Jim Mora said. "Wade Wilson came in early last year and worked 
hard, and he still wasn't completely comfortable at the start of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 A suggestion. There are already special rules to protect the quarterback on 
the field. Add one to protect him off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow teams to exceed the salary cap in paying their free-agent quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA already has this rule for every player, regardless of position, and 
their big stars are staying put.

A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?; NOT FOR ANGELS; BASEBALL: THEY SCORE SEVEN IN BOTTOM OF 
NINTH AND BEAT BLUE JAYS, 14-13, IN THE 10TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It the most remarkable comeback since Dick Schofield's grand slam capped an 
eight-run ninth inning to carry the Angels to a victory over Detroit in August 
of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels scored seven runs in the ninth and beat the Blue Jays, 14-13, 
Friday night before 20,413 at Anaheim Stadium when Damion Easley's two-out 
single scored Tim Salmon in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds, the 11th batter of the ninth inning, hit a ground-rule double 
over the head of Toronto right-fielder Joe Carter that bounced into the seats 
Friday night and carried the Angels into extra innings tied, 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the capping blow of a most improbable seven-run rally after the Angels 
had given up five runs in both the eighth and ninth innings to let a 6-3 lead 
become a 13-6 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The question about the Angels all along has been pitching. The Angels feel 
they have the lineup to compete evenly with the best teams in baseball, but how 
will they fare in the arms race? 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday night is any indication, it's going to be a long summer for the 
Angels on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie first baseman Eduardo Perez had a pair of bases-empty home runs, Tim 
Salmon hit a two-run homer, Dwight Smith drove in two more and the Angels had a 
6-3 lead in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Toronto Blue Jay batters later, however, the Angels were trailing by two 
runs. And one inning after that, Toronto led by seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel rebounded with five singles, three walks, a sacrifice fly and 
Reynolds' big blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Brian Anderson got his second for the Angels and weathered a sometimes 
rocky six innings, giving up four hits and three runs. But thanks to the 
Salmon-Perez Power Co., he was in position to pick up his second victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seemed. Scott Lewis was summoned to provide relief and cruised 
through a 1-2-3 seventh. Then lightning -- and reality -- struck and the Blue 
Jays reenacted batting practice for the folks who arrived late. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon White led off with a double to right-center and, one out later, Paul 
Molitor walked. Joe Carter hit a slow roller to third and when Easley bobbled 
the ball, the bases were loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers called for left-hander Bob Patterson to face left-hand 
hitting John Olerud. So much for the percentages. Olerud, who won the batting 
title last season, lined a two-run single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher was next to emerge from the Angel bullpen and, like those before 
and after, soon to leave with his head humbly hung. Ed Sprague greeted him with 
a double down the left-field line. Pat Borders followed with a single to left 
and Toronto led, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher gave up three consecutive hits -- by White, Alomar and Molitor -- and 
two runs in the ninth before giving way to Bill Sampen, who got an out after 
Carter's rocket to deep center ran out of fuel on the warning track. But Olerud 
singled and then rookie left fielder Carlos Delgado lined an opposite-field 
homer to left, his seventh of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, whose superb control is already almost legendary -- he walked just 
six while striking out 98 during the 1993 season at Wright State University -- 
was victimized by his lack of command and throwing accuracy in the third and 
seventh innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto scored the game's first run when Sprague led off the third with a 
walk, took third when Anderson's pick-off throw eluded Perez and scored on 
White's single to left. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out in the seventh, Anderson hit Alomar in the back and then almost 
started a brawl when he walked menacingly toward Alomar as Alomar glared at him 
on his way to first. 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar scored on Molitor's double to left and, after Carter struck out, Olerud 
sliced a line-drive double to left to drive in Molitor. Anderson got Delgado to 
ground to shortstop to end the inning.

FROST 'SETTLES' FOR A RECORD 61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Frost had visions of a 59, but settled for a Harbour Town-record 
10-under-par 61 during a second day of low scores and light wind in the 
Heritage Classic on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost had 10 birdies and no bogeys, and his 131 total left him one stroke in 
front of Jim McGovern and Larry Mize and two ahead of former Heritage winners 
Greg Norman and Hale Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it was Frost and other morning starters such as McGovern, Norman, 
Irwin and first-round co-leader Bob Estes who dominated the layout, still 
without its characteristic swirling gusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mize, who made eight birdies for a 65 and a 132 total, was the only one in the 
top five Friday to tee off in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Cochran shot a second 67 for a 134. Estes, Tom Lehman and Funk were four 
shots behind at 135. Estes and Funk shot 70 and Lehman 69. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the 15th hole, I thought about 59, but there were too many things going 
on for me to add it up," said Frost, whose lowest round on the PGA Tour was a 
60 at the 1988 Tucson Open.

GOLF / PGA SENIORS' CHAMPIONSHIP; MOWRY'S COMEBACK GETS A BIG LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday, when the wind and the treacherous back nine tortured the best senior 
golfers in the world, Larry Mowry resumed his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowry, practically missing from the Senior PGA Tour in recent years, leaped 
out of relative obscurity, posting a 68, the best score in the second round of 
the PGA Seniors' Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-under round gave Mowry a 36-hole total of 138, tying him with favored 
Raymond Floyd for the lead at six under. Floyd shot a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino (69), Dave Stockton (69) and Jim Colbert (71) were at 139 after 
surviving a wild afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,457-yard, par-36 second nine frustrated most of the 50-and-older group, 
especially Stockton. The 1993 player of the year was making a mockery of the 
back nine and had a two-stroke lead after birdies on four of the first five 
holes after making the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the water, which had already swallowed about 40 balls during the round, 
finally got Stockton. On the 412-yard, par-four 16th, he put consecutive 
approach shots into the drink and had a quadruple-bogey eight to drop to four 
under. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Stockton remained a jovial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an eagle and seven birdies, but all you circled was the eight," he said 
with a laugh. "I'm not at all upset because my putting is finally coming 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting the feeling that I could do anything when I took out the 
five-iron for a 170-yard shot. Both shots sailed out to the right. The first 
was a shock, because I never do that. Then I pulled out a four-iron, but missed 
a 15-foot putt for the eight." 
</P>
<P>
 That opened the door for Mowry, and he walked right in. And if he stays on his 
game, he could prove to be a good front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mowry joined the pro tour 35 years ago, he was a young man with talent. 
He was also a young man with a drinking habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous. It was too late to help 
him on the regular tour, but when he turned 50 in 1986, he became an instant 
success on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning more than $1 million in four years -- even before there was big 
money on the tour -- he woke up one morning feeling the same as he had in his 
drinking days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flopping around like I did when I was drinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was different. He had not had a drink for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowry learned he had vertigo, an inner-ear problem that caused him to lose his 
balance and depth perception. It was three years before it was discovered that 
allergies caused the problem. Last year Mowry, who won this tournament in 1989, 
began his comeback. It was temporarily interrupted by a hernia operation last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start out well this year, but I'm feeling great," he said. "To play 
this well on this tough course is a giant step forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Mowry missed birdie putts of eight, 15 and 12 feet on the front nine, and his 
25-footer on No. 8 hung on the lip. So he finished with a three-under 33. On 
the rugged back nine, he had birdies on 11 and 16, the two toughest holes.

 Outfielder Andy Van Slyke of the Pirates has this fantasy, he told Paul Meyer 
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:  
</P>
<P>
 "Some game, I'd like to make all 27 putouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't happen, of course. But I'd love to do that. I love making dashing,

 Hey, Chuck, since when are hot dogs cheap?

FORGET EVERETT, ROME'S COMMENT IS AN INSULT TO WOMEN IN SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it not surprising to find the "male jock mentality" so alive and well in 
the world of athletics? Jim Rome's labeling of former Ram quarterback Jim 
Everett as cowardly by nicknaming him "Chris" Everett is part of an 
all-too-familiar pattern. It characterizes male athletes as "weak" by referring 
to them as girls. In fact, The Times called the reference "an obvious affront 
to Everett's manhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The news media choose to focus upon the spectacle of the event without ever 
focusing on Rome's behavior as objectionably archaic and demeaning. I have 
coached female athletes for many years and have witnessed tremendous tenacity, 
courage, skill and commitment. The tennis playing "Chris" has impressed 
millions with her ability and her particularly tough attitude. Perhaps someday 
soon we may actually be able to say that the days of imagined male superiority 
and its attendant underlying male insecurity are truly a thing of the past.

<P>
 The underlying point that has been completely overlooked with regard to the 
Rome-Everett incident is the fact that Rome called Everett "Chris" to degrade 
him. As a high school teacher, it troubles me that this issue of men being 
degraded by being called a woman has not been addressed. In fact, it has been 
reinforced by this incident. Both of these men have a great impact on my 
students, male and female. 
</P>
<P>
 The media and people in the spotlight need to become aware of the impact they 
have on the youth of this country and work toward ending this type of sexist 
reinforcement. Both of these men should be so lucky to possess the athletic 
ability and class that Chris Evert does. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jim Rome was a real man, he would not call men "women" as a means to 
degrade. If Jim Everett was a real man, he would have said, "Thank you."

 You're now an example for my kids. I tell them not to be like Jim Everett when 
they grow up. Good riddance.

 They black-flagged people last season more than in any other year, but Mansell 
didn't get penalized once. 
</P>
<P>
 It continues this year. He spun two or three times in Australia, once under 
yellow, but everybody praised his determination. Last week at Phoenix, he lost 
it in the warm-up lane, and except for Scott Goodyear's heads-up driving, he 
would have caused an accident as he entered the racing line before the merge 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a blatant violation of the rules, but he was not penalized. It seems 
like they're constantly trying to hand this guy points on a silver platter. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Bobby Rahal, who said "Mansell's not God." I just wish the 
officials knew that.

MERCKER NO-HITS DODGERS: SO WHAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The report of the overpowering pitching performance by Kent Mercker overlooked 
the fact that the Dodgers were fielding a non-batting team. Five members of 
that Friday night lineup had not had a hit all season, and two more batters 
were below the Mendoza Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent pitched an excellent game, but he wasn't overpowering. You don't pitch a 
no-hitter with a fastball under 90 m.p.h. unless you're facing a wimp of a 
team. The Dodgers were lucky to get a hit all weekend.

 I attended the Kent Mercker no-hitter and watched in amazement the stream of 
departures, starting in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst was the gentleman who was walking up Aisle 136 in the bottom of 
the eighth inning. In response to my friend asking why he would want to leave a 
no-hitter early, he said, "Who wants to see a no-hitter?" Enough said.

HILGENBERG, 35, HAS ANGIOPLASTY AFTER SUFFERING MINOR HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former New Orleans Saint backup center Jay Hilgenberg had a minor heart 
attack, but after a procedure to clear clogged arteries, he "feels great," a 
suburban Chicago cardiologist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he will be back on the football field again is up to him, "but it 
would not be my recommendation," said Jay Alexander, a cardiologist treating 
Hilgenberg at Lutheran General Hospital in suburban Park Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilgenberg, 35, checked into Lake Forest Hospital on Monday when bothered by 
chest pains and nausea at his suburban Chicago home. He was admitted to 
Lutheran General on Thursday and underwent angioplasty, a non-surgical 
procedure to clear clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said Hilgenberg was recovering nicely, but said, "I think he's got 
some hard decisions to make." 
</P>
<P>
 He expected Hilgenberg to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilgenberg, a former Chicago Bear and seven-time Pro Bowl selection, felt 
chest pains last season while with the Saints. Doctors told him the pain was 
probably caused by a cartilage tear in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an unrestricted free agent.

NBA ROUNDUP; HORNETS' PLAYOFF HOPES DIMMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B.J. Armstrong's three-point basket with 4.5 seconds to play gave the Chicago 
Bulls an 88-85 victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night at Charlotte, 
N.C., putting a serious dent in the Hornets' postseason hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you make them, sometimes you don't," Armstrong said of his 
game-winning shot. "This just happened to be a game where I made one. I just 
happened to be at the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Bulls' 10th in a row, matching a season-high winning 
streak for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets, who had won five in a row, were in position to gain a game on the 
Miami Heat, who lead the Hornets by 2 1/2 games in the race for the final 
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 109, Miami 100 -- Mark Price scored 26 points and sparked a 14-2 
fourth-quarter run by the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami retained its hold on the eighth and last playoff spot in the conference 
despite its fourth consecutive loss and 11th in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 99, Denver 97 -- Jim Jackson's eight-foot jumper with 3.4 seconds to 
play gave the Mavericks a victory at Dallas, preventing the Nuggets from 
clinching a spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 103, Washington 90 -- Reserves Anthony Mason and Herb Williams scored 
all but two of the points in a 12-0 fourth-quarter run that lifted the Knicks 
at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing scored 24 points and Hubert Davis 18 for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 105, Milwaukee 96 -- Kevin Willis had 24 points and 18 rebounds and 
Danny Manning scored 23 points at Milwaukee to help the Hawks remain tied with 
the New York Knicks for the lead in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 113, Orlando 110 -- Dee Brown's two free throws gave the Celtics the 
lead for good with 1:08 to play in the second overtime at Boston, enabling 
Boston to win despite 42 points by the Magic's Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, held to seven points after the third quarter, missed three of four 
free throws in the final minute after Brown had made the score 110-109. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 130, Minnesota 112 -- Rik Smits scored 30 points at Minneapolis to 
lead the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller added 24 points as the Pacers recorded their 42nd victory, 
matching their second-best victory total since joining the NBA in 1976-77. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 119, Detroit 114 -- Kenny Anderson scored 12 of his career-high 45 
points in overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Nets handed the Pistons 
their eighth consecutive loss.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BRAVES ENJOY A RECORD-SETTING DAY IN ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred McGriff, Terry Pendleton and Tony Tarasco hit consecutive homers in the 
first inning and the Atlanta Braves scored the most runs in team history 
Friday, routing the Chicago Cubs, 19-5, at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves -- winning for the 10th time in 11 games -- hit five homers, had 24 
hits and set another club record with 46 total bases. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff, Pendleton and Tarasco hit their first-inning home runs against 
Anthony Young with the aid of a 24-m.p.h. wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton and Deion Sanders each had four runs batted in. Sanders and Ryan 
Klesko hit two-run homers in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come to this ballpark before with the wind blowing out and no one on the 
team has been able to hit the ball out," Pendleton said. "You just never know. 
I've played here with wind blowing out and hit ground balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta has twice scored 18 runs in a game, last September against Montreal 
and in 1973 against Pittsburgh. The Braves' 46 total bases were seven more than 
the previous Atlanta record and one shy of the franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Glavine (2-0) was an easy winner, giving up three hits in 5 2/3 innings. 
Glavine also had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 10, San Diego 6 -- Sore-wristed Gregg Jefferies had two home runs 
and five RBIs to help the Cardinals defeat the struggling Padres at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury won his third consecutive start for the Cardinals, who have won 
three in a row to tie the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Central lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres have lost six in a row and are 1-10 overall, the worst record in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferies, who sat out Thursday's game against the Dodgers after being hit by 
a pitch on his right wrist Wednesday night, said before the game that the 
injury was still bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
 But he hit a two-run homer in the third against Scott Sanders, doubled in the 
fourth and hit a three-run homer against A.J. Sager in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 9, Montreal 2 -- Ellis Burks, recording the second Rocky "first" in 
as many days, hit a two-run, inside-the-park homer to highlight the Rockies' 
victory at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after the Rockies got the first shutout victory in their history, 
Burks hit their first inside-the-park homer. 
</P>
<P>
 His sixth-inning hit caromed high off the right-field wall into the corner, 
and Burks easily beat the relay to the plate. Charlie Hayes, who had doubled, 
scored ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 6, Florida 0 -- Bill Swift of the Giants gave up six hits in 8 
2/3 innings at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift (2-1) retired 16 consecutive batters after Chuck Carr led off the 
Florida first with an infield hit. Carr was erased on a double play, and Swift 
didn't give up another hit until pinch-hitter Kurt Abbott's infield single with 
two out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift, who lowered his ERA to 0.42, struck out six and didn't walk a batter 
before leaving with two men on in the ninth. Dave Burba retired Benito Santiago 
on a fly to center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Jeff Juden, acquired in the off-season trade 
that sent Mitch Williams to the Houston Astros, limited the Reds to one hit in 
seven shutout innings at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Juden, making the fifth start of his career, lost his no-hit bid in the 
seventh when Hal Morris led off with a sharp single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Juden (1-1), relieved by Doug Jones after walking two hitters to start the 
eighth, struck out nine and walked four. Jones, also acquired in the Williams 
trade, finished for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 8, New York 1 -- Jeff Bagwell drove in four runs and Ken Caminiti hit 
a two-run homer for the Astros at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell and Steve Finley each hit solo homers for Houston to support a strong 
pitching performance by Doug Drabek (2-1), who limited the Mets to three hits 
in eight innings.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Clemens quieted critics with one of his best performances since early 
last season, giving up three hits in eight innings as the Boston Red Sox 
defeated the Chicago White Sox, 5-3, on Friday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens, who had a 10.13 earned-run average after two starts this year, has 
endured repeated choruses of "What's wrong with Roger?" since struggling 
through his worst season in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But against the White Sox, he gave up only one run, striking out six and 
walking one. He retired 14 in a row between Dan Pasqua's second-inning double 
and Frank Thomas' homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a guy pitches like that, you can't do anything but tip your hat," Thomas 
said. "The last couple of times we faced him (last year), he didn't throw as 
hard as he did tonight. He was hitting his spots with hard gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (1-0), a winner in only six of his previous 23 starts, was in trouble 
only in the seventh when Thomas led off with his fourth home run of the season 
down the right-field line. With two out, Pasqua hit a shot to right-center 
field that Otis Nixon caught about three feet above the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Franco hit a two-run homer, his fourth, in the Chicago ninth against 
Greg Harris. Jeff Russell got one out for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Naehring hit his second home run of the season and Nixon had a run-scoring 
single in the second for the Red Sox, who are unbeaten in four games at Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 9, Milwaukee 1 -- Randy Johnson pitched a four-hitter and struck out 
11 at Seattle for his first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson (1-1), who won 19 games last season and led the majors in strikeouts, 
walked one in his first complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson hit Matt Mieske with a fastball in the batting helmet in the eighth 
and immediately rushed to the plate to see if Mieske was all right. Mieske 
stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Buhner and Rich Amaral hit home runs for the Mariners. Ken Griffey Jr. hit 
a bases-loaded triple during a six-run fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 8, Baltimore 3 -- Rick Helling earned his first major league victory and 
became the first Texas starter to win this season, pitching the Rangers past 
the Orioles at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Canseco homered and drove in three runs and Dean Palmer hit a two-run 
double for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Helling (1-0) gave up three runs and five hits in 7 2/3 innings. He struck out 
three and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 7, Detroit 5 -- Danny Tartabull and Paul O'Neill hit two-run homers 
and Jim Leyritz had a solo shot for the Yankees at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Melido Perez (1-0) held Detroit to three runs and seven hits in six innings 
and Steve Howe followed with two scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 7-3, the Tigers loaded the bases with no out in the ninth. 
Pinch-hitter Junior Felix struck out on a 3-2 pitch that bounced, but Tony 
Phillips hit a two-run single against Xavier Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Hitchcock retired Lou Whitaker on a popup and Jeff Reardon got 
pinch-hitter Eric Davis on a fly ball for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Oakland 7 -- Kent Hrbek hit his first home run of the season and 
the Twins again knocked around Todd Van Poppel at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrbek had three hits and scored three times. He led off the ninth with a home 
run for an 8-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Javier's run-scoring single with two out in the ninth finished Carl 
Willis. Ruben Sierra greeted Rick Aguilera with his fifth homer, a two-run 
shot. Aguilera, however, struck out Geronimo Berroa with the tying run at 
second for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 2, Cleveland 1 -- David Cone gave up five hits in eight innings 
and Greg Gagne doubled home the go-ahead run in the eighth at Cleveland with 
his first hit of the season.

 Disqualified in the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start, The Wicked North 
will have 11 opponents when he runs in the $750,000 Oaklawn Handicap today at 
Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Ark.

 Jim Edmonds' performance at first base Thursday night might have earned him a 
few extra at-bats this year. Edmonds, whose role was supposed to be 
pinch-hitting and providing relief for center fielder Chad Curtis and right 
fielder Tim Salmon, started the game in center.But he was moved to first -- a 
position he hasn't played since 1991 -- when Eduardo Perez sprained his left 
shoulder during his fourth-inning at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds made a nice play in the sixth when he stabbed a shot over the bag off 
the bat of Toronto's Carlos Delgado, spun and fired to second to get the lead 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty nervous for the first couple of hitters," Edmonds said. "I just 
wanted to be solid, not spectacular. The play (on Delgado) was just reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to think a lot more on the infield. In the outfield, 
everything's in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds was impressive enough that Manager Buck Rodgers said he wouldn't have 
made a roster move if Perez had to sit out four or five days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perez took batting practice Friday and declared himself fit to play, but said 
he had some doubts Thursday night. "It killed," he said. "It was a sharp pain, 
but it's all right now. It's nothing that will stop me from swinging the same 
way." . . . Left-hander Joe Magrane, on a rehabilitation assignment with the 
Angels' Class-A affiliate in Lake Elsinore, pitched 4 2/3 innings Friday night, 
giving up four hits and two earned runs with two strikeouts and three walks. 
Magrane underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery on Feb. 8. JOHN WEYLER

TEACHER SENTENCED FOR INVESTMENT SCAM; COURT: STANLEY GORDON WILL SERVE THREE 
YEARS IN A WORK-FURLOUGH PROGRAM. HE BILKED COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS OUT OF 
$225,000.

<P>
 A popular high school jewelry teacher was sentenced Friday to three years in a 
prison work-furlough program for swindling students and colleagues out of more 
than $225,000 in a bogus gold refinement scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Gordon, 54, avoided the gaze of his former friends Friday as they 
denounced him in court as a liar and thief who stole their life savings to 
support a lavish lifestyle that included giving cars as gifts and staying in 
$4,000-a-night hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all bald-faced lies," said Victor Cook of Corona del Mar, who told the 
judge that Gordon took $8,000 from him and another $65,000 from Cook's 
bedridden mother, Sophia Cook, who is now penniless and cannot afford the 
nursing care she needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about an extreme psychopath," Cook said, raising his voice as 
he stared at Gordon during the sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Young, 58, of Long Beach, told Superior Court Judge William R. Froeberg 
that he may never be able to retire because he gave Gordon nearly $70,000 -- 
wiping out his pension fund. Young said the former Santa Ana High School 
jewelry teacher persuaded him and others that the gold investment scheme was 
legitimate by returning some initial profits on their investments -- before 
asking them for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know now it was all a scam," Young said. "I'd like to see his future as 
bad as mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon pleaded guilty last month to 46 felony counts of defrauding 11 men and 
women, many of whom lost their life savings. Prosecutors say he told unwitting 
investors they were guaranteed profits through a plan to buy used or scrap gold 
at low prices, refine it, and sell it for higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, prosecutors believe Gordon took about $750,000 from his colleagues and 
students, many of whom were taking Gordon's jewelry-making class as a hobby or 
to learn a new trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Gordon used the money to pay for a lifestyle that included 
worldwide travel, expensive gifts and only the best accommodations. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. William L. Overtoom told the judge that Gordon violated the trust 
and respect that society gives its teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask the court to consider what lessons the students have learned from Mr. 
Gor don," Overtoom said. "He has shattered that trust and confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Froeberg sentenced Gordon to three years in a Los Angeles restitution center, 
a relatively new program for nonviolent offenders. He will work during the day 
and spend his nights and weekends in prison, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of Gordon's salary will pay the costs of incarceration, a third will 
go to his victims and a third will be held for Gordon until his release, 
Overtoom said. It is not clear what job Gordon will perform, the prosecutor 
said, adding that he has little hope the victims will ever get all their money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert D. Coviello told the judge that his client is sorry 
and is now broke, although many of the victims on Friday accused the teacher of 
having money stashed abroad in Europe, where he was traveling before his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Coviello said his client was also a victim of another man 
who made off with Gordon's -- and everyone else's money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any intent for this to happen at all," Coviello said, adding 
that his client has lost his wife, career and financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 Froeberg told the victims in the courtroom that he felt constrained by 
sentencing limitations in the case and would like to have given the teacher a 
longer sentence and made him pay back more money. But the judge said legal 
restrictions required him to craft a short prison time coupled with a 
restitution requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there were something I could do to get your money back for you," the 
judge told the victims.

5 FIREFIGHTERS RECEIVE TERMINATION NOTICES; INVESTIGATION: WESTMINSTER 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL INSTITUTE CHANGES IN OVERTIME AND OTHER POLICIES TO 
PREVENT ANY FUTURE ABUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Five firefighters face dismissal after a recent independent report found what 
city officials called a widespread abuse of overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, policy changes affecting overtime, vacation and sick leave will 
be instituted in the Fire Department, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not let the effort go to waste," Mayor Charles V. Smith said Friday, 
following a three-hour special council session to discuss the report's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month review of Fire Department payroll practices by the auditing firm 
of KPMG Peat Marwick concluded that loopholes in the system, including lax 
reporting policies, allowed department employees to incur $4.8 million in 
overtime pay over a seven-year period, beginning in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not release the names of the employees facing termination, but a 
lawyer for the firefighters union said that Fire Capt. Mike Garrison was among 
those who received termination notices Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice from Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. ordered Garrison and four 
other employees to appear before Assistant City Manager Don Anderson April 25 
and 26 to answer the allegations against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing policy, however, DeMonaco did not say what the allegations were. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alan C. Davis, the firefighters' attorney, said that Garrison is accused 
of failing to provide documentation for leaves he took between 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison, a 19-year veteran and union director, was suspended in January for 
alleging publicly that cuts in the Fire Department were responsible for a fatal 
fire early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a continuation of the vicious effort to slander outstanding members 
of the Westminster Fire Department," Davis said. He added that city officials 
are retaliating for the firefighters' support of a recall drive against Smith 
and three other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gilbrook, the union president, was fired after city officials said he 
drove a firetruck while his driver's license was suspended and improperly used 
sick leave. He has appealed the firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Garrison appeared before a city panel doing a separate 
investigation into the sick leave, vacation leave and holiday pay billings in 
the Fire Department. The three-person panel headed by labor relations 
consultant Alan Atlas also questioned seven other employees, including three 
battalion chiefs. That panel has not yet issued its report. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that more firefighters are likely to be investigated and 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will take all disciplinary action based on the report," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the auditors found that from 1986 to 1993, (complete records were 
not available for 1988), the firefighters charged 21,000 hours of overtime 
without city-required documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a practice called "double shift trades," 5,000 hours of overtime were 
paid to Fire Department employees who worked someone else's shift -- for 
overtime -- but not their own shift, according to the auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis responded in a letter to the City Council that the practice is common in 
fire departments across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman said: "All reasonable people will realize 
that what has been going on for many years was wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 Bohman and Councilmen Tony Lam and Craig Schweisinger also are the targets of 
a June 7 recall vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said that the auditors' report was "replete with false statements 
and innuendoes with conclusions that are built upon false statements." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that except for DeMonaco and the employee who keeps records in the 
Fire Department, the auditors did not talk to the employees while preparing the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones said that the city would probably wait for the 
results of an investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office 
before deciding whether to file a civil lawsuit against the firefighters to 
recover money. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that if the district attorney files criminal charges against the 
firefighters that result in a conviction, the judge could order the money to be 
paid back to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the D.A. does not file charges, the city has the option to file a civil 
lawsuit," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters union has filed a civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court 
against several city officials, and Davis said the dismissal notices will 
become a part of that suit.

POINTE WELL-TAKEN; LAS PALMAS STUDENTS JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO LEARN BALLET 
BASICS -- AND ELEGANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Few Las Palmas Elementary School students have been exposed to classical 
dance, and seldom are they told that they are princes or princesses. Most come 
from impoverished households, some with only one parent, and others are still 
mastering English. 
</P>
<P>
 But every Thursday, a group of them give up their lunch period, study hall or 
gym class to learn to respect their innate elegance and stand tall like 
royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 students from the San Clemente school take one of two weekly 
45-minute ballet classes taught by Larry Rosenberg, a dance instructor at UC 
Irvine and an artistic director of the Coast Ballet Theatre in San Clemente, 
who conducts classes at the school for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful opportunity for our kids," said school Principal Doug 
Kramer, who added that because the school has no dance teacher, few students 
had ever experienced classical dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-, fourth- and fifth-grade students line up in rows, take off their 
sneakers, then follow Rosenberg's lively instruction. "Show me your toes, 
pointed hard!" he called out, dressed in sweat pants, a T-shirt and dance 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids, in their jeans or shorts and without a mirror or bar, learn some of 
the simpler ballet positions. After warm-ups of plies and stretches, they learn 
jumps and moves like the saute, ronde de jambe, glissade and pas de chat. 
Rosenberg, 43, accompanied by classical music from a portable stereo, says: "Up 
and back, go, stretch!" 
</P>
<P>
 He said he teaches the class as if he were teaching a ballet company, 
discouraging slouching, laziness and sloppy posture. "The natural elegance is 
inborn, you just have to ask it of yourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they are dancing, he encourages them to hold their heads up and push 
themselves, and the strain of that is both welcome and challenging to the 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the novice dancers' faces strained with effort as they displayed their 
tenuous grasp of the grace the moves require. One boy laughingly whimpered, 
"Ow, ow, ow!" when he sat with his legs open on the floor, stretching. "This is 
torture!" he cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Often Rosenberg asks students who feel they have mastered a jump to come to 
the front of the class and show it off. About 15 students eagerly waved their 
hands Thursday to volunteer. Two of them demonstrated so much promise in 
previous classes that Rosenberg offered them scholarships to the Coast Ballet 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquita Taylor and Ian Chambers, both 10, go there every Friday. "You get to 
do a lot of neat things and stuff," Chambers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor added: "The teacher is good at it. I like how he does the jumps." 
</P>
<P>
 As the class ended, the students were reluctant to leave. "It's very nice and 
it's a little bit hard, doing the splits and jumping," said Nelson Dena, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the class was over, Melissa Calvillo's bangs were plastered to her 
forehead with sweat. "I like it, but I don't know why," she said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg began volunteering at the school in January, after getting such an 
enthusiastic reaction to a performance there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes a big difference in their lives. For many of them, being 
told to stand like a prince or a princess and hold their bodies erect creates a 
feeling about themselves that they may not otherwise experience," and it lets 
them discover "an inborn royalty which we all have."  
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's class, Rosenberg said, "I'm always surprised by their 
enthusiasm and how much they remember." He said he had not worked with the 
students for several weeks because they had just returned from school vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 But upon returning, "you just see their eyes light up," he said, adding that 
having an appreciation of what it does for them is what keeps him coming back.

U.S. OPENS PROBE INTO DEPUTY DEATH; INQUIRY: OFFICIALS ARE GATHERING EVIDENCE 
TO WEIGH WHETHER OFFICER BROKE FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTE IN SHOOTING OF 
COLLEAGUE. COUNTY GRAND JURY REFUSED TO INDICT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 One month after an Orange County grand jury refused to issue a criminal 
indictment, federal officials have stepped in to review the Christmas Day 
shooting of a veteran sheriff's deputy by a fellow officer during a training 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether grounds exist to indict 
Deputy Brian P. Scanlan under federal criminal civil rights law, department 
spokesman Myron Marlin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, launched in Washington, will try to determine whether Scanlan was 
simply negligent or intended to harm his fellow officer, Deputy Darryn Leroy 
Robins, 30, who died of head wounds inflicted by a single gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 The review may answer criticism from Orange County minority groups who have 
insisted that the district attorney's office was too close to the Sheriff's 
Department to fairly investigate the volatile case. These critics have also 
questioned whether race played a part in the shooting because Robins was black 
and Scanlan is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups had prodded the Justice Department to look into the case 
after the grand jury made a rare rejection March 10 of a prosecutor's request: 
a manslaughter indictment against Scanlan. The district attorney's office, 
which conducted the investigation, said the 32-year-old deputy was "grossly 
negligent" in training with a loaded weapon during an impromptu exercise that 
led up to the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the two deputies were running through a mock car-stop behind a 
Lake Forest movie theater, with Robins playing the suspect and Scanlan the 
arresting officer. Scanlan maintained in an interview with investigators that 
he shot Robins accidentally after he was startled to see him pull a handgun 
from the visor of his car. Robins was apparently imitating a technique used by 
gang members to get the drop on police. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin said FBI agents have been dispatched to gather evidence weighing 
whether Scanlan broke a federal statute that bars anyone from depriving a 
person of his civil rights. But to lodge such a charge, officials would have to 
demonstrate that the deputy intended to harm Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors were skeptical whether that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three days of testimony and 14 witnesses, the Orange County Grand Jury 
was unwilling to indict for aggravated, reckless and grossly negligent 
behavior. So is it likely the feds will indict? I don't think so," Assistant 
Dist. Atty. John D. Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan and his attorney, James B. Stotler, could not be reached for comment. 
Undersheriff Raul Ramos said his department will cooperate with the federal 
investigation, but he said the FBI and other federal officials have not 
notified them formally about the review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, this thing has lingered on and on," Ramos said. "My heart goes 
out to the families of the affected officers as it gets prolonged into another 
investigation. On the other hand, the facts are pretty straightforward and 
there's nothing to hide. So if somebody else looks into it, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of various community groups praised the Justice Department's decision 
to review the case, arguing that federal investigators will have a more 
independent perspective than the district attorney's office, which often works 
with the Sheriff's Department on criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way uneasiness will be laid to rest," said Amin David, a 
Latino activist with Los Amigos of Orange County, who met with members of the 
grand jury weeks ago to discuss this and other cases of minority interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene M. Wheeler, president of the civic group 100 Black Men of Orange 
County, said the federal investigation probably would have been unnecessary had 
local authorities investigated the incident in a more open fashion in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have prevented all this embarrassment," said Wheeler, whose group 
has consistently complained about the process. "They should do their job. Their 
explanation was not satisfactory as to why the case went to the grand jury when 
the district attorney indicated that charges should have been filed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the local investigation, prosecutors relied heavily on information provided 
by Scanlan. They say there were no other witnesses to the shooting, because two 
other deputies on the scene were waiting around a corner for their turn to run 
through the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 To seek a federal indictment, prosecutors will have to demonstrate that the 
shooting was something more than a tragic accident, a premise that will be 
difficult to prove. Minority leaders acknowledge that they have no evidence 
that race played a part in the killing, or in the way authorities handled the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 And in hundreds of pages of investigative files released by the district 
attorney's office last month, there was little or no evidence produced to 
suggest the shooting was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at 
Loyola Marymount University Law School, said that federal civil rights actions 
are generally rare and difficult to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're either going to have to show a conspiracy or show the officer acted 
intentionally," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 She added that federal investigators have the advantage of distance and 
independence in reviewing a controversial local matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They serve the purpose of letting people know there's been a fair 
investigation by people who don't have a particular interest," Levenson said. 
"People should know that just because they've opened an investigation does not 
mean they're marching toward an indictment."

SHEET MUSIC'S AN 'AMAZING GIFT'; CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY GETS COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving away 500 pieces of sheet music written for clarinet, oboe, bassoon, 
French horn and flute wasn't exactly George Waln's idea. It was, he said, 
Father Time's. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get to be 90, you have to think about the future," said the 
woodwinds virtuoso, who has taught, performed and composed for more than 50 
years. As Waln and his wife of 36 years, Elsa, prepared to move from Leisure 
World in Laguna Hills to a smaller retirement home, Elsa realized they had to 
take inventory and give up some possessions to save space. 
</P>
<P>
 So two weeks ago, Waln donated his sheet music collection, worth about 
$15,000, to Chapman University in Orange. The George Waln Woodwind Library -- a 
room in the school's music library where Waln's sheet music is displayed -- may 
be one of the country's most extensive single collections of solo and ensemble 
pieces covering that instrumental category, Chapman officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing gift," said John Koshak, Chapman's orchestra conductor. 
"There are 107 woodwind quintets. . . . There are solos, duets, trios, quartets 
and choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other schools were after it. We're real privileged."

 Waln said it was difficult to give up the essence of a career that spanned 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's putting it mildly," he said. "Such great nostalgia, but I knew I had 
to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Several universities, including Oberlin's Conservatory of Music and the 
University of Maryland, sent hopeful letters of request for Waln's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Waln said he chose Chapman because he has a strong friendship with Koshak, 
noting that it was also more practical to have the music picked up and taken to 
the nearby campus than to box it up and ship it away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waln taught music at Oberlin College's Conservatory of Music from 1929 until 
1969, spending summers teaching in Idaho, Arizona, California, Oregon, Iowa and 
New York, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired to California, but taught part time at USC until 1972 before 
retiring again and moving from Glendale to Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshak, who said he knew of Waln as "one of the major figures in music," since 
his own student days in the 1950s, asked him to teach part time at Chapman. 
Waln's third teaching stint lasted from 1973 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would ask me why I worked so hard," Waln said. "Every place is a new 
experience, a new environment. It wasn't work. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Morrison, who majored in music education at Chapman from 1973-79 and 
became a soloist with the college orchestra under Waln's tutelage, said that 
Waln had a special rapport with students. He invited them to his home and 
played group pieces with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Waln visited Morrison in Delano, where his former student now teaches 
woodwinds to elementary schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Waln "can still play a whole page in one breath," Morrison said. "I still 
can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Laguna Hills home, Waln flipped through a stack of photos of former 
students, remembering their names and where they went. "This fellow," he said, 
pointing to one photo, "conducts a symphony orchestra in Akron." 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed out his 1935 Oberlin student quintet, which performed at a 
musical convention at New York's Metropolitan Opera House, and a treasured copy 
of a huge anthology dedicated to him by Instrumentalist magazine, for which he 
wrote 66 articles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waln said he doesn't perform much anymore, though playbills of two 
performances for community groups in the past two months lay on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly displayed a large B-flat clarinet resting in its case. His career 
began more than 80 years ago, he said, when he took his father's clarinet from 
the closet while his father was out farming corn in the Iowa fields. Waln 
eventually took up all the woodwinds but still favors the clarinet most. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have to keep practicing," he said, "though, at my age, learning 
new things is harder."

D.A. CONSIDERS POSSIBLE CHARGES IN BOY'S SUICIDE; SHOOTING: THE 10-YEAR-OLD 
KILLED HIMSELF IN A SCHOOLYARD WITH A PISTOL BELONGING TO HIS FATHER. 
PROSECUTORS ARE ANALYZING WHETHER THE PARENT CAN BE CHARGED BECAUSE THE WEAPON 
WAS ACCESSIBLE TO A MINOR. 
</P>

 The district attorney's office is deciding whether to file charges against the 
father of the 10-year-old boy who shot himself to death in a South-Central Los 
Angeles schoolyard after being suspended from class for misbehavior, police 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol that Jorge Lisea Jr. used to wound 
himself fatally belonged to his father, Jorge Lisea Sr., according to 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the boy had found the weapon hidden beneath a mattress, then loaded 
it with ammunition that was stored separately, on the top shelf of a bedroom 
dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Children's Firearms Protection Act, which took effect in 1992, an 
adult can face up to three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine for keeping 
a loaded weapon that is accessible to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's office is taking a look at that, and analyzing the 
case, to see if there is enough there to press charges," said Detective John 
Garcia of the Los Angeles Police Department's Newton Street station. "They 
won't have an answer until sometime next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the father has told police that he was investigated by the LAPD 
four or five years ago for possibly abusing the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it had any relevance in this case," the detective said. "He 
didn't beat the child; it was more of a one-strike type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The detective said he has not yet determined whether there was a child abuse 
investigation, or what its outcome might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he does not believe that the child was driven to suicide by fear 
of punishment from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said a teacher at the 49th Street Elementary School suspended the boy 
on Tuesday, reportedly for using profane language in a fifth-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Lemuel Chavis said the boy was sent home with a note that asked his 
parents to come with him to school on Wednesday to discuss the problem. Garcia 
said the father told him the boy never mentioned the incident or showed him the 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the boy apparently stashed the pistol in his backpack before his 
father drove him to school Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 a.m., as his fellow students filed past him at the front door of 
the school, the sobbing boy pulled out the pistol, pressed it to his temple and 
pulled the trigger, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than four hours of surgery at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center, the boy never regained consciousness. On Thursday afternoon, moments 
after he was removed from life-support systems, he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do I think he did it?" Garcia asked. "I've spoken to the teacher briefly, 
and I think the boy was upset about being suspended. . . . That was his 
behavior when he got in trouble, he'd go home crying, upset. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to his father, his mother, his older brother, they're all telling 
me the same thing," Garcia said. "They don't understand why. If anything, 
they're blaming the pressure school puts on a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, the school principal, said Wednesday it was difficult for him to 
believe that the note from the school was sufficient to create the sort of 
anxiety that would lead to suicide, "unless there was something else bothering 
him in his personal life or home life." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Navarro, a lawyer representing the family, reacted strongly Friday to 
Chavis' statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is solely concerned about liability," Navarro said. "They are 
least concerned about the truth. They are least concerned about the grieving 
process that this family is going through. (Those are) nothing but speculations 
on their part that (there are) problems going on at home."

STRATTON'S WAIT FOR A RULING ON AUDITOR'S RACE CONTINUES; JURISPRUDENCE: THE 
SIMI MAYOR FILES HIS APPEAL ASKING THE STATE HIGH COURT TO OVERTURN A LOWER 
DECISION REMOVING HIM FROM THE BALLOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton will have to wait until Monday to find out if 
the state Supreme Court will consider overturning a judge's ruling to remove 
him from the Ventura County auditor's race because he lacks the educational 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton filed an appeal with the high court Friday morning and was hoping to 
have an answer by the afternoon. But by 5 p.m. when the court closed for the 
day there was still no word. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like sitting on death row and the governor hasn't called," 
Stratton said. "On the other hand he hasn't not called. So I don't know if 
they're going to execute me or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county election officials gave the go-ahead Friday to start 
printing sample ballots without Stratton's name in order to meet a 
state-mandated deadline for mailing samples to voters before the June 7 
election. The printer, situated in the city of Exeter in Central California, 
started working on the ballots immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't wait any longer," said Robert R. Orellana, assistant county counsel. 
County election officials planned to begin mailing ballots out to voters for 
review by April 28 to meet the state's May 16 deadline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Printing of the sample ballots has already been delayed a week because of the 
Stratton case. Because there are 18 ballots that must be sent to more than 
350,000 registered voters in seven areas of the county, officials will barely 
meet the deadline, Orellana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Supreme Court changes the appeal court ruling on Monday it could cost 
us money (to print new sample ballots)," Orellana said. "But if they need more 
time it could cost us a special election." 
</P>
<P>
 County elections officials estimate that a special election would cost the 
county about $400,000, about $1.12 per registered voter, Orellana said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Ventura refused to overturn 
Superior Court Judge William Peck's ruling disqualifying Stratton from the 
auditor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck ruled that Stratton's master's degree in business administration from Cal 
Lutheran University does not qualify him for the auditor's job because it was 
not earned at an accounting school. William Baker, a certified public 
accountant and one of five other candidates for the auditor's job, filed a 
lawsuit challenging Stratton's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for county auditor, state law dictates that a candidate must either 
be a certified public accountant, have served as county auditor-controller or 
deputy auditor for at least three years, or possess a certificate or diploma 
from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no longer any schools of accountancy in California, Stratton 
has argued that his master's degree in business administration -- including 14 
units in accounting -- should be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Peck said while Stratton might have a strong background in 
accounting and business administration, he nevertheless did not meet the 
literal requirements for the job as outlined in the 1957 law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton and his attorney Tom Wise, saying they believed the courts are 
still wrestling over the interpretation of the law, cited a similar case in 
Santa Barbara in which the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that a legal 
challenge to a mayoral candidate's qualifications had to occur after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll just have to wait and see," Stratton said. "Right now I'm the 
maybe candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the county's decision to start printing sample ballots, Stratton said 
he did not understand the rush since the deadline for getting them to the 
public is May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sent out mailers throughout the entire city of Simi Valley in three 
days," he said. "It seems to me the county is rushing to print the ballots at 
the risk of (spending more) taxpayer money. That doesn't seem real 
cost-conscious" 
</P>
<P>
 The Stratton case has some county employees working overtime. Orellana, with 
the county counsel's office, said he was in his office at the Ventura County 
Government Center until 1 a.m. Friday preparing documents in the case for the 
state Supreme Court to review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the office at 1:15 a.m., went home and changed and then went to the 
hospital to help my wife deliver a baby at 5 a.m.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about the Supreme Court," Orellana said. "It was a great day for 
me."

CITY COUNCIL TO REVIEW CLOSURE OF POLI STREET; VENTURA: COMMITTEE REPORT 
RECOMMENDS BARRICADES REMAIN IN PLACE AND SPEED BUMPS BE ADDED TO OTHER ROADS 
TO DISCOURAGE DETOURING TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Student safety versus traffic concerns will be debated Monday when the Ventura 
City Council discusses whether to continue blocking off Poli Street at Ventura 
High School to protect students. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders are scheduled to hear a report from a committee headed by Mayor 
Tom Buford, which concludes that the east-west artery should remain closed 
during school hours. But the report also recommends that speed bumps be 
installed on nearby streets to discourage detouring traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to come up with a compromise," Buford said. "It's a tough issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted in August to close Poli during school hours, but directed a 
committee to look at alternatives after neighbors complained that the closure 
pushed hundreds of detouring cars into their hillside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Barricades were installed on Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive to discourage 
detouring motorists. Hillside residents are unhappy with that solution, 
however, fearing they will have trouble getting in and out of their homes 
quickly in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now residents are upset about the committee's speed bump compromise, which 
they say will not solve the problem. They are continuing to push for reopening 
Poli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone on the hill will raise Cain about (the speed bumps)," said Jack 
Biller, a hillside resident who sat on the committee. "I don't think they 
should do it. They're unsafe, and they cause wrecks." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff acknowledged that it is generally against city policy to install 
speed bumps because of the increased liability and potential for accidents that 
they cause. Each speed bump would cost about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are fighting to keep the street closed, saying student safety 
is more important and that noise from the cars disrupts classroom instruction. 
Students have testified in front of council members, saying they fear drive-by 
shootings and pedestrian accidents. Studies have shown that every day, more 
than 5,000 students cross the street -- which bisects the campus -- between 
classes and before and after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides for an extremely unsafe situation and the noise is unbearable," 
said Helena Torres-Reaves, vice principal at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Large crowds from both sides are expected to lobby for their cause Monday. But 
whatever action -- if any -- the council takes on Monday may be overturned in 
November by an initiative that hillside residents are trying to get on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is divided on the issue, but a majority said they are not ready to 
implement the committee's recommendation to put in speed bumps instead of the 
barricades at Palomar and Sunset. Many said they wanted to study the issue 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a big fan of speed bumps," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, who favors 
keeping Poli closed. "I think it's dangerous and it's a nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan said they are sympathetic to the 
homeowners' concerns, and Councilmen Steve Bennett and Greg Carson said they 
have not yet decided how they will vote on the issue. Mayor Buford said he is 
not inclined to follow his committee's recommendation if a significant number 
of hillside residents object to speed bumps. Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members are proposing other solutions, such as keeping Poli closed 
only during class breaks and lunchtime, or building a pedestrian overpass over 
Poli. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether Poli should be closed has come before the council in 
1974, 1991, 1992 and 1993. In 1974, Poli was closed for a two-week trial period 
and reopened after hillside residents complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue will not be resolved," Buford said. "Every time we have new 
council members and every year when school opens, council members will be put 
to the test."

WILDLIFE WATER TANK VANDALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High above Simi Valley on Rocky Peak, two members of Quail Unlimited surveyed 
the damage to their latest project, a 1,000-gallon water tank for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the tank they installed in February was vandalized during the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the water dribbled into the surrounding hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Taylor, county chairman of the group, held the lid to the drink box, a 
metal container where larger animals get water, and looked down at its severed 
hinges. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just broke it off," he said. "There's just no reason. Seems like they 
were just doing it to be spiteful." 
</P>
<P>
 Quail Unlimited, a group of hunters and conservationists, has built a dozen of 
these ingenious drinking fountains around the county, most of them in Los 
Padres National Forest. This is the first time members have seen such 
destructive vandalism at one of their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank is made from the same simple design that ranchers and farmers have 
been using for the past century. Called guzzlers, they are commonly built in 
dry areas to benefit wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 A hole is dug, and wooden forms are placed inside to shape the sides and 
barrel-vaulted top. Then cement is poured in to create the underground tank. 
One side slants up, so animals can walk down into the tank to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing water sources for wildlife is the top priority for Quail Unlimited, 
a national organization with more than 100 members in its Ventura County 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 As an environmental group, Quail Unlimited has rather unlikely origins. It was 
formed by hunters to preserve the habitat of the small birds that hunters 
pursue with dogs and guns. Membership -- 99% male in Ventura County -- tends to 
grow in leaps and bounds after each local gun show. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of its members find anything incongruous about the idea of hunters 
building drinking fountains for wildlife. They seem drawn to Quail Unlimited 
largely as a way to get outside and hang out with the guys while making life a 
little easier for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Bill Ingenito has been with the group three years, though he 
has hunted since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first project I went up on, I just thought it was kind of nice to be out 
there doing something constructive instead of shooting the place up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New recruit Ray Pomada, also of Ventura, learned about the group at a recent 
gun show. 
</P>
<P>
 He described himself as a hunter, but not "an avid hunter." His reason for 
joining was simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to take care of the birds," Pomada said with a shrug. "I do it for the 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Taylor has hunted only once in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in this because I'm an environmentalist," Taylor said. "If you want to 
put something back into the environment, this is the only group around here 
that specializes in restoring habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 At monthly membership meetings, the focus is usually on guzzlers; where to put 
them and how to maintain existing ones. Using annual dues, grants and matching 
funds from the U. S. Forest Service, the group can afford to install about 
three guzzlers a year. They work closely with park rangers to choose locations. 
</P>
<P>
 George Garcia, a biologist with the Ojai Ranger District, said the group's 
assistance has become critical as budget cuts hit the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty valuable piece of labor that they provide us with," he 
said. "They spend their entire Saturdays sometimes helping me out. They're out 
to help quail, but the work they do benefits all wildlife, maybe even the 
bigger species more than the birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Guzzlers are particularly important in water-scarce Southern California, 
Garcia said. Since so much of Ventura County flatlands -- where streams and 
creeks run -- have been settled, the wildlife that retreats to the hills often 
has to look hard for water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The project in Simi Valley is not within Forest Service jurisdiction, so Quail 
Unlimited won't get matching funds for it. Total costs for putting in a guzzler 
are usually about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After ripping off the lid, someone filled the drink box with rocks, causing 
the water to overflow, and destroying the valve that leads to the main tank of 
the guzzler. Normally the valve serves as a slow stopper, allowing levels to 
rise slowly as animals drink from the box. Without it, all the water from the 
main tank drains out. The damage could cost as much as $600 to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 That cost includes driving in a water truck to refill the tank, which upsets 
both Mike Taylor and Eric Taylor, the group's unrelated conservation committee 
chairman. They were careful to bring the heavy truck in during February, so the 
grasses and plants they disturbed would have time to recover before the heat of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're going to have to drive through the meadow again it'll probably be 
trashed for a year," Eric Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 By next year, assuming there is no drought, the tank will refill itself with 
rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dozen guzzlers installed by Quail Unlimited are in spots 
inaccessible to people. They don't like to advertise the spots for fear that 
people they call "slob-hunters" will come and take advantage of easy prey. 
</P>
<P>
 No hunting is allowed on Rocky Peak, but the Rocky Peak site is well-traveled 
by hikers and bikers. It was selected largely to promote gene mixing between 
the animals that live on either side of the Simi Valley Freeway. A tunnel under 
the freeway, built for sheep, allows animals to get through. A new water source 
on the other side should encourage healthy mixing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was another reason for choosing the Simi Valley spot: so people as 
well as animals could enjoy it, giving residents a chance to view deer, 
coyotes, birds and other wildlife as they drink from the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an experiment the group might not be able to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's accessible, they'll screw it up," said Ingenito, shaking his head. 
FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Quail Unlimited welcomes anyone interested in attending their meetings, which 
are held on the second Monday of each month. Meetings begin at 7:30 p.m. in the 
office of the Ventura County superintendent of schools, 5189 Verdugo Way, 
Camarillo. For information, call Mike Taylor at 482-5177.

ASSEMBLY BID TO SLOW CHEMICAL PHASEOUT DIES; AGRICULTURE: OXNARD REPUBLICAN'S 
RESOLUTION IS REJECTED. FARMERS FEAR EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES ARE NOT BEING 
DEVELOPED FAST ENOUGH.

<P>
 An Assembly resolution to aid strawberry growers using methyl bromide failed 
this week, but it called attention to the debate over the planned phaseout of 
the fumigant, Assemblyman Nao Takasugi's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution by the Oxnard Republican urged the federal government to slow 
the phaseout of methyl bromide, which has been identified as a potential 
ozone-depleting agent. 
</P>
<P>
 A toxic gas that purges fields of disease and insects before crops are 
planted, methyl bromide will be outlawed nationwide in 2001. Some farmers, 
however, worry that scientists are not developing cheap and effective 
alternatives fast enough to replace the widely used gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite arguments from farm lobbyists, Takasugi's colleagues on the Assembly's 
Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee voted down his resolution 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came after a number of measure opponents, including an almond grower 
and a Santa Cruz strawberry grower, testified on organic methods of controlling 
disease and bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole point is that the pesticide is being phased out for a very good 
reason," said Anne Schonfield, spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based 
Pesticide Action Network. "We should be promoting alternatives because they are 
safer, they don't destroy the environment and they are much healthier for the 
soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Committee staff member Arnie Peters said the wording of the resolution 
lessened its chances of passage. The resolution called for U. S. Environmental 
Protection Agency officials to postpone the phaseout, when they are the agency 
required by the federal Clean Air Act to remove methyl bromide from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Memorializing the EPA to do something that's illegal just wouldn't get you 
very far," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia King, a spokeswoman for Takasugi, said the assemblyman was not surprised 
that his resolution was killed and he has no plans to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our decision was that we pretty much knew it wasn't going to pass, but we 
thought it needed to be raised as an issue," King said. "It's a big concern for 
farmers. We had heard so many rumblings about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, said all of 
the county's major strawberry growers use methyl bromide to enhance their 
yield. Strawberries are grown on about 5,500 acres in Ventura County and are 
the county's No. 2 crop after lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, methyl bromide has been used to prepare soil for planting. The 
gas is injected into the earth beneath huge tarps meant to prevent the 
pesticide from dissipating in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, about a dozen people living in an Oxnard subdivision 
became ill, complaining of difficulty breathing and irritated eyes, after the 
gas escaped from a nearby strawberry field. 
</P>
<P>
 The substance is also used to rid buildings of termites and other pests, and 
residents who return to their homes too soon after the application can become 
sick or even die. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fields, growers are required to take precautions to limit farm workers' 
exposure to methyl bromide. California Strawberry Commission spokeswoman Teresa 
Thorne said the industry tightened restrictions last year, calling for the 
fumigant to be buried deeper in the soil under heavier tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking methyl bromide off the market could mean a 40% reduction in crop yield 
for strawberry growers, Thorne said. To prevent such a dramatic drop in 
production, the strawberry commission has delved deeply into researching 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 One method being investigated involves plowing cauliflower and broccoli under 
the soil's surface, where the decaying vegetables might release a naturally 
occurring chemical that does the work of methyl bromide, Thorne said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; 4-YEAR PRISON TERM FOR EX-PHARMACIST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Lake Forest pharmacist was sentenced Friday to four years in prison 
for illegally possessing prescription drugs for sale -- his third such 
conviction in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Bruce Marcum, 38, was stripped of his pharmacy license last year, 
placed on electronic surveillance for six months and sentenced to five years' 
probation after he was found to be illegally possessing prescription drugs, 
court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent search of his home turned up dozens of prescription drugs he had 
apparently stockpiled, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor called Marcum a "sophisticated drug dealer, scammer and 
con-man." 
</P>
<P>
 But Marcum told an Orange County deputy probation officer in his current case 
that he was not selling drugs to addicts, but was assisting sick people with 
prescriptions who needed an emergency refill after their supplies had run out. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcum said he was trying to put people out of their pain and make them more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan, Marcum 
asked that "justice be tempered with mercy." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcum's attorney could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Marcum was convicted of transporting and selling controlled 
substances. He was sentenced to a work furlough program, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sentencing report, Marcum has not been a problem prisoner, 
but has been placed in protective custody in the Orange County Men's Jail 
because of his snoring. RENE LYNCH

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EDUCATOR TO ENTER SUPERINTENDENT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks educator plans to hold a rally Sunday to formally launch his 
campaign for Ventura County superintendent of schools, in what will be the 
first contested race for the superintendent's job in at least 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Flynn, principal of the county's schools for juvenile offenders, will 
challenge appointed Supt.Charles Weis in the race June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's kick-off rally Sunday will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. at Conejo Creek 
Park in Thousand Oaks, next to the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of New Jersey, Flynn worked for 10 years in the Los Angeles school 
system before taking over as principal of Ventura County's three juvenile court 
schools, which serve minors who are in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile court schools are operated by the county superintendent, which 
means Flynn is running against his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he got the idea to run while he was collecting signatures from 
teachers at his schools to help Weis qualify as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was gathering signatures for Chuck, my teachers were saying, 'Dan, why 
isn't it you that's running?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's decision makes this the first contested race for the superintendent's 
position since James Cowan took the job in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 During Cowan's 24 years in office, he never faced a challenge to his 
reelection. And when Cowan stepped down last year, the county school board 
appointed Weis to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the juvenile court schools, the county superintendent office 
runs about 14 other schools for special-education students. MAIA DAVIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; PANEL AGREES VIEW OF IMMIGRANTS SKEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Chicano leaders told about 200 people at Cypress College on Thursday 
that immigrants have become the scapegoats of present day society and that 
combatting xenophobia should be addressed communitywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders agreed that immigrants are getting blamed for too many problems, 
ranging from the lackluster economy to taking advantage of health and social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants have recently come under attack by a variety of groups and 
politicians who contend that California should put a stop to continued 
immigration because the immigrants are putting too much of a burden on state 
and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time the college sponsored such a forum. No one took an 
opposing view during the two-hour discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing statistics from university studies and government offices, Occidental 
College Sociology Professor Marta Lopez-Garza said immigrants in Los Angeles 
alone pay ample federal, state and local taxes -- $4.2 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigrants come here to work, not to go on welfare, and (they) use 
substantially less services than people born in the U.S.," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Alva, an attorney for the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights of Los 
Angeles, emphasized that undocumented workers are not eligible for most public 
benefits, including social security and unemployment even though they pay for 
the programs through taxes and payroll deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes are being paid regardless of immigrant status," she said. "The 
anti-immigration wave that we're experiencing, especially in California, is 
(attributed) to the change in demographics that's got people freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Alva, Lopez-Garza and Cal State Northridge Chicano Studies Professor Rudy 
Acuna urged the audience to be aware of "racist fears" and to learn the facts 
about immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Cadena, an Anaheim resident who attended the forum, said the speakers 
answered many questions he had about immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bashing "stirs up desire to get involved and do something against it," he 
said. "People should not be so complacent. We need to combat prejudice and we 
can do it through education and knowledge."MIMI KO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CAMERA EXHIBIT GIVES VISITORS PICTURE 
OF PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a 71-year-old camera, the Sept 35-millimeter sports some pretty 
sophisticated technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The French-made camera can film and project motion pictures, enlarge 
photographs and take snapshots. And it's only one of a dozen cameras that puts 
modern technology to shame in the Stagecoach Inn Museum's new "Time Exposures" 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 On display through the end of September, the exhibit features vintage 
still-photo and motion-picture cameras borrowed from private collectors across 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A late 19th-Century magic lantern uses a kerosene lamp inside a copper and tin 
box to project pictures -- hand painted on glass slides -- on nearby walls. A 
Kodak vest-pocket camera from 1915 folds up, accordion style, to a compact, 
lightweight box. And hand-cranked movie cameras from the turn of the century 
sparkle with brass accents and other gizmos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we're so modern in our technology, but when I look at some of these 
cameras and see what they could do back then, it seems we have a long way to 
go," exhibit curator Darlene Appleford said. 
</P>
<P>
 To fulfill the exhibit's goal, which Appleford described as "giving people a 
better appreciation of the past," the museum will periodically show silent 
movies and taped interviews with a camera restoration expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the exhibit is included in the regular museum fee of $2 for 
adults and $1 for seniors and children. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, admission is free, as the Conejo Valley Historical Society sponsors 
a mini-festival to launch the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents dressed in turn-of-the-century costumes, from plumed hats to flowing 
capes to silk skirts, will guide visitors through the camera displays and a 
one-day exhibit of Model T cars. Volunteers wearing old-fashioned lace bodices 
and antique jewelry also will lead guests to lectures about antique cameras and 
the art of restoring old movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stagecoach Inn Museum on South Ventu Park Road is open Wednesdays through 
Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, call 498-9441. STEPHANIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROCRASTINATORS TAX POSTAL WORKERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, hordes of Ventura County residents waited until the last minute 
Friday to file their income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 And like just about every other April 15, bushels of government workers were 
ready to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole week has been really hectic," said Harlene Hartwell, one of five 
Internal Revenue Service counter workers who fielded questions from the steady 
flow of people who jammed the IRS office in Oxnard Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just wait 'till lunch, when people start getting off work. It will just be a 
mess then," said Hartwell, an 18-year IRS veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were just as hectic at the main post office in Oxnard. The office was 
one of only three post offices in Ventura County scheduled to remain open until 
midnight Friday to keep up with the last-minute rush to mail tax documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The other post offices that remained open were in Thousand Oaks and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Some filers at the Oxnard office lined up to mail their forms the easy way: 
through the car window. Inside, lines 10-people deep at four windows kept mail 
clerks busy all day, postal clerk Margaret Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real crunch was expected after 5 p.m., when most people get off work 
and head in desperation to the post office, said Jim Hanlon, customer service 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people get so cautious they insist on sending their returns by certified 
mail, even though the post office guarantees to postmark them by April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who do it are concerned," he said diplomatically. "And there are quite 
a few people who are concerned when they deal with the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Judd had her tax return completed, and envelope addressed and stamped. 
But she still made a mad dash to the IRS office in Oxnard Friday to find a form 
for her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Both her parents have been recently incapacitated, Judd explained, so she had 
to file an extension for them, the 51-year-old Ventura woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not usually so late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Shook, perhaps reflecting the attitude of his Bart Simpson T-shirt that 
proclaimed "Eat My Shorts, Man," said he too was seeking more time to figure 
out how much he owes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shook, a self-employed carpenter, said he had not taken the time to file an 
extension until the last day because he had been too busy. And it's a hassle 
doing taxes when you own your own business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to find someone to figure it out for me," he said. "And all the 
accountants are too busy this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Borenstein, a certified public accountant with Jacobs & Jacobs in Thousand 
Oaks, said his office got requests Friday to file last-minute extensions, but 
nothing more urgent. "We seem to have things pretty much under control," he 
said. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MORE RACIST FLYERS FOUND AT 3 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students and officials at schools in Thousand Oaks and Ojai found racist 
flyers in student lockers Friday morning identical to those found at other 
schools across Ventura County in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers were discovered at Matilija Junior High and Nordhoff High in Ojai, 
and at Thousand Oaks High, authorities said.Although students at the two Ojai 
schools were on spring break, a Matilija pupil found the flyer when she went to 
her locker Friday morning, leading officials to check the lockers at Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thousand Oaks High, social studies teacher Gregory Barker said he discussed 
the flyers with students in his classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction was universal," Barker said. "They were appalled. They were 
really appalled. They couldn't believe anybody would write that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers include a diatribe against immigrants and ethnic minorities that is 
headed by the question: "Is the White Race Extinct?" 
</P>
<P>
 They are identical to those found stuffed in lockers at Simi Valley High 
School in December, Westlake High in January, and Royal High in Simi Valley and 
Buena High in Ventura last month. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no suspects in any of the incidents, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. 
Gary Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are investigating the incidents, Backman said, but it does not 
appear that distribution of the flyers at the schools is a crime, unless police 
can show that people who are not employees or students at the school trespassed 
on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker said he used the flyers in his instruction about totalitarian 
governments and the Holocaust. "We're looking at racism. We're looking at 
bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being found in schools around Ventura County, the flyers were 
discovered in December at various locations in Los Angeles County. MAIA DAVIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RECYCLING PROGRAM DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some residents remain dissatisfied with a new curbside recycling program a 
month after it was introduced, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The main complaint is that the bulky, 100-gallon waste and recycling cans are 
difficult to manage and do not fit through the side gates of most houses. As a 
result, residents have been forced to leave the cans in front of their homes 
throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can drive down the street in my area and see the (containers) out there," 
Councilman Frank Laszlo said. "We've gotten a lot of complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents also said that Briggeman Co., the trash hauler that runs the 
program for the city, has not given out enough containers to handle all the 
recyclables, regular trash and green waste that their homes generate. This has 
been a particular problem at homes on large lots, which generate substantial 
amounts of grass clippings, leaves and weeds, Mayor Gwen Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laszlo said it costs $8 a month for residents to get an extra container for 
green waste. Some residents have told him that they need two extra containers. 
"That's a lot of money to spend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited recycling program began in March in two Seal Beach 
neighborhoods: Marina Hill and College Park East. The program, run by Briggeman 
Co., will be extended to other parts of the city later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Each home was given two 100-gallon containers -- one for recyclables and one 
for regular trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who find that the 100-gallon containers are too large can trade them 
in for either 66-gallon or 33-gallon containers at no extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to meet with Briggeman Co. later this month to discuss the 
recycling program. At that time, officials said, they will raise some of the 
concerns expressed by residents and try to develop ways to solve the problems.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; PLAN TO REVAMP, REOPEN JAIL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously approved a plan to convert the city's 
dormant jail into a privately run short-term detention center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect the 32-bed facility to open later this year.The move is 
expected to eventually generate as much as $150,000 a year for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail will house nonviolent inmates awaiting arraignment, usually within 48 
hours of their arrest. It will be used by city police as well as neighboring 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston stressed that the jail will accept only 
"low-risk" prisoners such as accused embezzlers, drunken drivers and 
white-collar criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 People accused of more serious crimes, such as rape, armed robbery and murder, 
will continue to be booked into County Jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Monday expressed general support for the concept but 
peppered Bankston with questions about the safety of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that the vast majority of inmates will be held at the jail 
for less than a week. In special cases, a judge could order a convicted 
criminal to work at his job during the day and report to the jail to serve his 
sentence at night, Bankston said. Such an arrangement might occur with someone 
convicted of withholding child support payments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council could close the jail for any reason within 180 days. The 
council must approve any changes in the jail design and in the category of 
suspects held there. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has entered into a contract with Correction Services Inc. to run the 
jail. The firm plans to spend $300,000 to renovate the facility, located in the 
basement of the police station on Seal Beach Boulevard.SHELBY GRAD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNTY QUIZZED ON HERBICIDE POLICY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints about the county's practice of spraying herbicides to 
control weeds in flood control channels, the Thousand Oaks City Council has 
asked Ventura County officials to publicly explain their policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's public works director, Arthur Goulet, has already defended the 
policy in letters to several residents.He has repeatedly said the flood control 
department uses the herbicides correctly and appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate and share your concern for the environment," he wrote one 
resident. "But I believe the use of these herbicides is a safe and 
cost-effective method for the control of vegetation within (flood control) 
channels and rights-of-way." 
</P>
<P>
 After reading a thick packet of letters on the subject, council members 
Tuesday heard from two residents concerned with the spraying, including James 
Nichols, who requested city help in battling the county. City officials, 
however, said there was little they could do other than ask for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not hurt us to (write a letter) again, but it's not our land and it's 
not his land -- it's the county's jurisdiction," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 2 STUDENTS TO GET FIREFIGHTER AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Ventura County students will receive $1,000 scholarships next week from a 
foundation set up by the Simi Valley family of a Navy firefighter killed in an 
explosion aboard the aircraft carrier Midway. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Nestor, 18, a Moorpark College student, and Kevin Myers, 17, a senior 
at Simi Valley High School, were selected by the Ventura County Professional 
Firefighters' Assn. for the awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship fund was set up by the Firefighter's Assn. and the family of 
Shane Kilgore, 22, an aspiring firefighter from Simi Valley who was killed in 
June, 1990, while serving in the Navy. Kilgore was credited with saving several 
other sailors after a fiery explosion ripped through the USS Midway, while it 
was on maneuvers off the coast of Japan. He died from his burns several days 
after the incident, which killed two other men. 
</P>
<P>
 In his memory the Kilgore family and the Firefighters Assn. set up the 
scholarship to benefit children of firefighters, as well as talented youths 
hoping to become firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestor, daughter of a Ventura County battalion chief, is a volunteer at Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. She plans to work with burn 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin is a cadet at Fire Station 43 in Simi Valley and plans to attend Oxnard 
College, then become a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair will receive their awards at 2 p.m. Friday at Simi Valley City Hall, 
2929 Tapo Canyon Road. For more information, call (805) 484-8844. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SANTA ANA RIVER BIKE ROUTE TO BE DETOURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana River cyclists will be detoured onto city streets beginning late 
next week when the bike trail between Warner Avenue and 17th Street closes for 
the start of construction on the next stretch of the flood-control project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of liability and safety concerns by Santa Ana city officials, a bike 
route was not agreed to until Thursday, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials agreed to a street bike route that will take 
northbound cyclists and others who use the river trail off at Warner Avenue and 
detour them west to Newhope Street, which will take them north to 1st Street. 
The detour will take them east on 1st Street to Fairview Street, which they 
will take northward until it links back up with the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrie Medeiros,county Environmental Management Agency project manager for the 
lower Santa Ana River, said that although construction begins Monday, the river 
trail between Warner and 17th will be open at least through Wednesday, until 
the street detour is finalized and bike paths are striped on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next week, construction work will be limited to the west side of the 
river to accommodate cyclists and others who use the bike trail, Medeiros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medeiros said all streets along the detour will have bike paths. On 1st 
between Harbor Boulevard and Fairview, one traffic lane in each direction will 
be removed to accommodate the bike path, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A detour will be worked out in the next two to three weeks for a segment on 
the river trail between Fairview -- where cyclists get back on the trail -- and 
17th to the north, Medeiros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Harvey, chairman of the 140-member Orange County Bicycle Coalition, said 
the bike route is a "good compromise and we support the compromise. We don't 
necessarily think it's much safer, but it might be better. We're happy with the 
detour." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, however, said the trail's closure is like closing a freeway to 
motorists and could discourage cyclists from riding their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some bicyclists will find the closure and leave bikes at home and take their 
cars, or go through city streets and find themselves in bad neighborhoods," 
Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey added that the bike trail is "a very important route. Thousands of 
people a day use it in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county, an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 cyclists use the trail 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Medeiros said that alternative routes using 17th and Trask Avenue were 
examined. But a road widening project is underway on 17th and a storm drain 
project is under construction on Trask. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana also looked at other possible bike routes and decided 
against using certain portions of Fairview because the street is heavily 
traveled by motorists and poses a higher risk for accidents, city engineer 
George Alvarez said. River Trail Blues 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, the Santa Ana River trail between Warner Avenue and 17th 
Street will be closed because of construction. For now, cyclists and others 
will enter or leave te trail at Fairview Street and Warner Avenue. A detour for 
the section between Fairview and 17th has yet to be determined.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; POLICE PROGRAM SERVES AS EYE-OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the police car pulled into the driveway of the Pasadena Village Apartments, 
Bonnie Winchester realized why joining the Police Department's citizen police 
academy made perfect sense for her. 
</P>
<P>
 She was with Officer Pat Welch on a ride-along Monday as part of the hands-on 
lessons at the academy. The ride -- intended to give her a front-seat view of 
how officers do their job -- took her close to home, too close, as she found 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchester manages the 172-unit Pasadena Village Apartments, and the call she 
and Welch were answering came from her tenants, the parents of a missing 
14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty horrifying," Winchester said. "I said: 'Oh my gosh, something 
terrible must have happened.' I saw the family in their living room and there 
was this helpless look in their faces." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the girl was safe and came home the next day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchester, 37, is one of 24 participants in the citizen police academy, a 
10-week course conducted Wednesday evenings at the city police station and 
intended to let community members learn more about the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants -- who either live or work in the city -- attend free, three-hour 
sessions conducted by officers on such topics as police organization, law 
enforcement programs, citizen's arrests, criminal investigations and the use of 
force in police work. The department has budgeted $2,500 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride-along is one of the highlights of the course, according to Detective 
Gordon Margulies, who helped develop the program. He said Westminster, Buena 
Park and Huntington Beach have similar programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good public relations," Margulies said. "It's good for the community to 
know how we do things and why we do things. The goal is to get the community to 
better understand about the police function." 
</P>
<P>
 During the course, the instructors demonstrate scenarios in which the 
participants arrest suspects and wield unloaded weapons, Margulies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect them to go out in the community and start arresting people," 
Margulies said. "This is not a training program for police work." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that by attending the course, residents should better understand 
police work and be more willing to help. At the very least, Margulies said, the 
department hopes the program will help change the way the public views 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Following her five-hour ride, Winchester said her opinion did change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that they are very well trained," she said. "People should not 
try to take the law in their own hands. That would create more havoc. We should 
leave it to the professionals." BERT ELJERA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; ATTORNEY TO LEAD COLLEGE FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime Oxnard attorney has been named president of the Oxnard College 
Foundation, a nonprofit organization formed to support the college's 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Regnier, who attended some of the first classes offered by Oxnard 
College in the early 1970s, takes over for Armando Lopez, who left the 
foundation earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a heavy responsibility and a very challenging task," Regnier said. "But 
I think we're in a position to accomplish some real good for Oxnard College." 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1983, the Oxnard College Foundation is primarily a fund-raising 
group that appropriates money for student scholarships, educational programs 
and campus improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Regnier has worked for the foundation since 1990 as both a director and 
general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation board member Florence LaManno said Regnier has shown a dedication 
to the college as well as an ability to raise money from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a tremendous vision and a lot of capabilities," LaManno said. "He's 
spending a lot of time through his volunteerism to achieve the goals of both 
the college and the foundation." JEFF McDONALD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; JURISDICTION OF ACCESS BOARD IS DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council and members of the Access Appeals Board met this week to 
discuss the jurisdiction of the board, which oversees whether building owners 
are complying with laws dealing with access by the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's building inspectors can check to see that structures comply with 
the laws, the council and board members were told.The inspectors can order 
expensive changes to be made to bring them up to code, they said. If people 
disagree with the Building Department's findings, they may appeal to the access 
board, composed of residents appointed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 If people are unhappy with the decision of the Access Appeals Board, they can 
take there case to the City Council, City Atty. Thomas A. Kathe said at the 
study session Monday. This appeal process was not made clear when the council 
established the access board in 1992, Kathe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she wants the access board to strictly enforce the 
Americans With Disabilities Act and other regulations because the city is 
legally liable for deviations. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Douglas G. O'Kieffe said he is concerned that expensive 
changes ordered by the board could result in a backlash by frustrated 
small-business owners against disabled people. "That's where I, as a person 
using a wheelchair, want to use a little common sense," O'Kieffe told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kieffe, who is a board member of the California Paralyzed Veterans Assn., 
said he thinks small departures from the building code are sometimes 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jay Humphrey said he wants the board to take "the high road" 
and make strict decisions. Other council members at the study session echoed 
his opinion.WILLSON CUMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BOYS & GIRLS CLUB PREPARES FOR FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An Austrian baby grand piano handcrafted in 1830 is one of nearly 200 items 
that will be auctioned to the highest bidders when the Boys & Girls Club of 
Oxnard holds its annual fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction and dinner, the center's biggest fund-raiser of the year, is 
scheduled for April 30 at the South Oxnard Center, 200 E. Bard Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have more than 40 (valuable) items like the baby grand piano, a 1950s 
jukebox, a Coke machine and a big-screen TV," said Abe Oliveras, the Boys & 
Girls Club's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting good support, but now that we have two facilities, we need the 
community to really come out and support us," Oliveras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to be auctioned are a 25-foot sailboat, a Hawaiian vacation 
package, weekend getaways to Santa Maria and Las Vegas, cellular telephones, 
and other items and services donated by local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers offer more than 1,500 members a variety of services, including 
youth-employment training, tutoring, summer camp, arts and crafts and 
recreational activities, Oliveras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives them an opportunity they wouldn't have otherwise," Oliveras said of 
the programs. "It exposes them to other things instead of being on a street 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen boys and girls sporting Oxnard Boys & Girls Club T-shirts 
earlier this week said they would be bored without the activities offered by 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be at home watching TV," said 12-year-old Joey Madrid, a seventh-grader 
who has been a club member for the past year. "I have friends here to play pool 
with and do different kinds of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Vanessa Alvarez of Oxnard said the club gives her a place to 
spend time after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's boring at home and there's nothing to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, several young boys and girls spent the day at Magic Mountain, one 
of several field trips the club provides children throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this month, Oliveras took one boy to see his first professional 
baseball game. "I just took it for granted that everyone had been to Dodger 
Stadium," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the board of directors of the Boys & Girls Club of Oxnard said they 
hope to raise $50,000 or more at the fifth annual action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's realistic if we can get 110% support from the community," said Michael 
Faulconer, an Oxnard architect who serves as a co-chairman on the board. 
"That's what we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the fund-raiser are $50 each and can be purchased by calling the 
Boys & Girls Club of Oxnard at 488-5717. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Area public service groups and a community improvement project will share 
$95,268 in federal funds earmarked for the city of Ojai after the Jan. 17 
earthquake, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen nonprofit organizations applied for a piece of Ojai's 
Community Development Block Grant money, but the bulk of the funding divided up 
Tuesday went to local groups and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The city allocated $49,658 for street improvements on South Montgomery Street, 
$26,420 for city administration of the grant, $6,790 for Concerned Resource and 
Environmental Workers, $3,300 for Assn. for Retarded Citizens of Ventura

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK VIEW; PROPERTIES DONATED TO NONPROFIT GROUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after Habitat for Humanity volunteers provided a home for 74-year-old 
Charles Henderson, the Oak View resident returned the favor by donating two of 
his three small parcels to the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Using donations of money, building materials and manpower, Habitat for 
Humanity, which builds housing for poor families, will construct houses on 
Henderson's land for two west Ventura County families, Habitat Chairwoman 
Elaine Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is set to begin later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pioneer concept of barn raising where people help their 
neighbors," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, expected to cost about $30,000 per house, is being funded with 
donations and $20,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds from the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Presbyterian Church pledged another $20,000 over three years, and 
several local business and homeowners have promised to donate tile, lumber, 
windows and other building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, who have not been chosen, will buy the houses at a low price 
and with a no-interest mortgage. Habitat hopes to have the families selected by 
July and the first family moved in by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The families selected must provide 500 hours of work, called sweat equity, as 
a down payment. Seventy-five of those hours will be spent in a training course 
on how to maintain the house. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the Habitat project, applicants must need housing, not have 
resources to buy or build shelter, and be unable to qualify for a government 
housing loan, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, applicants must have lived or worked in the west Ventura County area for 
at least a year, and have steady incomes of from $13,000 to $27,000 for a 
four-person family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are four-bedroom homes so we will be looking at larger families," she 
said. Habitat also plans to build houses in Ventura and Fillmore for smaller 
families and individuals in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said Habitat needs people to help choose the families and is holding 
two community meetings this week to form a selection committee. The first 
meeting will be at 7 p.m. Monday at the Ojai Methodist Church. The second will 
be at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Oak View Community Center. TRACY WILSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MURDER CHARGES FILED IN DEATH OF CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-week investigation, authorities on Friday upgraded the charges 
against house painter Brian Laudenback to murder in the death of his 
girlfriend's 22-month-old son, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback, 32, of Newport Beach, had been charged last month with felony 
corporal punishment on a child after the death of Tyler Jaeger, the son of his 
girlfriend, Karey Jaeger, 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback was arrested after the child died March 25 at Hoag Hospital. A 
preliminary autopsy showed that the child, who was being baby-sat by 
Laudenback, had suffered severe blows to his liver and pancreas caused by a 
blunt instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier the child had entered the same hospital with a large bump on 
his head that turned out to be a fractured skull. Laudenback said at the time 
that the child had fallen accidentally and hit his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback's arraignment, which was to occur Friday at Harbor Court, was 
postponed for unspecified reasons until next week, at which time he will be 
allowed to enter a plea on the new charge, said Newport Beach police spokesman 
Paul Henisey. 
</P>
<P>
 The arraignment date will be set Monday for Laudenback, whose bail was set at 
$250,000, Henisey said. FERNANDO ROMERO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; TOWER FOES TO HOLD BOWLING FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ojai Valley opponents of a National Weather Service radar tower at Sulphur 
Mountain will host a celebrity bowling party Sunday at the Ojai Valley Bowl to 
raise money for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents who oppose the tower have lost a series of legal battles in 
recent months aimed at forcing the federal government to move the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from Sunday's bowling party will help pay about $11,000 in legal fees 
and help fund future events, said Dwier Brown, an organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the weather service erected the 98-foot-high weather-tracking system in 
November, homeowners have demanded its removal, saying the radar could cause 
health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowling party will run from 3 to 7 p.m., with a $10 admission. 
Television's Scott Bakula of "Quantum Leap" will host the party, with stars 
Mary Steenburgen Rickie Lee Jones and Bill Paxton among those also scheduled to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower opponents are also planning a $50 dinner and silent art auction -- to 
include two works donated by Ojai potter Beatrice Wood -- at 6:30 p.m. May 10 
at Wheeler Hot Springs, 1202 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai. For tickets, call 656-6656.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL DISTRICT FACES LEADERSHIP VACUUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District is without a top administrator following 
the sudden withdrawal this week of a top candidate for superintendent and the 
abrupt resignation of the interim superintendent Thursday night, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had hoped to woo Dennis Smith, superintendent of the Cajon Valley 
District in San Diego, to accept the top administrative post, but he backed out 
fearing micro-managing by the school board, said district officials who did not 
want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the district's management woes, Marilyn Corey resigned as interim 
superintendent after clashing with board members in a closed hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members would not comment Friday on Corey's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not had a permanent superintendent since June, 1992, and has 
gone through seven superintendents since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey and board members argued over an item on Thursday night's school board 
agenda to allocate $150,000 in legal fees to the district's attorney, Mary Jo 
McGrath, district officials said Friday. McGrath represents the district in a 
hearing to discipline three top school administrators accused of sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey, who initiated the sexual harassment investigation last fall, urged the 
board to approve the request, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members, who had approved $70,000 in fees to McGrath last year, 
asked for more information on the hearings, which have already gone longer than 
expected, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the closed-session meeting broke up, Corey turned in her resignation and 
failed to attend the public school board meeting. The board postponed a vote on 
the funding request. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey's departure surprised officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned and shocked," said David Reger, president of the teachers union. 
"I would have liked to have seen her stay, and lobbied the board to hire her as 
a permanent superintendent." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials were already reeling this week after Smith, described by 
some board members as "an excellent administrator," backed out of signing a 
contract. Officials were so sure Smith was going to sign, a special reception 
was planned for Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Smith was scared away not by the prospect of coping with the 
district's problems, but because he feared the school board would micro-manage 
his administration, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith did not return repeated phone calls Friday.MARTIN MILLER

OCTA DIRECTOR ADMITS CONFLICT IN DISNEY VOTES; TRANSIT: EILEEN KRAUSE SAYS 
PARTICIPATION WAS A 'DUMB MISTAKE.' HER FIRM HAS A BUSINESS CONTRACT WITH 
DISNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In what she admitted was a conflict of interest, Orange County Transportation 
Authority board member Eileen Krause has cast three votes since last year on a 
parking garage that will benefit Disneyland, even though her company earned 
$17,000 through a service contract with the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a dumb mistake. It never occurred to me that it could be a 
conflict of interest. They're just a customer of mine," said Krause, an 
alternate director on the OCTA board. She is allowed to vote whenever a 
director is absent or abstains. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause, a Dana Point councilwoman, and her husband, Robert, own Air Cleaning 
Technology, a Santa Ana-based company that services air pollution control 
equipment at several Disneyland restaurants and others in the county. She said 
Disney paid her company $17,000 for services in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Political Reform Act, local officials are banned from taking part in 
governmental decisions affecting any person or company that has provided them 
with $250 or more in income in the previous year. Violators can be reprimanded, 
fined or even prosecuted criminally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, this was an honest mistake," Krause said. "They're a customer and 
nothing else. It was not like I voted to promote Disneyland to increase the 
return on an investment. I don't own Disney stock or otherwise have a financial 
interest in the company." 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA attorney Ken Smart said Krause rescinded the three votes this week but 
said that will not affect the board's action. He said that he advised Krause to 
abstain from future votes involving the $223-million garage, which will be 
built across the street from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Krause, she was unaware of the conflict until it was brought to 
her attention by a local reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced she was unaware of the conflict of interest," Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-story parking garage, which will be built on Clementine Street 
between Freedman Way and Katella Avenue, is designed to accommodate the Walt 
Disney Co.'s planned Westcot expansion. The project is being funded with 
federal, state and local funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause's latest vote for the project, known as the Orange County Intermodal 
Transportation Center, came on Monday, when she voted with other board members 
to approve $32 million in OCTA funds for construction. She was sitting in for 
Anaheim Councilman Irv Pickler, who was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause said that she cast the other two votes in 1993 for Santa Ana Mayor Dan 
Young, who routinely abstains from all votes on the garage because his wife 
owns Disney stock. Whenever Young abstains, an alternate director votes for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause, who has been a Dana Point councilwoman since January, 1989, is 
scheduled to step down from the OCTA board in June, when her council term 
expires. She said she will not run for reelection.

JUDGE GIVES MAN'S KILLER LOWEST TERM POSSIBLE; COURTS: TODD LOVE, 27, IS 
SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS TO LIFE AND AN ADDED THREE YEARS BECAUSE HE USED GUN IN 
KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four weeks after reducing a Newbury Park man's conviction from first-degree 
murder to second-degree murder, a Ventura County judge sentenced the defendant 
Friday to the lowest prison term possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch sentenced 27-year-old Todd Love to 15 
years to life for the murder and added another three years because Love used a 
gun in the killing of his sister's boyfriend last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder sentence was mandatory, but Storch could have given Love as many as 
five years for using a gun. The sentencing came during a hearing in which the 
judge and a prosecutor engaged in a heated exchange over Storch's handling of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley accused the judge of "minimizing" the 
death of 32-year-old Frank Kish, who was shot to death as 911 operators 
listened on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reduced the verdict and then gave him the lowest he could have given him," 
Frawley said outside court, shaking his head in disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 During the sentencing hearing, Storch pointed out that before the trial, 
prosecutors were willing to accept a guilty plea from Love to voluntary 
manslaughter, which would have resulted in a maximum term of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch said the earlier offer appears to demonstrate that even the 
prosecutor's office did not believe that the case warranted a 
first-degree-murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think experienced lawyers such as you know how to evaluate a case," Storch 
told Frawley. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley, however, told the judge that any deal that the prosecutor's office 
might have offered Love before the trial was of no consequence once a jury 
rendered the first-degree murder verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, first-degree murder must be planned, while second-degree murder 
does not have to be premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury verdict was returned last December, after Frawley told jurors that 
Love shot Kish after losing a fistfight to the victim. Love lived in a house 
with his sister, Kelli, Kish and the couple's infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Spiga, Love's attorney, agreed with the judge, saying it was 
"disingenuous" for prosecutors to argue for the maximum sentence after earlier 
offering to settle the case for a plea to voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiga also questioned the district attorney's office stated policy against 
plea bargaining, in light of the deal that Storch said was offered to Love. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of chicanery going on as far as this being a 
no-plea-bargaining jurisdiction," the Los Angeles attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiga also asked Storch to sentence Love to the lowest sentence possible, 
noting that the defendant had a .20% blood-alcohol level when he shot Kish. He 
called Love "a redeemable human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, Love had gotten into a fistfight with Kish. Love dialed 
911 and told emergency operators that he was going to kill Kish, according to 
court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, had not alcohol been involved, had not Mr. Frank Kish come and 
punched Mr. Love while he was on the phone (with 911), it's very likely that 
Mr. Kish would be alive today," Spiga said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, however, took the occasion to deliver a soliloquy against the 
existence of more than 200 million firearms in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this is another case that cries out in its strictest sense" for 
gun control, the judge said. "The only people who should be allowed to carry 
any guns in my view are police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped lawmakers "will have enough guts" to outlaw firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kish Sr., seated in the court audience, broke down and cried during the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Kish had written a letter to the judge, calling for Storch to "send 
a message" by giving Love the toughest sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank leaves a 15-month-old son without a father, a mother who calls to the 
angels for help, a grief-stricken brother and a grandfather who still talks to 
him," the letter said.

COUNCIL TO DIVVY UP QUAKE RELIEF; THOUSAND OAKS: HARD-HIT HOMEOWNERS ARE EAGER 
TO SECURE A NO-STRINGS FEDERAL GRANT. STAFF WARNS GIVING FUNDS TO RESIDENTS MAY 
SET A PRECEDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the pleasant chore of divvying up half a million dollars, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will debate how best to spend a federal 
earthquake relief grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, homeowners are lining up, hats in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "A handful of us really have not resumed our normal way of living," Michele 
Relkin told the council earlier this week, after describing how the January 
quake twisted and tilted her home. "I'm asking for your understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with understanding, Relkin and other hard-hit residents also want some 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bill Johnson said he plans to request more than $11,000 as a grant to 
help him repair the roof and chimney of his home on Shelter Wood Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has given him a low-interest loan covering the $36,000 
needed to fix his earthquake-damaged home. Yet a loan, Johnson said, "still 
needs to be paid off," so he's eager to secure a no-strings grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you buy a house, it's your pride and joy," he said. "The roof and 
fireplace are a key part of my home, my castle." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's unexpected windfall -- $501,000 in community development funds -- 
might be Johnson's best bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will consider a proposal to give some of the cash to 
individual residents to pay repair costs not covered by insurance companies or 
Federal Emergency Management Agency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Funneling the federal funds to homeowners would set a precedent of paying for 
private property repairs, city staff warned. Brushing off that objection, Mayor 
Elois Zeanah said: "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis here should be not to repair public property, but to help people 
with private property," Zeanah said. "My preference is to assist homeowners 
whose property is so damaged that the costs are not being covered by federal or 
state funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Because only a handful of Thousand Oaks residents suffered staggering losses, 
Zeanah said in addition she would like to hand money to residents repairing 
cosmetic damage, such as fallen roof tiles or cracked plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option would be using the funds to repair dozens of block walls that 
tipped or crumbled during the Northridge earthquake. The staff has pegged the 
price tag for repairing all masonry walls around residential tracts and 
bordering main streets at $341,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But while his homeowner's association could use some help repairing three 
downed walls in Chanteclair Estates, resident David Habib said he thought the 
city should focus first on fixing up bedrooms and bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a human being, I say, get people back in their homes" before sinking money 
into block walls, Habib said. "We can scrounge around to pay for the walls, but 
we don't want people to live on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, once the neediest cases are taken care of, Habib said he would like 
leftover funds distributed evenly throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always use help," he said. "We wouldn't ask for it if we didn't need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding how to allocate the federal funds, the council could also choose 
to beef up the city's disaster preparedness program, survey water reservoirs 
for damage or pay for additional repairs at the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff has proposed spending $25,000 on disaster preparation, either to 
educate residents or to equip the Disaster Assistance Relief Team, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-member quick-response team could use walkie-talkies, search and 
recovery tools, and a van to cart around equipment and personnel, according to 
Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields.

SUBJECTS OF THE COMMENTARIES WERE STILL UNCLEAR. A FINAL FLURRY OF ABOUT 100 
ARRIVED FRIDAY.

 About 500 people met Friday's deadline to respond to the recommendations of 
two UC Irvine cost-cutting task forces by sending letters to the school's 
acting executive vice chancellor, Spencer C. Olin, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A final flurry of about 100 responses arrived Friday, UCI spokesman Scott 
Nelson said. Letters began arriving at Olin's office after the task force 
recommendations were finalized Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how many letters had been written about the most controversial 
recommendations in the task force reports: "disestablishing" the departments of 
education, comparative culture and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of late Thursday, Olin's office had received 408 letters, Nelson said; 
of those, 239 -- or 59% -- responded to the proposed closing of UCI's education 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 That percentage has remained fairly constant since letters started streaming 
in to the office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The academic task force has also suggested that other departments and programs 
be consolidated. A task force on non-academic issues recommended that some 
university services, such as the bookstore, might be cost-effectively handled 
by outside companies. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-member Academic Planning Council will read the letters and submit its own 
recommendations on trimming the budget to Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening by 
June 1, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the letters pleaded to save departments and assailed reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find the recommendations of the ATF (Academic Task Force) inconsistent and 
uninformed," wrote Dickran L. Tashjian, professor and interim director of the 
comparative culture department.  
</P>
<P>
 Tashjian opposed the task force's suggestion to close his department, as well 
as the recommendation to merge the Spanish and Portuguese department with 
interdisciplinary programs in Chicano and Latino studies and Latin American 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Olson, director of the 15-year-old UCI Writing Project, criticized the 
task force for its "unawareness." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised the task force seemed so unaware of the level of activity 
that the department of education has currently going with Orange County schools 
and the really strong and positive relationship between the surrounding 
(educational) community and the university," Olson said, summarizing her 
written comments to the vice chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, an offering of the department of education, has trained 538 
writing teachers in Orange County and at least 400 Garden Grove students, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 I a joint letter, education department faculty members told Olin of the 
department's new doctoral program for school administrators and new programs 
addressing diversity in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 They also disagreed with task force recommendations to transfer UCI's teaching 
credential program to the Cal State system or UC Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Several graduate students in English and comparative literature disagreed with 
a proposal that higher-quality undergraduate students could be attracted to UCI 
if the school made it possible for them to graduate in three years rather than 
four.

CONEJO BOARD HIRES ARCHITECTS TO DESIGN 2 HIGH SCHOOL THEATERS; CONSTRUCTION: 
SELECTION OF FIRMS IS APPROVED FOR THE LONG-AWAITED PROJECTS, WHICH WILL EACH 
COST $2.3 MILLION.

 For a decade, drama teacher Joseph Donia has dreamed of staging productions at 
Thousand Oaks High School where the audience didn't have to huddle under 
blankets in a tent or sit on fold-away bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the first couple (of) rows get to see the whole play and the rest 
get to listen to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newbury Park High, student actors have performed in equally awkward spaces 
-- an English classroom, a gym and, now, a former wood-shop studio. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time today's freshmen are ready for lead roles, the dream of 
performing in a real theater may be a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District took a 
major step toward building permanent performance halls at both schools. In a 
3-2 vote, board members agreed to hire two architectural firms to design the 
projects, which will each cost $2.3 million. Contracts with the firms have not 
yet been negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so good it's incredible," Thousand Oaks Principal Keith Wilson said. 
"We just have never had a place where we could do justice for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with students interested in drama, the theaters will be used by those in 
speech classes, band, orchestra and choral groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing the two firms, the school board followed the recommendations of 
Supt. Jerry Gross and the two high school principals. Newport Beach-based 
Dougherty & Dougherty will build the Thousand Oaks High theater, while Wolff, 
Lang, Christopher of Rancho Cucamonga will design Newbury Park High's hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Dolores Didio and Dorothy Beaubien cast the opposing votes, 
saying they would prefer to have one firm design both projects. Beaubien said 
she did not object to either firm, but said having one designer would avoid 
competition and save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The district could have saved at least $50,000 by awarding both projects to 
the same firm, officials estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That money could be used to do something extra in the two theaters that we 
could not otherwise do," Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Richard Newman argued that the chance to build two theaters 
was a once-in-a-lifetime event for the district. The choice of architects, he 
said, should not be based on whether the district could save a small fraction 
of the project's total cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to come back and do it again," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if the people would like to do it under these circumstances, more 
power to them," he said, referring to the recommendations of the two 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaubien also expressed concern that Dougherty & Dougherty has never built a 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But after visiting other projects built by the firm, Wilson said he was not 
worried, partly because a theater consultant will be hired to advise architects 
on such technical aspects as acoustics and audience views. 
</P>
<P>
 "For their first one, they need a monument, something where they can bring 
people and say 'this is what we do,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both projects -- which are expected to be completed by the spring of 1997 -- 
have been the subject of wrangling between the city and school district for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High theater is being paid for by the city's Redevelopment 
Agency, while the one at Newbury Park High will be funded by the school 
district. The City Council's vote in the fall to extend the life of the 
Redevelopment Agency allowed the projects to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The faculty here at Newbury Park has been waiting for 20 years for a 
theater," said Kristi Colell, chairwoman of the school's drama department. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Donia said he views the selection of the architects with 
cautious optimism. "We've been close a number of times, but this is the closest 
we've been," he said. "Once I see a backhoe, then it's real. I go with the old 
actor's theory: When you can cash the check and it clears, then you know you've 
got the job."

EX-POSTAL WORKER CHANGES PLEA IN KILLINGS; COURTS: THE SWITCH SETS THE STAGE 
FOR INSANITY DEFENSE FOR MARK HILBUN, WHO HAS A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Dana Point postal worker Mark Richard Hilbun pleaded not guilty by 
reason of insanity Friday to charges that he killed his mother and best friend 
and tried to kill seven others during a rampage last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Hilbun, 40, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The change in 
plea sets the stage for an insanity defense for Hilbun, who has a history of 
mental illness and tried to commit suicide while in jail, Deputy Public 
Defender Denise Gragg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is going to be his mental illness at the time," Gragg said. She 
does not plan to contest his role in the slayings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is that he was sick for almost a year before this happened," 
Gragg said. "I think all the facts only point to his insanity at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg said Hilbun is taking anti-psychotic and antidepressant medication while 
in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty against Hilbun. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Rick King said he disagrees with Gragg's assessment of Hilbun's mental 
state during the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view of the facts and circumstances surrounding this two-day crime spree 
is that he did know the difference between right and wrong," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun faces two counts of murder, seven counts of attempted murder and one 
count each of robbery, attempted kidnaping, burglary and killing his mother's 
dog, according to an Orange County Grand Jury indictment handed down in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun is accused of killing his mother, Frances, in her Corona del Mar home 
before opening fire at his former workplace during an attempt to kidnap Kim 
Springer, a postal worker with whom Hilbun had become infatuated. Springer was 
unharmed, but postal worker Charles T. Barbagallo, 42, Hilbun's friend, was 
fatally wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in plea also means that Hilbun's trial will be broken into three 
parts. Jurors must first decide whether Hilbun is guilty, then consider his 
sanity in a separate proceeding before they could proceed to the penalty phase. 
If found guilty but insane, Hilbun would be placed in a state mental hospital 
and there would be no penalty phase, Gragg said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she hopes that jurors will not fear Hilbun, even though the crime 
spree caused concern for many Orange County residents until he was captured. 
</P>
<P>
 "My greatest fear is that people will be afraid of him, which is something I 
understand because I was one of those people worrying" during the rampage, 
which ended when Hilbun was arrested in Huntington Beach. "I just hope they 
won't feel like they have to kill someone who has a mental illness."

MAN WHO ALERTED POLICE HELD IN FATAL SHOOTING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police found a mortally wounded 21-year-old woman who had been shot in a car 
Friday in front of her home in the 7000 block of Orangewood Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who has not been identified by Orange County sheriff's deputies, 
was treated by paramedics at the scene and taken to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they received a 911 call about 3 p.m. from a man who told them a 
woman had been shot. At the scene, police recovered a handgun in her 1991 
Toyota, and arrested a 34-year-old Garden Grove man who identified himself as 
the caller. The man, whose identity has not been released, was taken to the 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Thomas L. Garner said the incident did not appear to be gang-related.

2 ARRESTED AFTER FIGHTS LEAVE 3 INJURED; NEWBURY PARK: AUTHORITIES SAY RIVAL 
GANGS WERE INVOLVED IN THE MELEE, WHICH INCLUDED A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING. A FORMER 
WESTLAKE HIGH ATHLETE AND A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY ARE BEING HELD.

<P>
 Two teen-agers were arrested after fights broke out among rival gangs in front 
of a house in Newbury Park, leaving three youths injured, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Willmon, 18, a former football player at Westlake High School, suffered 
a cut to his head and was being held in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon, authorities said. A 16-year-old, whose identity 
was not released because of his age, was being held at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ventura County sheriff's deputies, an argument began about 7:40 
p.m. Thursday after three suspected gang members in a black, compact car 
stopped in front of a house in the 100 block of North Wendy Drive and began 
talking with several juveniles standing outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pull up, there's a confrontation, and the juvenile living at the house 
goes inside and gets a knife," Sheriff's Sgt. Mike De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the juvenile returned with a large knife, the trio drove off, De Los 
Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, a gold van carrying another rival gang drove by and spotted 
the juveniles outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Willmon and the 16-year-old exited the van and confronted the 
juveniles in front of the house. Authorities said the two were intent on 
getting revenge for a stabbing that took place last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some threats were yelled back and forth and they get into fisticuffs with 
weapons they bring," De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon allegedly hit one of the juveniles with a broom handle, injuring the 
youth's left arm. Authorities said the injured youth had been blamed for the 
earlier stabbing. Another juvenile living at the house told authorities that he 
then hit Willmon on the head with a pipe in self-defense, De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the scuffle, the 16-year-old suspect hit the 15-year-old juvenile who 
lived at the house with a hand tool, inflicting minor injuries, authorities 
said. Willmon and the 16-year-old fled in the van, De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 After they left, the first group of rival gang members returned in the compact 
car and fired at least one round at the house as the juveniles ran inside, De 
Los Santos said. No one was hurt and no arrests had been made late Friday in 
connection with the shooting, De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willmon and the 16-year-old were arrested Thursday night at Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center, De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to the hospital to talk to the 16-year-old that was injured," De Los 
Santos said. "And (Willmon) comes walking in with his head busted open and 
bleeding all over the place. And the 16-year-old suspect was dropping him off 
at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 De Los Santos said he was amazed at the coincidence of two rival gangs driving 
by the Wendy Drive house within 30 minutes of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have gone out and bought a Lotto ticket," De Los Santos said. "I 
mean, what are the odds?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old suspect is at Juvenile Hall awaiting a court hearing and 
Willmon was being held on $5,000 bail. Willmon was scheduled to be arraigned 
Tuesday.

HOME ROBBERY SUSPECT, 17, IS ACCUSED IN CAFE MOZART KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities said Friday that a juvenile arrested this week in a thwarted home 
invasion robbery in Fountain Valley is also responsible for a fatal shooting 
last month at the Cafe Mozart in Westminster's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Anderson has petitioned the Orange County Juvenile 
Court to try the suspect, a 17-year-old Hawthorne resident, as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he plans to file an array of charges against him, from murder 
and attempted murder, to residential robbery, assault and active participation 
in a criminal street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for gang members to be involved in both of these types of 
crimes" -- home invasion robberies and cafe shootings, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all counts, Anderson said, the juvenile faces maximum sentence 
of life without possibility of parole, plus 28 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 26, two men walked into the crowded Cafe Mozart, spraying the 
coffeehouse with bullets. A 20-year-old Garden Grove man was killed, a 
16-year-old boy was paralyzed and two women were slightly wounded in what 
police said was a confrontation between rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the shooting, Anderson said, police identified the juvenile now in 
custody, and "we had every police agency in this world looking for him. We 
feared he would flee the state because of the mobility of Asian gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile was one of two people arrested when police were able to trace a 
911 call from a home near Harbor Boulevard and Edinger Avenue in Fountain 
Valley during a home invasion robbery on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at the house, just before 5 a.m., two of the four suspects 
ran out of the back of the house and drove away. Police arrested the man and 
the youth a short distance away, later identifying the juvenile as an escapee 
from a correctional facility.

women's ordination, gay rights, the "pro-choice" movement on abortion and 
various theological issues will be launched Sunday by the Rev. Kenton Puls, 
pastor of Canoga Park Lutheran Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Affiliated with the staunchly conservative Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, the 
Canoga Park congregation averages about 400 people at its Sunday services -- 
the largest attendance of any San Fernando Valley church in the denomination, 
according to Wayne Storm, evangelism chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The sermons' perspective on modern church life may be somewhat predictable, 
Storm said. "We're somewhere to the right of the John Birch Society," he said. 
</P>

 Services are at 8:15 and 10:45 a.m. Sunday. The church is at 7357 Jordan Ave.

TAX DAY RUSH KEEPS VALLEY'S POST OFFICES BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rush began early Friday afternoon at the Van Nuys Main Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2 p.m., cars were already backed up for a block and postal officials were 
rushing to set up a drive-through drop-off. And for every car but one, there 
seemed to be an excuse or maybe a nod toward tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tax day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people in the Valley, they are conditioned that this is the place to 
come on tax night," said post office spokesperson Terri Bouffiou. "It is a fun, 
crazy way to spend your Friday night." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal clerk Elizabeth Perez has watched the annual parade for 10 years. "I 
think it started early because it's the weekend, but we will stay busy all 
night and still get stragglers coming in around 1 a.m.," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they are parked along the street and still filling out the forms 
with a calculator." 
</P>
<P>
 Post offices in Burbank, Canoga Park, Encino, Northridge, Sherman Oaks, Studio 
City, Sylmar and Woodland Hills, in addition to Van Nuys, stayed open until 
midnight on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in line had had anything but a traditional tax preparation season, 
according to tax officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Villalobos, spokeswoman at the IRS Fresno Service Center, said the 
Jan. 17 earthquake caused filing problems for many Los Angeles residents who 
did not have their damage documents organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Others delayed because of the federal tax increase passed last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new tax increase may have had an effect on people if they find that the 
new tax rate will make them pay more and it isn't possible because they don't 
have the money," Villalobos said. "They may have to pay more, but they get more 
time to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Those caught in that bind get three years to pay, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one man joining the postal rush had been tripped up by methods that 
were supposed to make filing easier and faster. "My home computer wouldn't 
print out the form," said a man who identified himself only as John, as he 
rushed to the Van Nuys post office to obtain a tax form. 
</P>
<P>
 And to add insult to injury, when he got into the post office he found out 
they were not carrying the forms he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got myself into my own trouble," he said. "I waited until the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Last-minute filers have been around as long as taxes themselves, according to 
officials. "Close to half of all taxpayers wait until the last few weeks to get 
their patriotic duty in the mail," said Jim Reber, spokesperson for state 
Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, 7.5 million people filed before the last day, Reber estimated, 
about 1 million fewer than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Five million more Californians were expected to file on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One man at the post office had no excuses for pushing the deadline, and said 
he was proud of it. "I am proud of being a last-minute procrastinator," Tony 
Delgado of Panorama City said with a laugh. "This year I am actually doing it 
on time because they owe me money." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said many of the drive-through customers simply throw their envelopes 
out their windows while others are afraid the mail might not get through. "They 
ask me, 'Are you sure it is going to get posted today' or they worry that they 
don't have enough postage," she said, as a man drove by anxiously handing her 
his taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 He mumbled something about making sure his forms make the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry. I got them in the box," she told him.

ACCUSED BOY TO REMAIN AT JUVENILE HALL; CRIME: REQUEST TO PUT TEACHER POISONING 
SUSPECT UNDER HOUSE ARREST IS DENIED. HE COULD FACE EIGHT YEARS IN DETENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old Littlerock High School student accused of poisoning his teacher 
by putting cleaning fluid in her Diet Pepsi broke into tears Friday after he 
was ordered to remain in custody at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have charged the boy, whose name is being withheld because of his 
age, with one count each of adulterating a beverage and assault with a deadly 
weapon. If convicted of the pair of felonies, the youth could face a maximum 
sentence of five to eight years in detention. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing before Commissioner Antoinette Liewen, an attorney representing 
the high school sophomore asked Liewen to place the boy under house arrest and 
release him into the custody of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believed it was a practical joke that had occurred," said attorney Ronald 
V. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Liewen sided with prosecutors when she denied the defense request and ordered 
the boy to remain in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practical jokes can lead to people's death," Liewen said. "This is a very 
serious matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later the boy's father reached over and squeezed his son's leg in a 
show of support. Then they both began wiping tears from their eyes. Visibly 
shaken even before the hearing began, the boy's father declined to comment on 
his son's case except for a single sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love him a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The events leading to Friday's hearing began April 7, when Susan Ennis, 32, an 
English teacher at Littlerock High School, became violently ill after taking a 
sip from a can of Diet Pepsi that had been laced with cleaning fluid, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives began interviewing dozens of students and subsequently 
arrested a boy from Ennis' second-period class after some of his peers told 
authorities they had heard the youth boasting that he had poured cleaning fluid 
in the soda can as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis was released from Palmdale Hospital Medical Center in stable condition 
on Tuesday, ending a five-day stay. She has been recuperating at home and 
school officials say it is uncertain when she will return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Andy Reynolds said his office chose to file felony counts 
against the youth based on the seriousness of the crime, noting that it remains 
to be seen whether Ennis has suffered permanent damage to her kidneys and 
esophagus as a result of the poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a teacher who was vomiting in class and writhing in pain," Reynolds 
said. "I don't consider the pain she suffered for at least five days to be a 
prank." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is scheduled to return to court April 22, when a probation report 
will be presented that will recommend to the court how the boy should be 
punished if he pleads guilty or proceeds to trial, Reynolds said. The report 
could also recommend that the youth be sentenced to six months of informal 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the judge presiding over the case will decide. If the case goes to 
court, a trial date has been set for May 2.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; ALARCON STAFFER TO LEAVE FOR KCBS POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon's director of communications is leaving 
at the end of April to become director of media relations for KCBS-TV, the 
councilman announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil MacDonald, who has overseen Alarcon's media relations since August, said 
she will begin her new job in May.Prior to working for Alarcon, MacDonald 
worked for a video outlet firm designing a model for a Hispanic video store. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also worked as director of Hispanic public relations for a public 
relations firm and public relations director for KMEX-TV in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald's departure is the third staff change Alarcon's office has undergone 
in his short tenure. In February, Alarcon hired Mayor Richard Riordan's press 
secretary, Annette Castro, to be his chief of staff in City Hall. In March, Leo 
Briones, an Alarcon deputy overseeing mail operations, quit to become vice 
president of a public relations firm in Woodland Hills. Briones has not been 
replaced. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOOLCHILDREN FOCUS ON THEIR SIMILARITIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From a distance, the 300 children mingling on the grassy slopes of Veterans 
Memorial Park looked like just that -- 300 kids playing. And that, said 
organizers of this interaction between students from Sylmar Elementary School 
and students with disabilities from Lowman Special Education Center, was the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the same as us," said Ivan Navarro, 12, one of 58 children from 
Sylmar Elementary to spend the day with about 250 special education students 
from North Hollywood. "They have the same feelings as us. They go to school and 
learn just like we do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of what administrators hope will become an annual event, the 
children from both schools spent a day together in the park. Under hazy blue 
skies and a gentle breeze, the children shared games, picnic lunches and 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for kids to be exposed to something they are unfamiliar with," said 
Sylmar teacher Jay Yarnell. "It's just another aspect of experiencing real 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Several teachers from Lowman visited Sylmar before the outing to teach 
students about some of the physical and emotional disabilities that their 
pupils have. Steven Mark, administrative coordinator for the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's division of special education, said as more special 
education students move onto regular campuses, the need for such interaction 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
 For the special education students, the exchange offered an opportunity to 
practice some of the social skills they learn in class every day. Sylmar 
students pushed Lowman students in their wheelchairs in a relay race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get our kids out into the community, into a natural environment," 
said Lowman Principal Helen Hartel. She said the school is making an effort to 
include more community-based education programs in its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the Sylmar students, the lesson was one they wouldn't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the park, sixth-graders Elizabeth Mendoza and Eunice Curiel 
took turns holding a tiny three-year-old girl who couldn't see or hear, 
bouncing her softly against their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to treat them another way. We should treat them the way we 
want to be treated," said 12-year-old Elizabeth. "We're both human." SUSAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; POLICE HELP ORGANIZE SAFE HOUSE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon to be seen in the windows of homes across the San Fernando Valley, a 
six-inch green triangle is well on its way to becoming a household symbol for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley 
Division, several other Valley divisions are helping schools and Neighborhood 
Watch groups organize the Safe House program -- which identifies a pre-screened 
residence as a sanctuary for children to flee in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by a series of molester attacks on children in the fall, the West 
Valley division launched the Safe House program in January, targeting all 32 of 
its region's elementary schools. More than 50 residents have already been 
screened and are awaiting the arrival of the triangles to place in their 
windows. In addition, the Safe Houses will be marked with a smaller triangle 
painted on the curb next to the address. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Lead Officer Stephanie Tisdale of the West Valley Division modeled the 
effort after a program begun at Van Nuys' Erwin Street Elementary School in 
1992, in an attempt to get the community involved in making streets safer for 
children. Only one Erwin Street student has used a Safe House and in that case 
it was a non-emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited through Neighborhood Watch groups and schools, the Safe House 
volunteers must be screened by police, who will check for criminal records and 
require two recommendations from neighbors. The residents must agree to be home 
from 7 to 9 a.m. and between 2 and 4 p.m. when children walk to and from 
school. In addition, the triangles will be numbered through a complex system so 
police will be able to spot unauthorized ones that might be placed in windows 
to lure children inside. SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VALLEY IS ADDED TO ANTI-PROSTITUTION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley may become part of a five-year pilot program being 
considered by the state Legislature that would allow police to take away the 
cars of men convicted twice of soliciting prostitutes with the same vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at the request of concerned merchants along crime-ridden Sepulveda 
Boulevard, State Senator David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) convinced Assemblywoman 
Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson) to add the Valley to AB 2667. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the program is to judge the effect of confiscation on the 
prostitution problem," said Sandy Miller, Roberti's district office chief of 
staff. "This problem is one of the senator's highest priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, AB 2667 would allow the Signal Hill, Long Beach and Valley 
communities to pass five-year ordinances that enable police to declare a motor 
vehicle a public nuisance if it is used by a person convicted of soliciting a 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would be able to impound the person's vehicle permanently upon a second 
conviction on the same charge using the same vehicle. Exceptions would be made 
for stolen cars and vehicles owned by spouses or others not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley police and neighborhood activists are urging passage of the bill, which 
must clear the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Roberti chairs, by April 26. 
It was passed on to the Senate last month after a 62-0 vote of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch President Flip Smith, who asked Roberti's 
office for help combatting prostitutes, said the idea is simply sound 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you eliminate the customer, no matter what the package is, you can't sell 
it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Vice Sgt. Larry Mauldin said the measure would most affect repeat 
offenders. Under current law, he said, vehicles are not impounded when used by 
persons soliciting prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of married individuals who do this," Mauldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they knew their car might be impounded and they might have to explain it 
to their wife, it would have an impact." JEFF SCHNAUFER

<P>
 One thousand balloons will float through the air above Warner Park Sunday, 
carrying with them the thanks of people who have been given a second shot at 
life and the hope that others will get that same chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred organ-transplant recipients will gather at the park to honor 
the memory of their donors and give thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will release the "environmentally safe" balloons that carry organ 
donor cards in the hope that whoever finds the cards will fill them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on the balloons are the words: "Don't take your organs to heaven. . . 
. Heaven knows we need them here!" 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an enormous long waiting list for people waiting for organs," said 
Barbara Schulman, a registered nurse and adviser to the Los Angeles chapter of 
the Transplant Recipients International Organization, a support group for 
recipients and their families. "Each donor can donate about seven different 
organs and many different tissues." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday begins national Organ Donor Awareness Week, but Schulman said: "Donor 
Awareness Week starts every day for these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The several hundred recipients and family members will gather at the park at 9 
a.m., and their picnic will begin about 11. REBECCA BRYANT

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RECYCLING PROGRAM TO STAR ON EARTH DAY

 Burbank will be showing off its recycling program and teaching lessons about 
the environment during its Earth Day celebration next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our center is doing well and we wanted to show it to people," said Hope 
McAloon, a Burbank recycling specialist.Burbank began recycling in 1982, making 
its program one of the oldest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling in Burbank has grown from 400 tons of cans, bottles, newspapers and 
cardboard per month in 1982 to 3,000 tons last month. A big reason for the 
increase was the automated trash-pickup program that started last year, McAloon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of Burbank garbage collection customers participate in the system, 
in which trash, yard trimmings and recyclables are collected in separate bins 
by a hydraulic arm. The program's phase-in started in April, 1993, and the 
entire city will be served by September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth Day event will take place Friday from 2 to 6 p.m. at the Burbank 
Recycle Center, 500 S. Flower St. at the corner of Verdugo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours of a new learning center, demonstrations of the recycling process and 
exhibits on water and electricity conservation are included. A local naturalist 
will show how insects and worms turn yard trimmings and vegetable peels into 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The event represents one of the city's larger Earth Day celebrations since 
1990, she added. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; JEWISH STUDENTS HEAR WORDS OF HOPE FOR ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing blue and white to celebrate Yom HaAtzmaut, Israeli Independence Day, 
students at Abraham Joshua Heschel Day School on Friday heard the sounds of 
hope for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 From two peace activists -- one Jewish, one Arab -- the students at the Jewish 
day school heard talk of compromise and of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choice of peace is in your hands now. You are the future," said Monir 
Deeb, who was born and raised in Gaza and is on the board of the Arab-American 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside Deeb, Carole Kracer, regional director of Americans for Peace 
Now, told students they were too used to hearing about the deeds of radicals.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we want to offset," she said. "Jews and Palestinians can 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly formed Arab-Jewish Speakers Bureau is trying to prove that point. 
Organizing the effort to promote the peace process are groups that include the 
American Jewish Congress, and the National Assn. of Arab Americans, as well as 
Kracer's and Deeb's organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arab-Jewish Speakers Bureau was formed last December, but after the Feb. 
25 massacre in Hebron, the group gained a increased sense of urgency. It plans 
to send volunteer speakers to community and religious groups and schools to 
discuss Middle East peace prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a Jewish day school, we want to educate our youngsters (as to) what's 
involved in the peace process, what the issues are, to show all perspectives in 
the process," Luisa Latham, director of the school's Judaic studies program, 
said before the speakers took the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Americans for a Safe Israel, will speak to Heschel students. That 
organization has criticized the new speakers bureau because of the message it 
may send about the position of American Jews, some of whom oppose the surrender 
of any territory to Palestinian control. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers' appearance created a debate among ninth-graders who lingered 
after the event to talk to Deeb and Kracer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as much their country as ours," said Talia Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in Jewish day school since kindergarten and I've learned it's ours. 
It's not theirs. It's ours," Marla Soled responded, saying that all her life 
she'd heard of the conflicts, of the warring. "It's hard to change your opinion 
by one person speaking. I'm more narrow-minded than I should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Soled is just the person Kracer is trying to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I opened her eyes," she said after the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 But one child's question was harder to answer. With a question so simple that 
only a child could ask but so complex that few adults could answer, 11-year-old 
Matt Kramer waded into the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody wants peace," he shyly asked, "why are the boys still throwing 
stones at the soldiers; and why are the soldiers still shooting people? Why is 
the killing still going on?" REBECCA BRYANT

 The last store to return to the Woodland Hills Promenade Mall after January's 
earthquake celebrates its official reopening today, three months after losing 
part of its wall and roof in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the I. Magnin outlet at 6101 Owensmouth Ave. marks the end of 
the mall's repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fully functioning now," said Catherine Duke, concierge at the Woodland 
Hills mall. "It's back to business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Saks Fifth Avenue store remains closed, Duke said, and there are no 
plans to reopen it. Elizabeth Pedersen-Knapp, marketing director for the mall, 
said the damage was too extensive and Saks doesn't want to invest in the 
repairs. KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; REPAIR COSTS TO LIMIT USE OF DONATED PARK 
</P>

 Once privately owned by Lockheed Corp., Robert E. Gross Park will make its 
debut next month as a public facility, but with a jury-rigged irrigation system 
and cracked asphalt, and without playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deed to the park was handed over by Lockheed officials in a December 
ceremony, Burbank officials were delighted with the gift and budgeted $200,000 
to make repairs. But after acquiring ownership, the city discovered that it 
would take up to $700,000 to fix everything needed, Parks and Recreation 
Director Mary Alvord said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The park has for years been a popular spot for large groups, events and 
company picnics. The schedule for this summer is already filling up. Rather 
than close the facility for the summer, Alvord said the city has opted to 
complete the major repairs in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to sit down and figure out what exactly we have to do," she said. 
Playground equipment had to be removed because it did not meet the standards 
for a public facility. Asphalt in a picnic area has been cracked and warped by 
tree roots. Fencing needs to be replaced, and at first it seemed like the 
irrigation system for the ball fields would not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going to have to water the fields by hand," Alvord said. 
Officials were able to temporarily fix the system so it can last until major 
repairs can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had planned to use the ball fields for league games this year, but 
instead the fields will be used only as practice fields or for T-ball, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvord said she hoped to replace the playground equipment so that it meets the 
standards for a public park, which includes handicapped accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4.8-acre park is named for the founder of Lockheed, who had been chairman 
until his death in 1967. Lockheed began a pullout from Burbank in 1990, moving 
nearly all of its operations to either Palmdale or Georgia. ED BOND

DRUNK DRIVER SENTENCED TO PRISON IN DEATH OF 2 STUDENTS

 A Canoga Park man whose car ran a red light and slammed into another car, 
killing two teen-age college students, was sentenced Friday to seven years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leslie A. Dunn sentenced Hector Ruiz after the 
22-year-old man pleaded guilty to two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter 
while intoxicated in the Jan. 6 crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara N. Paull of Chatsworth and Stephanie Tourikian of Ontario, Canada, 
both 19, were killed when Ruiz's car ran a red light at Corbin Avenue and 
Roscoe Boulevard and sheared their car in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents have long complained that the intersection is too dangerous. 
Paull and Tourikian, both students at UC Riverside, were killed at the same 
location where a 57-year-old woman died in an accident two weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported that there were 15 accidents at the intersection in 1993. The 
deaths of Paull and Tourikian prompted police to crack down on speeders in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Ruiz was driving about 80 m.p.h. on Roscoe when his car ran a 
red light and smashed into the car that Paull was driving on Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz had been drinking before the accident and had a blood alcohol level of 
0.20%, which is 2 1/2 times the legal limit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven years in prison was the best I could get," Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew W. 
Diamond said. "I sent him to prison, but that wasn't enough. I want Barbara and 
Stephanie back." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz had no prior convictions, according to authorities, who said the sentence 
is standard in vehicular manslaughter cases where the defendant has a clean 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents of both women addressed the court, expressing their grief and 
sense of loss while showing portraits of their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge described it as the most tragic case she had ever seen," Diamond 
said.

4 MEN SENTENCED IN RAPES, ROBBERIES IN VALLEY PARKS; CRIME: ALLEGED LEADER GETS 
45 YEARS FOR SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT HAD THE AREA ON EDGE. ANOTHER DEFENDANT 
GETS 20 YEARS.

<P>
 Four transients involved in a series of late-night armed robberies and rapes 
in west San Fernando Valley parks pleaded guilty to various charges Friday, 
leading to a 45-year prison sentence for the alleged ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Martinez Rocha, 21, pleaded guilty to 10 felony counts -- three rapes 
and seven robberies -- stemming from attacks May 30, 1993, in Shadow Ranch Park 
and June 16 in Chase Park, both in West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first incident, prosecutors said Rocha raped two teen-age girls who 
were lying only a few feet from four friends who were tied up with their own 
shoelaces and belts. Another girl was sexually assaulted in the second 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha also admitted robbing one person June 11 in Chatsworth Park North. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff sentenced Rocha to the maximum 
term of 45 years in prison. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors 
agreed to drop 10 other charges that could have added 16 years to his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocha won't see the light of day again until at least 2015," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch. California law allows prisoners to be released after 
serving only half their sentence if they work and stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant, 30-year-old Francisco Chavez Ramirez, pleaded guilty to 
seven felony counts, including one rape, in the May 30 attack. Hoff sentenced 
Ramirez to 20 years in prison in the plea bargain. If Ramirez had been 
convicted on all charges, he could have been locked up for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ramirez's attorney beside him, Rocha's lawyer, Dennis Cohen, said: "Both 
counsel felt it was an appropriate disposition based on the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The third defendant, Jose Rivas Torres, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of 
robbery in the June 11 incident. He was ordered to prison for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who acted as a getaway driver during the June 11 robbery, Jose Guadalupe 
Chavez, 22, pleaded guilty to being an accessory and was sentenced to 16 months 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good the victims will be able to get on with their lives and won't have 
to relive this nightmare," Fisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor previously said she was forced to drop six felony counts 
against Rocha and Ramirez stemming from an alleged attack May 28 in Shadow 
Ranch Park because the victims were not willing to testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocha was arrested June 19 at the park during a surveillance operation by the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of attacks last summer led police to issue a warning for residents 
to avoid parks after dark. The arrests of the four men ended the crime spree, 
but authorities warn that the parks may still be dangerous after nightfall.

DEMOLITION IS URGED FOR TWO CSUN STRUCTURES; QUAKE: ENGINEERING REPORT SAYS 
DAMAGES TO PARKING GARAGE AND APARTMENT COMPLEX ARE TOO SEVERE TO REPAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The partially collapsed Cal State Northridge parking structure and the 
seven-story University Tower Apartments sustained such severe damage in the 
January earthquake that they should be demolished rather than repaired, the 
university's chief damage consultant has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 In newly released reports, the Los Angeles-based engineering firm of 
Law/Crandall Inc. told university officials that it would be difficult to 
salvage the still-standing portions of the 2,500-space garage and that the 
dormitory is so battered that having repair workers in the building would be 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 The two structures are the only ones on the 353-acre campus that the 
consultant will recommend for demolition, said Chris Baylis, Law/Crandall's 
senior projects manager at CSUN. Even so, university officials said they plan 
to sponsor additional reviews of the two structures before making final 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake jolted 
Southern California and damaged virtually every major building at CSUN, campus 
officials have consistently maintained that talk of potential demolitions was 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports estimate the university's loss for the two structures alone would 
be about $51.8 million. That is based on estimated replacement costs of 
approximately $27.3 million for the parking structure, including nearly $1.6 
million in demolition expenses, and about $24.4 million for the high-rise, 
including $1.3 million for demolition and asbestos abatement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Northridge campus, students and faculty have widely assumed the remains 
of the parking structure built in 1991 -- which became one of the most visible 
symbols of the quake's power -- will be demolished. The Law/Crandall report 
said about half of the four-level concrete garage on Zelzah Avenue is still 
standing. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's report, however, added, "We believe it would be difficult to 
selectively demolish in order to reuse parts of the structure" and cited cracks 
in the exterior concrete columns of the still-standing portions. Therefore, "We 
are making a preliminary recommendation to demolish the entire structure," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower apartments, built in the late 1960s but closed since 1991 because of 
seismic safety and asbestos hazards, sustained "widespread and severe" 
structural damage in the January quake, according to that building's report. In 
particular, enclosed stairways in the building's four wings have separated from 
the main structure by up to 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, university officials had considered demolishing the 
tower, saying it is too expensive to repair. The Law/Crandall report reinforces 
that plan, concluding, "Due to the hazards of working in the damaged structure, 
the extensive damage and deficiencies in the overall structural system, we do 
not believe it is reasonable to repair the structure." 
</P>

BOY HIT BY BASEBALL DIED OF HEART TROUBLE, AUTOPSY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Crescenta boy who died several hours after he was hit in the head with a 
baseball had a fatal heart condition, officials said Friday, confirming his 
parents' suspicions that the accidental hit did not contribute to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy results showed that Timothy Richard Herman, 9, had an enlarged heart 
and that several tumors were present in the heart muscle, said Scott Carrier of 
the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death was related to heart conditions and not directly related to being 
struck by a baseball," Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy died just before midnight Wednesday, several hours after he was hit in 
the head, just below his helmet, with a pitched ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-grader continued to play the game -- pitching several innings and 
garnering three hits for his team, the Jasco Jammers. 
</P>
<P>
 After returning home, Timmy complained of pain in his leg. He was found by his 
mother several minutes later lying unconscious in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 While the autopsy showed a "bruising of the scalp present on the left side of 
the head," no skull fractures or brain injuries were noted, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmy's parents, Rob and Karen Herman, sought to disassociate his death with 
baseball Friday. They had previously speculated that their son's death was not 
related to the sport.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the conviction of the family that baseball contributed to his life 
rather than his death," said Rev. Rick Wright, speaking for the family.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a pastor at the Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Glendale, said the 
family wants Timmy to be remembered for his talents in many sports, including 
baseball, basketball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermans and their other children, Josh, 14, and Lindsey, 11, are active in 
La Crescenta sports activities. Rob Herman coached Timmy's baseball team in the 
Mustang League for 9- and 10-year olds. The league is overseen by the Crescenta 
Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are tentatively planned Monday at the First Baptist Church in 
La Crescenta.

THIEVES ASSAULT GUARD AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A security guard was bound and beaten by four masked men who burglarized a 
computer store Friday and escaped with 14 laptop computers valued at about 
$28,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard was treated at a local hospital for cuts to his head and will remain 
overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was feeling dizzy and couldn't see the number to dial 911 and was forced 
to dial the operator," said Detective Robert Johansen of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard told authorities that he was checking on the Comp USA store 
in a shopping mall at 6400 Owensmouth Ave. at about 5:15 a.m. when four men 
wearing ski masks drove up in a van and pulled him inside, where they tied him 
up and beat him with the butt of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 With the guard inside the van, the thieves crashed the vehicle, which was 
stolen, against a side door of the store, ripping the door open, police said. 
The men grabbed the laptop computers and fled in a second van. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no suspects as of Friday evening.

MAN ARRESTED IN MOLESTATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saugus man was arrested Friday on charges that he sexually molested three 
women more than two decades ago, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against William Lynch, 64, were the result of 1992 therapy 
sessions during which one of his alleged victims recalled attacks on her and 
her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch was charged with twelve counts of lewd acts involving minors that 
allegedly occurred between March 1967 and July 1972, said Sandy Gibbons, a 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney' office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, who is being held on $600,000 bail, will be arraigned Monday in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the complaint was Lynch's former girlfriend, Mildred Human 
Fleetwood, 60, who now lives in Florida. She was charged with eight counts of 
child molestation, but police do not have her in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons declined to discuss the cases against Lynch and Fleetwood other than 
to say that her office felt there was sufficient evidence to charge the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged victim, who told authorities that memories of the attacks surfaced 
during therapy sessions, is now in her 30s and a California resident. She said 
she also remembered attacks on two others in her neighborhood, Gibbons said. 
These two other alleged victims now live in Tennessee and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 A law enacted earlier this year made it possible to charge Lynch and Fleetwood 
for crimes they allegedly committed long after the statute of limitations ran 
out.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; MANY VALLEY CATHOLICS WELCOME VATICAN DECISION ON ALTAR 
GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presence of women reading Scripture and occasionally distributing 
Communion at Roman Catholic Masses may have muted any displeasure by the 
tradition-minded over the Vatican decision this week to permit altar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you allow women to give out Communion, then altar girls are nothing," 
noted Father Robert McNamara, pastor of St. John Eudes in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was welcomed by Bishop Armando X. Ochoa, who oversees the 
48-parish San Fernando Pastoral Region in the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a mother who happens to be a lector (who reads Scripture) at 
the Mass or a eucharistic minister (who distributes Communion to parishioners 
or shut-ins) and you do not allow her daughter to be an altar server, it was a 
very difficult pastoral situation," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many U.S. parishes, including an estimated 20 of 48 parishes 
in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, permitted altar girls, 
usually aged 8 to 14, to assist the priest while he is celebrating Mass, 
lighting candles and presenting him with bread and wine to be consecrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice had grown since 1983, when a revision in church laws did not 
explicitly forbid girls to join boys as altar servers. American bishops, 
governing parishes which jumped at the chance, asked the Vatican to clarify the 
issue about a year ago. At that time, new parish requests for altar girls were 
put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I went around visiting parishes, invariably the question came up from 
girls, 'Why can't we be altar servers?' " Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles archdiocese will issue guidelines to the parishes next week, 
said spokesman Father Gregory Coiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The muted traditionalist Catholic objections to altar girls stem partly from 
concerns that advocates of priesthood for women would win another small 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Catholics have worried that Vatican-approved altar girls "would 
create a comfort level with women exercising some kind of liturgical role," 
said Gabriel Meyer, associate editor of the Encino-based National Catholic 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed but not surprised by the Vatican decision," said Jack 
Kocienski of Camarillo, president of the conservative California Coalition of 
Concerned Catholics. "It may give some women the false hope that they could 
become priests." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Kocienski and church officials noted, the papal-approved announcement 
Wednesday described the change as an interpretation of existing church law and 
has no effect on the doctrinal prohibition against women priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Another traditionalist objection comes from church history. 
</P>
<P>
 Altar servers now perform duties in a Mass that were once done by an acolyte, 
an ordained position that was considered a boy's first step toward priesthood. 
But the modern altar server -- boy or girl -- is not ordained. Yet the 
symbolism remains for some older Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a misuse of girls to have them assist at Mass because this has 
been the traditional means of young men to enter seminary, but we are living in 
a feminist culture and women want to do everything that men do," said Charles 
Belting of Northridge. He described himself as an obedient Catholic even as he 
expressed misgivings in an interview. "I follow whatever the Holy Father 
approves," said Belting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship and Sacraments, in outlining the 
change, said that altar servers represent "a noble tradition" that has led to 
priests and must continue to be supported. 
</P>
<P>
 But editor Tod Tamberg of the archdiocese's weekly newspaper said more was at 
stake than inspiring future priests. The altar role not only fosters thoughts 
of priesthood in boys but also imparts to children a reverence for the sacred 
that most ex-altar boys would affirm lasts for a lifetime, he said in an 
editorial this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching our children -- boys and girls -- to reverence the Sacred in our 
church and in our lives is something all of us can agree fits the definition of 
a pastoral need," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Francis J. Weber, archdiocesan archivist based at the San Fernando 
Mission, said church traditions die hard. "Some traditions should die, some 
should be maintained. But traditions should always serve the time you're in," 
Weber added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Altar girls "have been vastly accepted" by Burbank's St. Francis Xavier 
Catholic Church since they were introduced three or four years ago, said Holy 
Cross Father William J. Neidhardt, the senior pastor. "I'm very happy (Vatican 
approval) finally came through." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Edward J. Kaminski, an associate pastor at St. Francis, added that 
there is a practical benefit too: "The girls have been more enthusiastic than 
the boys and more reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, Granada Hills' St. Euphrasia parish, which has not had altar 
girls, is looking forward to training them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an extremely difficult time getting guys to serve," said Father 
Raymond A. Saplis of St. Euphrasia. "I think once we get the girls in, there 
will be competition for recognition between the boys and girls."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REDEVELOPMENT PLAN WON'T HINDER AGENCY, AUDIT 
FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's proposed $1.1-billion redevelopment plan won't hinder the Castaic 
Lake Water Agency's ability to pay for the Rio Vista water treatment plan, 
according to a city-commissioned financial audit released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency filed a lawsuit March 31 to block the city's Community Recovery 
Plan, saying it siphons off property tax revenue and hurts the agency's 
repayment of $132 million in bonds issued to pay for the water treatment plant 
and other debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Council members adopted the plan in February to help the 
city recover from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, improve its 
infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable housing. The plan 
would be administered by a city community redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of four years of financial reports shows the water agency is taking 
in more than enough property tax money to pay for the bonds even without funds 
lost to the redevelopment plan, according to James Regan, a financial 
consultant hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've still got more than they thought they'd have, even with the Community 
Recovery Plan," said Don Duckworth, the city's community recovery manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like if I borrowed $100 from you and I for some other reason come up 30 
to 40 cents short, I say I can't pay you back," said Assistant City Manager Ken 
Pulskamp. "It's such a small amount it's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Any difficulty the water agency has in paying its debts is actually coming 
from a drop in water sales and connection fee revenues, according to Regan's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Lake Water Agency officials haven't seen the document yet, but said 
they strongly disagree with its findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are absolutely wrong," said Bob Sagehorn, agency general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagehorn said the $132 million in bonds cover only a third of the cost of the 
treatment plant. He added that the property tax revenue that would be lost to 
the redevelopment agency also would hinder the agency's ability to obtain 
future financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The water agency's lawsuit accuses the city of improperly declaring the 
recovery plan exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act because it's 
an emergency plan that stemmed from the earthquake. The suit alleges that only 
20% of the plan addresses earthquake-related needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't they simply use the city share of the (property tax) they now 
receive . . . ?" said Sagehorn. "Why does the city have to go in and create 
this phony redevelopment agency based on the earthquake?" 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to review Regan's report at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope these programs don't get held up for this minor amount of money for 
the water agency," Pulskamp said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COLLEGE TO GET $1 MILLION TO CONVERT OLD 
LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state will give Antelope Valley College $1 million for the conversion of 
the school's 33-year-old library into a student learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The community college is nearing completion on the construction of a two-story 
library that will be more than twice the size of the one now in use. With 
remodeling, the old 14,000-square-foot library building will allow for the 
consolidation and expansion of learning labs scattered around campus, said Bill 
Fellers, assistant superintendent of facilities planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should really be a fantastic facility," he said. "We now operate in very 
tight quarters off of the bookstore and in different locations. This will bring 
everything on campus together in one area." 
</P>
<P>
 The learning center will offer self-help and assisted math, reading and 
writing labs as well as computers. It will also house disabled student 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Remodeling is expected to take about a year, with the center planned for 
opening in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 State funding has already been provided for $120,000 in preliminary work 
related to the remodeling. Approval of the $1 million in construction funds 
leaves the college needing an estimated $500,000 to furnish the building. 
Fellers said the college is hoping to also receive that from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The school most recently broke ground on a $1.6-million child development 
center. With nearly 9,000 square feet, the center will serve the dual purpose 
of providing another day-care opportunity in the community and offering early 
childhood education students a chance for hands-on experience. The state is 
paying nearly $1.4 million of the construction cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last month, the state Department of Finance approved $7.5 million for the 
construction of a two-story applied arts building at the college, the school's 
first new classroom building in more than two decades. The building will 
include 10 lecture rooms, 24 faculty offices and 16 to 18 laboratories. At 
54,000 square feet, it will be the largest building on the 125-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the applied arts building may begin as early as June and is 
expected to take 21 months. It will be ready for use in the fall of 1996. The 
state is also expected to fund the $3 million needed to equip the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The college, with an enrollment of slightly less than 10,000, is also seeking 
state approval of a $100-million, 10,000-student satellite campus on 100 acres 
in Palmdale. That approval could come as early as August. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellers said the new $6-million library building, at 33,500 square feet, will 
provide students more than twice as much space than in the school's old library 
building, built in 1961.

A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?; NOT FOR ANGELS; BASEBALL: THEY SCORE SEVEN RUNS IN THE 
NINTH TO TIE AND THEN BEAT THE BLUE JAYS, 14-13, IN THE 10TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was the most remarkable comeback since Dick Schofield's grand slam capped 
an eight-run ninth inning to carry the Angels to victory over Detroit on Aug. 
29, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 After letting a three-run lead turn into a seven-run deficit when the Toronto 
Blue Jays rolled up a pair of five-run innings in the eighth and ninth, the 
Angels rallied for seven runs in the bottom of the ninth and pulled out a most 
improbable 14-13 victory in front of what was left of a crowd of 20,413 at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel mentally exhausted, but we'll take it," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
said. "We were able to give up 10 runs, score seven and win the game. This 
ranks as one of the top two comebacks I've been involved with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels came out of spring training with the firm belief they had the 
lineup to contend for the title in the newly realigned American League West. 
Sure, the pitching was a little shaky, but they felt they would do some damage 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday night was any indication, this is going to be a clubhouse full of 
tired arms and happy hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Reynolds, the 11th Angel batter of the ninth inning, hit a fly ball 
that carried over the head of Toronto right fielder Joe Carter and bounced into 
the seats for a ground-rule double that scored two runs and swept the Angels 
into extra innings. Rex Hudler, running for Bo Jackson, would have scored 
easily if the ball had stayed in the park. Gary DiSarcina grounded out to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Reynolds doesn't hit the ball so hard, we win it then and there," Rodgers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the capping blow of a most improbable rally as the Angels strung 
together five singles, three walks, a sacrifice fly and Reynolds' big blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto had two runners on in the top of the 10th but Joe Carter lined out to 
left to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two Angels -- Chad Curtis and Jim Edmonds -- to hit in the 10th 
struck out, but Tim Salmon beat out a roller to third and Chili Davis walked. 
Then Damion Easley, whose error on a slow ground ball in the eighth inning 
allowed the Blue Jays to score four unearned runs, lined a single to left and 
the Angels were celebrating around home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the ninth inning, it was quiet on the bench," Easley said. "Buck said, 
'Let's get some good at-bats up there,' and everyone took it to heart, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get one runner on and then you say, 'Let's get, two.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie first baseman Eduardo Perez had two home runs, Salmon hit a two-run 
homer and Dwight Smith drove in two more to give the Angels a 6-3 lead in the 
eighth. But you never want to say "comfortable" and "lead" in the same sentence 
when talking about the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Blue Jay batters later, however, the Angels were trailing by two runs. 
And one inning after that, Toronto led by seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' Brian Anderson, a 21-year-old rookie, got his second start of the 
season and weathered a sometimes rocky six innings, giving up four hits and 
three runs. But thanks to the Salmon-Perez Power Co., he was in a position to 
pick up his second victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lewis was summoned to provide relief and cruised through a 1-2-3 
seventh. Then the Blue Jays re-enacted batting practice for the folks who 
arrived late and missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon White led off with a double to right-center and, one out later, Paul 
Molitor walked. Carter hit a slow roller to third and when Easley bobbled the 
ball, the bases were loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers called for left-hander Bob Patterson to face left-hand hitting John 
Olerud. So much for the percentages. Olerud, who won the batting title last 
season, lined a two-run single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher was next to emerge from the Angel bullpen and, like those before 
and after, soon was to leave the field with his head humbly hung. Ed Sprague 
greeted him with a double down the left-field line. Pat Borders followed with a 
single to left and Toronto led, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher gave up three consecutive hits -- by White, Alomar and Molitor -- and 
two runs in the ninth before giving way to Bill Sampen, who got an out after 
Carter's rocket to deep center ran out of fuel on the warning track. But Olerud 
singled and then rookie left fielder Carlos Delgado lined an opposite- field 
homer to left, his seventh on the year.

MAGIC PASSES A LAST TIME, WON'T COACH NEXT YEAR; LAKERS: AFTER A 105-100 DEFEAT 
BY THE TRAIL BLAZERS ELIMINATES L.A., HE SAYS LOSING IS TOO HARD TO TAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He made the no-look pass his signature, but Magic Johnson's move Friday was no 
surprise, only the confirmation of what he had been hinting at for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 He will finish the season as coach of the Lakers, but not return. 
</P>
<P>
 The only suspense left in the season that continued with the 105-100 loss to 
the Portland Trail Blazers at the Forum, which eliminated the Lakers from the 
playoffs for the first time since 1975-76, disappeared with the announcement 
Johnson had telegraphed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the fact of our record," Johnson said after falling to 5-6. "I never 
wanted to be a coach. I'm just sticking by that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a decision I'm comfortable with (because of) my lifestyle. I take 
losses too hard. I hurt. I take it home with me. It's tough for me to sit there 
and take it, hard. I wanted to win so bad. It just wouldn't be right for me 
because I think I would hurt myself more than help. Then I would hurt the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've enjoyed the time I've been here. It was a great experience, a great 
challenge. I hope they (the Lakers) benefited. I know I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson told the players of his decision after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's not sad or disappointing," longtime teammate James Worthy said. 
"It's just a decision we all have to respect and go on." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jerry West said current assistants Larry Drew and Michael 
Cooper would be considered to succeed Johnson, but otherwise avoided 
speculation that will center on three of the biggest names from the college 
ranks -- Rick Pitino of Kentucky, Roy Williams of Kansas and Bob Huggins of 
Cincinnati. The Lakers reportedly approached both Pitino and Williams before 
Randy Pfund was hired in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something, frankly, that I anticipated all along," West said. "This 
does not surprise me at all. We'll get busy immediately exploring all our 
options." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had said all along that he didn't expect to stay beyond the 16-game 
stint, going so far as to say Monday it was 70-30 against a return and that he 
had planned to make an announcement sometime this week and as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Friday came, Johnson said before the game he had reached a decision. He 
wouldn't say what it was, hoping not to take any of the limelight away from 
former teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who was honored at halftime to commemorate 
the 10th anniversary of becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer. Johnson 
said he would announce his intentions tonight before the game against the 
Clippers at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But when word that he would not be back began to spread shortly before tipoff, 
the Lakers made it official in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching requires a tremendous commitment of time and energy, so with all 
that Earvin is trying to accomplish in his life, I readily understand this 
decision," owner Jerry Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am appreciative that he gave it a try. I am even more convinced now that he 
would have been a great coach, and I'm sure our younger players benefited from 
his tutelage." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he disappointed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes and no," Buss said. "Yes, I would have preferred for him to stay. But I'm 
not disappointed, because I would not have wanted him to do something he did 
not want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "It's been a tough decision. I never thought that (originally). 
I thought, 'Boom, you're out. Sixteen -- hurry up and get here. But I enjoyed 
it. . . . This has been great for me, working with 12 guys, trying to teach 
them the Lakers way." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his agent, Lon Rosen, Johnson still has interest in buying a 
percentage of the Lakers. However, he said that there had not been any 
discussions on that front with Buss, and that issue was not a factor in the 
decision to stop coaching. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Pfund attended his first game since being fired as coach 3 1/2 weeks 
ago, saying he wanted to be on hand as the Lakers honored Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
The organization gave Abdul-Jabbar, who passed Wilt Chamberlain as all-time 
leading NBA scorer on April 5, 1984, a gold watch. Asked what his greatest 
memory from that day is, Abdul-Jabbar said: "The sense of relief that I had 
finally done it." Abdul-Jabbar also reiterated previous comments that he would 
be interested in coaching under the right circumstances. "I'd join somebody's 
staff if all of the logistics work out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers came in with a magic number of two to be knocked out of the 
playoffs, but were actually eliminated despite Denver's loss at Dallas because 
the Nuggets would advance on the fourth tiebreaker, best record against 
conference playoff teams. . . . Magic Johnson had threatened after Wednesday's 
29-point loss at Phoenix to shake up the starting lineup, especially the front 
line, but stayed with Vlade Divac, Elden Campbell and George Lynch against the

HEAR THEIR ENGINES ROAR; MICHAEL, FATHER MARIO ANDRETTI ENJOY LONG BEACH GRAND 
PRIX FOR SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY SEEM TO DRIVE THEIR BEST ON SEASIDE COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Long Beach has been special for the Andretti family. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, on a temporary racecourse laid out through seaside streets in 
1986, that Michael Andretti won his first Indy race. The Toyota Grand Prix of 
Long Beach was the first of 28 races won by the second-generation driver from 
Nazareth, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you win the first one is always somewhere you look forward to going 
back," Andretti said Friday during a lull in practice for Sunday's 20th 
anniversary race. "The way I won was great, too. It's always nice to win, but 
it's more exciting when it's close, and Al (Unser) Jr. and I had a great battle 
that day. I think the last 20 laps, we were just going at it, and then to win 
it that way over a guy like Al was . . . it made it a special way to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole family loves coming to Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's father, Mario, has won four times at Long Beach -- the United States 
Grand Prix Formula One race in 1977 and PPG Cup Indy car races in 1984, '85 and 
'87. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael and Mario were last in Long Beach together, two years ago, they 
were Newman-Haas teammates. Then Michael made his forgettable move to Formula 
One, a season with McLaren in which he finished only six of 13 races. Before 
the season was over, he had left McLaren and returned to Indy cars to join Chip 
Ganassi's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the special things about coming back is that I get to race against my 
dad again," Michael said. "When I left to go to Europe, it saddened me that I 
would never be in a race with him again after all the good times we had 
together. Having one more year with him will make this season extra special." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti has announced that this will be his last season, and Sunday's 
166-mile race around the nine-turn, 1.59-mile circuit will be his last at Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to really miss this place," Mario said. "Some places just treat you 
better than others, and no question, Long Beach has been good to me over the 
years. Believe me, I wish I could take some of that luck with me to other 
places where I can't seem to buy a break. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think back to coming here for the first time in 1975 (for a Formula 
5000 race) and seeing the city then, and seeing what it is today, there has 
been tremendous growth. I think it's a great credit to the city, and to Chris 
Pook and his Grand Prix organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "For any driver to win his home country's Grand Prix is very, very special, so 
to have won here has a great deal of personal meaning to me. It was such a 
great race and (Jody) Scheckter and I were nose to tail just about all the way. 
I managed to get by him at the end. Getting that trophy was sweet, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Andrettis gave Mario's "Arrivederci, Mario" tour a jump start in the 
season opener at Surfers Paradise, Australia, when Michael was the winner and 
Mario was third. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, that moment on the podium together in Australia won't be the only 
one we have throughout the year," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, things are different this year from when father and son were teammates. 
Mario remains with Newman-Haas, but with Britain's Nigel Mansell as his 
teammate. Michael is with Ganassi in a new Reynard chassis powered by a Ford 
Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being with different teams is really nothing new to Dad and me," Michael 
said. "Before I joined Newman-Haas, I had driven about five years for Kraco, so 
the family conversations are back the way they used to be. Obviously, we are 
not as open as when we drove together, but we know pretty much how to handle 
it. It's never been a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reynard made its Indy car debut with the victory in Australia, continuing 
a tradition created by owner Adrian Reynard. On seven previous occasions, his 
cars won the first time out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the Reynard ran in Australia gives me confidence for Long Beach," 
Michael said. "There were parts of the Surfers Paradise course that are very 
similar to Long Beach and that's where I was quickest, so I'm hoping that our 
car repeats its performance down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reynard chassis wasn't the only first-time winner in Australia. Before 
Andretti took the checkered flag, Ganassi's team had gone 65 races without 
winning since the former driver broke with Pat Patrick and formed his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Chip Ganassi since I was a teen-ager and I felt he had all the 
ingredients this year for a winning combination," Andretti said. "We worked 
very hard last winter, and I prayed to God that things would work out. The Lord 
answered my prayers when we won in Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti met Ganassi when they were driving Formula Fords. Ganassi was the 
Northeast Division Formula Ford champion in 1980. The next year, Andretti won 
six races and succeeded Ganassi as champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started racing (Formula Fords), all I heard was Chip Ganassi this and 
Chip Ganassi that," Michael said. "The first time we met was at West Palm Beach 
in the first race of 1981. Chip led from the start, but then it began to rain 
and I passed him in the wet. We finished 1-2. I like to remind him of that 
every chance I get." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganassi, who was the fastest rookie qualifier for the Indianapolis 500 in 
1982, beating Bobby Rahal and Danny Sullivan, smiles when reminded of the race 
with Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he keeps winning for our team, he can have all the bragging rights 
he wants," Ganassi said.

A DRIVING FORCE; FOR FORMER BOSTON MARATHON CHAMPION AND CABBIE KELLEY, CLOCK 
IS ALWAYS RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has made his peace. Age helps. And so does the job. When you are driving a 
cab and listening to the problems of others, yours seem less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the job for two weeks 14 years ago because he quit teaching, angry 
with the education system in Groton, Conn. He's still driving and will work 
tonight. Then he will go to Boston as an honored guest, celebrated as a part of 
the city's history on Patriot's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 He's Johnny J. Kelley -- Johnny the Younger, as opposed to Johnny A. Kelley, 
Johnny the Elder, who won the Boston Marathon in 1935 and '45 and still trots 
the course once a year as part of the race's pageantry. 
</P>
<P>
 "By a fillip of teasing fate, I bore the monarch's name," said Johnny J. 
Kelley when he won Boston in 1957. For 2 hours 20 minutes 5 seconds, then a 
course record, he was king, running from Hopkinton, through Framingham, past 
the women of Wellesley and up the hills of Newton ahead of the world's best, 
and finally down Exeter Street alone, almost 
</P>
<P>
 four minutes in front. 
</P>
<P>
 With triumph came relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was always going back to work the next day and answering the 
questions," Kelley, 63, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually asked, "What happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 For a decade, from the mid-1950s into the early '60s, Kelley was America's 
best marathoner. It was a title that might have meant little worldwide, but 
brought extreme pressure on Kelley at Boston, which will be run Monday for the 
98th time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley ran second in '56, '58 and '59, dropped out at 21 miles in 1960 because 
he knew he couldn't win, ran second again in '61 and '63, and fourth in '62. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are second, you always have an idea that if you had put in a little 
extra work, done something different tactically, ate something different, slept 
a little more, you would have won," Kelley said. "That was the hard part for 
me. I could ignore most of it -- all but feeling I had to apologize for 
finishing second. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it was Churchill who said of war, 'Your majesty, there is no second 
place.' I know what he meant." 
</P>
<P>
 It was worse for Kelley because of the dearth of American winners. From 1946 
until Kelley's victory in 1957, no American won at Boston. After his victory, 
no American won until Amby Burfoot, whom Kelley coached in high school at 
Groton in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, it did not matter much where Kelly finished. In his era, the 
marathon was an amateur event. Nike, Reebok and Adidas were yet to be born and 
Converse concentrated on basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would go into a shoe store and buy a pair of Keds, rip out the insides to 
make them lighter and hope they didn't rip up my feet," Kelley said. "Later, I 
wore custom shoes, made for me to run in." 
</P>
<P>
 He ran everywhere, including the 1956 Olympics at Melbourne and the 1960 Games 
at Rome. He led for 13 miles at Melbourne, burning himself out in the 85-degree 
heat and hobbling home 21st, behind runners he had beaten at Boston only months 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny was always making like he wanted to be accepted in the mainstream," 
said Burfoot, editor of Runner's World magazine. "That meant winning, leading. 
He ran for everybody else, instead of for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 He supported himself by teaching remedial reading at the high school in 
Groton. He would not coach track but handled the cross-country team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track coaches and other coaches would have you out there, running around in 
circles," Burfoot said. "Kelley would take us on runs down roads, through an 
apple orchard and through the water of the Long Island Sound. He would 
constantly quote Thoreau about leading the simple life, the animal's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley would repair to Boston, once a year, to renew a love-hate relationship 
that had begun when he was in high school in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped with about six miles to go, in Newton, and just sat by the side of 
the road and shivered in the cold," Kelley said. "I didn't know what to do. 
Nobody was coming by to pick me up. I just sat, a skinny kid in the cold. Then 
a kid came pedaling his bike over a hill, holding up the marathon edition of 
the Boston Herald. The headline said: 'Swede Wins.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More than an hour after Karl Leandersson had won, Kelley hitched a ride to the 
finish line in a Studebaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I should have learned from that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did learn from Emil Zatopek, the famous Czech distance runner, who 
prescribed long, slow distances to build endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a competitor at Boston University, such training went against the 
grain. So, Kelley ran through woods, along rivers and through fields in secret, 
won weekend races and worked in a cafeteria to survive before getting his 
English degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember winning a race at Salem (Mass.), and they gave me a pair of shoes 
-- leather, business-type shoes for a professional to wear to a job," Kelley 
said. "I took them and walked away, and an old geezer came up and said, 'You 
know you can't accept those shoes, don't you? You'll jeopardize your 
opportunity to run in the Pan American Games.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoes were worth more than $35, and that was the limit then. More than 
$35, and you were a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kelley drove back to his Connecticut classroom, teaching after a 
13-mile morning workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marathon runners were ensnared by the dictatorship of amateurism," he said. 
"You couldn't legally take money, though some did, under the table. But there 
wasn't much to take. Men dedicated their whole lives to the sport and their 
families' lives. You had to be almost consecrated to running. . . . Actually, 
you had to be really a kook." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley won a laurel wreath and a medal in 1957. A vegetarian, he disdained the 
traditional bowl of beef stew. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the winners will each earn $70,000 and a luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I won, doors opened to a much larger world for me," Burfoot said. "There 
were trips around the world. There were no opportunities to get wealthy off it, 
but there were still rewards. It was the same for him. I always wondered why he 
didn't capitalize on 1957. He said he wasn't the traveling kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Money came to the Boston Marathon too late for Kelley, but being the purist he 
at first fought the transformation in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race had to cross the Rubicon and pay," Kelley said. "For the people in 
charge, amateurism equated to morality. It all seems so stupid today." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kelley's attitude changed, he began to appreciate Bill Rodgers, who won 
Boston in 1978, '79 and '80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess Bill was the first to capitalize on the fame that comes from winning 
Boston," Kelley said. "He broke away from amateurism. Many thought he would be 
corrupted by money, but it seemed that was not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers opened a running store as the nation awakened to a health boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, 50-year-old doctors are taking up marathon running," Kelley said. "All I 
know is that now, when I run, nobody rides by and throws beer cans at me 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He still runs, three or four miles a day, and on Wednesday, when his weekly 
running column is due at a local paper, he runs it in, 10 miles from Mystic to 
New London and back. When it rains, he rides a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, there is the cab. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely a free spirit," Burfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Kelley said. "I'm a dropout. I'm completely disaffected." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's at peace, because nobody asks him "What happened?" anymore.

SNEAKING IN UNDER THE CAP; ALTHOUGH CONLAN HAS BENEFITED, HE DISLIKES 
FREE-AGENT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The system freed him, made him rich, and upon reflection, he said, "It 
stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago this week, the Rams paid linebacker Shane Conlan $5.4 million for 
three years to leave behind the cold winters in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 No regrets, he said. Conlan profited from NFL free agency, but in Year 1 of 
the new collective bargaining agreement between NFL players and management, 
there was no salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfect timing," Conlan said. "Obviously, it was great last year -- 
especially for me. I was talking to my wife the other day about how lucky I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 With no salary cap, teams were not limited on what they could spend to sign a 
player. By this time last year, 80-plus players had signed, and in most cases, 
they got substantial raises. A little more than 50 have signed this year, and 
they are being asked to take pay cuts in increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look, there are a lot of good players out there still unsigned," 
Conlan said. "I'm sure I would have signed someplace but probably would not 
have gotten near the money I got from the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan will begin playing his eighth NFL season, and while he has made many 
friends over the years, fewer and fewer remain on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's kind of hypocritical for me to complain about free agency," 
Conlan said. "But I've got buddies who are free agents, and they are just going 
through hell. What do you tell a guy who's gotten screwed by the system? There 
are a lot of great football players out there, but management can't do anything 
because their hands are tied by the cap. And we're going to see more players on 
the street in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not what we had in mind when we went on strike in 1987. The way 
things are now it's going to shorten some guys' careers. The middle guys are 
either going to take a pay cut or be released, and that's bad for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is important to Conlan, as evidenced by his off-season presence at 
Rams Park. There were only five players working out on the practice field 
Wednesday, and Conlan was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Free agency bothers Conlan, but playing football for a team that loses more 
games than it wins is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he arrived heralded as the Rams' top free-agent acquisition, then 
drew immediate attention for injuring a knee on the first day of training camp. 
He recovered, was hurt again, recovered, and then went unnoticed playing for a 
team that did little to excite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams finished 5-11, and Conlan sat at home on Jan. 30 watching his former 
teammates battle the Cowboys in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy for them, but I was also hoping they wouldn't get that far," 
Conlan admitted with a smile. "In the back of your mind you'd like to think 
they aren't as good as they were because you're not there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first half, they were winning, and I was saying, 'Can you believe 
this: I go to three straight Super Bowls and we get killed, and now they're 
going to get a ring the year after I leave.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills went on to lose their fourth consecutive Super Bowl, and while 
Conlan didn't have to live with the image of his former teammates celebrating, 
he was still stuck with a losing team for the first time since his rookie 
season in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "We very rarely lost in Buffalo after my first year, and when we did, 
everybody was down and out," Conlan said. "But here it was a different 
atmosphere. It was like it's a job, I tried hard, I get paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is we just got to learn how to win here." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan played like a winner last season, and finished third on the team in 
tackles despite missing four games and being limited in playing time against 
run-and-shoot offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings an awful lot to our defense," said George Dyer, Ram defensive 
coordinator. "I couldn't be happier with the way he played last season. When he 
hits a guy, you know he's been hit. He plays hurt, runs like a deer, just loves 
the game, and as a result, our football team loves to play around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you pay big bucks to get a guy, you expect you're getting a King Kong 
type of player. This guy did exactly what we thought he would, and more. It's 
just not his fault if we're matched against a run-and-shoot team; there isn't a 
middle linebacker in the league who is going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' plan for an overnight turnaround in 1994 begins with the team's 
defense. They say they have budding superstars in defensive end Robert Young, 
linebacker Roman Phifer, defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, cornerbacks Steve 
Israel and Todd Lyght and have added defensive tackle Jimmie Jones via free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reminds me so much of what we had going in Buffalo," Conlan said. "We 
had an all-pro guy in Bruce Smith in Buffalo and we have Gilbert. Phifer and 
Cornelius Bennett are alike. We had Nate Odomes in Buffalo and here we have 
Israel. They drafted Thurman Thomas and we have Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's just a matter of turning the corner, and there's no doubt in my mind 
that this organization is committed to winning. They're bringing guys in like 
Jones and quarterback Chris Miller . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Free agency, the system that Conlan finds so offensive, is giving the Rams a 
chance to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously free agency has already helped this organization -- the players 
brought in last year and the players this year," Conlan said. "Record-wise we 
were a bad team, and free agency helps a bad team get better quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for the players it can be tough. I hope to God the people (who are 
running the players' association) aren't going to say this is a good deal. In 
the whole scheme of things, this wasn't the deal everyone had in mind."

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; FOR ATLAS, TITLE SHOT IS DAD'S PAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Teddy Atlas was wary late last year at the beginning of his relationship with 
Michael Moorer. "Give it two weeks, and walk away if things aren't working," he 
told himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs the grief of trying to train a fighter best known for burning 
through trainers at mach speed? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to allow myself to be compromised," Atlas says tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas is the man who, although he practically grew up with the young 
heavyweight and knew his vast potential, walked away from Mike Tyson when Tyson 
stopped listening, who left Cus D'Amato's camp when D'Amato's actions no longer 
seemed to match his principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Teddy Atlas training Michael Moorer? For John Davimos, Moorer's manager, it 
was a match made in bull-headed heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Teddy, and I knew Teddy's reputation," Davimos said. "He put a gun to 
Tyson's head (when Atlas thought Tyson was bothering the girlfriend of a 
friend). I was pretty sure if he was willing to do that, he'd actually shoot 
Michael." 
</P>
<P>
 Davimos said that with a smile, now that Moorer's title shot against 
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield next Friday night at Caesars Palace is 
almost here, now that seven weeks of often tempestuous training seem to have 
invigorated both Moorer and Atlas as they approach the biggest fight of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened that the timing was pretty good," Atlas says. "He wanted to 
be disciplined. He wanted it. It had to be somebody he believed, that really 
meant it, and he was going to test them. But he wanted to be, because I could 
not do it if he did not want to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fortunate or unfortunate that it will all be weighed by whether he wins 
or loses. I know the reality of it, that's winning and losing in life. But we 
have made progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer has something to prove -- that he can approach a major bout mentally 
and physically stable. But Atlas has something to prove too. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Cus, if you didn't have a strong personality, he'd overcome you and just 
leave you nothing but what he wanted to leave you with," Atlas says. "And that 
didn't happen with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept what I thought was very valuable from Cus and I threw away what I 
thought was hogwash. I believed it was too one-dimensional. You don't make 
everyone one way. You have to adapt to the time and place for the fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he think that Kevin Rooney, D'Amato's disciple who took over Tyson's 
training when Atlas left, has suffered from never expanding D'Amato's 
teachings? 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin wouldn't be capable of it," says Atlas, who has long feuded with 
Rooney. "Of course he could benefit, he'd be much more versatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rooney lost Long Beach heavyweight Jeremy Williams when Williams 
thought Rooney was trying to force him into becoming a Tyson clone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cus wasn't pure, but at least he gave a much better appearance of it than 
Kevin does," Atlas says. "Kevin, he just doesn't do it as classy as Cus did, 
though Kevin thinks he does, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin does it Cus' way because Kevin was one of those guys whose personality 
was overcome by Cus. The contradictory thing for me with Kevin is that he says 
all these things about Cus. Meanwhile, in certain areas of his life, he does 
the opposite thing of what Cus said he believed in, as far as his habits in 
front of the fighters, being an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas acknowledges a far stronger influence on his life than D'Amato's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a funny way of putting it, but I learned more from my father, who was 
a doctor, about boxing, than from Cus' bantering," Atlas says of Theodore Atlas 
Sr. "Cus helped me formalize things in my mind, but my father made me 
understand what a pro was. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made me understand what tough was. He was always in pain, but he never 
missed a day of work, never made an excuse, didn't come home until taking care 
of his obligations, his patients." 
</P>
<P>
 During his seven-year, mostly unpaid apprenticeship with D'Amato, Atlas said, 
his father, who founded two hospitals in New Jersey, paid for his room and 
board, paid for equipment and never pushed him to give up the craziness for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He passed away in November," Atlas says. "He was 88. He was a very good man. 
So when you ask me what this means, that's what this means. It means it 
validates in my own way, even though things shouldn't have to be validated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope there's a way people can see things, at least in my mind, that he 
could see, and just say, all those years he was supporting me, well, this is 
what it led to. This is the payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't get to go to a graduation for those seven years. This is the 
graduation."

JEFFIRES REJECTS RAMS' CONTRACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires rejected the Rams' three-year, 
$3.9-million contract proposal Friday, choosing instead to entertain offers 
from other clubs, including his current team, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, confirmed Jeffires' decision, adding 
that the Rams do not plan to offer a new deal to the three-time Pro Bowl 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, who earned $900,000 last season with Houston, has indicated he would 
like to stay with the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>

 The Rams signed free-agent defensive back and punt returner Cliff Hicks, 
formerly of the New York Jets. Hicks, 5 feet 10 and 187 pounds, was a 
third-round draft selection by the Rams in 1987. Hicks played three seasons 
with the Rams and three seasons with Buffalo before signing as a free-agent 
with the Jets last season. MIKE REILLEY

ST. JOHN BOSCO'S GARDNER SPURNS UCLA, PICKS CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jelani Gardner, considered the state's top high school basketball player, was 
not swayed by a national title or an early exit from the tournament when he 
announced his college decision Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The prep All-American from Bellflower St. John Bosco High said it was the 
opportunity to play immediately that made him sign a letter of intent with 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, a 6-foot-6 point guard, also considered Arkansas and UCLA, but he 
said those teams' performances in the NCAA tournament had no bearing on his 
decision. Neither did Cal's postseason loss to Green Bay Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be on a completely new team, so what they did this season meant very 
little to me," said Gardner, who announced his decision before 500 students in 
the school gym. "I'll be with a new group of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 After competing in Magic Johnson's Roundball Classic all-star game last 
weekend in Auburn Hills, Mich., Gardner said he began favoring Cal. Spending 
much of that game on the bench made him realize he did not want the same 
experience in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be on a team with a bunch of all-stars and keep looking over 
my shoulder all of the time," he said. "I want to get in the game and do what I 
do best." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner also credited Cal Coach Todd Bozeman with personally recruiting him 
from the beginning, rather than leaving those duties to his assistants, as UCLA 
and Arkansas did. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal, Gardner is expected to take over for Jason Kidd, a sophomore who 
announced last month that he is making himself available for the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, selected the state's most valuable player this season by Cal-Hi 
Sports and the John Wooden Award, started high school at La Puente Bishop Amat. 
He transferred to St. John Bosco his junior season, leading the Braves to a 
53-6 record during his stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Gardner averaged 25 points and eight assists as St. John Bosco 
won the Southern Section Division II-A title.

SPRINTERS ARE RUNNING OFF AT THE MOUTH; TRACK AND FIELD: WORLD ALL-STARS SAY 
THEY CAN BEAT LEWIS-DRIVEN SANTA MONICA TEAM AT MT. SAC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is this the year that meet director Dan Shrum finally has found formidable 
challengers in the Mt. San Antonio College Relays for the Santa Monica Track 
Club? No, if you listen to the Santa Monica Track Club. Yes, if you listen to 
the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 They will settle the argument on the track Sunday at Walnut, where they plan 
to meet in the 400-meter relay. In case the issue remains unresolved, it is 
possible they will reload for a rematch later in the afternoon in the 800-meter 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show you don't have to run with the sunshine on your chest to be 
one of the best," said Dennis Mitchell, referring to the logo on Santa Monica's 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked fourth in the world in the 100 meters last year, Mitchell would fare 
well, head to head, with any sprinter. But the only part he usually sees of 
Carl Lewis' anatomy when they run the same relay anchor leg is his back. 
</P>
<P>
 They will, however, be head to head when they receive the batons at Mt. SAC, 
at least in the 400-meter relay, Mitchell predicted this week, emboldened by 
his supporting cast.  
</P>
<P>
 Joining him on the World All-Stars are a teammate from the United States' 
gold-medal sprint relay team at the 1993 World Championships, Jon Drummond, and 
two members of Great Britain's silver-medal team, John Regis and Tony Jarrett. 
They have been practicing handoffs while training under Coach John Smith at 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time he gets the stick, he's usually 10 or 15 yards out front," 
Mitchell said of Lewis. "He looks nice and pretty then. I want to see him grit 
his teeth a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The response from Santa Monica: 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a break," manager Joe Douglas said. "I don't mean to be rude, but, by 
the time we get to the 150-meter mark, no one will ever see us. They're selling 
wolf tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they are, Smith confessed. But in an age where there is too much 
trash talk in many sports, there probably is not enough in track and field. The 
sport could stand some good-natured friction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're gentlemen," Smith said of Santa Monica's runners. "They can afford to 
be because they're on top. But maybe we can get their attention. If we're as 
polite as they are, we could sneak up on them and win. This way, they'll get 
angry and break the world record, which we'd all like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 21 fastest times in the 400-meter relay, 16 were by national teams. The 
five others were by Santa Monica, including the 37.89 run by Mike Marsh, Floyd 
Heard, Leroy Burrell and Lewis last Saturday in the Texas Relays. The U.S. team 
that won the gold medal in 37.83 during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics is the 
only one to run faster on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been shooting for Mt. SAC all year, but we got a little ahead of 
ourselves at Texas," said Burrell, who won the 100 meters in Austin with a time 
of 9.86, equaling Lewis' world standard but not legal for record purposes 
because of a prevailing wind of 2.47 meters per second. "I think we can at 
least duplicate that Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he is worried about the World All-Stars, he said, "Not really. We've 
been doing this for a long time, while they've got two Brits and two Americans 
who have been working together for only a few weeks. If we get the baton around 
the track, we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis will not have to grit his teeth? 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl has been running at the world-class level for 12 years, and I've never 
seen him grit his teeth, no matter who he's running against," Burrell said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Johnson had 8,219 points to win the Mt. SAC decathlon, held at Azusa 
Pacific, Thursday and Friday. Shawn Wilbourn was second with 7,579 points.

LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX NOTES; MANSELL, FITTIPALDI LEAD WAY IN QUALIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To no one's surprise, Nigel Mansell and Emerson Fittipaldi were the fastest 
drivers Friday, the first day of qualifying for the 20th annual Toyota Grand 
Prix of Long Beach. More time trials today will set the field for Sunday's 
105-lap Indy car race through the streets of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, who sat on the pole seven times last year and was fast qualifier in 
the season opener in Australia, lapped the circuit at 107.919 m.p.h. in his 
Lola-Ford. Fittipaldi, the Indy car points leader after a second-place finish 
at Australia and a victory last Sunday in Phoenix, is at 107.846. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever wins the pole tomorrow had better be a half-second quicker," Mansell 
said after his 53.040 second lap. "I was quite pleased with my lap, I got 
everything I could out of it, but I was not pleased with the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell's time was slightly slower than the track record of 108.098 m.p.h. he 
set last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigel says he needs a half-second, so that means a full second for me," said 
Al Unser Jr., a four-time Long Beach winner. Unser was third fastest at 
106.827. 
</P>
<P>
 "A half-second is light years here," he said. "We're going to work very hard 
to find it before (this) afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Final qualifying will start at 11:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Robertson, winner of the Indy Lights race last year, ran a track-record 
98.736 m.p.h. to take the provisional pole for Sunday's race for Buick-powered 
Indy Lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, like Mansell an Englishman, bettered the record of 98.300 by Franck 
Freon of France. Freon, who lives in Anaheim during the racing season, will 
make his Indy car debut Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-fastest qualifier is former world motorcycle champion Eddie Lawson at 
98.246. Lawson is a teammate of Robertson on Steve Horne's Tasman team. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Greg Moore, who won wire to wire last Sunday in Phoenix, is fourth 
fastest. A second Indy Lights qualifying session is scheduled today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as a tutor for several of his Toyota pro-celebrity rivals, Juan 
Manuel Fangio II showed them how to do it by easily winning the pole for 
today's 10-lap race. The two-time Camel GTP champion did a lap of 67.842 in one 
of the identically prepared Celicas. 
</P>
<P>
 World champion jet skier Christy Carlson got out of her car after the morning 
practice and made a beeline for Fangio for a lesson. Fellow celebs Alfonso 
Ribeiro and Mark-Paul Gosselaar joined Carlson in learning the proper braking 
points and apexes from Fangio, now a Toyota test driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with Cruz Pedregon and Clay Regazzoni when Fangio just passed us like 
we weren't moving," said Ribeiro of NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." Let me 
tell you, at Turn 3 my car was saying, 'I want the wall! I want the wall!' and 
I was saying, 'No you don't! No you don't!" 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Smith, the Raiders' 265-pound defensive end, paid the price of size 
when he was the slowest qualifier among 17 celebrities at 61.529 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom's really nervous about this race," Smith said. "I was changing gears, 
got a little nervous myself and pulled the stick shift out of the gear box. I 
think my mom probably made my gearbox fall out." 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni, the inaugural Formula One winner at Long Beach, qualified third 
behind Fangio and Brian Redman in a car specially prepared with hand controls. 
The veteran Swiss driver is paralyzed from the waist down from injuries 
suffered in the 1980 Long Beach race. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Besides second-day qualifying and the pro-celebrity race, today's program 
includes a 30-minute Supercar race and a demonstration of electric cars. Long 
Beach Grand Prix

CENTURY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; ORANGE ENDS SKID IN A BIG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Matranga stepped to the plate Friday, determined to get himself and the 
Orange baseball team out of a rut. By the end of the day it was Foothill that 
was deep in a hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers shook themselves out of the doldrums by pasting the Knights, 
17-2, in a Century League game at Foothill. It ended a two-game losing streak 
and swung the team's batting average upward for the first time in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Orange's 16 hits matched its total from the previous three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to find the magic again," Matranga said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Matranga, the Panthers' leadoff batter, who waved the wand. 
</P>
<P>
 He had two hits, including a home run, and had two runs batted in. He also 
walked three times and scored three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were going to break out of our slump, I had to get it started," 
Matranga said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, leading off the game with a double. It started a three-run inning that 
seemed to shake the Panthers loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange's first five batters got hits. Saul Archuleta and Sean Simpson had RBI 
singles and Marshall Maresh had a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way this team can hit," Coach Ed Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 It came as a relief to Howard, who had watched his team's batting average drop 
from .436 to .395 since league play began. The Panthers, considered a favorite 
to win the league title, took extra batting practice Wednesday and even went 
back to using self-hypnosis, which they'd used earlier in the season, to relax 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange (11-6, 4-3) had seven extra-base hits. Everyone in the starting lineup 
had at least one hit, except for catcher Jacob Garza, who walked twice and 
scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers had 10 players get at least one RBI and they scored in every 
inning but the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the bounces started going the Panthers' way. They got two bad-hop 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 They also got some help. William Reinsch, Foothill's starting pitcher, 
wild-pitched in two runs and balked home two more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (9-8, 5-2) also made four errors, leading to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 It became overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got up 4-0, that was it," pitcher Gil Gonzales said. "Give me four 
runs and I can do my thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales retired 14 of the first 16 batters. He struck out five and gave up 
only five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Friday, he was merely the sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gil pitched well, but our strength is hitting," Howard said. "We did that 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 5, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Casey Wilson hit a two-run homer in the fifth 
inning for Canyon (12-4, 5-1). Scott Redfox pitched a complete game, giving up 
five hits and striking out five, and walking none. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 7, El Modena 2 -- Matt Parker had two hits and an RBI and gave up 
two earned runs to earn the complete game victory for Villa Park. Sean McMahon 
had two hits and an RBI for Villa Park (9-8, 3-4).

SUNSET LEAGUE SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; OCEAN VIEW STAYS IN HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was not pretty, the in-house bickering on Ocean View's softball team. When 
the Seahawks returned from spring break, they weren't thinking about softball. 
And after losing to Huntington Beach in their first game back, Coach John 
Sansone did not paint a pretty picture. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was going to get uglier, he said, if they lost to Fountain Valley on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-ranked Ocean View -- formerly a house divided -- lived up to their 
ranking and kept pace in the Sunset League race with a 6-1 victory over 
eighth-ranked Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling was that if we lost, our quest for first place would be over," 
Sansone said. "We would have to climb over too many teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal was to improve every game, and we had until that (Huntington Beach) 
game. But we were back today." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the Sunset League's eight teams have been ranked among the top 10. 
Ocean View (10-4, 3-2) trails second-ranked Marina (13-2, 5-1) and Huntington 
Beach (11-5, 5-1). Fountain Valley is 8-7-1, 4-2.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have lost, it would have meant the season," said pitcher Kathy 
Ponce (10-3), who struck out nine and allowed only four hits -- three from the 
sixth inning on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone said Ponce threw harder Friday than she has all year: "She was strong, 
dominating. After we got three runs, there was never any doubt in my mind we 
wouldn't win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View scored three times in the first inning, one in the fourth and two 
in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 A single, an error and RBI singles by Tracy Wilkinson and Angela Burke pushed 
across two runs, and Wilkinson scored on another error. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson had three hits and scored twice. Janee Sansone (who scored) and Lisa 
Messick (who had an RBI) had two hits apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a good job of putting the ball in play and we didn't make the 
plays," Fountain Valley Coach Cary Baker said. "When you get behind a team and 
there's parity, you start pressing. We didn't do anything until late (in the 
game)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce said Fountain Valley has the toughest lineup in the league, but she made 
short work of the Barons nevertheless. An error and back-to-back singles by 
Linsey Collins and Lynea Backlund scored Fountain Valley's only run with two 
outs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 8, Santa Ana 6 (8 innings) -- Christy Webb had an RBI single to key a 
three-run eighth-inning rally for visiting Edison (2-9, 1-5).

 Jimmy Bragan, president of the Southern League, said Friday that he is 
investigating whether Michael Jordan violated a minor league tobacco policy by 
having a cigar in the Birmingham Barons dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 The former NBA star was photographed with the cigar in his mouth before 
Thursday's game against the Lookouts in Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
 The minor league policy states that no athlete, coach or anyone associated 
with a team can have tobacco products in the dugout or on the field. Violators 
can be fined $300. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he was smoking or not," Bragan said. "I don't condone it, and 
he would be handled as if he were any other player or coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Bragan said he is awaiting a report from the game's umpires before making a 
decision on what action to take, if any. He said he does not expect to receive 
the report before Monday. He said it was possible Jordan was unaware of the 
no-smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are tickled to death to have him in the league, want him to do well and 
expect him to follow rules like anyone else, and he will do that if he stays in 
the league," Bragan said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK TALKS UP NEW ATTITUDE

<P>
 Chan Ho Park stopped by pitching coach Ron Perranoski's locker before Friday's 
game, and Perranoski said Park communicated without an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who had struggled through most of his three-inning appearance Thursday, 
used hand signals and a little English to tell Perranoski that he had been 
thinking about his tough outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chan Ho has been very defensive pitching-wise, and I have told him to throw 
his fastball more, but he's been tentative," Perranoski said. "I had taken him 
back to the clubhouse between innings Thursday and told him, using his 
interpreter, to throw more fastballs. And when he went out there the last 
inning, he got more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today he stopped by to tell me that mentally he had been putting major 
league players up high, and his pitching, low. He used broken English, and 
pointed up high and then low, and then said that after his last inning, he 
realized that he is even with the batters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pointed to my head, and he nodded. What he was telling me is that he has 
his confidence back." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the fifth inning Friday, Pirate Kevin Young made a great play at third 
base. When he went to glove a grounder by Cory Snyder, it bounced up, rolled 
down Young's back, then continued down his arm and into his hand as he spun 
around and made the throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
 His throw appeared to beat Snyder, but first base umpire Steve Rippley ruled 
that first baseman Orlando Merced had left the bag and called Snyder safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit was Snyder's first since he was activated Thursday, having recovered 
from several injuries. Outfielder Billy Ashley was sent back to Albuquerque. 
</P>

 Tim Wallach wasn't pleased with Angel Manager Buck Rodgers' comment Thursday 
about Wallach being one of the players who benefited from the alleged juiced 
baseballs during the 1987 season. Rodgers said that while it makes it more 
exciting for the fans, they are still paying for the guys from '87. Rodgers 
said that Wallach is one of the players who got long-term contracts just from 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had a pretty good career," said Wallach, who played for Rodgers 
in Montreal. "Have I been that bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It did kind of surprise me because he singled me out," Wallach said. So, I 
don't know, it could have been a Freudian slip."  
</P>
<P>
 Wallach is 11 for 38 in his last six games, including three home runs and nine 
runs batted in. Friday night he hit a two-run homer that tied the score in 
fourth inning. "It was a corked baseball, or it wouldn't have gone out 
otherwise," Wallach said sarcastically. MARYANN HUDSON

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; MATER DEI'S HARRIS TOSSES NO-HITTER, BEATS 
SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adam Harris last experienced this feeling at 9, but candy and cartoons 
dominated his thoughts as much as baseball back then. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Mater Dei senior right-hander clenched the ball in his glove and 
stepped on first base for the final out, he fully appreciated the 
accomplishment this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris pitched a no-hitter Friday in the first-place Monarchs' 11-0 rout of 
host San Clemente in a South Coast League game, enabling Mater Dei to sweep the 
season series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been awhile for me," Harris said. "All this year I've taken no-hitters 
into the third and fourth (innings), so it felt really good to finally get 
one."  
</P>
<P>
 The no-hitter is the first of the season for Mater Dei (11-5-1, 6-1 in 
league), which is alone atop the league standings and ranked fifth in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a first-inning walk to Robert Frith denied Harris (5-0) a prefect game. 
Still, though, Harris faced the minimum of 21 batters because Monarch catcher 
Matt Treanor nailed Frith at second on a steal attempt. Harris, who entered the 
game with the county's No. 2 earned-run average, lowered his ERA to 0.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris ended the game by receiving a soft toss from first baseman Tim Wetzel, 
who fielded Frith's ground ball to his right. Harris struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my pitches were on; fastball, curveball, slider," Harris said. "But I 
just want to say thanks to (shortstop) Erik (Mattern) because he saved it for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mattern made a spectacular defensive play in the fifth inning to rob Mike Wood 
of a hit. He ran nearly to the lip of the outfield grass, jumped high to field 
the ball on a hop, did a 180-degree spin and fired a perfect throw to first 
that just got Wood for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know he was throwing (a no-hitter)," Mattern said. "I got back 
to the dugout and everyone was patting me on the back and congratulating me. 
That's when I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Monarch Coach Bob Ickes: "It was the play of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercifully, San Clemente is done with Mater Dei -- at least for the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons (11-6, 4-3) were routed by the Monarchs on Wednesday, 21-8, and 
lost the season's first meeting, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente entered the week in a three-way tie for first, but now finds 
itself in third and looking up at the Monarchs and Dana Hills (10-7-1, 5-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 13, El Toro 4 -- Tyson Loreque hit a grand slam in the top of the 
seventh for Dana Hills (10-7-1, 5-2). Catcher Scott Maynard went two for two 
with four runs batted in and Mark Richardson went four for five. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Etherton pitched a complete game to improve to 6-0 on the season. 
Etherton gave up four hits, striking out five and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley 5, Mission Viejo 1 -- Brandon Puffer hit a home run in the 
third for Capistrano Valley (12-5, 3-4). Peter Zamora (4-1) pitched a complete 
game, striking out nine and walking one. Brian Harnetiaux went two for two with 
a triple and an RBI.

BLUE GRASS STAKES; TRAINER MCANALLY HOPES TO SET DERBY CAP WITH VALIANT NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally has another set of souvenir caps from a major Kentucky 
Derby prep race. And this time McAnally's 3-year-old, Valiant Nature, might 
even run in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days ago, a batch of Santa Anita Derby souvenirs were delivered to 
McAnally's barn. Later that day, the trainer announced that Valiant Nature 
would run in today's $500,000 Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland instead. McAnally 
brought the assortment of caps, shirts and badges here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the horse's name on them, but not Santa Anita's," he joked. "I 
thought that maybe Ted Bassett (Keeneland's board chairman) might give me a 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bassett's employees dropped off a bagful of Blue Grass caps at 
McAnally's barn this week, the same day that Valiant Nature worked half a mile 
in 48 seconds, the fastest of 64 horses on the workout tab for that distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The track was fast for the workout, but it might be muddy today. No rain is in 
the forecast, but the track was pounded Friday by an off-and-on storm that came 
with tornado warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 An off track could result in the scratch of Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby 
winner, but the morning-line favorites -- Holy Bull at 4-5 and Valiant Nature 
at 9-5 -- are expected to run. Holy Bull, with six victories in seven starts at 
tracks in New Jersey, New York and Florida, seems comfortable with any surface. 
On a sloppy track last fall, he won the Futurity at Belmont Park, beating 
Dehere, the eventual juvenile champion who was injured in Florida this winter 
and eliminated from the Triple Crown picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, who has won the Hollywood Futurity and one other race in four 
starts, ran in mud for the first time last month and finished third, behind 
Soul Of The Matter and Brocco, in the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's clay in the Keeneland track that makes the mud here different than it 
is most other places," McAnally said. "Look at Paseana (his champion mare). She 
couldn't stand up when she ran in mud in New York last year, but then she came 
to Keeneland, on another off track, and it didn't bother her at all." 
</P>
<P>
 More than the racing surface, Valiant Nature's chief obstacle today is Holy 
Bull, who left the field behind at the start of the Florida Derby last month 
and won by 5 3/4 lengths. The Florida Derby, at 1 1/8 miles, is the same 
distance as the Blue Grass. The Kentucky Derby, which will be run at Churchill 
Downs on May 7, is an eighth of a mile farther. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who finished 10th aboard Lahint in the Florida Derby, said of 
Holy Bull: "He's very impressive. He's only had one bad race, and in the 
Florida Derby, he was awesome. He ran fast early, fast in the middle and fast 
late in that race. I'm no handicapper, I leave that part of it to the other 
guys, but if I were, I'd be making Holy Bull 8-5 or 9-5 to win the Kentucky 
Derby right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The track bias favored front-runners at Gulfstream Park on Florida Derby day, 
and McAnally is hoping that contributed to Holy Bull's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maidens were running 1:09 and change in other races that day," McAnally said. 
"And that kind of track will tend to help a horse with Holy Bull's type of 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull worked three furlongs Friday in 34 seconds, but the Keeneland racing 
strip has undergone a major renovation since last year and has shown a bias 
against front-runners. Before Friday, and discounting races for 2-year-olds, 
only one horse has won wire to wire here. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's race, which has drawn Warn Me, Mahogany Hall, Bonus Money and Chimes 
Band besides Kandaly and the two favorites, sets up as an early battle between 
Holy Bull and Valiant Nature, with Kandaly taking aim at the leaders through 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that Holy Bull will be in front," McAnally said. "I don't 
know how much pressure my horse (and jockey Laffit Pincay) will be giving them. 
The way the track's been playing, Kandaly has the best running style to take 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally is not second-guessing himself about not running at Santa Anita, 
where Brocco, Tabasco Cat and Strodes Creek ran 1-2-3 and Soul Of The Matter 
was scratched because of a leg blister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Holy Bull's been awesome," he said. "But there were three or four 
tough horses that we would have had to face in California. I like the way my 
horse is coming up to the race." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally, 61, is in the Racing Hall of Fame, and Jimmy Croll, Holy Bull's 
74-year-old trainer, is among five candidates on the ballot this year. Neither 
of them has won the Kentucky Derby, McAnally's horses finishing fourth twice in 
seven tries and Croll finishing second to Alysheba with Bet Twice in 1987, 
which was only his second starter in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll, who has found it difficult to evaluate the California contenders for 
the Kentucky Derby, will get some insight into the national 3-year-old picture 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They either have four champions or four ordinary horses out there," he said. 
"Those horses have taken turns beating each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Blue Grass was run in 1911 at the old Kentucky Assn. track in 
Lexington. Meridian finished second that year, then won the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Blue Grass, which has been run at Keeneland since 1937, has 
frequently been a harbinger of what will happen at Churchill Downs, 70 miles to 
the west. Twenty-three horses who raced in the Blue Grass won the Derby, and in 
the last seven years, six Blue Grass horses have either been first or second in 
the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the last four Derby winners -- Unbridled, Strike The Gold and Sea 
Hero -- prepped in the Blue Grass. Whether the track is muddy or fast, this is 
a good place for a Derby candidate to be.

WINNING AGAINST BIG BOYS, MOORPARK THINKS BIGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark High, playing the part of giant-killer in the Camarillo baseball 
tournament, didn't want to miss an opportunity to play the biggest giant of all 
in today's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with 1993 Southern Section Division I runner-up Simi Valley lying in wait, 
the upstart Musketeers -- hailing from the small-school Frontier League in a 
tournament filled with big-school Marmonte League teams -- sent stopper Mike 
Vasquez to the mound against Camarillo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But stop he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander struck out three in the top of the first inning, but he 
also gave up three runs and five hits, including a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pitchers might have been shellshocked. Not Vasquez. After the third out, 
he looked at his teammates and said, "Go hit." And the Musketeers scored five 
runs in the bottom of the inning en route to a 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (12-3), having beaten two Marmonte teams in as many days, will play 
Simi Valley today at 3 p.m. -- thanks, in part to Vasquez (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best start for us -- as far as the competition we've played -- in 
my five years," said Moorpark Coach David Rhoades, whose team defeated 
Westlake, 16-2, Thursday. "Now we get to play Simi Valley. What an honor for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, who entered the game with a 2.47 earned-run average, wasn't his 
sharpest, but he went the distance, striking out six and scattering 10 hits 
while throwing 105 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of confidence in my guys," Vasquez said. "We all hang around each 
other. We've been playing together since T-ball. We're like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez credited his errorless defense, but the key to this victory was the 
first inning. After the Scorpions (6-8) sent eight men to the plate in the top 
half, the Musketeers sent up 10 in the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's first-inning runs came with two out against Nathan Kaup (1-1). 
Jason Adamson hit a run-scoring pop-fly double to right off the glove of Erik 
Jue, who had ripped a two-run double for Camarillo. The inning was kept alive 
when third baseman Nick Moody gloved a chopper by Bill Finnerty that seemed 
bound for foul territory but ended up as an infield hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a trio of left-handed batters stroked opposite-field hits -- Craig Weaver 
with an RBI single, Ryan Huisenga with a two-run double and Ben Hall with an 
RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed with them," Camarillo Coach Jack Willard said. "They swing 
the bat from one to nine, and the left-hander hung in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez allowed single runs in the second and fourth but retired nine of the 
last 10 batters. "I couldn't get my inside fastball for strikes for a while," 
said Vasquez, who was 5-5 in 1993 and 8-3 in 1992. "So I started varying the 
fastball. I threw some two seams and some four seams, and then I got better."

COURTING A NEW GAME; GABE HIGA JOINS BROTHER AT PIERCE, GOES FROM BASKETBALL TO 
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is no midlife crisis for Gabe Higa or a fantasy he is trying to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Higa, who at 21 appears to have few worries, concedes that the idea 
of being a novice volleyball player at Pierce College after a distinguished 
high school basketball career is, well, unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd still be playing basketball in college," said Higa, a former 
standout at Quartz Hill High, where he also was a champion triple jumper. "I 
had no idea I would be playing volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
 And a couple of years ago, Michael Jordan probably never thought he'd be 
playing minor league baseball, although Higa, already an excellent spiker, has 
proved he can hit a ball more consistently. But that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is about a versatile 6-foot-6 athlete who not only has taken up a new 
sport, but is enjoying success as a starting opposite hitter on a powerful 
Brahma team that is 14-0 (13-0 in Western State Conference play) and a strong 
contender for the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Not altogether bad for a guy who first picked up volleyball seriously about 
two years ago, when he started playing at the beach with his brother Branden, 
19, a sophomore outside hitter at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Right about then, Higa's basketball career was in transition from a Division I 
program at UC Irvine to the junior college ranks at Irvine Valley College. His 
interest in the game had fizzled to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball got to be kind of a job," Higa said. "I'm happier playing 
volleyball than I was playing basketball. I pretty much got burned out on it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Quartz Hill, Higa's opponents were the ones being torched by his shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 24.7 points and 11.5 rebounds his senior season, when he was an 
All-Valley selection. He left Quartz Hill with eight school records, including 
1,486 points in his career. In the spring, he was a two-time Southern Section 
4-A Division champion in the triple jump, winning in his junior and senior 
seasons with jumps of 48 feet 8 inches and 48-2 feet, but gave up track after 
high school and accepted a basketball scholarship to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no scholarship money in track unless you were a sprinter or someone 
who could score a lot of points for the team," Higa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bill Mulligan's up-tempo offense at Irvine, Higa played off guard and 
small forward his freshman season. But when Mulligan resigned and Rod Baker 
took over the next season, Higa's playing time dwindled in Baker's half-court 
offense. Higa also had a nagging ankle injury and eventually received a medical 
redshirt for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't fit into (Baker's) plans," Higa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa transferred to Irvine Valley, where Mulligan had become coach, and played 
about half a season before pneumonia knocked him out of action.  
</P>
<P>
 By then, volleyball was beginning to pique his interest, so Higa decided to 
join his brother at Pierce.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Brahma Coach Ken Stanley didn't know whether Higa would be skilled 
enough to stick with the team, but he was pleasantly surprised after watching 
Higa on the court a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was a good athlete, but I've seen a lot of good athletes who can't 
play volleyball," said Stanley, who guided the Brahmas to the state title two 
seasons ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he has a tremendous ability to jump (43-inch vertical leap), which is 
pretty impressive, and he is able to take instruction very well and is so 
consistent in doing what we ask him to do. . . . He has improved a ton. He has 
made steady, upward improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 For Higa, the challenge of playing a new sport has rekindled his athletic 
spirit, something he says was missing the last two years.  
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys his teammates and is grateful they have accepted and helped him.  
</P>
<P>
 Even having to rise before dawn to make practices at 5:45 a.m. at Valley 
College, where the Brahmas work out and play their home matches because the 
Pierce gym was condemned after the Jan. 17 earthquake, hasn't dampened his 
newfound enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new sport and it's exciting to learn it," Higa said. "I consider 
myself a good beach player, but when I came (to Pierce) I had no concept of the 
footwork or the timing needed to hit a ball, for example. I'm still pretty 
rough and I don't like the way I look when I watch (game) tapes of myself but 
I'm having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job on the team is pretty basic. Just hit the ball as hard as I can and 
block. Our team could survive without me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley doesn't share that opinion but admits that Higa needs to refine his 
skills, including his defensive work at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one area he really needs to improve on is his blocking," Stanley said. 
"He could be much more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Higa could have attempted to make the Irvine Valley volleyball team, the 
defending state champion, but chose Pierce for three reasons: His brother plays 
there, he considers Stanley and assistant Bert Fuller two of the best coaches 
in the state, and he wanted to move to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ideal situation," said Higa, who was born in Encino and moved to 
Antelope Valley when he was 7. "We (Branden and he) live with our grandma 
(Florence Bunde) in Northridge and we can go home and she cooks dinner for us 
and we don't pay rent. You can't beat that." 
</P>
<P>
 Living together and playing side-by-side have allowed the brothers, who had a 
moderate sports rivalry in high school, to become closer.  
</P>
<P>
 They refer to the other as their best friend and would love to play together 
at a four-year school, although Gabe questions whether a coach would take a 
chance on a player with only one year of college eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important to me back (in high school) to be my own person," said 
Branden Higa, who has always concentrated on volleyball. "But volleyball has 
brought us closer together. . . . Just having a talent like him on the team is 
great. Thank God he is here and nowhere else."

PRO BASEBALL / MIKE HISERMAN; ROSSELLI MAKES GIANT STRIDES IN COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no outward signs of excitement. No pumping of a fist; not so much 
as the trace of a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the calm exterior, Joey Rosselli was overcome by a pool of 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was happy, relieved, proud. "You name it, I felt it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first regular-season appearance in almost a year, Rosselli pitched the 
Shreveport (La.) Captains to a 6-3 victory over the Arkansas Travelers last 
week in a Class-AA Texas League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, a 1990 graduate of Alemany High, gave up one earned run in seven 
innings, an outing he typically downplayed, saying, "I did OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, his performance was far better than that considering the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rosselli, the game marked the culmination of months of rehabilitation 
after shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli was on a fast track up the ladder in the San Francisco Giants' 
organization last spring when an impingement beneath his collarbone forced him 
onto the disabled list and ended his third professional season after four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 First came arthroscopic surgery, then hundreds of hours of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Rosselli, a left-hander who was voted pitcher of the year in 
the Class-A California League in 1991, remained determined and focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very religious about therapy, religious about exercise and religious 
about his throwing program," Captains' pitching coach Steve Cline said. "He's a 
true professional. He knew what he needed to do after the surgery, and he made 
sure it got done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants obviously appreciated his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his injury, San Francisco protected Rosselli on its 40-man winter 
roster and invited him to big-league camp this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That answered any question about what the Giants thought about me," Rosselli 
said. "It's a little booster in the back of my head. I want to make sure I 
don't disappoint them." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli didn't get into a spring game with the Giants, but he did enjoy the 
experience of being around some major league stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoot, anybody would be excited about just being (at a major league camp)," 
Rosselli said. "Then you're out on the field and stretching with guys like 
Barry Bonds and Matt Williams and Rod Beck. You tell yourself not to be 
intimidated, but you are a little anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, 21, may be among them sooner than he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Siegle, the Giants' vice president in charge of baseball operations, 
still counts Rosselli among the club's top pitching prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has velocity, control and stuff," Siegle said. "He's a good competitor and 
is very poised for his age." 
</P>
<P>
 That poise was evident when Rosselli strode onto the field against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great feeling, just to be out on the mound again," he said. "Of 
course, I can't get too excited about one start. There's 24 or 25 more to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short 'n sweet: Roger Salkeld isn't long for the Pacific Coast League, which 
is good news for a fairly sizable group of triple-A hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld has won his only two starts for the Seattle Mariners' affiliate in 
Calgary. In 11 innings, he has given up two earned runs and three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are batting .081 against Salkeld, who had a no-hitter through five 
innings against Vancouver on Wednesday night when he was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Salkeld is scheduled to make another start on Monday before receiving a 
promotion. The former Saugus High star is expected to make his first start for 
the Mariners next Saturday, a club official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second time around: With his second team and in his second position, Jim 
Bruske is on the cusp of getting his first shot in the big leagues after eight 
full seasons in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Palmdale High and Antelope Valley College star is a starting 
pitcher for the Houston Astros' triple-A team in Tucson. Drafted by the 
Cleveland Indians out of Loyola Marymount in 1986, Bruske spent the first half 
of his pro career as an outfielder before being converted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros signed Bruske as a minor league free agent in 1992 and last season 
he was a combined 13-7 with a 3.29 earned-run average for Tucson and double-A 
Jackson (Miss.). 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in his career, Bruske was invited to big-league camp this 
spring. He appeared in three games and pitched well, giving up three runs in 
nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 One strike against Bruske is his age, 29. But because of his switch to 
pitching, he has remained patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely had a timetable as an outfielder, but things have changed," he 
said. "It would be different if I'd been a pitcher for a lot of years already. 
Then it would be easier to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: A sore shoulder that has plagued infielder David Landaker since 
shortly after he was drafted out of Royal High has flared up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker, a second-round choice of the Astros in 1992, has not appeared in the 
first seven games for the Class-A Quad City River Bandits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers him to throw," a club official said. "When he does, it pinches 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar problem last season limited Landaker to 10 games in the rookie Gulf 
Coast League. In 32 at-bats, he batted .500 with five doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Cubs have told former Westlake High standout Matt Franco to expect 
some work at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, a first baseman who last season batted a combined .305 with 12 home 
runs and a Cubs' organization-high 37 doubles for double-A Orlando and triple-A 
Iowa, welcomes the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to play as much third as I can because I think I become a lot more 
valuable if they know I can play both positions," Franco said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're versatile and bat left-handed, there's usually a spot for you on at 
least one of the 28 teams out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago thinks enough of Franco that he was protected on its 40-man big-league 
roster during the winter.  
</P>
<P>
 This spring, because of an injury to Cub regular Mark Grace, Franco got a long 
look by the major league team. In 41 at-bats, he had 11 hits, including a home 
run off Mike Harkey of the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a solid 1993 season with double-A San Antonio, former Poly High standout 
Javier Delahoya was released by the Dodgers and quickly signed by the Florida 
Marlins.  
</P>
<P>
 Now pitching for double-A Maine, Delahoya is off to an 0-1 start, but he has 
struck out nine and given up only two earned runs in 12 innings.

COUNTY SECTION PROPOSAL TO GO BEFORE CIF PANEL; HIGH SCHOOLS: OFFICIALS ON 
MONDAY WILL MAKE THE NEXT MOVE TOWARD SECEDING FROM SOUTHERN SECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County high school officials will make a formal presentation to the CIF 
section relations committee Monday, hoping to take another step toward forming 
an Orange County Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Seal, superintendent of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District, will head 
a three-man delegation that will present a revised plan to set up and govern a 
new section. 
</P>
<P>
 A recommendation for approval by the section relations committee would be a 
major step toward forming an Orange County Section. 
</P>
<P>
 If the section relations committee approves of the plan, it will be forwarded 
to the State Federated Council for a vote on May 28. Final approval could be in 
October, at the council's fall meeting. The federation generally follows the 
recommendation of the section relations committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said a representative from the 
section will be present at the meeting to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The outline for an Orange County Section has undergone revisions in the areas 
of representation, appeals and protests, according to Seal. He said finances 
are no longer a question. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to form an Orange County section began nearly two years ago, when 
superintendents in the county grew disgruntled with the Southern Section over 
representation. They formed a committee to look into seceding from the section 
and have held several meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been a smooth process. A meeting of principals ended abruptly last 
summer, when many complained about the weighted voting process. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said those problems have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school in the section will have one vote. Schools that field at least 16 
teams of the section's 40 sanctioned sports will have two votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that if you were a school of 500 students and fielded 16 sports you 
should be just as involved as a school of 3,000," Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal said everyone involved with the process to form a new section -- 
including superintendents, principals and athletic directors -- were in favor 
of the voting structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed appeals and protests bylaw has streamlined, according to 
Esperanza Principal George Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The process will have only one level in Orange County. A decision by the 
commissioner can be appealed to the section's eligibility committee. After 
that, all appeals will be to the State CIF. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to simplify and get rid of as much bureaucracy as possible," said 
Allen, who is on the committee that worked on the process. "We will be a small 
section and won't have a very large office staff. If the decision is 
unacceptable, then move it on to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said an appeal committee would not be set up in each case. It would not 
include officials from the same league or anyone who had a stake in the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way we get a true, unbiased decision," Allen said.

IN VICTORY, WESTON STAYS OUT OF HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Weston turned his prophecy into reality Friday night at Ventura Raceway, 
winning the 20-lap Street Stock main event by one-third of a lap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura resident blew a tire twice in last week's main, the second one 
coming when he hit a hole in the track in the first turn on the last lap after 
charging from last place to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward he vowed, "I'll get them next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Weston did just that, taking the lead on the start from the second position 
and running wire to wire for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still that hole there," Weston said. "I just adjusted my setup and 
tried to stay out of the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak View's Paul Moore, who won the main last week and won the championship 
last year by 15 points over Weston, charged from eighth place to finish second 
in the main event after defeating Weston by one length in the eight-lap heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weston of his victory over Moore, "I didn't have to battle with him, 
which made it a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think I had it set up right, but we'll find out in two weeks when 
we run side to side." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mini Stock division, Ventura resident Gary Swenson went wire to wire in 
the eight-lap heat, and led all but the first two laps while winning the 20-lap 
main. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson started on the pole in the feature, but slid into the infield on the

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; EL TORO RALLIES PAST SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro, ranked No. 1 in Orange County, rallied to post a five-game victory 
over fourth-ranked San Clemente in a South Coast League boys' volleyball match 
Friday at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Tritons put themselves on the verge of an upset with a convincing 
15-1 victory in Game 3, El Toro's bench sparked the Chargers to a 14-16, 16-14, 
1-15, 15-13, 15-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Clemente outplayed us for 80% of the match," El Toro Coach Mike Jagd 
said. "But we got lucky at a few critical times." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his top player, Ryan Mariano, had 30 kills, Jagd needed reserves 
Steve Hilbert and Steve Nelson to spark the Chargers (7-1, 4-0 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson filled in for starting setter Todd Steinert, who had 74 assists, during 
Game 4 and helped El Toro re-establish its middle attack. Hilbert had 11 kills 
in Games 4 and 5 when Mariano went cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, San Clemente (7-1, 3-1) had its chances. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 5, Corin Bemus spiked to draw the Tritons within three, 11-8, and 
Brandon Taliaferro added another from the back row to make it 11-9. But El Toro 
shut out San Clemente the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our camaraderie slipped a bit," San Clemente Coach Mike Hurlbut said, "and 
you need that late in Game 5. But I asked the kids if they left every ounce of 
physical energy on the court and they answered yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Gardner led the Tritons with 24 kills and Bemus added 16. Taliaferro had 
65 assists and six blocks and Eric Krogh had 14 kills and six blocks. Four of 
Krogh's blocks came in the lopsided Game 3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This league is tough as nails," Hurlbut said. "That's the good thing and the 
bad thing about this league. But we have a long season to go, and I know we can 
still play better." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro's Doug Thompson had 15 kills and Chris Jacobson had 10 kills and five 
blocks, including two in Game 5.  
</P>
<P>
 In Game 5, Jacobson blocked Phinney Gardner's spike attempt to push El Toro's 
lead to 13-9. Then after a San Clemente hitting error, Steinert blocked Alan 
Duke on match point.

 Ventura County prosecutors said Friday they have not decided whether to file 
charges against all-state football player Leodes Van Buren of Newbury Park 
High, who is suspected of firing a gunshot into his girlfriend's home last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren appeared in Ventura County Municipal Court on Friday for a scheduled 
arraignment, but it was postponed after the prosecutor's announcement. 
Municipal Judge James Cloninger ordered the 18-year-old senior back to court 
May 10, when the district attorney's office will disclose its decision on 
filing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who appeared in court with his guardian and a school counselor, was 
arrested April 8 on suspicion of firing a single shot through the back door of 
Marcie James' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he fired the shot after engaging in an argument with James, 19, a 
pitcher on the Moorpark College softball team, earlier that day. No one was 
injured, and Van Buren later denied pulling the trigger. He said a companion 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Cloninger allowed him to remain free on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren's attorney, John B. Miller Jr. of Woodland Hills, said his client 
plans to tell investigators the truth about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to cooperate so it will not deleteriously affect his scholarship," 
Miller said. Van Buren has earned a scholarship to play football at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia J. Kelliher said a decision on 
charges against Van Buren will be made by May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Sheriff's Department has turned over its investigation to 
prosecutors, but the district attorney's office requested sheriff's 
investigators to do more follow-up work -- a common practice in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren helped Newbury Park win the Southern Section Division III 
championship last fall. The 6-foot-1, 190-pounder finished his high school 
career as the state's career leader in receptions. DWAYNE BRAY

WHITE MAKES RIGHT AT TORONTO; BASEBALL: ANGELS GAVE UP ON CENTER FIELDER IN 
1990, AND NOW HE HAS TWO WORLD SERIES RINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, they said the young center fielder couldn't hit his weight. They said he 
couldn't be a leadoff hitter, wasn't patient enough, didn't hit for average. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon White still runs like Carl Lewis, patrolling center field with long, 
blazing strides. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, he has also become an exceptional leadoff hitter as he showed once 
again Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels gave up on White after the 1990 season, trading him to Toronto 
along with Willie Fraser and Marcus Moore in exchange for Junior Felix, Luis 
Sojo and Ken Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 They got fleeced. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hard-hitting Blue Jays, who went into Friday with a .291 team 
batting average and 19 home runs, White tends to get lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olerud won the American League batting title last season with a .363 
average. Paul Molitor was second at .332 and Roberto Alomar was third at .326. 
</P>
<P>
 White hit .273, 10 points better than in any of his six seasons as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Friday, when White delivered three hits, one RBI and one run scored, he 
was almost overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into extra innings, Olerud had three hits and three RBIs and Molitor 
had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, he proved to be more valuable than the current Angel center 
fielder, Chad Curtis, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't White's run-scoring single in the third inning. Or the long sprint 
to catch up with Curtis' certain double in the gap in left-center. Or the 
eighth-inning double. Or the ninth-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those things stood out as White improved his average to .380 Friday. 
Each was remarkable in its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 His counterpart, Curtis, was struggling at the plate, hitting .171 going into 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels hope it's a temporary funk and that he'll snap out of it soon. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Curtis led the Angels in 1993 in average (.285), at-bats (583), 
runs (94) and hits (166). He was second to Luis Polonia in stolen bases with 
48. 
</P>
<P>
 How does that stack up to White? 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, Curtis fared well, most notably holding a higher average and stealing 
more bases. 
</P>
<P>
 But with White, an All-Star for the second time in his career last season, 
leading them, the Blue Jays won 95 games and their second consecutive World 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's no coincidence that the aforementioned they are no longer employed at 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager, Doug Rader, is long gone and so are former general managers Mike 
Port and Dan O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, White keeps running strong.

GOLDEN WEST CO-COACH DAVE STRICKLIN LEAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Stricklin, co-coach of the Golden West College women's basketball team 
the last eight years, has accepted a teaching and head coaching position at 
Umpqua College in Roseburg, Ore., a Golden West spokesman announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin, who with his father, Dick, has a record of 259-27 (.906) in guiding 
Golden West to the State tournament in each of the last eight seasons.The 
Rustlers advanced to the semifinals seven times and the championship game three 
times, winning unprecedented back-to-back State championships in 1990 and '91. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Golden West was 33-5 and won its fifth consecutive Orange Empire 
Conference title before losing to Los Angeles Harbor in the State title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about going, but I'm not excited about leaving," Dave Stricklin, 
35, said in a release. "I have had the opportunity to be in kind of a special 
situation the last several years working with my dad and I will really miss 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West also announced that Elizabeth Sirchia, a Kodak All-American who 
led the Rustlers to their consecutive State titles, will rejoin the school's 
program, replacing Dave Stricklin as assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirchia, who was a two-time All-State and all-conference selection at Golden 
West, transferred to Hawaii, where she was a member of the Rainbow Wahine team 
that finished 25-7 and second in the Women's NIT. She later transferred to Cal 
Poly Pomona, where she played this season and was a first-team All-California 
College Athletic Assn. selection. 
</P>
<P>
 She will work with the Rustlers' guards and defense and be involved with 
recruiting.

JEFFIRES REJECTS RAMS' CONTRACT PROPOSAL; FOOTBALL: HOUSTON WIDE RECEIVER WILL 
ENTERTAIN OFFERS FROM OTHER TEAMS, INCLUDING HIS OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires on Friday rejected the Rams' 
three-year, $3.9-million contract proposal, choosing instead to entertain 
offers from other clubs, including his current team, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, confirmed Jeffires' decision, adding 
that the Rams don't plan to submit a new contract deal to the three-time Pro 
Bowl selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that he didn't accept the offer," Zygmunt said. "That's 
basically it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I would say that it is more unlikely than likely (that the 
team will submit a new proposal)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Joseph, Jeffires' agent, was unavailable for comment, but a 
representative at his Greensboro, N.C., office said Jeffires had rejected the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' proposal, which included a $600,000 signing bonus, was about 
$700,000 a year less than Jeffires has been seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Jeffires had told reporters in Houston that he wanted to keep 
his options open -- including the Rams' offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who doesn't give you a take-it-or-leave it offer?" Jeffires said. "I'll wait 
and be patient. It's a cat-and-mouse game. A million dollars is easy to come 
by. I could get that from a lot of teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and Denver also had pursued Jeffires, the AFC's leader in 
receptions in 1990, '91 and '92. But the Broncos signed Anthony Miller in March 
and the Redskins signed the Rams' Henry Ellard on Wednesday. The Rams made the 
offer to Jeffires on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, who earned $900,000 last season with Houston, has indicated he would 
like to stay with the Oilers. Houston has made him a tentative offer worth $1.3 
million a year and isn't likely to offer more because of salary cap problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also have been interested in unrestricted free-agent receivers Ricky 
Sanders of the Washington Redskins and Greg McMurtry of New England. They also 
have scheduled a Tuesday workout for Cincinnati wide receiver Wesley Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed free-agent defensive back and punt returner Cliff Hicks, 
formerly of the New York Jets. Hicks, 5-feet-10 and 187 pounds, was a 
third-round draft selection by the Rams in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks played three seasons with the Rams and three seasons with Buffalo before 
signing as a free-agent with the Jets last season. His first pro interception 
came in 1987 against Chris Miller, his former college teammate at Oregon and 
current Ram quarterback.

UC IRVINE BASKETBALL ASSISTANTS ORELLANA, MURPHY FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Orellana and Tim Murphy, assistant men's basketball coaches at UC Irvine, 
have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana was hired during Coach Rod Baker's first season at the school 
(1991-92) and Murphy, the restricted-earnings assistant, had been with the 
program for a total of eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hearing rumors about it recently, but it was finalized today," Joe 
Hannon, a senior with the Anteaters last season, said Friday. "Coach Baker 
hasn't confronted (the players) with it yet and I don't really know if he's 
going to, but Tim and Rob have talked to some of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana was out of town Friday and Murphy was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West coaches had picked Irvine to finish sixth in the preseason poll, 
but the Anteaters were 4-14 during the regular season and ended up in last 
place. They rebounded to win three games in the conference tournament and 
missed a berth in the NCAA tournament when they lost the final game to New 
Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana was the most vocal of the Irvine coaching staff, both in practice and 
during games. He had been the head coach at Downey Pius X and the team manager 
at UNLV when the Runnin' Rebels won the national championship in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, whose brother, Tod, was a standout for the Anteaters in the mid-1980s, 
was an assistant at Irvine from 1985 to 1988 before coaching at Pacific 
Lutheran in Tacoma, Wash., for one season. He returned to the Anteater staff 
for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Greg Vetrone, whose main responsibility is recruiting, apparently 
escaped the shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rod Baker did not return a phone message Friday night.

PRICE, IRVINE-BASED FLUOR PLANS TO OVERHAUL ITS MANAGEMENT.

 Fluor Corp., one of the most esteemed engineering and construction companies 
in the world, broke its own record last year for both earnings and revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The $7.9-billion company is now putting up 80 oil and chemical refineries 
everywhere from Thailand to the Netherlands. Closer to home, Fluor has been 
cleaning up a closed uranium plant in Ohio -- a $2.2-billion federal contract 
for the largest environmental remediation project yet. And a few months ago, 
the company landed the less lucrative but more glamorous assignment to build a 
Mercedes auto plant in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's stock recently has been trading at more than $50 a share -- quite a 
leap from seven years ago, when the then-troubled company brought in half the 
revenue it did last year and its stock was languishing at $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite that impressive showing, Fluor plans to announce next week a 
major overhaul of its management team. The move begs the question: Why mess 
with success? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you try to stay level, you're probably going to end up moving backward," 
Leslie McCraw, chairman and chief executive officer of Fluor, said in an 
interview this week at the company's Irvine headquarters. "So we are 
challenging our organization to think through how we can do better tomorrow 
what we do today." 
</P>
<P>
 McCraw would not be specific about upcoming changes, saying only that the 
company will decentralize power by transferring employees to bases around the 
world in order to strengthen its presence abroad. Nearly half of Fluor's 
$15-billion backlog of contracts is for projects on foreign land -- compared to 
a fifth of its $5-billion backlog in 1987, the year after the company underwent 
a reorganization that set it on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest restructuring comes within weeks of McCraw's return to work after 
recuperating from surgery last month to remove a malignant tumor from his 
prostate gland. "I was very fortunate in that the tumor was closely contained 
and had not metastasized to the rest of my body," said McCraw, 59. "I feel 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why now? Why tinker with the company's structure at a time when you are 
enjoying such success? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Against a backdrop of considerable success, we're asking ourselves how we 
can take it to the next level. How can we align ourselves even more closely 
with the marketplace? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So even though the company has reached its height of success, you worry 
about hitting a plateau? 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you tread water, you're not going to make progress. I set up a couple of 
task forces made up of senior executives to brainstorm while I was in the 
hospital and out of the office, and they came back to me with recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What were those recommendations? What changes do you have in store for the 
company? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We want to flatten the organization, to take some of the hierarchy out and 
redirect it. I want to reduce the levels between me and the worker, and utilize 
our executives in a more focused way. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll put more resources into regional offices than we have in the past. We'll 
ask some people to move to Asia Pacific and other areas to strengthen our 
regional influence. We want to give these people more accountability, so they 
won't always have to come back to headquarters to get an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have you already informed the people who are slated for relocation? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No one has been notified. We've not made the final decision as to who's 
going to be in what role. We'll roll this out over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. As I understand it, you are talking about a decentralization of power. 
</P>
<P>
 A. We want to put decision-making at lower levels -- at locations close to the 
client so we can react faster. We want to set policy in a central way, but set 
execution in a decentralized fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will you bridge language and cultural differences? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The concept of duality is important in a global marketplace. It is 
important to front the market with people who are very familiar with a 
particular (type of) project -- we want automotive business people talking to 
automotive clients, petrochemical people talking to petrochemical clients and 
the like. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to temper and support their knowledge of the business with an 
appreciation for the geographic influences. In other words, if we have a 
hydrocarbon project in China, we want to get Chinese people involved who know 
China well. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very challenging to be a diversified global player. It's not all that 
complicated to sell one product globally. But if you're going to respond to a 
variety of opportunities, a lot of customized thinking needs to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. As the CEO of a major corporation and a world traveler, what was it like to 
lie in the hospital for a week, then at home for another two weeks, after your 
recent surgery? 
</P>
<P>
 A. This is the longest stretch I've gone in a long time without making a trip 
someplace. My wife and I were sitting around thinking about that the other 
night -- when was the last time we were together for two months every day and 
every night? Probably 1978. That's just the nature of this business. The past 
two months were different for us, and fun. I think I can speak for her on that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did your brush with cancer make you re-evaluate your life? Did it make you 
want to work a little less, spend more time with your family, retire earlier -- 
anything like that? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Any normal person who has looked across the table at a doctor and heard the 
word "cancer" would look at life somewhat differently after that experience.  
</P>
<P>
 I was very fortunate that we caught it early enough to get rid of it. As we 
sit here and speak, there are many people living with prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, it does give one pause to think, to reassess values, and to go back 
and rediscover some truths and concepts we might have been taught in Sunday 
school or by our parents. It's a time when your feelings toward family become 
stronger than before. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, it almost seems like a dream now -- being diagnosed with cancer, 
then having an operation, and now it's all gone and I'm back at work. It all 
happened in a pretty short time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You returned to the office just in time for the sale of your lead-mining 
subsidiary, Doe Run Co., two weeks ago. (Plagued by a glut in the lead market, 
Doe Run has lost $50 million since 1991, and Fluor put it on the market in late 
1992.) Is that a relief for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Doe Run was a business that doesn't provide a lot of compatibility with our 
core business. It's a mining company, and we're a service company. It's capital 
intensive, and that's just not our business. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Last month, you became one of the first U.S. engineering companies to open 
trade offices in Vietnam after the embargo was lifted. Have you received much 
criticism for doing business in a Communist country? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We've received some letters. But I think we can learn more about MIAs on a 
business-to-business basis than we can from a strict standoffish position. 
Establishing lines of communication will allow us to break down barriers faster 
than trying to do it in a threatening way.

BONDS AGAIN TRIP PAINEWEBBER; INVESTMENT: BROKER CLAIMS HE WAS FIRED FOR 
TELLING CLIENTS THEY MIGHT BE DUE MONEY FOR SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of risky, unregistered securities by PaineWebber Inc.'s Santa Barbara 
office helped get the Wall Street brokerage in trouble with regulators before. 
But that didn't stop the high-producing branch from doing it again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed Friday, a former broker in the office charged that he was 
threatened, punished and finally fired by PaineWebber earlier this year because 
he told clients they could be entitled to get back money they paid for bonds 
that weren't registered for sale in California. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber denied that the broker, Charles M. Bloom, was punished for 
advising clients of their rights, saying he was "terminated" in January "due to 
the low level of production that he generated." 
</P>
<P>
 But the brokerage confirmed that the Santa Barbara office sold several hundred 
thousand dollars' worth of unregistered R.H. Macy & Co. junk bonds in 1991 -- 
the bulk of the more than $1 million worth that PaineWebber sold without 
registration in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A "purchase advisory" the firm sent to its brokers nationwide in June, 1991, 
did not warn that the bonds were not registered for sale in every state. The 
advisory noted that the bonds were "highly speculative" but said they were 
"attractive for total-return investors, and we recommend purchase." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months later, the bonds became virtually worthless when Macy's filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom -- who alone sold $395,000 of the bonds to 20 clients -- said he 
believed at the time that the securities were properly registered. His suit, 
filed in Santa Barbara County Superior Court, alleges that PaineWebber 
repeatedly ordered him to remain silent after he learned of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents filed with the lawsuit include a Sept. 14, 1992, letter from a 
PaineWebber lawyer warning Bloom he would be violating the firm's policies if 
he let his clients know about a settlement the brokerage had reached with 
another Macy's bond investor. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions from The Times, PaineWebber said the bonds were sold 
improperly because "a number of investment executives in California 
(erroneously) assumed the Macy's bonds qualified for an exemption" from the 
state's registration requirements, which are known as Blue Sky laws.  
</P>
<P>
 The firm noted that once investors learned the bonds were not registered and 
filed a class-action lawsuit against the firm in February, 1993, PaineWebber 
settled the following August, reimbursing investors for most of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under David W. Stanger, the same branch manager who supervised Bloom, the 
Santa Barbara office has been accused before of illegally selling high-risk, 
unregistered securities and defrauding clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were part of wide-ranging charges by the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission accusing PaineWebber of 
wrongdoing in retail branch offices across the country, including charges of 
brokers stealing customers' money, selling unregistered securities and making 
trades customers hadn't authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 settlement of wide-ranging charges against PaineWebber by the NYSE -- 
which resulted in a $900,000 fine -- included allegations against the Santa 
Barbara office and Stanger. Stanger was officially responsible for approving 
every trade in his branch, and the NYSE alleged that he allowed brokers in the 
late 1980s to load up the accounts of small investors with risky, unregistered 
stocks that ultimately produced huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
 PaineWebber and Stanger accepted punishment without admitting or denying 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger's branch had heavily promoted the stocks of three companies whose 
principal backer was a convicted felon. The companies made wildly false claims 
about their financial prospects. One falsely told investors it had discovered a 
cheap process for extracting vast amounts of gold from the black sand beaches 
of Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate 1993 settlement with the SEC, PaineWebber's Beverly Hills branch 
office was banned for one month from opening new accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 A PaineWebber spokesman said the firm had not taken any disciplinary action 
against Stanger in connection with the sale of the Macy's bonds. The spokesman 
said the sale was the firm's fault, not Stanger's, and that a new monitoring 
system has been put in place to prevent the sale of unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger declined to comment, citing company policy.

WARNING FLAG OVER GATT; ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY PACT WILL WEAKEN U.S. SAFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The environmental community, which recently split deeply over support for the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, is issuing warnings about the new world 
trade agreement in a newly unified voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists charge that the comprehensive General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade accord signed Friday in Morocco will erode the United States' 
-- and California's -- ability to enforce its environmental strictures on 
everything from recycling to pesticide use to air pollution.  
</P>
<P>
 "If this . . . is enacted," said Barbara Dudley, executive director of 
Greenpeace USA, "over two decades of environmental protection could be severely 
weakened."  
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that more true than in the area of food safety, some 
environmentalists argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, with some of the world's most restrictive regulation of 
pesticides, prohibits the entry of food products with detectable traces of 
about 40 chemicals -- substances used by many of its trading partners and 
listed as allowable by the standard-setting organization of the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But if U.S. Customs Service inspectors begin turning away food imports that 
bear traces of these chemicals under the new agreement, America's trading 
partners are almost certain to cry foul, environmentalists warned. If their 
challenges stand, one activist said, U.S. pesticide protections could topple, 
one after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the accord acknowledged that the letter of the new agreement may 
indeed put the United States, with its strong environmental protections, on the 
defensive. That is because some U.S. laws championed by environmentalists, as 
well as state laws, do not appear to be based on undisputed scientific evidence 
demonstrating that a regulation will improve the public's health or mitigate a 
known environmental hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the agreement also argue that the United States' market power, 
as well as a growing appreciation for the environmental ethic among America's 
trading partners, will cause virtually any challenge to U.S. environmental laws 
to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practical implementation of trade agreements is often more politically 
sensitive and realistic than the sheer language of the treaty," said William K. 
Reilly, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the George 
Bush Administration and an avowed free trader. 
</P>
<P>
 Other free traders cited the power and transparency of the processes by which 
U.S. laws are passed and regulations are made. In a challenge before the 
international trade deliberative body, U.S. defenders could produce reams of 
scientific data, risk assessments and economic analysis to prove that an 
American environmental standard was established not to keep foreign products 
out, but to benefit the public's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a fair fight," said Linda Fisher, a Washington-based trade attorney with 
the Los Angeles law firm Latham & Watkins, "the United States will win." 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental activists are not comforted by those assurances. They say 
that the fine print of the new agreement would allow a trading partner to argue 
before the trade court in Geneva, Switzerland, that Washington's environmental 
laws -- or those of individual U.S. states -- constitute an unfair barrier to 
the entry of that country's exports. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States regulates more strictly than its trading partners the 
fuel emissions or stipulates the fuel efficiency of cars sold or operated 
within its borders (which it does), or prohibits food products that bear traces 
of certain pesticides it considers hazardous (which it does), a trading 
partner, in principle, can challenge the federal stricture under the trade 
agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists said that under the trade agreement, trading partners could 
target laws such as the one that grew out of California's Proposition 65, which 
requires a cautionary label on any product that would expose its user to a 
carcinogen or a chemical that could be harmful to a developing fetus or 
pregnant woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California state regulations that could be challenged go beyond federal 
government requirements by making manufacturers of agricultural chemicals 
furnish the state with data on the chemical's possible effects on human 
reproduction, water pollution, exposed workers and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Another California stricture that could come under attack is one that has 
required wine manufacturers to sponsor efforts to warn consumers of the 
possible dangers posed by the lead in the foil that covers wine corks. Finally 
... A World Trade Pact 
</P>
<P>
 Ministers from 124 nations ended seven years of complex negotiations Friday 
and formally concluded the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade talks in Marrakesh, Morroco. Following are the main elements of the 
26,000-page, 385-pound global world trade pact: 
</P>
<P>
 MARKET ACCESS - This is the backbone of the act. Countries pledge to cut 
tariffs on industrial and farm goods by an average of about 37%. The United 
States and European Union agree to trim tariffs between them by one half. 
</P>
<P>
 SERVICES - For the first time, rules will govern annual trade in services such 
as banking, insurance and travel, as well as the movement of labor. The United 
States reserves the right to deny other countries favorable access to the 
lucrative U.S. financial services market, but will hold off for at least 18 
months. Washington has threatened to challenge EC curbs on audio-visual goods. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXTILES - Import quotas on textiles and clothing, in place under the 
Multi-Fiber Arrangement since 1974, will be phased out over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 ANTI-DUMPING - Rules on dumping - pricing exports below their value in the 
domestic market - are clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 AGRICULTURE - Also for the first time, agriculture is folded into the GATT. 
The blueprint is the 1992 Blair House accord reached between the United States 
and the EU as amended in talks last December. It converts all non-tariff 
barriers such as quotas into tariffs, which are reduced 36% for industrialized 
countries, 24% for poor nations. The cuts will be phased in over six years for 
rich countries, 10 for others. The pact also cuts direct export subsidies and 
agricultural supports and forces countries with closed farm markets -- 
including Japan, which restricts rice imports -- to import at least 3% of 
domestic consumption of the product, rising to 5% over six years. 
</P>
<P>
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - The treaty toughens protection for patents, 
copyrights, rights of performers and producers of sound recordings, trademarks, 
and labels of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT EXPANSION - Set up as a temporary body in 1947, GATT will be transformed 
into a permanent watchdog called the World Trade Organization, with status 
equal to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The WTO will begin 
operations between January and July, 1995.

TURNER TURNS COLD TO DEAL WITH HSN; TELEVISION: AFTER BOARD MEETING, TBS 
ABANDONS MERGER TALKS WITH HOME SHOPPING NETWORK, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turner Broadcasting System has abandoned merger discussions with Home Shopping 
Network, according to industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came at a Turner board meeting Friday. Sources say Time Warner 
Inc., a Turner shareholder, opposed the idea of buying the electronic retailer 
because the stock-swap deal would have shifted the balance of power within 
Turner to Tele-Communications Inc., another Turner shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Shopping Network is controlled by a TCI affiliate, Liberty Media Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and Time Warner are part of the group of cable TV operators that acquired 
a large stake in Turner in the late 1980s when the company ran into financial 
trouble. "It was Ted's idea," the executive said, referring to Turner Chief 
Executive Ted Turner. "But Time Warner never bought into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The asking price for HSN was not disclosed. Turner was apparently interested 
in the network not only for its core home shopping business, but also because 
of the company's link to Silver King Communications, which owns 12 UHF 
television stations that operate as HSN affiliates. The stations, many of them 
in large cities, could serve as a launch pad for a broadcast network. 
</P>
<P>
 From HSN's standpoint, Turner would have made a good partner because of the 
ability to cross-promote HSN on Turner's cable TV networks such as CNN and TBS, 
as well as the economies of scale that could have been achieved by merging HSN 
with Turner's marketing, affiliate relations and advertising departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, HSN would have been able to sell merchandise connected with the 
growing Turner entertainment empire, which includes the Atlanta Braves baseball 
and Hawks basketball teams, cartoon characters such as Yogi Bear and the 
Jetsons, and paraphernalia from the company's large library of movie classics. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said the Turner board was also uneasy about the deal because of 
the growing disparity in the two companies' stock prices. Turner stock has been 
trading at a 52-week low of about $19 a share, which would have meant that more 
TBS shares would have to have been exchanged for HSN shares. However, the 
source did not rule out an eventual deal.

STATE WARNS FIVE WORKERS' COMP JUDGES ON CONDUCT; ETHICS: YEARLONG INQUIRY 
FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. BUT QUESTIONS OF IMPROPRIETY WERE 
RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a report that prompted calls for further investigation into the workers' 
compensation courts, state officials announced Friday that they have warned 
five of the system's judges about possible misconduct and vowed to tighten 
regulations to prevent future wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up a yearlong inquiry, the state Division of Workers' Compensation 
found no evidence of criminal activity. But the agency concluded that three 
Southern California judges appear to have unwittingly violated ethics rules 
related to a trip to Hawaii, while two others broke state civil law by 
improperly accepting speaking fees from groups that appear before the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased that the most serious allegations proved to be unfounded rumor 
and innuendo," said Casey L. Young, administrative director of the Division of 
Workers' Compensation, referring to charges of bribery and money laundering. 
"The most valuable lesson of this ordeal is the realization that the line 
between what is acceptable behavior and what is unacceptable is not always as 
clear as it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 But a key state lawmaker immediately called Young's promised tightening of 
regulation an inadequate response and said he will call for a criminal 
investigation if Young does not take the action himself. Young had said he does 
not plan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmaker, Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear) -- co-author of a workers' 
compensation reform measure passed last year -- argued that "strong 
accountability" is needed in the workers' compensation courts. Referring to 
statements that two judges "appear to have violated" state law and that three 
others "may have breached" the state code of judicial conduct, he added, "It's 
weasel language that the public doesn't enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley R. Zax, chairman and chief executive of Woodland Hills-based Zenith 
Insurance, one of the state's biggest workers' compensation insurers, said, "I 
don't think that Casey Young, who apparently found violations, can think that 
the matter is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have a system where people are perceived to have violated the law, 
and there are facts to support it, and then it's excused," Zax said. "That 
doesn't equate to equal justice under the law to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation by the Department of Industrial Relations began last year 
after the agency received a number of complaints about workers' compensation 
judges in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The allegations heightened concerns 
that wrongdoing and sloppy operating procedures in the courts might be another 
major source of trouble in California's abuse-riddled workers' compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the inquiry was complete, Young said, the agency had reviewed 
numerous documents and interviewed dozens of witnesses related to 26 
allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges included receiving bribes or improper compensation in the form of 
gifts, money and speaking fees from insurance company representatives, 
attorneys or doctors involved with cases pending before some of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also looked into the allegation that some members of the bench 
had outside business relationships with attorneys, lien collectors and 
physicians that created the potential for conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation extended all the way up to the top judge in the workers' 
compensation system, Mark L. Kahn, who from his office in Van Nuys oversees the 
27 district courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, who carries the title of assistant chief of the Division of Workers' 
Compensation, was scrutinized for outside income he drew by giving speeches for 
a legal seminar firm he co-owns. Records show that in 1992, Kahn made a profit 
of $70,000 from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kahn's lawyer, Fred J. Kumetz, said the judge was cleared of any 
wrongdoing and was not among the five singled out in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client has been fully vindicated," said Kumetz, who charged that insurance 
companies instigated the state investigation to intimidate judges they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 Young declined to release the names of the five judges singled out in the 
report, calling the investigation a personnel matter that by law must remain 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the inquiry centered on whether Ellen L. Flynn, the presiding 
judge of the Anaheim workers' compensation court, and at least three other 
Orange County judges had improperly accepted a trip to Hawaii from a doctor 
whose cases regularly went before their courts. The judges went to Hawaii to 
appear at a workers' compensation seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three judges whom the investigation deemed to have acted 
improperly in connection with the trip received "counseling letters," Young 
said, to clarify ethical rules and to warn them against creating the perception 
of improper activity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a summary of the investigation, only one judge reimbursed the 
doctor for all expenses related to the trip. Three others reimbursed the 
physician only for air fare and accepted hotel accommodations from him. In 
addition, the spouses of the judges accepted free air fare and accommodations 
paid for by the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators noted that the Fair Political Practices Commission had told the 
judges they were under no obligation to report the trip on their state-mandated 
financial disclosure statements. But the FPPC had also warned the judges that 
if any of them received transportation or other gifts worth more than $250, 
they might have a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Young promised Friday that his agency will draft a more specific code of 
conduct for workers' compensation judges with the help of the Josephson 
Institute of Ethics, a nationally known organization based in Marina del Rey. 
He said the standards should be established by the end of the year.

DIGITAL EQUIPMENT POSTS $183-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a fresh demonstration of the problems facing traditional computer 
companies, Digital Equipment Corp. on Friday shocked investors with a 
$183-million third-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The abysmal performance sent the company's stock into a free fall and raised 
questions about the effectiveness of Chief Executive Robert Palmer, who has 
generally received good reviews since taking over the top spot at the computer 
giant two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Like longtime rival International Business Machines Corp., Digital has been 
humbled by customers' rapid movement away from large, expensive, proprietary 
computer systems toward networks of standardized, low-cost personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long the nation's second-largest computer vendor, Maynard, Mass.-based Digital 
began piling up losses in 1991, and legendary founder Ken Olsen -- unwilling to 
undertake mass layoffs and other changes demanded by the board -- was pushed 
aside in favor of Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new CEO moved aggressively to cut costs, reorganized the company into 
industry-specific marketing groups and recruited a number of respected outside 
executives. Results improved steadily, though revenue continued to fall, and 
Hewlett-Packard Co. took over the No. 2 spot in the computer rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs began to emerge early this year that Palmer's program was running into 
trouble, and customer-specific marketing organizations were de-emphasized. The 
third-quarter loss (for the period ended April 2) was more than four times 
larger than Wall Street expected, and it confirmed the worst fears of analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital shares plunged $5.875 to $23 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
Computer stocks fell generally; IBM was down 87.5 cents to $53, and Apple 
Computer lost $1.25 to $30.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mind-set of senior management -- that cost cutting is going to be a 
solution -- has been proven wrong," said Richard Buchanan, a former Digital 
employee who is now a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. 
"The problem is related to corporate strategy. They do not have one." 
</P>
<P>
 Digital's explanation of the problems reads like a primer on how the computer 
industry has changed in the 1990s. Revenue from the flagship VAX line of 
mainframe and mini-computers are in decline. Sales of computers based on the 
new Alpha design were up, as were sales of industry-standard personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 But those products carry much lower profit margins than the proprietary VAXs. 
And, alarmingly, Digital's service revenue plunged 11%; the old-line VAX 
customer base that relied on Digital maintenance contracts is shrinking, and 
new customers are seeking cheaper service options. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Digital's revenue fell 6% to $3.26 billion from the year-ago quarter, 
when the company lost $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is supposed to be a growth area for companies such as Digital and IBM, 
which are among the few firms capable of designing, implementing and 
maintaining large corporate computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said Friday that the losses "are unacceptable to this management and 
obviously disappointing." He indicated that a new round of layoffs is likely, 
but he did not provide details. Digital is already in the process of cutting 
the work force from 92,000 worldwide to 85,000, far below its 1989 peak of 
about 140,000.

 Della Femina's Agency to Merge With Ketchum: Outspoken adman Jerry Della 
Femina said he will combine his 16-month-old agency with the New York office of 
Ketchum Communications, which has been seeking a higher profile on Madison 
Avenue.Della Femina, 57, has long been one of the most colorful figures in 
advertising. He severed 25-year ties to the Della Femina McNamee Inc. agency in 
June, 1992, after clashing with the French agency that had acquired control of 
it. Six months later, he founded Jerry Inc. That agency will be merged in a 
stock swap. The partners will each own 50% of Jerry & Ketchum Inc.

 Chicago Board of Trade Quits Globex: In dropping out of the troubled 
around-the-clock electronic futures trading venture, the board announced it 
will form a competing after-hours network with Bloomberg Financial Products.The 
move casts further doubt on the long-term survival of Globex, which was created 
with great fanfare a few years ago but has encountered numerous problems. The 
Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings developed the 
system. The Board of Trade and the Merc are the world's largest markets for 
commodities contracts. The system was created to allow trading of financial 
futures and options after the trading floors of the participating exchanges are 
closed.

 U.S. Ready to Hike Canada Wheat Tariffs: The government plans the action to 
limit imports if a trade dispute is not settled in a week, U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy said at a global trade meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. Espy 
and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor met their Canadian counterparts 
repeatedly over two days, but no deal was reached.Kantor said that if a deal is 
not struck by next Friday, the United States will try to stop what it considers 
unfairly subsidized Canadian wheat sales that hurt U.S. farmers. Canadian wheat 
sales to the United States have soared in the past few years, and Washington is 
seeking a ceiling to hold them back. The United States wants Canada to agree to 
a ceiling of reportedly 1.5 million metric tons a year, but Canada wants as 
much as 3.2 million tons, a source said.

FED EXPECTED TO HIKE INTEREST RATES AGAIN; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS SAY INFLATIONARY 
PRESSURES MAY FORCE MOVE AS EARLY AS MAY. LATEST ACTION CAME FEB. 4, THE FIRST 
TIME IN FIVE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Federal Reserve is expected to keep up its guard against inflationary 
pressures and may raise interest rates again as soon as next month, economists 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed tightened credit for the first time in five years Feb. 4 and raised 
interest rates again in March, making clear it wanted to stamp out any threat 
of inflation before prices started creeping up. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is set to meet again May 17 -- 
the trigger date, analysts said, for the next round of higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a good guess would be that it will happen after the May 17 (Federal 
Open Market Committee) meeting. That seems to be the trend," said Ray Stone, 
economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the next Fed tightening will be the last. It seems there will 
be another," Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We think the Fed will probably continue to tighten for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported Friday that the Fed was again signaling that 
interest rates would move higher, since low short-term rates have already 
encouraged too much lending. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the policy, the newspaper said, was to make the economy grow at its 
fastest-possible pace without feeding inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has argued strongly, however, that there is no current 
inflationary threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In an opinion piece in the New York Times, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of 
the Council of Economic Advisers, wrote that financial markets were reacting 
more to myths than to realities when it came to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, tighter credit has lifted rates on business loans and home 
mortgages, beginning the gradual process of dampening demand for money and 
crimping back on economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the most recent inflation reports were viewed as benign, economists 
said there is still a threat of potential price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that consumer prices advanced just 
0.3 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign the economy is still steaming ahead, the Fed said Friday that 
factories operated at their busiest pace in nearly five years during March and 
manufacturing output grew for a 10th straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data offer continued evidence that the industrial sector is doing quite 
well and that capacity use continues to trend upwards," said Dana Johnson, head 
of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is that the continued surge in the economy will force the Fed to 
take action again.

to options expirations, but bonds held steady as new economic data eased fears 
of renewed inflation. 
</P>

 Bonds held steady after economic reports came in as expected, quashing fears 
that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial output rose 0.5% in March, after a revised 0.6% rise in February. 
Capacity utilization rose to 83.6% from 83.4% in February.

7.29%. Its price also closed unchanged at 87 16/32.

2,199.90. 
</P>

 Retrial Ordered on Lion Country Safari-Irvine Co. Suit: A jury's order that 
Irvine pay $42.6 million in damages to the operator of the now-defunct Lion 
Country Safari theme park was overturned.Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Claude M. Owens also granted a motion for a new trial in the case, which dates 
to 1987. United Leisure Corp., which ran the park, claims that Irvine 
undermined the business by blocking it from making full use of the 300 acres it 
leased from the company. As a result, United Leisure's lawsuit alleges, it was 
forced to shut down Lion Country Safari. Brian Lysaght, a lawyer for United 
Leisure, said the company will appeal the order for a retrial, for which no 
date was set.

 Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey

<P>
 Hata concurred, saying, "We had useful, frank talks on how to stimulate 
U.S.-Japan economic relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Useful and frank -- but not especially productive. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kantor said progress had been made, he gave no details and set no date 
to reopen the trade talks, which crashed to a halt in February after a failed 
summit in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeking a common ground as the basis to begin re-engagement of the 
framework talks," said Kantor, who is here to sign the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade global treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Transpacific friction has mounted along with Japan's trade surplus, which 
totals $60 billion with the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree on the basics -- that the surplus must fall and Tokyo's 
imports rise -- but they have hit a wall over exactly how to get there.

INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT CONTINUES TO RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Industrial production in March rose for the 10th straight month, pushing 
factories closer to their operating limits than they have been in nearly five 
years, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That could lead to higher prices. But analysts said they saw no justification 
for the "inflation mania" that has convulsed financial markets or for any 
sudden increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration agreed, predicting moderate growth for the economy 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Production climbed 0.5% last month, the Federal Reserve Board said, despite 
cutbacks by the booming auto industry and a decline in electricity output as 
frigid weather ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Production has risen every month since May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed also reported that the operating rate at industrial companies -- which 
measures capacity use -- increased 0.2 percentage points to 83.6%, the highest 
rate since it was 83.9% in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial markets reacted calmly to the latest figures. Bond prices firmed 
and stocks were higher most of the day before closing slightly lower. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed at 3,661.47, down 1.78. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said factories are operating well below capacity, and they shrugged 
off the inflation worries that have spooked Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a danger sign at all," said economist Stephen S. Roach of 
Morgan Stanley & Co., the New York investment house. But he said that may not 
be enough to calm investors who have generated "the inflation mania sweeping 
our markets." 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has boosted short-term interest rates from 3% to 3.5% this 
year, and many analysts expect another rise no later than May 17, when the 
Federal Reserve Open Market Committee next meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear is that manufacturers could be reaching their production limits, 
which could drive prices higher and fan inflation. Industrial Production

 TRW to Repay Pentagon $29 Million: The company will make the payment to settle 
claims that it overcharged the Defense Department for jet engine and naval 
nuclear reactor parts. Assistant Atty. Gen. Frank W. Hunger of the Justice 
Department's civil division said employees of two former TRW Inc. divisions, 
Compressor Components and Power Accessories, both in Euclid, Ohio, padded labor 
hour estimates to support inflated cost proposals, charged the Pentagon for 
time spent working on commercial contracts and misstated the costs of raw 
materials. He said the overcharges occurred on numerous military subcontracts 
from at least 1978 through mid-1984.

AMERICA WEST TO TEAM UP WITH KNOTT'S BERRY FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm announced Friday that America West Airlines will sponsor 
its new $10-million Mystery Lodge attraction, promote Orange County tour 
packages and open a travel office at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's becomes the second theme-park sponsorship for the Phoenix-based 
airline, which operates 16 daily round-trip flights at Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport.America West recently unveiled plans to become the official 
airline of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, which includes a movie-themed 
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 America West spokeswoman Daphne Dicino said that the three-year Knott's deal 
is important because "that's a very big market for us in that area of Southern 
California. We have a lot of service out of that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's spokesman Bob Ochsner said the alliance will "provide us with added 
exposure in and out of Orange County, an opportunity to have a greater 
marketing presence in those Western cities where America West flies." 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 When America West opens its travel office at Knott's, local residents dining 
or shopping at the theme park will be able to use the office to make flight 
reservations and purchase plane tickets. And America West's name will be able 
posted at the Mystery Lodge, a theater that will feature Native American 
storytellers and special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement should benefit both tourists and Southland visitors to 
Knott's, Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's list of in-park sponsors includes Bank of America, the Chevrolet-Geo 
division of General Motors Corp., Alamo Rent A Car and Coca-Cola Co.

N.Y. STORE PICKS APPLE'S NEWTON AS ITS SPECIALTY; RETAIL: NEWTON SOURCE'S OWNER 
WANTS HIS OUTLET TO BE A RELAXED PLACE FOR CONSUMERS TO LEARN ABOUT THE 
HAND-HELD COMPUTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN RAMSTAD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across from the Plaza and down the street from Bergdorf Goodman is one of 
those specialty boutiques Fifth Avenue is known for. 
</P>
<P>
 But this one doesn't sell hats or gloves or shoes or watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the Newton, the hand-held computer that is, depending on your view, the 
most successful new product from Apple Computer Inc. or the most ridiculed. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Stephen Elms, a New Zealand native and former currency trader, decided 
to open Newton Source because he liked the Newton and disliked the way most 
stores sell computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a consumer of these types of things and buying a computer is 
befuddling," Elms said. "There's a gap in the market that hasn't been serviced 
directly and we took the opportunity to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apple introduced the one-pound Newton MessagePad with great fanfare in August. 
But its handwriting recognition drew criticism, including a one-week lampooning 
in the "Doonesbury" comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Apple sold 80,000 Newtons through January, the fastest launch of 
any of its products, including the popular Macintosh personal computer. The 
one-pound Newton keeps track of notes, addresses, calendars, spreadsheets and 
other data. 
</P>
<P>
 The company released an improved version several weeks ago and more software 
and accessories have become available, including a way for Newton to receive 
messages of up to 500 words. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the idea behind Newton, including the planned use of its core software 
on other portable devices in the future, isn't clear to most people, Elms 
believes his store is a relaxed place to learn about it. His business cards say 
"Personal Power Outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to be like a Saturn dealership, where they don't pressure you," he 
said, referring to the popular General Motors car. 
</P>
<P>
 He marked his first month of business Friday and said sales were 10 times what 
he expected. But he acknowledged his expectations were low and one month's 
experience does not mean success. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's location on West 58th Street across from the Plaza Hotel helps 
tremendously. After technophiles, Elms said the first people to try products 
like Newton are those with a lot of disposable income. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the chief of Apple's Newton division walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aware about this. We had never contacted him but I was very curious to 
see how he did it," Gaston Bastiaens, vice president and general manager of 
Apple's Personal Interactive Electronics Division, said of Elms Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very great initiative. This guy really understands what it takes to 
sell a new platform. He can give full service to all Newton owners." 
</P>
<P>
 But Elms also has the headaches of a small-business owner, including dealing 
with credit card companies, putting in a new floor and paying rent in a 
neighborhood where monthly rates typically start at a few hundred dollars per 
square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newton Source is already gaining a reputation. Elms said he has had calls 
from people in other states who said they were given his number by other 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 One software company even boasted in a press release that its new Newton 
program was available in three places -- the catalogues Mac Connection and Mac 
Warehouse and Newton Source. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are multimillion-dollar companies," Elms said of the comparison. "That 
to me is really funny."

O.C. THEATER / JAN HERMAN; CECILIA FANNON'S DETERMINED TO PLAYWRIGHT IT HER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You get an inkling of what she's like from the titles of her plays: "Wowee 
Maui" or "Bounds of Normal" or "Green Icebergs." But they don't quite prepare 
you for the playwright in person.  
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Fannon is sitting at her dining room table in Newport Beach. It is 
close to midnight. A slim redhead with granny glasses on the bridge of her 
nose, she looks very Irish and very smart and nothing at all like the stand-up 
comic she could easily be if she ever wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually wanted to be a nun," she said, "until I thought I was going to be 
a sex goddess. I used to wait for the guardian angel to appear at the foot of 
my bed. I'm not kidding. You're told you're going to receive a vocation, that's 
the word they use -- receive -- and I always thought there would be some 
announcement. What happened was at 17 I decided to skip trigonometry and make 
out with Billy McCarren." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon's eventual calling, which she discovered just four years ago, has 
yielded half a dozen full-length plays and an equal number of one-acts. Though 
still an unproduced playwright, she has already been blessed twice by South 
Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 She won the $5,000 top prize in SCR's 1993 California Playwrights Competition 
for "Green Icebergs," a comedy about modern sexual manners, and the $3,000 
second prize in 1992 for "To Distraction," about a woman trying to get her life 
in order. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "To Distraction" will air tonight at 6:30 on KCRW-FM (89.9) as 
part of the L.A. Theatre Works radio series "The Play's the Thing." If that 
isn't enough to make Fannon queen for a day, this morning at 10:30 on KTTV 
Channel 11, the Fox television network will air one of her episodes in its 
Emmy-nominated educational cartoon series for children, "Where on Earth Is 
Carmen Sandiego?" (see box). 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon, who is 43, appreciates the accolades, the money, the radio exposure, 
the free-lance work she gets in television. But none of that has fulfilled her 
craving for a full-scale theatrical production. "I feel like a virgin," she 
said. "I keep winning prizes, but I never get, um, produced." 
</P>
<P>
 That may change in the not-too-distant future. "Green Icebergs" will have a 
NewSCRipt reading May 2, to be staged by SCR producing artistic director David 
Emmes. "It's seriously under consideration for a production next season," Emmes 
said. "We're anxious to see how it works in the reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two of Fannon's biggest fans -- SCR literary manager John Glore and 
dramaturge Jerry Patch -- both maintain that it's just a matter of time before 
her plays catch on somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm surprised 'To Distraction' hasn't been grabbed up," said Glore, 
who has touted it to resident theaters around the country. "Her writing is very 
funny, but in the best kind of way. It feels real. It doesn't feel jokey or put 
on."  
</P>
<P>
 Fannon, a native New Yorker who worked during the mid-'80s as head writer for 
the CBS-TV daytime soap opera "The Guiding Light," insists she has never 
considered herself a comedy writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always amazed when people find my stuff funny," she said, pouring a 
second cup of coffee. "I deliberately write things that are ironic and skewed. 
Right now I'm writing a play called 'White Blood, Red Blood' about St. Ursula 
and the slaughter of 11,000 maidens. How can I possibly make that funny?" The 
main theme in all her plays, she believes, is infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always writing about it," she added. "Sometimes its sexual infidelity. 
But not being a great practitioner of sexual infidelity myself, I spend a lot 
of time in shame and remorse over verbal infidelity. I mean out-and-out 
betrayal, like picking on the frailties of friends." 
</P>
<P>
 A devoted playgoer from childhood, Fannon remembers growing up on Broadway 
shows during the '60s. "I can still see my father the bookmaker weeping at 'A 
Man for All Seasons,' " she said. "He was a big theater buff, and he always 
took me along. He couldn't take me to the track because I wasn't old enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon, 43, cut her teeth on Broadway musicals as well: "I saw Richard Burton 
and Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet in the original 'Camelot.' I saw Barbra 
Streisand in 'Funny Girl.' I even remember going out to the Westbury Music Fair 
and seeing Phyllis Diller take off her girdle." 
</P>
<P>
 After Fannon decided not to become a nun -- this during her senior year at a 
Catholic high school in Manhattan -- she naturally began to consider acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was being called to the legitimate stage by Sol Hurok, or maybe 
it was David Merrick," she said. "I remember confiding to my sister that I 
wanted to go to Lee Strasberg's school, the Actors Studio. She looked at me 
with absolute horror. 'Forget Barnard? Forget City College? Forget Catherine 
Gibbs?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But taking acting lessons was just a passing notion. Instead she played hooky 
from school and took trips to the Performing Arts Library at nearby Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would develop crushes on whoever I saw in the theater," Fannon recalled. 
"So I would go look them up at the library. You could get all these loose files 
with their pictures and obscure stories about them. I would become part of 
their lives for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until recently, however, that playwriting became part of her life. 
Five years ago Fannon picked up a script of "Top Girls," an early-'80s social 
satire by the British playwright Caryl Churchill, and had a revelation of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I was good enough to write plays," she explained. "Smart 
people wrote plays. Chris Durang wrote plays. Peter Shaffer wrote plays. When I 
read 'Top Girls,' something happened to me. I thought, 'Wow! It's outrageous!' 
So what the hell; I guess I decided to recapture that guardian angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon studied Russian, classical Greek and Yiddish and took a bachelor's 
degree at the University of Utah in 1974. She spent two years in a master's 
program in comparative literature before giving up on academia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't bring myself to write another paper on Milton," she said. "So many 
people had been there before me. What could I write? That Milton was really 
talking about striptease artists in 'Areopagitica?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The only academic research that interested her were bizarre topics, she said, 
such as flower symbology in D. H. Lawrence or Manipean satire in Ben Jonson's 
classical tragedy "Sejanus." And she couldn't find enough bizarre topics to 
keep her attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to bribe my husband to write some of my papers," Fannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't have to look far, though, for the subjects of her plays. Whether 
she sets them in Tuscany ("Green Icebergs") or Hollywood ("To Distraction") or 
Queens, N.Y. ("They Live Upstairs"), all of her plays seem to be informed by 
intense feelings about her Catholic religion and her Irish family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I'm a practicing ex-Catholic, I really like the idea of 
Christianity," Fannon said. "Catholic Christianity, not any other kind. I like 
its idea of a reward at the end of all this.  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it took the Catholics centuries to figure out the hierarchy of 
heaven. There's actually a guy who wrote a book called 'The History of Heaven,' 
which is fascinating to me. He's Catholic, of course. Who else would bother 
writing a book like that? You think some Lutheran is going to sit down and 
write the history of heaven?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for her family, Fannon said she has been trying to escape it all her life 
-- another instance of her betrayal and infidelity, she thinks, and a recurring 
theme that also runs like a deep vein through her family's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father's story is the story of infidelity," Fannon explained. "His mother 
ran off with this guy, Clary Witherspoon. His father went off in another 
direction. It was all very Park Avenue and Palm Beach. I guess they climbed to 
the top of the lace curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon finds it particularly ironic, however, that she now spends her time 
recapturing in her plays the very family she spent so much time running away 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like the servant in 'A Man for All Seasons' who keeps giving away the 
secrets," she said. "It's in his nature. He can't help it. Neither can I."

RICK DU BROW: THE SEASON COMES TO A CLOSE AND THE EYE HAS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC had two explosive hit series, "Home Improvement" and "Roseanne," in the 
1993-94 prime-time season, but CBS had Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in the 
hugely watched Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although Olympics invariably are audience winners on their own, the 
scandal-driven story and matchup of the two skaters were a factor in helping to 
blow apart what had been a relatively tight ratings battle between the two 
networks, easily assuring CBS of its third consecutive winning year in the 
so-called official season that ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Olympics, CBS got major attention with another significant 
showcase in 1993-94: David Letterman's whopping first season on the network as 
he comfortably won against NBC's "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno, who beat him out 
for the job as Johnny Carson's heir. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles-area TV viewers, nothing in the 1993-94 season, of course, 
will ever compare to the great Northridge earthquake of Jan. 17. And it is 
quite possible that the Winter Olympics in Norway, which took place soon 
afterward in February, were also a tremendous emotional release to the audience 
here in the nation's second largest TV market, as well as offering the 
intriguing rivalry between the two skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrigan-Harding affair was to this past television semester what the 
networks' three prime-time Amy Fisher movies were to the season before, a 
perfect real-life story for the era of tabloid journalism, particularly as it 
continues to ooze its way onto the home screen. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing was more obvious in the 30-week season that began on Sept. 20 than 
the fact that sensation-based, prime-time reality series -- dressed up as 
newsmagazines -- were taking over far too much of prime time, mainly because 
they are cheaper to produce than the dramas they have replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, there were 10 network newsmagazines, with more probably on the 
way. CBS' "60 Minutes," the inspiration for many of these lesser imitations and 
offshoots, continued its amazing hold on the audience, ranking second among all 
series for the season, trailing only "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the others, ABC's "20/20" is No. 14 thus far for 1993-94, as of the 
next-to-last weekly ratings for the season released on Tuesday. Diane Sawyer, 
who finally decided to remain at ABC after a multimillion-dollar network 
bidding war for her services, had the next two highest-rated newsmagazines: the 
new "Turning Point" (No. 16) and "PrimeTime Live" (No. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Anchors from the once-staid evening news broadcasts were getting roped more 
and more into the prime-time newsmagazine arena. CBS' new anchor team this 
season, Dan Rather and Connie Chung, were ill-matched and ignited few sparks in 
their nightly broadcasts, but each had newsmagazines. Rather's "48 Hours" was 
No. 45 and "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" No. 66 among 127 series for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at NBC, meanwhile, anchor Tom Brokaw was also inserted into a 
newsmagazine, paired with Katie Couric of the "Today" show. Their prime-time 
entry, "Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric," was No. 55. 
</P>
<P>
 How hot are the newsmagazines? Well, starting May 24 and for 13 weeks through 
the summer, "Dateline NBC," another entry in the field with Jane Pauley and 
Stone Phillips as anchors, will expand to two nights a week -- Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. The network has tried this briefly before with the series, which has 
attempted to re-establish its credibility after its shocking staging of a fiery 
truck crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the hard-edged reality shows and tabloid stories, it seemed almost an 
omen when Charles Kuralt, the gentle host of CBS' "On the Road" pieces and 
"Sunday Morning" series -- and a bastion of solid, understated journalism -- 
announced his retirement from the network at only 59 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Winter Olympics did well by CBS, they were also good for networks 
overall, serving as a reminder that, even in a cable age -- and with the hype 
of the burgeoning information superhighway -- nothing, at least yet, can 
compare to the traditional form of TV broadcasting in terms of sheer clout in 
harnessing an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Networks may yet be sold, merged or change their form, but their power as 
distribution outlets is undeniable -- and desirable for prospective partners. 
And the perception that at least some networks are still alive and kicking -- 
after years of funereal pronouncements about their fate -- is helped by such 
events as the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS research chief David Poltrack said this week that the audience share of 
the Big Three networks will actually increase this season -- from 60% in 
1992-93 to 61% for 1993-94. Other reports have estimated the increase as 
slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-night wars, meanwhile, held viewer attention throughout the season as 
audiences watched to see who would replace Carson as the new king. The field 
was jammed last fall, but Fox Broadcasting's entry, Chevy Chase, fell out 
quickly. The shocker was not that Letterman started fast in his new 11:35 p.m. 
slot -- the curious were expected to tune in at first -- but that his audience 
was steady and unexpectedly sizable, even though Leno pulled decent ratings of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wee hours after Letterman and Leno, NBC's new Conan O'Brien series was 
an awkward, fumbling yawn. But the same network's new late-late program with 
Greg Kinnear -- replacing Bob Costas -- showed promise with its quick-witted, 
quick-study host. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leno-Letterman rivalry will be stepped up during the May sweeps when each 
invades the other's home-base city for a week. Letterman airs from Hollywood 
starting May 9, and Leno will originate from New York beginning May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 From government to the private sector, TV violence continued to be an issue. 
Yet the irony was that the one series that gave new hope to network dramas -- 
ABC's police show "NYPD Blue" -- not only was outstanding and high-rated (No. 
24) -- but succeeded despite attacks that it was too violent and sexy. Producer 
Steven Bochco maintained it was important for network television to go further 
out on a limb to win back viewers who were defecting for the realism on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 While NBC was third among the Big Three for the season, it did succeed in 
establishing a highly entertaining, blockbuster tandem on Thursdays -- 
"Seinfeld," which remained a sensation, followed by "Frasier," a new sitcom 
starring Kelsey Grammer, formerly a "Cheers" regular. ABC, meanwhile, had its 
own new blockbuster tandem on Wednesdays -- "Home Improvement," followed by 
another highly entertaining new sitcom, "Grace Under Fire," starring Brett 
Butler. Both new series made the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Fox, the young company made a further bid to become a complete network 
by swiping National Football League games from CBS, starting this fall. But for 
1993-94, CBS, despite snipes that its audience is older, was the easy winner 
again, running up big profits and, with the help of Tonya and Nancy, wrapping 
up the season early. Top 10 of 1993-94*

NEA SEEKS MILLENNIUM MONEY; CONFERENCE: FUNDS ARE SCARCE, BUT CHAIR JANE 
ALEXANDER SEES 'A TURNING POINT' IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a delicate time for American arts, and for the National Endowment for 
the Arts in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is scarce, and years of controversy over sexual and religious imagery 
have bruised the sensibilities of politicians and artists alike. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, six months after taking office as NEA chairman, actress Jane Alexander 
convened the first federal conference on the arts at the Hyatt Regency hotel 
here this week "out of a sense of necessity," she told her audience of more 
than 1,000 as the meeting opened. "We are at a turning point in the history of 
public funding for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is certainly not upward; the NEA has lost nearly half of its 
purchasing power since the late 1970s, including a $4-million reduction this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, then again, President Clinton is not seeking further cuts in the NEA's 
$170-million budget. "Hopefully," he said in a videotaped message to the 
assemblage on Thursday, "we can do more in the years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander has set a deadline for amassing more resources, and the conference 
title, "Art-21," provides a clue to her thinking. "We have a big event coming 
up . . . the millennium," she said in an interview before the meeting started. 
"How do we celebrate who we are at the end of a big century and 1,000 years? If 
there was ever any century that belonged to America, it was the 20th. I'm 
hoping that artists and arts organizations will be applying for big, big 
projects, and I'd like to have the money to fund them." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, she treads carefully now. She has been seeking to reassure 
conservatives who once tried to eliminate the agency that the NEA is a force 
for social good, by anyone's definition. At the same time, she says she backs 
artists' right to free expression, although she clearly does not relish the 
thought of enduring the type of turbulence that surrounded earlier federal 
grants to exhibitions of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs and 
Andres Serrano's "Piss Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander doesn't promise never to veto a grant awarded by an NEA panel, but, 
she said, "I don't know what would make me do that. I depend heavily on the 
juries." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, she is changing the subject. "I'd rather focus on the plethora of 
grants that everybody can agree on," she said. She has been on the road 
incessantly, with stops from Burlington, Vt., to Waterloo, Iowa, visiting local 
arts programs. The day before "Art-21," she watched young students on Chicago's 
South Side learn traditional African dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, she said, is interested "in all of the arts being involved in 
everyone's life on a daily basis." She talks of a new emphasis on getting 
children involved -- and trained -- at an early age, as young as toddlerhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid has to sit down with the instrument and learn to play, preferably a 
keyboard or percussion," she said. Instruction doesn't have to be costly, she 
said, citing the People's Music School here. The director "couldn't afford 
drums," Alexander said, "so she used telephone books." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's funding of such programs can also fit in with the agendas of 
other Cabinet departments, such as Justice and Housing and Urban Development, 
she added. "If children don't have art in the home and just come home to TV, 
which is a passive art form -- sometimes it's not even art -- what happens to 
that creative impulse? 'Let's trash our neighborhood.' If you are engaged in 
art, you become an appreciator," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she is also urging creativity on the part of arts administrators. 
"We seed," she said. "We seed to leverage the private sector." Innovative 
partnerships, she said, can also bear financial fruit. The Detroit Institute of 
Art, for example, received money from the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services for outreach work with the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Museums can work with one another too. The San Jose Museum of Contemporary 
Art, for example, is entering into a long-term agreement to present exhibitions 
from the permanent collection of New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. The 
shows will be presented during the next seven years, in chronological order, 
for 18 months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a very exciting time," said Whitney grants officer James 
Bonkovsky, who was attending the conference. He praised Alexander, with her 
aristocratic bearing and the fame won after decades on the stage, in movies and 
in television, as "an incredibly strong presence, a real leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, he was heartened by the effort she made to solicit opinions at 
the conference. She attended working sessions, taking a chair near the back 
during a panel on "Facing Society's Censure" -- although she left before Brian 
Freeman, artistic director of San Francisco's Pomo Afro Homos, described strong 
reactions faced when the renowned black gay male performance artists came to 
towns as different as Anchorage and Atlanta. She was long gone when Freeman 
showed a video clip of a performer who clutched an upright microphone in his 
lap while describing a back-room, safe-sex encounter -- at once one of the 
group's most provocative segments and a piece lauded by AIDS educators. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be plenty of opportunity for her to review the reaction later. 
Volunteers passed out cards for the participants to write down comments and 
questions, and an electronic bulletin board for on-line discussions was 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 A blank canvas was hanging too, with plenty of pens nearby, outside a banquet 
room. It didn't stay blank for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists Mastering Poverty," someone had scrawled anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you NEA and don't forget," wrote another on the canvas, which Alexander 
intends to take back to Washington. "All art is subversive but we need not fear 
the artists." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is hope," yet another entry read.

COUNT HIM IN; PIANIST GEORGE SHEARING, WHO JOINS 3 OTHER JAZZMEN IN CERRITOS 
TONIGHT, IS AS COMFORTABLE IN A DUO AS IN A 29-PIECE ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Shearing isn't straying too far from his roots these days. On his 
current tour -- which brings him to the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts 
tonight -- the distinguished pianist is providing singer Joe Williams with 
thumping, charged accompaniment on rousing blues numbers such as "I'd Rather 
Drink Muddy Water" and "All Right, Okay, You Win." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I started professionally, playing boogie-woogie," Shearing 
said over the phone recently from a tour stop in San Luis Obispo, recalling his 
premiere $5-a-week-plus-tips engagement at the Mason Arms pub in London, where 
he was born in 1919. "I still love to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearing and Williams go back a long way -- to 1949: Shearing's quintet was 
working the Regal Theatre in Chicago, where Williams was singing with Jay 
Burkhart's band. Shearing and Williams first recorded together in 1971 and have 
been touring with each other on and off for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cerritos, Shearing will open the show with bassist Neil Swainson. After 
intermission, they'll be joined by Williams and drummer Sherman Ferguson. The 
set list includes "The End of a Beautiful Friendship," "Have You Met Miss 
Jones?" and "Here's to Life," the title track of Williams' new Telarc album, 
recorded with Robert Farnon's orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Shearing's recent albums -- "I Hear a Rhapsody" on Telarc, recorded at 
the Blue Note in Manhattan -- features two tunes from the be-bop era, Charlie 
Parker's "Birdfeathers" and Bud Powell's "Wail." That's another style Shearing 
says he doesn't "ever want to get away from." He said he'll probably play at 
least one of those numbers at Cerritos, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, one of his strongest suits is melody -- which gets the full treatment 
on his latest album, "How Beautiful Is Night" (also on Telarc). There, it's 
Shearing who luxuriates in the warmth of Farnon's 29-piece orchestra, serenely 
investigating such selections as "More Than You Know" and "Heather on the 
Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and I go back to World War II," Shearing noted, "so we share a lot of the 
same musical ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shearing has spent the last 16 years working mainly in duos with 
bassists Don Thompson, Brian Torff and now Swainson, his name still prompts 
memories of his quintet and its dulcet, pastel-colored sound, produced by a 
front-line mix of piano, vibes and guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearing said he has discovered that duos are not only easier to manage in 
terms of traveling and payroll, but also that they can be more rewarding 
musically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the feeling of being able to hear so much of the bass," said the 
pianist, who is blind. "And there's nothing like the feeling the two of us can 
set up rhythmically. And there's less structure, so we can play something we 
haven't bothered to rehearse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, he has responded to repeated requests from fans by recording a 
new quintet album, due from Telarc in November. Working with Steve Nelson 
(vibes), Louis Stewart (guitar), Dennis Mackrel (drums) and Swainson, he cut 
such classics as "Lullabye of Birdland" and "East of the Sun" and some new 
numbers, including two by Horace Silver, "Peace" and "Strollin'." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like a little kid with a toy," he said of the sessions, which were done 
in New York. "I enjoyed bringing back the sound. The respite has done me good." 
</P>
<P>

the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court Drive, Cerritos. Curtain: 8. $28-$37.

OLD STANDBYS, NEW CONCERT SALES RECORD?; POP MUSIC: WITH STREISAND, THE EAGLES 
AND PINK FLOYD ON TOUR, SOME ARE ESTIMATING A $1.1-BILLION YEAR. BUT OTHERS 
WORRY THE BIG ACTS WILL HURT SALES OF OTHER SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pop music world is jumping into the time machine this summer and turning 
back the clock, and all expectations are that previous concert box-office 
records will fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long-unseen figures Barbra Streisand and the Eagles are back on the road after 
extended hiatuses. And such lumbering giants as Pink Floyd and the Rolling 
Stones bringing their Gargantuan spectacles back to stadiums. The result is 
that concert promoters -- having suffered through a three-year recessionary 
slump -- are positively giddy about the year's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Their vision: $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the record take for U.S. pop concerts, set in 1990, just before the 
economy took a downturn.  
</P>
<P>
 With those shows and with such other monsters as an Elton John-Billy Joel 
stadium pairing, and reliable perennials like the Grateful Dead and Jimmy 
Buffett also on tour, it's a virtual cinch that, barring an apocalyptic 
cataclysm, the old record will be far surpassed this year.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no cap on (how high it could go)," says Hal Lazareff, director of 
West Coast booking for the Pace/Sony/Blockbuster alliance, which operates the 
Glen Helen Pavilion and other amphitheaters. "Whatever the demand is, that's 
how high the new record will be." 
</P>
<P>
 For the high-profile, veteran acts that are dominating the season, the demand 
has been tremendous. Even with prices much higher than standard concert 
tickets, the Streisand shows (top ticket: $350) and Eagles reunion concerts (up 
to $115) sold out almost instantaneously everywhere they have gone on sale so 
far.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium events too have so far been dramatic sales successes, including 
Pink Floyd's two Rose Bowl shows starting tonight and the more than 20 
John-Joel dates that have been announced, including four shows at the 
Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey (L.A. dates are still in the planning 
stages). Some observers speculate that the Pink Floyd tour could even approach 
the single-tour record of $98 million set by the Rolling Stones' 1988 "Steel 
Wheels" trek.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert business trade magazine Pollstar, says 
that while veteran acts generally dominate the top concert grossers each year, 
the number of superstar attractions coming out this summer is unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had Steely Dan and Bette Midler, two acts that people had pretty 
much given up on getting to see," he says. "But we didn't have the stadium acts 
like this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bongiovanni also notes that the steady growth of country music's audience in 
the last several years and the arrival of such young attractions as Pearl Jam, 
Stone Temple Pilots and the Spin Doctors -- all of whom are touring this summer 
-- has also strengthened the concert market. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most of our business relies on old acts," he says, noting that even the 
H.O.R.D.E. tour, founded by the band Blues Traveler with the intent of exposing 
young acts, is this year being headlined by the veteran Allman Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: "The demographics of the Eagles and Pink Floyd and those 
acts are people with money and credit cards," says Lazareff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While those people were a little tight with their funds in recent years, the 
consensus in the concert industry is that the economy has leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is not 100% recovered, but I think we're seeing an 
optimistic attitude," says Alex Hodges, vice president and head of booking for 
the Nederlander Organization, which operates the Greek Theatre and books 
concerts at the Pond in Anaheim, where Streisand will be performing. "And 
people are starting to get over the earthquake and the other tragedies we had 
and want to have some fun. People need this kind of outlet."  
</P>
<P>
 Connie Hillman, Elton John's U.S. manager and the producer of the John-Joel 
tour, agrees. "These big shows are artists with catalogues of music to play and 
you know you're going to get, as Elton said, value for money," she says. "And 
there's a confidence level trickling to the point of people saying they'll go 
spend $150 for two tickets to the Elton and Billy show and they'll get 
something great in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all are so confident, though. Some fear that the big acts will chew up so 
much of the concert business that people will be unwilling or unable to buy 
tickets for other shows.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the summer's going to be a disaster," says one major booking agent, 
who asked that his name not be used. "If people buy Eagles tickets for $75 and 
go to one or two of the other big shows, that's a lot of money spent. At some 
point there's no money left in the marketplace for other acts. Something like 
Stevie Nicks or the package tour of the Doobie Brothers and Foreigner, who's 
going to want to see that if they've already spent a lot of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 The first victim may have been Lenny Kravitz, who recently canceled a summer 
tour due to poor initial ticket sales, according to industry sources. And some 
say that even the Rolling Stones' planned fall tour could suffer some if fans 
are strapped for cash and burned out from the glut of big events. 
</P>
<P>
 But promoters on the whole prefer to see the situation not as a glut but as a 
market-priming wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 "These big events get people into going to see live shows," says Arny Granat, 
co-owner of the Chicago-based Jam Productions concert promotions firm. "One 
feeds off of another." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dave Frey, manager of Blues Traveler and the organizer of the H.O.R.D.E. 
tour, "Good shows breed more good shows, and if people see a good one they're 
more likely to go see another. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic, but it all 
helps."

 No pandering arrest -- In articles published March 16 and 20 that mentioned 
the Redwood Inn Motel, The Times erroneously reported that a Los Angeles police 
officer testified at a public hearing that a motel manager was arrested on 
pandering charges.In fact, the officer did not specify the charge. The officer 
has since told The Times that a person affiliated with the hotel, but not the 
manager, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge. He declined to name the person. 
An attorney for the motel said the manager never has been arrested on any 
charge, and that no other motel employee has been arrested on charges related 
to prostitution.

 Misleading Headline-A headline in the West County Edition on Thursday, on a 
story concerning a deputy public defender's accusation of prosecutorial 
misconduct, might have been misleading.Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride 
himself did not face the possibility of arrest or incarceration in connection 
with the complaint. A hearing before Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell 
Jr. was held only to determine whether there were grounds for granting a new 
trial in a case prosecuted by Kilbride.

RICK DU BROW: THE SEASON COMES TO A CLOSE AND THE EYE HAS IT 
</P>

 ABC had two explosive hit series, "Home Improvement" and "Roseanne," in the 
1993-94 prime-time season, but CBS had Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in the 
hugely watched Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although Olympics invariably are audience winners on their own, the 
scandal-driven story and matchup of the two skaters were a factor in helping to 
blow apart what had been a relatively tight ratings battle between the two 
networks, easily assuring CBS of its third consecutive winning year in the 
so-called official season that ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Olympics, CBS got major attention with another significant 
showcase in 1993-94: David Letterman's whopping first season on the network as 
he comfortably won against NBC's "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno, who beat him out 
for the job as Johnny Carson's heir. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles-area TV viewers, nothing in the 1993-94 season, of course, 
will ever compare to the great Northridge earthquake of Jan. 17. And it is 
quite possible that the Winter Olympics in Norway, which took place soon 
afterward in February, were also a tremendous emotional release to the audience 
here in the nation's second largest TV market, as well as offering the 
intriguing rivalry between the two skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrigan-Harding affair was to this past television semester what the 
networks' three prime-time Amy Fisher movies were to the season before, a 
perfect real-life story for the era of tabloid journalism, particularly as it 
continues to ooze its way onto the home screen. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing was more obvious in the 30-week season that began on Sept. 20 than 
the fact that sensation-based, prime-time reality series -- dressed up as 
newsmagazines -- were taking over far too much of prime time, mainly because 
they are cheaper to produce than the dramas they have replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, there were 10 network newsmagazines, with more probably on the 
way. CBS' "60 Minutes," the inspiration for many of these lesser imitations and 
offshoots, continued its amazing hold on the audience, ranking second among all 
series for the season, trailing only "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the others, ABC's "20/20" is No. 14 thus far for 1993-94, as of the 
next-to-last weekly ratings for the season released on Tuesday. Diane Sawyer, 
who finally decided to remain at ABC after a multimillion-dollar network 
bidding war for her services, had the next two highest-rated newsmagazines: the 
new "Turning Point" (No. 16) and "PrimeTime Live" (No. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Anchors from the once-staid evening news broadcasts were getting roped more 
and more into the prime-time newsmagazine arena. CBS' new anchor team this 
season, Dan Rather and Connie Chung, were ill-matched and ignited few sparks in 
their nightly broadcasts, but each had newsmagazines. Rather's "48 Hours" was 
No. 45 and "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" No. 66 among 127 series for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at NBC, meanwhile, anchor Tom Brokaw was also inserted into a 
newsmagazine, paired with Katie Couric of the "Today" show. Their prime-time 
entry, "Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric," was No. 55. 
</P>
<P>
 How hot are the newsmagazines? Well, starting May 24 and for 13 weeks through 
the summer, "Dateline NBC," another entry in the field with Jane Pauley and 
Stone Phillips as anchors, will expand to two nights a week -- Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. The network has tried this briefly before with the series, which has 
attempted to re-establish its credibility after its shocking staging of a fiery 
truck crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the hard-edged reality shows and tabloid stories, it seemed almost an 
omen when Charles Kuralt, the gentle host of CBS' "On the Road" pieces and 
"Sunday Morning" series -- and a bastion of solid, understated journalism -- 
announced his retirement from the network at only 59 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Winter Olympics did well by CBS, they were also good for networks 
overall, serving as a reminder that, even in a cable age -- and with the hype 
of the burgeoning information superhighway -- nothing, at least yet, can 
compare to the traditional form of TV broadcasting in terms of sheer clout in 
harnessing an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Networks may yet be sold, merged or change their form, but their power as 
distribution outlets is undeniable -- and desirable for prospective partners. 
And the perception that at least some networks are still alive and kicking -- 
after years of funereal pronouncements about their fate -- is helped by such 
events as the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS research chief David Poltrack said this week that the audience share of 
the Big Three networks will actually increase this season -- from 60% in 
1992-93 to 61% for 1993-94. Other reports have estimated the increase as 
slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-night wars, meanwhile, held viewer attention throughout the season as 
audiences watched to see who would replace Carson as the new king. The field 
was jammed last fall, but Fox Broadcasting's entry, Chevy Chase, fell out 
quickly. The shocker was not that Letterman started fast in his new 11:35 p.m. 
slot -- the curious were expected to tune in at first -- but that his audience 
was steady and unexpectedly sizable, even though Leno pulled decent ratings of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wee hours after Letterman and Leno, NBC's new Conan O'Brien series was 
an awkward, fumbling yawn. But the same network's new late-late program with 
Greg Kinnear -- replacing Bob Costas -- showed promise with its quick-witted, 
quick-study host. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leno-Letterman rivalry will be stepped up during the May sweeps when each 
invades the other's home-base city for a week. Letterman airs from Hollywood 
starting May 9, and Leno will originate from New York beginning May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 From government to the private sector, TV violence continued to be an issue. 
Yet the irony was that the one series that gave new hope to network dramas -- 
ABC's police show "NYPD Blue" -- not only was outstanding and high-rated (No. 
24) -- but succeeded despite attacks that it was too violent and sexy. Producer 
Steven Bochco maintained it was important for network television to go further 
out on a limb to win back viewers who were defecting for the realism on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 While NBC was third among the Big Three for the season, it did succeed in 
establishing a highly entertaining, blockbuster tandem on Thursdays -- 
"Seinfeld," which remained a sensation, followed by "Frasier," a new sitcom 
starring Kelsey Grammer, formerly a "Cheers" regular. ABC, meanwhile, had its 
own new blockbuster tandem on Wednesdays -- "Home Improvement," followed by 
another highly entertaining new sitcom, "Grace Under Fire," starring Brett 
Butler. Both new series made the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Fox, the young company made a further bid to become a complete network 
by swiping National Football League games from CBS, starting this fall. But for 
1993-94, CBS, despite snipes that its audience is older, was the easy winner 
again, running up big profits and, with the help of Tonya and Nancy, wrapping 
up the season early. Top 10 of 1993-94*
