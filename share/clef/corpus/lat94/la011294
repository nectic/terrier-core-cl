ROBIN ABCARIAN: EVERYONE WANTS AN AGENT -- WHY NOT A DOG WITH AN ARTIFICIAL 
LEG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here in L.A., where everyone is looking for an agent, why not a three-legged 
dog in search of Lassie-like fame? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that a dog with three legs is such a rarity -- plenty of quadrupeds 
live quite happily as tripods following the loss of a limb to trauma or 
disease. But few, I am certain, are as striking as Kuma, a 2-year-old white 
Akita who takes his constitutional each morning along the Venice boardwalk with 
John Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unique about Kuma is the prosthetic rear leg strapped to his hips, 
clattering against the pavement, captivating passersby as he ambles along. And, 
of course, his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not his plans exactly, but the plans of Weaver, 41, a long, lean 
industrial artist whose sensibilities are a quirky combination of New Age 
spirituality and frontier inventiveness. Weaver claims, in believe-me-or-not 
tones, to be a healer and to be able to hear birds talk. And when he was told 
that prosthetic legs for dogs are not readily available, he wasn't fazed. He 
simply created one. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more to Kuma than good looks and a peg leg. Weaver has big dreams for 
this dog. He is trying to start a charitable organization -- the Kuma 
Foundation -- that will do good works for disabled children. He is looking for 
corporate sponsorship, developing a prefabricated prosthetic for dogs and is 
casting about, naturally, for an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver's sense of Kuma's place in the universe is obvious. He concludes our 
meeting with this request: "When you write about Kuma, could you please refer 
to him as the Great White American Akita?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver was living in Frazier Park when he acquired the little snowball of a 
puppy. At 8 months, Kuma escaped from the back yard and wandered to a nearby 
elementary school for a visit. The dog was hit by a slow-moving cement truck. 
He disappeared, and Weaver feared Kuma would freeze -- or bleed -- to death. 
But the next day, Kuma, his right rear paw torn off, limped home. Weaver 
bundled him up and drove to West Los Angeles, where veterinary surgeon Alan 
Schulman operated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said the standard thing to do is to amputate high up," Schulman said. "If 
not, you may regret it because the dog will try to walk on the stump. But 
(Weaver) was adamant. He said he was going to get a prosthesis for the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 First, Kuma had to get well. But the dog seemed to have lost his spirit. Kuma 
refused food, and Weaver fretted. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, as Weaver was making himself a grilled cheese sandwich, Kuma perked 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is gross," Weaver said, "but he was saved by Velveeta cheese. He 
smelled the Velveeta and decided, 'This is life.' So I began putting it all 
over the house to get him to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Weaver began designing a prosthesis for Kuma. He experimented by cutting 
up an empty antifreeze bottle and turning it upside down as a sling. Kuma 
didn't know what had been strapped to his hips at first. So Weaver tied a 
string to Kuma's leg, and lifted it each time the dog took a step, helping him 
relearn the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Weaver contacted Performance Prosthetics in Santa Monica, where he 
and the staff came up with a high-tech "sports leg" for Kuma, incorporating a 
shock absorbing coil in the peg. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's owner, Albert Rappoport, agreed to a trade for the device -- 
Weaver painted some signs in exchange for the leg. It could have cost as much 
as $5,000, Rappoport said, because of the great amount of time involved in 
fitting and aligning. (Legs for people cost between $5,000 and $15,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog is easier to work on than most people," Rappoport said. "He never 
complained. The only thing is, he has no insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Kuma and Weaver visited children at Shriner's Hospital for 
Crippled Children. Recreational therapist Sandy Hill said the children loved 
the dog: "It definitely helps the kids to see that not only do the other kids 
here have problems, but animals do, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver hopes to take Kuma on hospital visits every month and to become 
involved in the Special Olympics. To subsidize his plans, which have taken a 
toll on his work schedule, Weaver hopes to print and sell a coloring book 
featuring the adventures of Kuma, his accident and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently in Japan, Akita breeder Jackie Costello said, a movie was made about 
a famous Akita named Hachiko, immortalized decades ago for his enduring 
loyalty. Every evening, goes the story, Hachiko met his owner, a professor, at 
the train station. One day, the professor died at school. But Hachiko continued 
to meet the train until he died nine years later. To this day, said Costello, 
you can see statues of Hachiko in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Hachiko-like adulation in the cards for Kuma? Could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Today a peg leg, tomorrow a three-picture deal.

FIXATIONS: CASTLE OF CREATIVITY; MARY FOSTER AND HER SON ALAN MAKE MAGIC THAT 
GOES BEYOND INTERIOR DESIGN IN THEIR SANTA ANA HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SANTA ANA -- In the years of doing this column, I've learned to respect the 
power of people's front doors. Even the flimsiest pine and Masonite ones seem 
able to safeguard from the suburban drabness outside the fragile, separate 
realities created by those living inside.  
</P>
<P>
 Some are overtly weird, the homes of people who have based their lives on 
Dungeons and Dragons, collecting ventriloquist dummies or deifying Vic Morrow. 
Others might be a gentler shift from the norm, yet those can be the most 
startling, creating a subtle sense that you've stepped into another world. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the feeling I had entering Mary and Alan Foster's Santa Ana home. The 
57-year-old and her 22-year-old son have created a wonderland of design in 
their cozy rented circa-1920s house. Like only a handful of places I've been, 
their house felt faintly magical, as if a special hand had passed over every 
aspect of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, from a quantity of uniquely decorated Christmas trees to napkin 
rings made with ears of purplish Indian corn, has been given a distinctive 
twist or flourish, and each seems as if it has been set in its perfect place 
amid the antique "early grandmother to early garage sale" furnishings. One felt 
no less certain that a few months hence, the entire place will have changed, 
and will be no less perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't surprise, then, that its co-creator Mary Foster has a high regard 
for the places people keep apart from the life outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your world; it's your sovereignty. This is where you live . This is 
the real person. Everything else is just window dressing," Foster says. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a small, cheerful woman. Alan is smaller, and even more cheerful. Since 
her marriage dissolved 12 years ago, Foster has singly cared for Alan, whose 
Down's syndrome and juvenile diabetes require 24-hour care. They will tell you 
that they are quite a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than have Alan institutionalized or in a program, Foster is his 
constant companion. She receives a small income from a state in-home supportive 
services program and gets by doing a bit of work as a notary public. Sometimes 
she helps prepare for weddings, and, when pressed, makes a Victorian wedding 
cake decorated with hundreds of tiny pastry roses. The two are also aided by 
some very loyal friends and family, such as Foster's older son, David, who gave 
them a washer and dryer last year, and a friend who fixed their plumbing for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Alan spend much of their day working on the design projects in which 
their house abounds. Christmas trees are reinvented with dried flowers, costume 
jewelry, holly and decorated toy-sized Victorian hats. There is a wall hanging 
made from a sled they saved from a local demolished house; it's adorned with 
twisted sticks, pine cones, toy birds and an old Pinocchio marionette. A sad 
Emmett Kelly dummy sits in a wagon astride a bale of hay, with an autumnal flow 
of curly willow and Hawaiian protea bursting behind him.  
</P>
<P>
 Although it is now well past Christmas, tables hold festive centerpieces and 
place settings, while the fireplace plays host to a scene Alan created with 
evergreen branches, elves busily working on toys and an approving Santa looking 
on.  
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Claus loves the elves," Alan explained with a bemused, musical voice. 
"The elves do like making dolls and assembling scenery, so Santa can relax." He 
has a few other solo works in the house, but his pride and joy is the train 
room, which is nearly filled with a platform holding an electric trolley car 
course and its surrounding winter scene created by the pair. Covered with 
flecks and drifts of plastic snow, it is a holiday vision, with even the six 
handmade dollhouses teeming with interior detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fosters don't sit idle when Christmas is past: If there aren't holidays to 
celebrate, Mary and Alan recognize the seasons with household designs. They 
also make items to sell at a gift show, open to friends, that they hold in 
their home each November. They usually make $100 to $300 that way.  
</P>
<P>
 They already have drawers stuffed with the raw materials, such as a bag of 
autumn leaves brought from Wisconsin by a friend. Foster lets the two evergreen 
shrubs in her yard grow wild, so she'll have branches when they need them for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Mother Nature, so everything that I can bring in comes into the house. 
Flowers, leaves, bare branches, sticks, you name it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also undertake projects such as re-tiling, wallpapering and painting 
the house, the latter in a blue-gray hue Alan chose.  
</P>
<P>
 On his own, Alan's favorite things are poring through Architectural Digest and 
watching "Star Trek: The Next Generation." He likes all the characters best, he 
says, including the vile Borg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't participate in structured education and structured this and that. It 
wasn't for us," Foster said. "It was much better for us to go it alone and do 
more and see more and be more. We work until we feel like we don't want to any 
more, and then we quit. Then if we can't sleep and want to do some more, one of 
us gets the other one and we get up and do something." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she had Alan 22 years ago, Foster says doctors advised her to have him 
institutionalized immediately and not to form a bond to him because he would 
likely die within a year. They wouldn't bring him to her room, so she got up to 
look at him through the nursery window. She was appalled to see what she 
regarded as unnecessary tests being conducted on him, and raised a fuss, 
insisting on taking him home. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she didn't have an instant's qualm about flying in the face of expert 
advice. Having worked as a nurse, she had some knowledge of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But how did I know ? I can't give you an answer to that. But when a mother 
looks at a new baby and she loves that baby more than anything in the world, 
and that baby says, 'Oh, gosh, there's that pair of arms I've been waiting 
for,' you know . They said, 'Don't become too attached.' Well, too late .  
</P>
<P>
 "In life one has to make choices, and why would I choose to desert an entity 
that I gave birth to? It could have six heads, but it would still deserve 
dignity, food, parents, a home. When I saw him in the nursery being used as a 
guinea pig, that instantaneously made me decide that for the rest of my life, 
and his, that he would have the quality care and quality home and quality life 
that every child is entitled to no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took Alan home, and from then on it was our partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has discovered to have diabetes at 10 months, when he went into a coma for 
three days. Since then, his health has demanded constant vigilance, requiring 
several blood tests and shots a day. He has had other problems as well, such as 
hypothyroidism and an incident of his immune system shutting down two years 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many with Down's syndrome, Alan could teach the rest of us a few things 
about being personable and sweet-natured. As a result, he's made a lot of 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've met wonderful, wonderful people," Foster said. "Alan picks his own 
friends, and I never know what shape or size or age they'll be. His latest 
acquisition is a 65-year-old man we met at Pop's Cafe, and the two of them have 
become great buddies. Here we are eating ham and eggs and this very nice man 
puts his arm around him and says, 'Hi, buddy, what's your name?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As is always the case with people who are different, not all the reactions are 
so pleasant. When they were dining out once last year, a waiter pointed to Alan 
and asked Foster, "What does it want to drink?" He and the management quickly 
learned that she isn't always as good-natured as her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be shy," she says. "You have to be fair and you have to be honest, 
and you have to be as compassionate for the ignorance of that other person as 
you can be, but you must draw the line at the aggressive pursuit of that 
behavior from that person. So we do that when it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster says she and Alan take such occurrences and his health difficulties in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not been easy, but I've got to tell you, nothing that's fun is. If you 
see humor in everything, you might make it," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Where others might see a burden, she sees a rare freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have what you see in this house, and we're happy with that. And we have 
the inner peace of knowing that if we don't choose to do something, we don't 
have to. We can take a walk if we want, and don't have to answer to anybody as 
to what time we get back. Or, if we decide to get up at 2 in the morning and go 
down and watch the moon over the ocean, that's fine.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's freedom, it's sovereignty, and that comes from doing things our own way. 
Consequently, Alan is healthier, happier, well-adjusted and would surprise you 
with what he can do." 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Alan understands more from the pictures in his architectural 
magazines and books than he does from the text. Foster hopes to help develop 
his reading and math skills this year, since he recently has shown a greater 
interest. She says he's learned a great deal from the crafts projects they 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole idea in learning is you should enjoy how you learn. You do 
learn doing these things, believe it or not, all about wood, and finishing, 
depth and perception, color, shape and design, all kinds of things. This is the 
learning Alan gets in so his own ideas can come out. Like all the things in his 
bedroom, I said, 'Here, you do it,' and he did.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these kids would not be allowed to plug in an electric plug, not 
allowed to have all these things to work with. He can and does, and then he 
gets to see how people enjoy it."

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; FOLLOWING THE PIED PIPER OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL 
CHANGE; NEVER STOP RUNNING: ALLARD LOWENSTEIN AND THE STRUGGLE TO SAVE AMERICAN 
LIBERALISM BY WILLIAM H. CHAFE ; BASIC BOOKS / HARPERCOLLINS, $28, 592 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allard Lowenstein was something of a cult figure in the '60s and '70s -- he 
served only a single term in Congress and died at 51 -- yet biographer William 
H. Chafe is moved to call him "one of the pivotal figures who shaped American 
political culture during the post-World War II era." 
</P>
<P>
 How and why Lowenstein became a Pied Piper of progressive politics is the 
theme of Chafe's absorbing new biography, "Never Stop Running." Although 
Lowenstein is best remembered as the architect of the "Dump Johnson" movement 
that prompted Lyndon Johnson to withdraw from the 1968 presidential campaign, 
Chafe's book allows us to see Lowenstein as a person whose lifelong identity 
crisis is emblematic of an era and a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the heart of Lowenstein's liberalism was a tension," writes Chafe, a 
history professor at Duke University. "He lived on the edge of conventional 
liberalism, torn between complacent New Deal-type homilies and a radical 
challenge to all comfortable and entrenched institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 As we discover in "Never Stop Running," the tension in Lowenstein's political 
identity can best be understood as the expression of much deeper disturbances, 
all of which Chafe explores with both candor and insight.  
</P>
<P>
 Lowenstein was troubled by his Jewishness, his sexuality, his family 
relationships, and -- above all -- his "sense of marginality," an agonizing 
self-doubt that expressed itself in everything from an obsession with the 
length of his nose to a curious ambivalence about electioneering on his own 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can imagine the turbulence and anxiety of a young man like Allard 
Lowenstein as he sought to struggle with these issues," Chafe writes. "Was he 
Jewish or not Jewish? A 'normal' man, with 'normal' sexual instincts, or 
'peculiar'. . . ? How could he live, carve out a community, define a lifestyle, 
become a person at home with himself, publicly and privately, in the face of 
such tensions?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never Stop Running" is not quite a work of psychohistory, but Chafe is 
interested in the emotional crucible in which Lowenstein's political credo was 
cooked up, and he is not shy about suggesting direct linkages between, for 
example, Lowenstein's troubled relationship with his father and his later 
willingness to challenge an incumbent Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 Chafe discloses that Lowenstein was a teen-ager before he discovered that his 
mother had died when he was still an infant -- the very fact of his mother's 
existence was withheld from him by his father, who never revealed that his wife 
was Lowenstein's stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most significant aspect of Lowenstein's discovery," Chafe offers, "was 
his realization that the central figure of power and authority in his life was 
both the author of the conspiracy of silence and the one person he could never 
talk to about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chafe describes Lowenstein's early and enduring activism in the anti-war and 
civil rights movements in sharp and penetrating detail, and he is perfectly 
willing to consider the darker side of Lowenstein's record. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Chafe observes that Lowenstein brought a "demonic intensity" to 
his work in the National Student Assn. -- and he chose to overlook or actively 
conceal the fact that the NSA was financed by the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The enigmatic relationship between Lowenstein and the CIA, writes Chafe, 
"could easily become a surgical probe into all the implications of working as a 
liberal activist inside, rather than outside, the prevailing structure of power 
and values." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Chafe is always quick to speculate on the private meanings of a public 
stance, and he argues that Lowenstein used politics as a drug to ease his 
emotional pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He craved intimacy with men but ran away from confronting all the inner 
conflicts and secret desires that lasting intimacy of that kind might involve," 
Chafe writes. "Instead, he became someone devoted to causes and to movements . 
. . as though sheer activity provided the best means of escaping his problems 
and enhancing his self-image." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his life, Lowenstein played the role of confessor, as Chafe puts 
it, and he attracted a great number of groupies, proteges and disciples, 
including such future presidential aspirants as Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Bill 
Bradley. And his habit of collecting people helps to explain why he was so 
beloved in his own lifetime and so well remembered after his death within 
certain political circles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also explains how Lowenstein, long in decline and haunted by visions of 
his death, fell victim to one of his followers, a troubled young man who shot 
Lowenstein to death in 1980. Lowenstein's reckless magic -- his taste for 
"relationships so crammed with volatile emotion that each contained the 
potential to explode" -- finally killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chafe likens Lowenstein's life and death to a Greek tragedy. But the fact is 
that "Never Stop Running" is a distinctly American tragedy, and Chafe has 
achieved a degree of grandeur and drama in a work of biography that one might 
expect to encounter only in the Great American Novel.

ART REVIEW; EPIPHANIES OUT OF THE CORNER OF HELEN LEVITT'S EYE; FOR THE PAST 50 
YEARS, THE NEW YORK PHOTOGRAPHER HAS RARELY BEEN IN THE DIRECT LINE OF THE ART 
WORLD'S VISION. A TOURING RETROSPECTIVE AT THE L.A. COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART IS 
CHANGING THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "New York" (circa 1945), one of 84 photographs of life in the modern city 
that make up the enchanting Helen Levitt retrospective newly opened at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, four men are arrayed across a shallow picture 
plane like mythological figures on a classical Roman frieze. 
</P>
<P>
 Three stand at a railing, one sits on a stoop. Three look off to the side at 
something (or some things) unseen beyond the camera's range of vision; one 
peruses a newspaper, his back to the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-contained and isolated from one another, despite a close proximity 
enhanced by the visual compression of lighting and composition, all four men 
are engaged in a solitary but intimate practice: observing and being observed. 
It seems a distinctly urban trait, this paradoxically connected quality of 
individual isolation. The urbanism of the activity makes apposite the otherwise 
generic title of the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 The three male faces that we can see on this urban frieze conjure "the ages of 
man" -- youth, middle age, old age -- a continuity given a quiet spin by the 
single mystery-man who is turned away from us. The specificity of New York life 
in the 1940s is transformed, becoming most any city, most anywhere, most any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the foreground prominence of these men, it takes a moment to notice a 
fifth person in the picture. From an open window at the rear, a little girl, 
her curly-haired head resting on her hand, looks bemusedly out on the scene at 
which we are gazing from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a female version of a heavenly putto in a Baroque painting, this cherubic 
child dreamily observes these half-mythic, half-mortal men below her. She 
assumes an ambiguous place in the scheme of things, somewhere between the 
innocent blank-slate of childhood and an all-knowing realm of divinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly, the photographic jolt of the picture is carried by this unobtrusive 
little figure hovering in the background. For we soon realize that the artist 
has orchestrated her casual, street-side scene to let us know that, finally, 
this child mirrors us. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Levitt is not a popularly well-known photographer, but as this single 
picture so vividly attests she is certainly an extraordinary one. A 
quintessential "artists' artist," she is highly regarded among her peers. The 
distinction fits the tenor of her work. 
</P>
<P>
 The show overflows with images of an unusual tone: Banal at first glance, her 
views of life in the unglamorous streets of the metropolis tend to blossom 
slowly, finally deepening with a peculiarly intimate resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Levitt's uniqueness lies in the difference between her photographs and 
those of well-known American social documentarians of the 1930s, the era of 
great social crisis when she began to make pictures. She photographed almost 
exclusively in a variety of decaying neighborhoods of New York -- the city of 
her birth, which she has rarely left during her 80 years and which she has used 
as the title for almost all her work. Yet, her photographs do not speak of 
public issues as much as intimating private meditations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers are visual poems, not polemics. Her friendship with the likes of writer 
James Agee and painter and art historian Janice Loeb, and her admiration for 
the photographs of Walker Evans, Weegee, Cartier-Bresson and others testify to 
the lyrically poetic interests of her art. As is common in our own turbulent 
moment, such work is easily swamped by the noisier clamor of more contentious 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the children. Children are Levitt's great subject. They 
appear in about two-thirds of the black-and-white and color pictures in the 
show -- in the background, on center stage; playing, fighting, daydreaming; 
disappearing into shadowed doorways or reflected in storefront windows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with the latter-day putto observing the urban frieze of New York, Levitt's 
children are both remote in the half-remembered mystery of their youthfulness 
and conceived with an almost shockingly blunt intimacy. Levitt doesn't 
sentimentalize children -- or, rather, sentimentality becomes just one among a 
panoply of facets through which children are fully seen. 
</P>
<P>
 One way Levitt was able to capture the feeling of the childlike quality of a 
consciousness-in-formation was through her choice of camera. In 1936, she 
bought a Leica -- the small, hand-held camera that, unlike a boxy view-camera, 
for the first time allowed photographers a degree of obscurity on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 To make herself even more inconspicuous, Levitt fitted the camera with a 
right-angle lens. She could face in one direction and shoot, but her camera 
would be taking a picture 90-degrees to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is subjects who, if they are aware of the photographer's presence 
at all, are not actors playing to or shying away from the camera. When you look 
at her photographs you see the world out of the corner of her eye. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Helen Levitt has been for the past 50 years, too, as far as the 
art world goes -- over there, in the corner of its eye, never completely out of 
sight but rarely ever in the direct line of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrospective is changing that. Its thoughtful installation at LACMA is 
provocative in juxtaposing earlier work of the 1930s and 1940s with more 
recent, often color pictures made since the end of the 1960s. (Levitt made few 
photographs during the 1950s -- a film shot and edited with Agee and Loeb and 
released in 1952 is in the show, but technical difficulties prevented its 
preview -- while a studio burglary in 1966 obliterated all evidence of her 1959 
return to still-camera pictures.) The juxtapositions of past and present 
underscore the continuity of her artistic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, is now 
concluding a two-year national tour. (It coincides with a rare L.A. gallery 
show of her work, at Paul Kopeikin Gallery.) Together with an excellent 
catalogue by the show's curators, Sandra S. Phillips and Maria Morris Hambourg, 
it goes a very long way toward establishing Levitt as a superior artist of her 
generation.

 Oscar Flap: Some Oscar voters were surprised to open their ballots and not see 
"The Summer House," a British comedy starring Jeanne Moreau, listed among the 
eligible films. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the movie 
was disqualified because of a long-standing rule that a film cannot appear on 
television anywhere in the world before it is seen in Los Angeles-area 
theaters. "Summer House" played in British theaters, then on the BBC before it 
opened in Los Angeles. The film's distributor, Samuel Goldwyn Co., said it had 
not been informed of the disqualification. Goldwyn's president of production, 
Tom Rothman, said, "the rule doesn't reflect the way of today's movie-making, 
particularly for small pictures, because those pictures are financed by piecing 
together money from international sources, which often includes television 
networks." Another of 1993's films not eligible under the same rule is Miramax 
Films' "The Snapper," directed by Stephen Frears, which also aired on the BBC.

 As the Channels Grow . . . : MTV personality Daisy Fuentes will host a weekly, 
half-hour live interview program on cable's CNBC beginning Feb. 12. The 
program, to air on Saturdays at 5 p.m., will focus primarily on lifestyles and 
cultural topics and will include live interviews and viewer call-in segments. 
Fuentes will continue her role at MTV, where she hosts several programs 
including "Street Party" and the Spanish-language "MTV Internacional." . . . 
Meanwhile, for those who think they can take on Fuentes, and maybe even David 
Letterman, America's Talking, a 24-hour all-talk cable network set to launch 
later this year, has announced plans for a nationwide contest to find an 
"average American" to become the country's "next talk-show personality." The 
first-place winner gets a yearlong contract to host a national talk show on the

 A 'Mystery' at Knotts: Burbank-based BRC Imagination Arts has announced plans 
for a $10-million special effects attraction scheduled to open at Knott's Berry 
Farm in May. Called "Mystery Lodge," the new attraction focuses on Native 
American culture with a family oriented multimedia show taking place around a 
full-size replica of a traditional Kwakiut'l Indian house. Hailed as "one of 
the park's most technically advanced projects ever," "Mystery Lodge" is to be 
the largest expansion to Knott's since the addition of "Bigfoot Rapids" in

 Burt Agrees to $37,000 a Month: Actor Burt Reynolds has tentatively agreed to

monthly rent on the 12,000-square-foot Los Angeles home where Anderson and 
Quinton live, Reynolds' lawyer told a Florida judge Monday. The latter payments 
would continue until the lease on the home expires in July. A Jan. 26 hearing

breached a 34-year-old contract stipulating she would pay the company 5% of her 
gross entertainment industry earnings to represent her to the media. The Los 
Angeles Superior Court lawsuit says Woodward's actor husband, Paul Newman, 
wrote the firm to terminate both their contracts in 1992, citing slowdowns in 
their careers. But the agency alleges Woodward didn't repay money it advanced 
for publicity on her behalf between Jan. 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992.

 The Winner in a Recount: Producer-composer-arranger David Foster was actually 
the top nominee for the 36th Annual Grammy Awards, with seven nominations in 
categories including Producer of the Year and Record and Album of the Year for 
Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" and "The Bodyguard" soundtrack 
album. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences last week credited 
him with only five nominations, putting him behind Sting's six nods. Foster has 
won eight previous Grammys and now has 34 total career nominations. SHAUNA SNOW

THEATER REVIEW; ALLEN AND MEADOWS DISPATCH 'LOVE LETTERS' WITH INTUITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Letters are still our salvation," write the lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Just when we feared that the post office had routed their 
correspondence to the dead letter department, Melissa Gardner and Andrew 
Makepeace Ladd III are together again. This time the mailman has delivered A.R. 
Gurney's "Love Letters" to the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, where 
the play's charms prove just as beguiling as during its record-breaking 
residency at the Canon Theatre in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's inaccurate to write "together again" about Steve Allen and Jayne 
Meadows. Their longstanding marriage provides the Gardner/Ladd epistolary 
relationship with graceful naturalism and intuitive timing. Allen and Meadows 
sit at an ornate wooden table and read aloud from the New Englanders' 50-year 
correspondence as if it's their own diary. Listening to this couple, you feel 
like a privileged visitor eavesdropping on intimate confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Love Letters" has no staged action, it's dependent on speech and body 
language to provide all dramatic impact. Among Allen's many gifts -- writing, 
directing, composing -- acting is the least of his talents. He tends to read 
too rapidly, obscuring the emotional depths hidden beneath Andrew's 
prim-and-proper Ivy League pose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows is the purer actor, possessing a more expressive voice. Her Melissa 
sounds tough and resilient, but underneath the acerbic wit hides a 
vulnerability begging for Andrew's tender embrace. We understand through 
Meadows' pauses and silences why the privileged New England heiress succumbs to 
alcoholism and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, sentiments and tears emerge, thanks to Gurney's inspired 
concept. It's to the La Mirada Theatre's credit that no stage director is 
listed. "Love Letters" requires no rehearsals, no memorizing of lines, no 
costumes and no sets. All that's required is a pair of actors who can be 
themselves. Allen and Meadows meet that challenge beautifully.

THEATER REVIEW; 'STORIES OF EDGAR ALLAN POE' ENTERTAIN, CONFUSE AT CORONET; 
THREE OF THE WRITER'S TALES AND BITS OF HIS POETRY ARE WOVEN INTO A PLAY ABOUT 
A GIRL'S QUEST FOR A LETTER THAT WILL REUNITE THE SPIRITS OF POE AND HIS WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whew. Talk about an antidote to any lingering holiday sweetness and light: 
"Gruesome, Gory, Grotesque Stories of Edgar Allan Poe," the latest production 
from the Serendipity Theatre Co., is a dark offering for ages 8 and up at the 
Coronet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The uneven mix of horror, romance and comedy by Sam Kuglen and directed by 
Katy Realista needs rethinking, but it has its chilling moments. Three Poe 
tales -- "The Tell-Tale Heart," "The Black Cat," "The Purloined Letter" -- and 
bits of the author's poetry are woven into a story about a teen-age girl's 
quest to find a letter that will reunite the spirits of Poe (Jeremy Scott) and 
his young wife, Virginia (Britta Von Detten). 
</P>
<P>
 Poe blames himself for his wife's tubercular death and is doomed to relive it 
forever with her because he never saw the love letter she wrote to him. It was 
hidden by his manipulative editor Griswold (Mark Conley), whose spirit has 
gleefully watched the other two suffer for nearly 150 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter two teens, Annie (Rebekah Baker) and Owen (Josh Wheeler), who search for 
the letter in Poe's haunted apartment. (Don Scott designed the nifty creepy 
set; Ken Realista did the moody lighting and the period costumes are by 
Daphne.) 
</P>
<P>
 Annie delves into her book of Poe stories hoping that Griswold may have used 
one for inspiration when he hid the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the confusing part. All the characters are on stage together, but the 
Poe and Virginia spirits can't see each other -- they relive Virginia's death 
separately. Griswold can see them, but they can't see him. They can all see the 
two teens, but the teens can't see them -- except when Annie is reading the 
stories and the spirits act them out. Then, the spirits are no longer spirits, 
but characters in the stories, so they can see each other . . . Except when 
they break character due to interruptions, primarily from Owen. Then they can't 
see each other anymore, except for Griswold, who . . . Confused? 
</P>
<P>
 During intermission at a recent performance, more than one mom was overheard 
trying to explain who was who, a task made no easier by the fact that at one 
point, the willowy, madonna-faced Von Detten in her lacy dress was supposed to 
be the old man with the evil eye in "The Tell-Tale Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What works the best is the comic interplay between the unseen ghosts and the 
teens, but the cast does a good job under difficult circumstances, especially 
Conley as the tortured killer in "The Tell-Tale Heart" and Jeremy Scott as the 
languid Frenchman in "The Purloined Letter." Owen's carping gets old fast, 
however -- he thinks Annie is weird and Poe is boring, until he hears the gory 
parts. "He buries the ax in her head? Cool!"

MUSIC REVIEW; EAR UNIT DELIVERS A COHESIVE EVENING OF ELLIOTT CARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hearing hefty doses of music by the celebrated but too often neglected 
American composer Elliott Carter is a rare enough treat, at a time when 
contemporary music gets token attention at best. Hearing a full plate of Carter 
works, spanning more than 40 years of the composer's output, and performed by 
the Carter-friendly California EAR Unit, was a multiple pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy-sized audience, by new-music standards, packed into the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art's Bing Theater for the Unit's Monday night concert. 
Carter, who was in attendance, is being feted for his 85th birthday at various 
concerts around Los Angeles this month. 
</P>
<P>
 What he heard this evening ranged from his Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and 
Harpsichord, from 1952, and his Sonata for Cello and Piano, from 1948, to four 
works from the last decade. The earlier pieces were potent examples of Carter's 
lifelong love of layering, pitting together contrasting tempos and instrumental 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaping ahead for the second half, "Enchanted Preludes" (1988) found Dorothy 
Stone's flitting flute weaving in irregular patterns around the brooding of 
cellist Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick. Violinist Robin Lorentz managed a similarly 
mercurial dance and dialogue in the context of the solo piece "Riconoscenza per 
Goffredo Petrassi," with plaintive single lines tumbling into gruff outbursts 
and wistful double stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Con Leggerezza Pensosa" (1990) is a three-way conversation for clarinet -- 
here, James Rohrig -- and, again, Duke-Kirkpatrick and Stone, running through 
stages of discord, empathy and puckishness. 
</P>
<P>
 As a grand finale, 1988's "Triple Duo" allowed for small units -- pianist 
Gloria Cheng and percussionist Amy Knoles, cello and violin, and flute and 
clarinet -- to behave independently and collectively within a larger system, 
like a bustling community of gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging to the ear but also full of vivid, abstracted imagery, this night 
of Carter proved to be a cohesive and cleansing experience.

ART REVIEW; MILLER'S COLLAGES A BLAND APPROACH TO THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Collage is often called the definitive art form of this century. In his paper 
collages, Pablo Picasso disrupted the space of art with the debris of "real" 
life.And in her image and text pieces, Barbara Kruger disclosed the abstruse 
manipulations of the media society. 
</P>
<P>
 For these artists -- along with everyone in-between, from John Heartfield to 
Robert Rauschenberg -- the power of collage has been its ability to unravel the 
fiction of seamlessness, the reigning myth of both art and life. What, then, of 
the collages and assemblages of Gregory A. J. Miller? 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is fascinated with the graphic look of American culture of the '50s and 
'60s: advertisements from Life magazine, plumped up with exclamation marks and 
wide-eyed wonder at this or that appliance; semi-sleazy cover illustrations 
taken from hard-boiled paperback novels; yellowed pages from "Catcher in the 
Rye" or "The Sound and the Fury," and pointy-breasted cocktail dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miller's work, such artifacts, both literary and material, are layered one 
over the other. The results are decidedly bland. 
</P>
<P>
 A man's narrow-lapel suit is covered in cut-out magazine ads and headlines. 
Pages from a book called "Dangerous Dames" provide the background for a 
flamboyantly '50s drawing of a woman in lingerie. The iconic image of Jack Ruby 
shooting Lee Harvey Oswald overlays a grid of pages from the Warren Commission 
Report. 
</P>
<P>
 What is missing, of course, is any disjunction, irony or wit. These are 
palimpsests, but they are strangely translucent. Here is the obvious restated, 
and the fiction of seamlessness reified. Miller exploits a contemporary taste 
for all things retro, but he fails to do something interesting with it: to 
interrogate that taste, undermine it or even surrender to it in a provocative 
fashion.

<P>
 * Having read "Multicultural Manners" (Voices, Dec. 27), I am appalled by the 
ignorant and prejudicial conclusion offered up by your writer, Norine Dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scenario, when the American, referred to as Sandy, asks in a friendly 
manner as to her acquaintance's first name, she is coolly rebuffed.The 
situation turns awkward. Dresser states that most Asians equate informality 
with disrespect and that Sandy was perceived to have behaved impertinently. She 
states that Sandy was wrong to have taken such liberties. What Dresser fails to 
acknowledge is that the acquaintance (Mrs. Rao from India) is new to America 
and has an equal responsibility to try to understand the customs of her host 
nation. A more proper response might have been for Mrs. Rao to reply that her 
culture preferred to use the family surname and that she might be more 
comfortable with using her first name after they know one another better. 
</P>
<P>
 When two different cultures meet, it is incumbent upon both to try to 
understand the other's viewpoints and customs -- that is the only way that we 
can learn understanding and tolerance.

 * In response to your editorial, "Tuneup for a Venerable Vehicle" (Jan. 3), I 
would suggest a major engine overhaul! 
</P>
<P>
 The Endangered Species Act of 1973, like a lot of well-intended legislation, 
has some flaws, the primary one being that it undermines a moral principle upon 
which our form of American democracy is founded: the protection of private 
property.  
</P>
<P>
 While we flaunt the protection of the golden eagle and the peregrine falcon as 
examples of the act's success, we are able to identify the obvious purpose of 
the act. These species, as well as the spotted owl, reside largely upon 
government-owned land. There can be little argument regarding public land. But 
what about land that is not owned by the government? 
</P>
<P>
 How many of us envisioned back in 1973 that a private landowner would be 
denied the right to build his retirement home on his acre of land because the 
act was being used to protect a rodent, a bird that dwells mostly in Mexico, or 
even a fly?  
</P>
<P>
 You stated, "Landowners with imperiled species on their property have been 
able to proceed with development while limiting and mitigating the ecological 
damage caused by construction." That sounds nice but it sure is poppycock! 
Paying $4,000 to a "rat preserve" for permission to build a home on one acre of 
land is rubbish. What happened to "just compensation" in the Fifth Amendment? 
What ecological damage is being mitigated to save a subspecies of rat at such 
enormous costs?  
</P>
<P>
 We should not allow the act to be used to prohibit owners of private property 
from using their land in what would otherwise be a legal and practical purpose.

 * We found your editorial regarding the Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
dismaying, and believe your statement that the act has stopped only 23 of more 
than 34,000 plans and projects reviewed under ESA between 1987 and 1991 to be 
intellectually dishonest. Many projects were reviewed and approved under the 
act, but phenomenal amounts of land and mitigation funds were extracted from 
private property owners for the "right" to build on "their" property; without a 
dime of compensation. The government is taking land for our societal goals 
without paying for it, and that is theft. 
</P>
<P>
 While protecting the bald eagle or even the lyrate bladderpod are noble 
causes, they don't justify institutionalized thievery and tyranny. If species 
and habitat are that important to society that we prevent someone from fully or 
partially utilizing his land, then it is our responsibility to compensate him 
commensurate with the degraded value of his property. DONALD W. SCHMITZ JR.,

RECESSIONS MAKE FOR UNHAPPY BUDGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the dreary backdrop of a fourth year of state deficits, Gov. Pete 
Wilson is again squeezing down on the expense side of the social welfare 
budget. In one area -- welfare reform -- he has the public policy right, but 
the cuts he proposes won't fly. In another area -- prenatal aid to immigrants 
-- neither the policy nor the cuts will fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is challenging Sacramento to strengthen the link between welfare 
assistance and work. On this big issue he's absolutely right, and Californians 
will benefit if this debate results, as it did last year, in important 
bipartisan welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the proposed budget would cut welfare payments by as much as 25%, 
eliminate additional benefits when a baby is born to a woman receiving welfare, 
and limit to two years the time a person is allowed to be on welfare. These 
proposals -- particularly the big cut in aid, absent significant new housing 
subsidies -- probably won't survive the Legislature. But if a sturdy safety net 
were in place, the time limit idea certainly would be worth exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is considering a similar limit. After the deadline, 
recipients still could get benefits, but only if they worked at community 
service jobs. The American Public Welfare Assn., which represents state and 
local welfare administrators, endorses, with qualifications, such a deadline. 
Several of Wilson's welfare proposals indeed merit support, including his plan 
to require teen-age mothers, in most circumstances, to live with a parent or 
guardian to qualify for aid. This would help ensure some supervision and 
protect young mothers from men who have their eyes on their welfare checks. And 
his proposed crackdown on welfare fraud is worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also seeks to end prenatal care to illegal immigrants in order to save 
$92 million; some of the savings would go to well-baby care for low-income 
citizens and legal residents, a worthy purpose. The state cannot afford both 
programs, says Wilson. Yet, is pitting one poor group against another the best 
public policy? After all, the problem originates with Washington's abject 
failure to control the borders -- and its unconscionable failure to reimburse 
the state for its cost in providing for illegal immigrants. The governor's real 
beef is with Washington. That's why he wants at least $2.3 billion in federal 
reimbursements for fiscal 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years Wilson has championed prenatal and preventive care. Cutting off 
all such care to illegal immigrant mothers eventually would result in greater 
state costs; cutting welfare too deeply would punish poor children. This does 
not sound like vintage Pete Wilson. It sounds more like a state budget held 
hostage to California's continuing severe recession. Though cuts are 
unavoidable, other ways must be found to spread the pain.

 A GREAT DEAL, IF IT CAN BE DONE; UKRAINE DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD BE A BARGAIN 
FOR THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Defense Department currently counts six nations with long-range nuclear 
strike capabilities. If the "hopeful and historic breakthrough" announced by 
President Clinton at this week's NATO summit meeting in Brussels in fact is 
achieved, that list would shrink to five, as Ukraine became the world's first 
state to voluntarily divest itself of its nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 But note that all-important if. What exists so far after intense negotiations 
that have been going on since 1991 is a complicated agreement in principle 
reached by the leaders of the United States, Russia and Ukraine. Details remain 
to be worked out, but by any objective assessment the core deal clearly serves 
the interests of all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not, though, without its powerful foes, most threateningly in Ukraine's 
own Parliament, which several times in recent months has blocked President 
Leonid Kravchuk's moves toward denuclearization. The U.S. view is that Kravchuk 
can implement the deal by executive order. That view, unfortunately, is not 
likely to be shared by Ukrainian legislators. The deal, in short, is not yet 
done, and getting it done is now a matter of some urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BEAST: For one thing, U.S. experts fear that the nuclear weapons that were 
inherited by Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed have not been well 
maintained -- most of the maintenance specialists were Russians who have gone 
back to Russia -- raising the possibility that catastrophic accidents could 
occur. The sooner, then, that those 176 land-based long-range missiles and 592 
air-carried cruise missiles are dismantled and their warheads transferred to 
Russia for reprocessing into nuclear fuel, the safer all the parties involved 
will be. That most definitely includes the United States, which, end of the 
Cold War or not, is still the place the land-based SS-24 and SS-19 missiles are 
pointed at. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also powerful political and economic reasons for moving speedily to 
begin dismantling Ukraine's arsenal. The country, tottering under the twin 
blows of soaring inflation and a shrinking economy, desperately needs help from 
outside. The deal on dismantling its nuclear weapons offers that help, 
providing hard-currency payments from international sales of the nuclear 
material that the Ukrainians would deliver to Russia for reprocessing into 
reactor fuel. One not unrealistic fear in Washington has been that economic 
desperation might tempt Ukraine to sell part of its arsenal to other countries. 
Dismantling Ukraine's weapons thus serves the cause of non-proliferation twice 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BEAUTY: For the United States the cost would be reasonable enough -- $175 
million already agreed to for dismantling the weapons and a probable doubling 
of the $155 million in economic aid budgeted for this year. That's a small 
price to pay for eliminating the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has to be emphasized again that an agreement in principle is still some 
distance away from becoming an agreement in fact, that the achievement a 
triumphant Bill Clinton hailed in Brussels for now remains no more than 
prospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian legislators worried about the climb to political prominence of those 
who would restore the Russian empire, of which Ukraine was for long the crown 
jewel, could prove immovable on the matter of denuclearization. The 
counterargument to their concerns is that a Ukraine that was seen to pose no 
nuclear threat to Russia could allay fears in Moscow and lead to greater 
accommodation between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case it's clear that Kravchuk has a formidable selling job in front of 
him, and he's going to need all the help and reassurance he can get from 
Clinton and from Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. Kravchuk has assured 
Clinton he can deliver. He will very soon have a chance to prove it.

SALINAS -- BOTH THE DOVE AND THE HAWK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was inevitable that Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would shake 
up his government after last week's bloody Indian uprising in the state of 
Chiapas. But more than political damage control is needed in the wake of a 
crisis that has tarnished the young Mexican president's reputation both inside 
Mexico and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the ouster of Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez was an easy 
call for Salinas. No official was more responsible for the social and political 
mess in Chiapas that blew up in the president's face. Gonzalez, who oversaw 
internal security in his Cabinet post, failed utterly to anticipate the Chiapas 
trouble. To make matters worse, he was governor of that state for five years 
before becoming interior minister last year and critics there claim his 
heavy-handed administration helped exacerbate the backward conditions that led 
to the outbreak of violence on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the far more interesting, and far more hopeful, changes that 
Salinas announced Monday are his selection of Atty. Gen. Jorge Carpizo 
MacGregor to replace Gonzalez as interior minister and his dispatching of 
former Mexico City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis to Chiapas. Camacho will be 
Salinas' personal envoy there and head a federal commission that will seek 
"reconciliation," Salinas said. Both Carpizo and Camacho have outstanding 
credentials for their difficult new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpizo was a respected human rights advocate before becoming attorney 
general. He will now have to ask some tough questions to determine whether 
security forces have, as some rights groups fear, gone too far in putting down 
the Chiapas revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 With both Mexican and foreign journalists still barred from the area of 
conflict in the south, rumors and reports of bloody suppression persist. Sooner 
or later Salinas must reply to international concerns over human rights abuses 
in this crisis, and when he does an aide of Carpizo's stature will be extremely 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho is a well-regarded negotiator with close ties to Mexican leftist 
groups, a key reason Salinas appointed him mayor of Mexico City, where the left 
is politically potent. The president surely figures that if anyone can get the 
Indian rebels to talk peace, Camacho can. But, as with Carpizo, Salinas must 
give his new appointee the leeway needed to get the job done and to calm the 
crisis without further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 A good first step would be for both Carpizo and Camacho to offer the leaders 
of the Indian rebellion guarantees of amnesty and, perhaps more important in 
the short term, personal safety if they agree to stop fighting, come out into 
the open and negotiate publicly with the government.

END OF EUPHEMISM

 If Gabler is correct (I do not believe so) that the price we pay for candor

GUN DEALER FEE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Why is it that instead of dealing with the real issue of crime, the Clinton 
Administration, per Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, proposes to increase the 
annual licensing fees to $600 for gun dealers (Jan. 4)? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't this Administration understand the term free market ? This $600 
licensing increase is only going to be passed down to gun buyers through higher 
gun prices, not to mention forcing many private gun companies out of 
business.Perhaps the reason why there are more gun dealers than gas stations is 
because our government has failed in its primary function: to protect the 
governed.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAD BARTH

<P>
 * Controlling guns by raising the cost of gun dealers' licenses is like trying 
to control illegal drugs by raising pharmacists' license fees. Doesn't Clinton 
and his tired old Cabinet understand that all of these naive efforts don't even 
begin to address the problem? Criminals don't look to licensed gun dealers for 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a gun nut. I have been trained by the military and as a police 
officer in the use and handling of guns. I took great comfort in the fact that 
while Daryl Gates and Tom Bradley stood by and let the rioters run rampant 
after the Koon-Powell acquittals in the Rodney King case, I had the means to 
protect my family and myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to gun control must start with disarming criminals. Before we disarm 
citizens, let's get our armed protectors to disarm the enemy -- the gangs and 
criminals. Then and only then can we turn in our weapons.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; A PAINFUL JOLT FOR THE BODY POLITIC; SALINAS PUT

 The Chiapas rebellion could prove to be a major watershed in Mexico's 
political evolution. After 10 days of upheaval and violence, the Mexican 
government has finally realized that pacification of Chiapas is a political 
problem, not a military one. The Herculean task has been assigned to the former 
mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Camacho Solis, who has been designated 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. That President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari chose one of the country's most popular politicians for the 
job suggests the government may be ready to grapple with the imperatives of 
broader political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years of his presidency, Salinas devoted most of his 
energies to economic modernization. He privatized, liberalized, slashed tariffs 
and hammered out a historic commercial accord with the United States. But he 
did not democratize Mexico. With an eye on Russia's debacle, Salinas argued 
that economic reform and political reform could not take place simultaneously. 
In order to maintain its stability, Mexico would enact "Salinastroika" first, 
and "PRInost" at some point in the future. Instead of democracy, Salinas 
offered NAFTA, lower inflation and increased social spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Salinas' popularity, the expectations created by free trade and 
renewed economic growth have been powerful analgesics. They kept the "other" 
Mexico at bay. Chiapas is a painful jolt into awareness that social peace 
cannot be bought at the expense of democratization.  
</P>
<P>
 The uprising in Chiapas on New Year's Day was rooted in social injustice and 
longstanding grievances. These grievances, however, exploded into violence 
because they lacked institutional channels for expression. Chiapas' Indians and 
peasants took up arms because they had spent years pounding on the doors of the 
state government, to no avail. During his weekly tours of the countryside, 
Salinas frequently visited Chiapas. Like a Mexican version of Gandhi, he sat 
under trees, chatted with peasants and listened to endless tales of repression 
and injustice. In response, his government did little else but pump up public 
spending in the state -- social compensation for political problems. Now, 
belatedly, as he enters the last year of his presidency, Salinas must hope that 
he can find a political solution to the political crisis that is typified by, 
but not restricted to, Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 In appointing Camacho, Salinas is offering an olive branch and implicitly 
recognizing his political mistakes. Many expected him to choose Camacho as the 
PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) presidential candidate. Instead, with 
an eye on the future of NAFTA, Salinas chose a button-down protege. He feared 
Camacho's proto-populism, his ties to Mexico's left, his tendency to bargain ad 
nauseam. Ironically, the characteristics that made Camacho unacceptable two 
months ago make him indispensable today. If he puts out the Chiapas fire, he 
will be declared a national savior and be a major force in politics for years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two questions are being asked: Why didn't Salinas intervene before 
the crisis in Chiapas exploded? One answer: because it's his style to let 
political problems fester until they need his last-minute resolution. What if 
Salinas really didn't know how critical the problems in Chiapas had become? 
Then something is seriously amiss in the national security Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 One lesson is already clear from Chiapas: Widespread economic modernization in 
Mexico cannot survive and flourish without political modernization. Mexico will 
not reap the benefits of free trade and renewed growth until and unless those 
benefits reach the dispossessed. Until and unless clean and fair elections 
reflect the popular will of the country's marginalized groups. Until and unless 
the word accountability becomes an accepted term of the country's political 
vocabulary. Some time will elapse before this comes to pass. But Chiapas will 
surely accelerate the pace of Mexico's rocky transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas' final lesson is that Mexico's political future is uncertain. After 
Chiapas, Mexico can no longer be considered the living museum of traditional 
Latin American politics nor the last bastion of social peace and political 
stability. Whatever happens from now on must be the result of negotiation and 
compromise between the Mexican people and their government. Instead of imposing 
presidential dictates, Salinas' successors must bargain. Instead of rigging 
elections, the PRI must be forced to work at winning them. This process will be 
open-ended, its outcome uncertain. We may not know beforehand which party will 
win, who will get elected and how that president will exercise power. But 
uncertainty is the essence of democracy, in Mexico as elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican complacency with dominant-party rule has been weakening in the past 
decade. If it serves to hasten the nation's democratization, Chiapas may turn 
out to be a blessing in disguise.

LESSONS FROM AN ATTIC AND A CELLAR; YOUTH SPEAKS TO YOUTH AS THE ANNE FRANK 
DIARIES SEND THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUSTTO WAR-TORN SARAJEVO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Journal of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Zlata Filipovic knows Anne Frank. Now I'd like her to meet Etty Hillesum. 
Filipovic, a 13-year-old Sarajevo girl, is the current literary star of Paris, 
thanks to the publication of her diary modeled explicitly after the one by the 
young Jewish girl of Amsterdam killed in a Nazi concentration camp. More than 
50,000 copies of "The Diary of Zlata Filipovic" have touched the hearts of 
French readers, who airlifted her and her parents out of Sarajevo to Paris 
recently. Written from her family cellar to a mythical "Dear Mimmy," the diary 
describes her daily life running in and out of bomb shelters during the Bosnian 
civil war, now almost two years old. The country is being led by "crazy" 
leaders, and all sides are being wronged, she says. "I'll be 20 in a few years' 
time," she writes. "If it turns out to be another Lebanon, as they keep saying, 
I'll be 30. Gone will be my childhood. Gone my youth. Gone my life. And I'll 
die and this war still won't be over." 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be ever like this, the old stumbling in the dark and the young 
screaming for help? As it turns out, at the time I read of Zlata Filipovic's 
journal, I was preparing a tribute to Etty Hillesum, who would have turned 80 
this weekend. Hillesum was another young diarist writing only blocks away from 
the Amsterdam attic where Anne Frank's family hid out with the Van Dams. 
Hillesum died in Auschwitz at age 29. Reading her diaries, collected in the 
book, "An Interrupted Life," is like discovering the sequel to the Anne Frank 
story and with it our own capacity to care. We can imagine what Frank would 
have been like as a young woman, more experienced in love, sex, intellectual 
discourse and hence less surprised by civilization's growing darkness, but 
still living in basic denial about mankind's capacity for evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillesum was capable of seeing the good in a bad day. Even as the grocers were 
putting up signs saying "No Jews allowed," Hillesum wrote, "I believe that I 
will never be able to hate any human being for his so-called wickedness, that I 
shall only hate the evil that is within me." Maybe she was just an optimist on 
a self-destructive bender, ultimately refusing to save herself even when she 
could. But even as she came to accept that "they are out to destroy us 
completely," she disowned the idea of nationalized hate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's good sometimes to go back to basics. The writings of youth are not always 
naive. They often seem to be in touch with what Carl Jung called the 
"underground spring" of universal human hope, something that we adults often 
desperately need. I've needed it myself, these days, especially since seeing 
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List." The movie has allowed me entry into a 
world I never wanted to know, to touch the possibility of madness and rage that 
I, far older than Frank, Hillesum and Filipovic, have denied as a matter of 
faith. Now I can't stay away. The implications of the Holocaust are everywhere, 
at the movie theater, in casual conversation and in the diaries of a Bosnian 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 But exactly what are those implications? Today, 50 years after the fact, we 
are being asked to decide the meaning of history. We, Jews and non-Jews, are at 
a crossroads. And we haven't yet made up our minds. The last survivors are 
dying out, and the collective memory is dimming. Who knows what comes next? 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, according to a recent survey, a large percentage of Americans 
don't quite believe that the Holocaust occurred. And some Jews have begun 
hoarding history. A disturbing double standard has set in. In responding to 
"Schindler's List," several critics object to the choice of Oskar Schindler as 
Holocaust hero, first because he isn't a Jew and then because he was a mixed 
bag, a self-serving profiteer even as he spared Jews from death. They want 
their lessons of history clear-cut, when even young girls in bunkers know that 
they are not.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a step backward. In the 50 years since World War II, Jews have learned 
to forgo such narrow thinking. We honored good and evil when we saw them, 
however muddy the background, and recognized our own potential for both. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why Zlata Filipovic's diaries come at precisely the right time. The 
young girl's missives make irrelevant the Holocaust as a metaphor of unique 
Jewish victimization and broaden its canvas as a symbol of human triumph. A 
girl in an attic speaks her truth to a girl in a cellar. And the still, small 
voice is once again finally heard.

EYEWITNESS: BERNARD KINSEY; 'WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS CITY WORK'; REBUILD L.A.: A 
SOLID RECORD, BUT IT TOOK ON TOO MUCH, STRUGGLING ALMOST ALONE ON OVERWHELMING 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By * As told to Robert Scheer, Times Contributing Editor; Bernard Kinsey, 50, 
co-chairman of Rebuild Los Angeles for the past 20 months, is returning to his 
business development and consulting firm, KBK Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 20 months ago, I joined Peter Ueberroth and Rebuild L.A. as chief 
operating officer. I was coming from a background in the private sector with 
the Xerox Corp., where I held a division vice presidential position for 10 of 
20 years I worked with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with many other people, I had believed that the problems of the inner 
cities are the biggest issues facing this country. The future of our cities and 
of the country rests on how we solve the problems of the underserved and 
neglected areas. RLA represented to me a clear economic model to bring 
businesses back into the inner cities -- which many had left over the previous 
20 years. This has been a unique experience with a mixture of both 
disappointment and success. 
</P>
<P>
 We were able to attract more than $585 million from the private sector to an 
area that had previously received nothing -- there were not enough grocery 
stores, paint stores, drugstores; not enough loans, investment and banks. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't lived up to everybody's expectations, but the reality is that 
nobody has ever tried to do what we did, and under extremely difficult 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 During the life of RLA, we elected four new council persons, a new county 
supervisor, a new mayor, a new President, two new senators and got a new police 
chief. Despite Peter Ueberroth's resignation and, most important, the worst 
recession in the history of this city, RLA has remained strong and resolute. 
RLA has been a gift to the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we solved the city's problems? No. Have we created a model that should 
continue? Yes. We made our share of mistakes and we missed some opportunities. 
For example, it was a mistake to have four co-chairs. We knew that all along, 
but the citizens demanded visible diversity. It's also true that we strayed 
from our initial focus on economic development only. We were pulled by many 
forces into child care, education and all the other areas that are important 
but for which, frankly, we didn't have distinctive competence and expertise. It 
thinned us out so much that it really diluted our effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has reminded me for months that RLA is not the only game in town, but 
no one can beat our track record. Let's look at the accomplishments:  
</P>
<P>
 * More than $585 million from the private sector, in hard commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thirty-two new supermarkets announced, 11 completed or under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eighteen new training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $20-million loan fund established by RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volunteer programs with more than 2,500 people working someplace in our city 
each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sixty new GM vans lent to community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * $5.5 million invested in three black banks. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 61% of the buildings damaged or destroyed in the riots rebuilt or 
under construction -- Crenshaw is 78% rebuilt, Broadway 62% and Florence 60%, 
to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those accomplishments have involved zero cost to the taxpayers of this 
city. Again, RLA has been a gift to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality remains that, despite this effort, the problems are immense. We 
estimated at the beginning that it would take a $6-billion fix. I said when I 
took this job that we had to now put back as much into the inner city as we 
took out over the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 We never expected that RLA alone could accomplish that. We knew that a strong 
federal, state and local government effort, coupled with the private sector and 
the community, could begin to solve these long-festering problems. The sad 
truth is that our effort ended up being basically the only effort. 
</P>
<P>
 We had better face up to the fact that government, banking, foundation and 
investment capital, on all levels, has not been available to solve the problems 
of Los Angeles and other inner cities. A pro basketball player, Larry Johnson 
of the Charlotte Hornets, recently got an $84-million contract -- more than all 
the government funds put into inner-city Los Angeles since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it, RLA became the whipping boy for the failure of our society to deal 
with the problem. Nobody else stepped up. But look at the negative press that 
Ueberroth and RLA received. The guy spent 14 hours a day for 14 months, away 
from his family, living at the Bonaventure Hotel, knocking himself out trying 
to solve the problem. But I had warned him -- this is not the Olympics. There 
are no opening and closing ceremonies, there's just the daily grind of trying 
to solve the many problems that confront day-to-day life in the inner city.  
</P>
<P>
 People put too many expectations on RLA, lost sight of its significant 
accomplishments and never focused on the massive needs of the community, which 
RLA was never in a position to deal with. That's how we got into the mistake of 
being expected to solve problems of American urban life that went far beyond 
our charter. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened is understandable. In the vacuum left by the failure of other 
institutions to respond to the needs of this city, RLA became the repository 
for everyone's hopes and dreams. We received 4,500 resumes for 22 jobs, we got 
more than 4,000 calls a day, we got 6,000 requests to volunteer. We had so many 
calls that we had to change the phone system, and so many people came through 
the front door that the carpet had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to us with every conceivable problem and proposal, many of which we 
had no ability to deal with. We never could get across to people that we were 
not a funding source, but that didn't stop them from asking. In retrospect, we 
should have dealt only with issues of economic activity and refused to get 
sidetracked. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever our failings, RLA represented an immense outpouring of community 
support and goodwill. I have the highest respect for our co-chairs, staff, loan 
executives, board and task-force members and thousands of volunteers. Let's not 
forget the hundreds of companies who fundamentally changed their approach to 
the inner city. None of this could have happened without Peter Ueberroth. I 
want to especially thank the black, Latino, Asian organizations that put aside 
their differences to advance the goals of RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm returning to the private sector, I intend to maintain my 
commitment to economic development, to encourage investment in all parts of our 
city. In every city, the problem is similar: We need to involve the uninvolved, 
we need to reach out to all classes and ethnic and racial groups, and they must 
believe they have a stake in this. We must learn to utilize the historically 
underrepresented talent we have in the black, Asian, Latino and female 
populations.  
</P>
<P>
 I was successful at Xerox because my team always looked and performed like a 
winning Olympic team. The problem is not just investment. The problem in the 
inner cities is that most of the people are not in the game. They must be 
included at all levels of government, boardrooms, business, banks, foundations 
and anywhere else that does not utilize all of the talent this country has to 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 We've got to make this city work. My 16-year-old son, Khalil, shouldn't have 
to be afraid to go to a football game or a dance for fear of being shot or 
being a victim of senseless gang violence. I want to continue to live here -- I 
like the beach, the weather, the people, the diversity of culture and the 
economic opportunities. I don't want to flee, I don't want to have to hide 
behind high gates, so my only choice is to make this city work. If anybody asks 
you how Bernard Kinsey feels about his tenure at RLA, tell them you heard it 
straight from me: I loved every minute of it.

 Time to put Governor Pete out to pasture?It could be a bad omen for 
California's governor as he prepares for his reelection campaign. A horse named 
Governor Pete made his debut the other day at Santa Anita and finished eighth 
in a field of 10. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wait until "Inside Edition" hears this theory about road kills: "Since it's 
L.A. Auto Show time," Gordon Johnson of L.A. writes, "you might want to mention 
this new term that I'm convinced will enter the dictionary in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson came across it in Car and Driver magazine's discussion of the problem 
of jaywalking animals. Writer Larry Griffin wondered if some critters were 
"trying to get Kevorked by a speeding car." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say this is an odd description: "Santa left me a welcome safety 
device (a combined alarm and flashlight)," wrote Joyce Clark Shults of 
Chatsworth. But she notes that his elves had a problem describing "its 
hand-dandy carrying loop" (see illustration). 
</P>
<P>
 Further proof that L.A. is a weightlifting center: Larry Nevers and Walter 
Budzyn, two ex-Detroit cops convicted of murdering a motorist, wrote their 
supporters from a Texas prison that they have received so many threats from 
other inmates that they have befriended two 6-foot-2, 300-pound prisoners for 
protection . . . "a gun/dope dealer from Hamtramck (and) a bank robber from San 
Pedro, Calif." 
</P>

 And keep your hands off them, Irwindale: What more is there to say of the 
Raiders' dramatic wins over Denver the last two weeks in Exposition Park? 
Perhaps Cole Porter said it best in song:  
</P>
<P>
 You're the top / You're the Colosseum . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We just can't understand why he gave the L.A. Coliseum a Latin spelling.

 Next time we'll mark our territory better: As we continue to paw through Jon 
Winokur's "Mondo Canine" collection, we found a tale about one Milton Kagen, 
who was angered by dogs relieving themselves in his yard while their masters 
"watched placidly." So Kagen posted a sign on his Hollywood property, warning 
that his plants were sprayed with "dioxinleucomaine," which brought an end to 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's dioxinleucomaine? "I made up the word," Kagen proudly admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, how did Only in L.A. miss this story? Wait a minute! Winokur acknowledges 
that he did lift it from Only in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 We're mondo relieved, even if we're not getting so much as a scrap of the 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today's handy hint: "Mondo Canine" also quotes comedian Jay Leno on a 
sensitive problem that too many families avoid discussing. "If you want to cure 
your dog's bad breath," Leno said, "just pour a little Lavoris in the toilet." 
miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Carl's Jr., founded in L.A. half a century ago, proclaims in its restaurants 
that it is the "first major fast-food chain to provide carpeted and upholstered 
dining rooms and service to the table." What, no chandeliers?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: ATTACK ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THE HUMANE, EFFECTIVE WAY -- 
AT THE WORKPLACE; UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS HAVE AN 
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. ASSEMBLY BILL 2404 WOULD PREVENT THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM UMBERG, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) represents the 69th 
District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians are becoming increasingly frustrated with their government's 
inability to control the flow of illegal immigration into California. 
</P>
<P>
 With 30% of the nation's illegal immigrants within our borders, California has 
borne a disproportionate share of the nation's immigration burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, governmental services have been strained. The poor economy and 
shrinking local and state tax revenues have exacerbated the problems and 
heightened frustrations. No doubt, that's why a recent Field poll revealed that 
three out of four Californians considered illegal immigration a "very serious 
problem" adversely affecting the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But while our economy may be poor, horrific economic conditions elsewhere in 
the world make it attractive for some to sacrifice everything to come to 
California -- even if it means working for subminimum wages in subhuman 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of low-paying, hazardous and "under-the-table" jobs is the 
magnet drawing illegal immigrants to California. Although data is scarce on 
California's undocumented population, a 1992 U.S. Department of Justice survey 
of 6,193 immigrants found that 94% of those who immigrated did so in search of 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there are substantial incentives to hiring undocumented 
workers. As a result, some Californians are quick to reach out to undocumented 
workers to fill certain positions. 
</P>
<P>
 These workers do not demand minimum wages, a safe workplace, Workers' 
Compensation or other basic benefits. Consequently, law-abiding employers are 
at a huge disadvantage when trying to compete, particularly those in hazardous 
or labor-intensive industries. 
</P>
<P>
 It's apparent that, until we reduce the availability of employment for those 
illegally migrating to California, we will fail in our efforts to stem the tide 
of illegal immigration to this state. 
</P>
<P>
 I submitted a bill (AB 2404) in the last session to strike at the heart of 
this problem. It was carried over and on Tuesday, the Assembly Public Safety 
Committee approved it by a 6-0 vote with two abstentions. It now goes to the 
Assembly's Ways and Means Committee, where I hope it will be approved within 
the next month.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure provides for civil and criminal sanctions for employers who 
knowingly hire undocumented workers. First offenses would be subject to fines. 
Subsequent convictions would result in the seizure of business assets and 
criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The provisions for asset forfeiture would be similar to those currently used 
by law enforcement to combat drug-trafficking, with a few important 
distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 First, an employer's property could be forfeited only after the defendant is 
found guilty in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, asset forfeiture would apply only to repeat offenders -- employers 
who had previously been convicted of knowingly hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirdly, to target enforcement on the most egregious abusers, the provisions 
of AB 2404 would apply only to employers of five or more employees. 
</P>
<P>
 This measure has ignited a firestorm of discussion. Criticisms come largely 
from those who are unfamiliar with the protections in the bill for legitimate 
employers. This bill requires employers to do nothing more than is already 
required under federal law. Indeed, legitimate businesses recognize they are at 
a competitive disadvantage to those who do not pay lawful wages and provide 
safe workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Most businesses view AB 2404, quite correctly, as a way to level the "playing 
field," to coerce all businesses to play by the rules, and to penalize those 
businesses that profit by breaking the law -- as well as to fund further 
investigations and prosecutions.  
</P>
<P>
 While federal employer sanctions currently exist, embodied in the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), past experience has made it clear that 
those federal sanctions are weak, compounded by a lack of committed resources 
to enforce the law. As a result, there has been little impact on the continued 
practice of hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although IRCA substantially increased the enforcement budget of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the number of investigations 
staff accounted for only 15% of INS' total enforcement budget. A 1991 study by 
the Rand Corporation and the Urban Institute indicated that in INS' Los Angeles 
district office, there were 2.2 employer-sanctions staffers per 10,000 
employers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 One very valid concern that has been raised in discussions on this measure is 
the possibility that tougher employer sanctions will lead to increased racial 
discrimination in employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a 1990 General Accounting Office study concluded that IRCA's federal 
employer sanctions had caused widespread discrimination against job applicants 
who looked or sounded foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true the federal government's response to these statistics has been 
abysmal. INS' Office of Special Counsel, created to handle those cases, 
currently has a staff of only 17 to handle IRCA-related discrimination cases 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this disparity, AB 2404 would designate a portion of forfeited 
assets to public agencies to investigate and prosecute 
employment-discrimination cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a portion of the proceeds would go to counties to help defray the 
costs of providing social services, and to fund further enforcement of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 A tamper-proof identification card establishing legal residency, such as a 
tamper-proof Social Security card issued after verification of legal residency, 
also would allay an employer's fear that he or she may unwittingly hire an 
undocumented worker. I am exploring the possibility of including in AB 2404 
provisions for a tamper-proof identification card. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no doubt that social service programs are impacted by the wave of 
illegal immigrants, once they are here. But there has been an unwillingness by 
government to tackle the reason illegal immigrants journey here: to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the proposals to address the illegal immigration problem in this state 
do not recognize this fundamental fact. There have been proposals to deny 
emergency health care to undocumented immigrants, and to remove children of 
undocumented immigrants from public schools. Many of these proposals are 
shortsighted and some, just plain mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have sacrificed everything are not likely to return to their country 
of origin merely because their children are removed from school. It is far more 
likely those children will instead be pressed into the same shady employment 
scheme as their parents, despite state and federal child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as likely, the children will simply grow up in California, uneducated and 
without hope of education, resulting in a significant impact on public safety 
and a long-term cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 I am reminded of a bumper sticker I saw recently, which read: "Think Education 
Is Expensive? -- Try Ignorance." What have we saved in tax dollars if we must 
quadruple law enforcement and prison budgets to compensate for this 
shortsighted saving in public education? 
</P>
<P>
 Targeting employers who flagrantly violate the laws against hiring 
undocumented workers is the only fair, humane and workable solution to the 
problem of illegal immigration in this state. After all, why should 
unscrupulous employers enjoy the fruits of illegal labor, at the expense of 
every other Californian?

 When Bob Weiss was hired to coach the Clippers last summer, he didn't 
anticipate that the job would be such a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 But this has been Weiss' biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried mini-camps, meetings and motivational speeches, but nothing has 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been much more difficult than I thought to get this team where I want," 
Weiss said. "It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplished amateur magician, Weiss can't seem to find the right trick to 
help the Clippers end a losing streak that reached six games with a 98-77 loss 
to the New York Knicks before a sellout crowd of 19,763 at Madison Square 
Garden on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers shot a season-low 38.3%, including 23.9% in the second half, and 
scored a season-low 77 points, including a season-low 33 points in the second 
half, and lost for the 10th time in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not playing real well right now, for who knows what reason," Weiss 
said. "We're just having trouble shaking out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper center Elmore Spencer, who had played well against top centers such as 
Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal, couldn't contain Knick center Patrick Ewing, who 
scored 31 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and blocked a season-high six shots. It 
was the third game in a row that Ewing has scored 30 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was vintage Patrick," said Clipper guard Mark Jackson, who spent the first 
five seasons of his NBA career in New York before he was traded to the Clippers 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing, who had 20 points in the first half, doesn't believe that he is playing 
well because he is missing too many easy shots. He made 13 of 25 shots against 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still missing easy shots, but now in the last three games, I'm just 
playing my game, not the way people want me to play," Ewing said. "I'm just 
playing the way Patrick Ewing knows how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks (22-9) embarrassed the Clippers on the boards, out-rebounding them 
by 56-39 en route to their fourth victory in their last five games. Knick 
forward Charles Oakley, who had averaged 12.5 rebounds in his last 10 games, 
had a team-high 15. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing tenacious defense in the first half as the Knicks shot only 
34.7%, the Clippers broke down defensively in the second half. The Knicks shot 
51.3% in the second half and outscored the Clippers by 54-33. 
</P>
<P>
 After the score was tied at halftime, 44-44, the Knicks blitzed the Clippers 
by 21-9 in the first eight minutes of the third quarter to take command. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason in the third quarter, (the Clippers) changed their attitude 
about how they were going to go about the game defensively," Knick Coach Pat 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guards Ron Harper and Jackson, who have been inconsistent this season, 
played poorly against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper missed seven of nine shots and scored seven points and Jackson missed 
four of five shots and scored three points. It was Jackson's second-lowest 
point total of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who is rarely at a loss for words, wouldn't talk after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't got no quote, man," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnovers and poor free-throw shooting, which have plagued the Clippers all 
season, continued to bother them in the opener of a six-game East Coast trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who are averaging a league-high 19 turnovers, had 24 to set up 
17 points for the Knicks. The Clippers made only 67% of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A flight attendant from Memphis, Tenn., said she plans to file a $6-million 
paternity suit against Clipper guard Ron Harper in Los Angeles Superior Court 
Friday. Michella Davis, who said she has known Harper for three years, alleges 
that Harper fathered her nine-month-old daughter, Pagge. "He's seen the child. 
He knows she's his daughter," Davis said. "She's his twin. She looks just like 
him. But he's cheap. He doesn't want to pay anything." Douglas Davis, the 
attorney for Davis, said he plans to ask for $4 million in support for the 
child and $2 million in emotional distress that his client has allegedly 
suffered. Harper declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie forward Harold Ellis and Knick forward Eric Anderson each drew 
technical fouls for a shoving match with 1:07 remaining. After being shoved by 
Anderson underneath the Clipper basket, Ellis delivered a forearm shiver to 
Anderson's head at the other end of the court.

LAKERS A LITTLE SHORT AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: VAN EXEL'S FIVE THREE-POINTERS NOT 
ENOUGH IN 122-117 LOSS TO WARRIORS. PFUND RETURNS, BUT CHRISTIE IS OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel scored 28 points and tied a Laker regular-season record by 
making five three-pointers, but that still wasn't enough Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers fell to the Golden State Warriors, who got 29 points from Latrell 
Sprewell in a 122-117 victory at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel is shooting only 39.9% overall, but he has made 12 of 21 
three-pointers the last five games. The five against the Warriors tied a record 
held by Magic Johnson, Michael Cooper, Byron Scott and Doug Christie. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive game, the Lakers (11-23) overcame a big deficit to 
make a game out of a potential rout, only to fall in the end. The comeback this 
time, from a 15-point hole, lasted until early in the fourth quarter, when 
Golden State took control for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors' lead was up to as many as 16 points, 106-90, with 6:30 
remaining. The Lakers made one final push, but could get no closer than five 
points. The final margin came thanks to a three-pointer by Tony Smith, the last 
of his career-high 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Randy Pfund returned from his one-game suspension for bumping an 
official to the news that the Lakers would be without Christie for at least a 
week and maybe longer, despite X-rays taken earlier Tuesday that confirmed the 
starting small forward suffered nothing worse than a sprain the day before in 
practice. Christie was reduced to a slow walk before the game, accompanied by a 
strong limp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think from the way he went down, we're looking at a couple weeks," 
the coach said. "That's my Dr. Pfund estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, the same one that sidelined Christie for much of training camp, 
cost the Lakers their leading scorer and third-leading rebounder, discounting 
Sam Bowie, who is already on the injured list. It also gave rookie George Lynch 
his first NBA start, coming after back-to-back solid showings off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the Lakers, in spite of the injuries to Christie and the 
strained hip muscle that kept Antonio Harvey out of action, was that they 
couldn't go anywhere but up after scoring a team record-low 25 points in the 
first half Sunday. So they scored 24 in the opening quarter against the 
Warriors . . . and trailed by 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit reached 15, 46-31, before the Lakers, and Van Exel in particular, 
clocked in. A 14-2 rally, with Van Exel contributing a pair of three-point 
jumpers and eight points in all during the stretch, brought the Lakers within 
48-45. 
</P>
<P>
 When Van Exel made another three-pointer, part of his 15 points in the second 
quarter, the Lakers closed within 51-50. Finally, Elden Campbell's free throw 
with 1:10 left before intermission got them even again, for the first time 
since 14-14. From there, the teams traded baskets before Van Exel converted two 
more from the line for a 62-60 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 With Anthony Peeler scoring 17 of his points by the break, the starting 
backcourt combined for 32 of the Lakers' 62 points. Smith had eight more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, looking for their third victory of the season against the Lakers 
in as many tries after losing four of five in 1992-93, started to pull away 
again in the third quarter, building an 82-74 lead. It was 89-80 heading into 
the fourth, by which time Sprewell had 27 points.

KINGS TAKE BEST SHOTS, STILL GET TIED; HOCKEY: L.A. OUTSHOOTS SAN JOSE, 39-10, 
BREAKING A RECORD FOR FEWEST SHOTS BY AN OPPONENT, BUT SHARKS FORCE 2-2 
DEADLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three shots in the first period and four more in the second made the Sharks 
look harmless, almost non-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Kings, long accustomed to shooting-gallery nights of 
40-something shots on goal, were almost lulled into complacency in their first 
appearance at the San Jose Arena Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a very strange night when you outshoot a team, 39-10, and come away with 
a 2-2 tie, which startled the Kings and delighted the sellout crowd of 17,190. 
The previous record for fewest shots against the Kings was 12 by the Atlanta 
Flames on Oct. 28, 1976 and the Kings won it, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 10-shooter," King Coach Barry Melrose said, shaking his head. "We played 
very hard and very smart. They (the Sharks) thrive on mistakes when you don't 
keep the puck deep. But we haven't lost on the road in five games (4-0-1) and 
it's something to build upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very hard game for a goaltender to play. Their forwards lull you to 
sleep. They don't forecheck and rely on their goaltender." 
</P>
<P>
 Said King goaltender Kelly Hrudey: "It wasn't that hard to stay in the game. 
We played well. I thought it would be a matter of time before we scored on 
(Arturs) Irbe." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Sharks (12-21-10), the 10 shots is a club record for fewest shots on 
goal. Twice before they had 13 shots on goal, most recently on Nov. 20 in a 3-2 
victory against Hartford.  
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Kings (16-21-4) are happy if they give up 10 shots in a 
period. The previous low for shots against this season was 21 by the Canucks on 
Nov. 10. The Kings lost that game, 4-0, in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Jose made the most of its limited opportunities, scoring two 
power-play goals after trailing, 2-0, on first-period goals by Tomas Sandstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Gaudreau scored on San Jose's third shot, at 18:39 of the first. Shark 
defenseman Tom Pederson hit Gaudreau in the slot with a pass. His shot was 
going wide, but it bounced in off defenseman Rob Blake's foot, surprising 
Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for Kelly," Blake said. "When it is 2-2 and one goes off your 
skate, if it doesn't happen, we win. Those things do turn games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also got help. On Sandstrom's second goal at 16:23 of the first 
period, Sandstrom, deep in the right corner behind the goal line, threw a 
harmless-looking backhander at Irbe, but the shot went off Doug Zmolek's skate 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Sandstrom converted a two-on-one with a pass from Wayne Gretzky. With 
the assist, Gretzky has 71 points, taking the sole lead of the NHL's scoring 
race. Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, held pointless on Monday in Anaheim, has 70 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Securing the rights of a Russian player is not as simple as it may seem. 
Tuesday, the Sharks reached an agreement with Dynamo Moscow to purchase the 
rights of forward Viktor Kozlov for $400,000. Kozlov was the Sharks' first 
draft choice (sixth overall) in June. Dean Lombardi, Shark vice president, had 
been negotiating with Alexander Steblin, the president of Dynamo Moscow. But 
the Sharks still have to negotiate with Kozlov's agent before he plays in the 
NHL. Lombardi said he has made a four-year offer to Kozlov -- $2.4 million, 
plus a $500,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 King goaltender Kelly Hrudey appeared in his 500th NHL game. This is his 11th 
season and sixth with the Kings. . . . . The Kings' scratches were defenseman 
Brent Thompson and forward John Druce. Right wing Dave Taylor (concussion) 
remained home in Los Angeles.

NHL ROUNDUP; PENGUINS PILE UP OVERTIME

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Stevens scored his third goal of the game with 51 seconds left in 
overtime to lift the Pittsburgh Penguins, 5-4, over the Boston Bruins at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins are 4-0-9 in overtime this year and lead the NHL in overtime 
games and points. They have played three consecutive overtime games, winning 
two and tying one. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens' power-play goal capped Pittsburgh's first hat trick of the season. 
The Penguins won despite being outshot, 46-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens scored the game's first goal at 4:30 of the first period and scored 
again at 1:29 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens has 26 goals this season. He has scored at least 25 for four 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 5, Chicago 2 -- Rookie Derek Plante scored one goal and set up two 
others to lead the Sabres over the Blackhawks at Chicago, giving the Blackhawks 
their fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Plante's 15th goal of the season came 2:45 into the game. He assisted on goals 
by Brad May at 10:45 of the first period and Don Audette only 42 seconds into 
the second period for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabre goalie Dominik Hasek made 24 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 1, Quebec 0 -- Robert Reichel scored the game's only goal midway 
through the second period, and Andrei Trefilov recorded his first NHL shutout, 
leading the Flames at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov stopped 19 shots in his fourth career start. 
</P>
<P>
 With Quebec's Mike Ricci in the penalty box, Reichel converted a pass from Wes 
Walz and beat goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec lost its fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 2, Washington 1 -- Doug Gilmour scored his 14th goal of the season 
with 50 seconds left to play, lifting the Maple Leafs at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour managed to push the rebound of Bill Berg's shot past goalie Don 
Beaupre, giving Toronto its fourth consecutive victory. The goal also ended 
Beaupre's nine-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Andreychuk scored his league-leading 35th goal for Toronto, which has 
lost only once in its last six games. Calle Johansson scored for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, Ottawa 1 -- Andre Faust scored the go-ahead goal with 5:06 
left, sending the Flyers past the struggling Senators at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa lost one day after ending its nine-game losing streak with a tie 
against the New York Islanders. Philadelphia won for only the second time in 
seven home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust, called up earlier in the day from Hershey of the American Hockey 
League, scored on a shot from the top of the right faceoff circle that got 
through a screen and goalie Craig Billington. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 5, Edmonton 2 -- Ulf Dahlen scored twice and led a second-period flurry 
that sent the Stars past the Oilers at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Evason had a goal and an assist for Dallas. He scored on a power play at 
10:02 of the second period, giving the Stars a 2-1 lead and starting a string 
of four consecutive goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlen, Mike Craig and Mike McPhee also scored in the second period.

 Kristen Talbot, a longshot medal hopeful at next month's Lillehammer Olympics, 
underwent a 40-minute operation to donate bone marrow to save her brother's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Jones, who performed the bone marrow transplant at Baltimore's 
Johns Hopkins Hospital, said donating marrow may slow an athlete whose success 
hinges on fractions of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 The one pint of marrow taken from Talbot was about 2% of the marrow in her 
bones, equivalent to the amount of blood taken during routine donations, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the two-time Olympian's blood count should return to normal within 
several days, but she will be "somewhat anemic" in terms of health standards 
for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very certain she'll be able to compete," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot was the fourth and final qualifier for the 500 meters in the Olympic 
speedskating trials last Saturday at Milwaukee.

PREP WRESTLING; EHLERT SAVES TIE FOR IRVINE WITH HIS QUICK PIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The bronze shoe wasn't the priority. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-way wrestling meet at University High Tuesday, the much-anticipated 
match-up between fifth-ranked Irvine and unranked University didn't disappoint, 
although it did leave several questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake was the lead in the Sea View League race and the city championship , 
with the impressive trophy -- topped by a shoe that once belonged to wrestling 
great Dan Gable -- that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the heavyweight class, it looked as though University might wrestle 
the Dan Gable Olympic Champion Award away from Irvine for the first time in the 
15-year history of the city championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Irvine's Scott Ehlert pinned Ray Davis at 57 seconds, it evened the 
score, and Irvine had escaped with a 27-27 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got some breaks, they got some breaks," University Coach Steve Stewart 
said. "Everyone else in Orange County might be surprised, but we knew if we 
could get everyone out on the mat together, we'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were more than OK, they almost won. 
</P>
<P>
 At 172, University's Andrew Siberfarb fell behind, 8-2, before he reversed his 
fortune and pinned Scott Kennifer at 5:22 and gave the Trojans a 27-18 lead 
with two weight classes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 At 189, the Vaqueros' Chris Kiyan beat Bobby Omid, 5-4, to pull Irvine to 
27-21, and it was left to the heavyweights -- Irvine needed a pin for a tie -- 
to decide the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehlert, who outweighed Davis by 60 pounds, went about his business like 
clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't scared about him getting points," he said. "I needed the pin." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth time in his three seasons on the varsity that Ehlert's 
result has determined Irvine's fate and all four times, he has won by a pin. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 10-2-1, 3-0-1 and University was 12-1-1, 3-0-1.

ST. MARY'S SWEEPS PAST CS NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge arrived conveniently for St. Mary's and Coach Ernie Kent, 
losers of three straight and facing a West Coast Conference basketball opener 
Friday at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kent, who is black, spent Tuesday afternoon avoiding questions about 
whether he would support the Black Coaches Assn. boycott on Saturday, his Gaels 
went out and gave him an unofficial night off, blowing out Northridge, 93-66, 
in a nonconference game before 1,576 at McKeon Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's is scheduled to play at defending conference champion Pepperdine on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say what I'm going to do," Kent said afterward, "without knowing all 
the details. The timing of it has us all scattered." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's forged a 36-29 lead at the half and made short work of the Matadors 
(3-11) thereafter. The Gaels scored 15 unanswered points to open the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Rollins led St. Mary's (7-4) with 24 points, including 18 in 13 minutes 
in the first half. Rollins, a 6-6 sophomore, scored 12 points in the game's 
first six minutes as the Gaels raced out to a 16-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge played without forward Chris Yard, its top scorer and rebounder. 
Yard has an injured right knee. Guard Brooklyn McLinn paced the Matadors with a 
career-high 24 points. MIKE HISERMAN

BIG WEST; UC IRVINE LOSES TO UNLV AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mighty had fallen -- flat on their faces if you ask the former Nevada Las 
Vegas faithful who have taken to booing their once-beloved basketball team at 
home -- but there's nothing like agame against UC Irvine to raise the spirits 
of the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas, a team that scored the fewest points in school history nine days 
ago in a 59-39 loss to Virginia, made it 10 in a row over the Anteaters on 
Tuesday night with a 101-79 Big West victory before 3,115 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Manuel finished with a career-high 39 points, making six of 11 
three-pointers. Guard Chris Brown, with a meaningless, late three-point 
barrage, led Irvine (4-6 overall and 1-1 in conference) with 19 points. But the 
Rebels (6-4, 2-0) dominated in nearly every phase of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine point guard Lloyd Mumford, who sat out Saturday's loss to Cal State 
Northridge because of an ankle injury, went down hard on a layup attempt early 
in the first half and was taken to UCI Medical Center for treatment of a cut 
left eyelid. Then forward Jermaine Avie ended up face down on the bench seats 
under the southern basket and left the game because of a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine missed its first nine shots as the Rebels took a 11-3 lead, but the 
Anteaters went on a 22-4 run that put them ahead, 25-15, with 10:56 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine student section was mocking Las Vegas' troubles with the NCAA by 
chanting, "pro-bation, pro-bation" at the Rebel bench, but it was their last 
hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters went 8 1/2 minutes without a field goal and were outscored, 
36-5, in the final 10:44 of the first half. Irvine shot 30% from the field in 
the first half. Las Vegas shot only 47%, but the Rebels were 55% from 
three-point range, thanks mostly to Manuel. Manuel had 28 points by halftime.

times this decade, came storming into town at a very convenient time -- just in 
time for St. Mary's to blow out the Matadors, 93-66. 
</P>
<P>
 With three losses in a row, St. Mary's was staggering with its West Coast 
Conference opener at Loyola Marymount on Friday night looming ominously on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate matters for St. Mary's Coach Ernie Kent, leaders of a black 
basketball coaches association were calling for a national boycott Saturday, 
the day the Gaels are set to face Pepperdine, the defending conference 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent, who is black, spent Tuesday afternoon avoiding questions from reporters 
wondering if he would support the boycott. Then his team went out and gave him 
an unofficial night off, routing Northridge before a crowd of 1,576 at McKeon 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say what I'm going to do without knowing all the details," Kent said 
afterward. "The timing of it has us all scattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge can relate. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's hounding defense and athletic post players had Northridge (3-11) 
seeking cover. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Rollins produced much of the destruction, scoring 24 points in 19 
minutes, all on layups, dunks and free throws. The 6-foot-6 forward had 18 
points in 13 minutes during the first half, including 12 in the first six 
minutes as the Gaels raced to a 16-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rollins is a far better athlete than anybody we have on the front line," 
Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly better than anyone the Matadors had healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Yard, Northridge's top scorer and rebounder, did not make the trip. He 
was home, nursing an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely missed Chris," said Peter Micelli, who normally plays the post 
alongside Yard. "But to tell you the truth I think we just got out-hustled." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli might well have been speaking from personal experience. The 6-8 junior 
managed to play 19 minutes without grabbing a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly the Northridge big men got beat at a running game. The Gaels simply 
beat them down the floor, time and time again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big men did not run the floor," Cassidy said, "and when they did they 
allowed themselves to get posted up." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's scored 36 points in the first half -- all but two on layups, dunks, 
put-backs and free throws. The other basket was a 10-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "And after all that we were only down by seven," said Brooklyn McLinn, who 
scored a career-high 24 points for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't stay that close for long. The Gaels (7-4) scored 15 unanswered 
points at the start of the second half, opening a 51-29 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than six minutes into the half, Cassidy had every Matador starter seated 
on the bench. Northridge's lineup included freshman forward Tom Samson, 
swingman Brent Lofton, and three guards -- Robert Hill, Ryan Martin and Ozan 
Korkut, an exchange student from Turkey who had played two minutes all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his mass substitution signified a white flag, Cassidy fairly 
bristled, saying he was merely attempting to "shake people up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get something going," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Korkut competed admirably, scoring five points in 12 minutes while grabbing as 
many rebounds as Micelli. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ozan did a pretty good job in many ways," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rest of the crew . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We were out-manned, but mainly we were out-worked," McLinn said. "They 
outhustled us, and when we let them out on the break like they were it was a 
dunk show. They made it seem like they were playing on a junior high court." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, against a junior high team. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge committed 22 turnovers, including four in 19 minutes by point guard 
Andre Chevalier, who is playing with a broken right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really can't do the things he's usually able to do," McLinn said of his 
backcourt mate. "Even on defense, he can't swat at the ball or be as aggressive 
as he usually is because he might hurt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier's number of minutes was a season-low, and watching from the bench 
could not have been much less painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was out-rebounded by the Gaels, 42-31, and out-shot, 53% to 35%.

VENTURA SETS RECORD WITH WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't spoken about openly, but the thoughts were vivid. The Ventura 
College men's basketball team wanted to beat Santa Monica more than anything. 
It was a burden the Pirates had carried for a year, one they wanted to unload. 
</P>
<P>
 And that they did Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, the state's top-ranked team, defeated Santa Monica, 82-73,in a 
Western State Conference interdivisional game before about 3,000 at Ventura to 
set a school record with 22 consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (22-1, 4-0 in conference play) hasn't lost since Kings River pulled an 
upset with a 63-61 overtime win in the season opener Nov. 12. The Pirates have 
won 54 of their last 58 games going back to the semifinals of the 1990-91 state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was especially meaningful because Santa Monica (13-6, 3-1) snapped 
Ventura's 21-game winning streak last season with an 87-80 victory at Santa 
Monica on Jan. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant a lot to the players to beat Santa Monica," Ventura Coach Philip 
Mathews said. "The kids were (looking forward to) Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, it seemed they might have been looking too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura jumped to a 15-9 lead with 13 minutes 43 seconds remaining in the 
first half on a jumper by Tracy Lundy, his only points of the night. But the 
Corsairs rallied behind forward James Gray for a 40-36 advantage at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, a smooth shooter with a fine three-point shot, scored 17 of his 
team-high 28 points in the half. He made seven of nine shots in the period, 
including a three-pointer and a dunk that gave Santa Monica the four-point 
halftime cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura regained the lead, 43-42, less than two minutes into the second half 
with a 7-2 run to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs stormed back with eight unanswered points, the last six on two 
three-point baskets by Gray, to take a 55-51 cushion before forward Brandon 
Jessie cut the deficit to two points, 55-53, with a short jumper at the 12:45 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie once again carried the scoring and rebounding load for the Pirates. He 
finished with a game-high 29 points and 15 rebounds, and also had three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, one of two returning starters, remembered well the loss at Santa 
Monica last January and didn't want history to repeat. The Pirates lost only 
one other game, to Columbia in the state championship game to finish 32-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want it to happen again," said Jessie, son of former Ram wide 
receiver Ron Jessie. "We want to go undefeated the rest of the season. I think 
we can do it if we play our game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates definitely did that in the waning moments of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a precarious 76-73 lead with 55 seconds to play, guard D'Mitri Rideout 
(12 points) made a free throw to give Ventura a four-point lead. After Gray 
missed two free throws with 29 seconds to play, Jessie made the first of two 
free throws. Center Michael Tate tipped in the second one for an 80-73 lead 
with 26 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie then dunked with 13 seconds to play for the final points. 
</P>
<P>
 All five Ventura starters scored in double figures, with point guard Joey 
Ramirez contributing 13, Rideout 12 and forward Steve Amar 13. Tate, who 
returned after a month layoff because of a stress fracture of the right ankle, 
had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy, despite scoring only the two points, did a superb job guarding Gray in 
the second half.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: ANOTHER AMOS IS FAMOUS ON RANCHO 
SANTIAGO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, Sean Amos of Rancho Santiago College has found ways to score 
against a taller player with nothing more on the line than family bragging 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos, 6 feet 4, has always been shorter than older brother, Fred, a 6-9 
forward currently playing at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had plenty of practice against bigger guys," Sean said. "Fred is an 
exceptional shot-blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred played two seasons at Rancho Santiago starting in 1991-92 and is the 
college's all-time shot-blocker with 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean, using the basic moves he learned on the family driveway, has become a 
scoring and rebounding force for the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos, often matched against players at least two inches taller, is averaging a 
team-high 23 points and eight rebounds through 19 games. He is shooting 63%, 
second best in the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea at the beginning of the year that I would score this many 
points," Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos came to Rancho Santiago from Foothill High School in the fall of 1991 but 
decided to sit out the season. "My skills just weren't up to par," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos spent his time working out with the team and attending to his studies. He 
has a 3.8 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season he started slowly but became more impressive as the season went 
along. He averaged six points and four rebounds coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Amos spent the summer increasing his upper-body strength, a key to his inside 
success, by doing push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sean has just done an excellent job for us," Rancho Santiago Coach Dana 
Pagett said. "He has really shown some good leadership capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago was expected to finish in the bottom half of the conference, 
but the Dons (14-5, 2-0) have been impressive.  
</P>
<P>
 Amos is a big part of Rancho Santiago's success, but he repeatedly pointed out 
that the hard work of his teammates and work ethic he learned from his brother 
and Pagett are reasons for how well things are going. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to get some interest (from four-year colleges)," said Amos, 19. 
"But I just might (only) go to school. I'm keeping my options open. I'm a 
student first. That's another thing I learned at Rancho Santiago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cards: Corie Blount and Eric Pauley, both former Orange County 
standouts, are featured on trading cards this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Blount, who played on Rancho Santiago's 1989-90 and 1990-91 State championship 
teams before moving on to Cincinnati, was a first-round pick of the Chicago 
Bulls. He is Card No. 159 in the Topps Stadium Club set. 
</P>
<P>
 Blount, a forward/center, started the week averaging 11 minutes and three 
points for the Bulls, the three-time defending NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauley, a forward, helped Cypress to the Orange Empire Conference title in 
1989-90 and a berth in the State tournament in 1990-91 He went to Kansas where 
he started for most of two seasons. He is Card No. 50 in the Classic four-sport 
collection series. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauley had a tryout with Milwaukee but was cut. He is currently playing 
professionally in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Prine, a freshman defender from Cypress College, was the only Southern 
California player to be selected first-team All-American by the National Soccer 
Coaches Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Prine, from Troy High School, also was the Orange Empire Conference's player 
of the year. She had nine goals and six assists for Cypress, which went 20-1. 
The Chargers' only loss was to De Anza in the State championship in a shootout. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley (14-6, 2-0) and Riverside (16-4, 2-0), two of the hotter men's 
basketball teams in the Orange Empire Conference, meet at 7 p.m. today at 
Riverside. Irvine Valley comes in with a four-game winning streak and has won 
10 of the last 12. Riverside has won eight in a row and 14 of 16. A little 
closer to home, Saddleback (11-6, 1-1) plays host to Rancho Santiago today in 
the Gauchos' first home conference game. . . . Todd Loewe, a sophomore guard at 
OCC, had two three-pointers last week, moving him into first place on the 
college's all-time list.

AILIN' REBELS GET BETTER AGAINST UC IRVINE; BASKETBALL: UNLV'S 101-79 ROUT IS 
TEAM'S 10TH CONSECUTIVE VICTORY OVER THE ANTEATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The mighty may have fallen -- flat on their faces if you ask the former Nevada 
Las Vegas faithful who have taken to booing their once-beloved basketball team 
at home -- but there's nothing like a game against UC Irvine to raise the 
Rebels' spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas, a team that scored the fewest points in school history nine days 
ago during a 59-39 loss to Virginia, made it 10 in a row over the Anteaters 
Tuesday night, putting the Runnin' back in Rebels with a 101-79 Big West 
victory in front of 3,115 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was our best effort this year," Las Vegas Coach Rollie Massimino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was certainly Reggie Manuel's best effort. Manuel, who had scored a career 
high by halftime, finished with 39 points, hitting on 15 of 21 from the field, 
including six of 11 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie played extremely well, on both ends of the court," Massimino said. "He 
shot well, of course, but he also did a very good job on (Irvine guard Chris) 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, with a late, garbage-time three-point barrage, led Irvine (4-6, 1-1 in 
conference) with 19 points. But the Rebels (6-4, 2-0) dominated in nearly every 
phase of the game. They shot 49% from the field, 56% from three-point range and 
71% from the free-throw line. Irvine hit 40% of its shots from the floor, 41% 
of its three-pointers and 62% of its free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a difficult time believing that we would get 35 points less than that 
team," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. "Of course, I saw it, but we committed a 
lot of turnovers we didn't need to make." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels led by 21 points at halftime and were leaving the Anteaters in 
their wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Lloyd Mumford, who missed Saturday's loss to Cal State Northridge 
because of an ankle injury, went down hard on a layup attempt early in the 
first half and was taken to UCI Medical Center with a laceration of the left 
eyelid. Then forward Jermaine Avie ended up face down on the bench seats under 
the southern basket and left the game with a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're concerned that there's some bleeding in Lloyd's eye so they're 
keeping him there for observation," Baker said after talking to team physician 
Dr. Carlos Prieto. "When things are going good, Lloyd's in the picture, but 
when things are going bad, that's when we really need him." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater fans had a few moments of fun early in the first half, when the teams 
took turns looking unbeatable and then horribly inept. Irvine missed its first 
nine shots as the Rebels ran out to a 11-3 lead, but the Anteaters found the 
range and got some fortunate bounces in a 22-4 run that put them ahead, 25-15, 
with 10:56 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine student section was mocking Las Vegas' troubles with the NCAA by 
chanting, "pro-bation, pro-bation" at the Rebel bench, but it was the last 
hurrah. And a fleeting one at that. Manuel, who had 28 points by halftime, 
swished home a pair of three-pointers within 35 seconds and Irvine's lead was 
down to six. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just the beginning of the end. The Anteaters went 8 1/2 minutes without 
a field goal and were outscored, 36-5, in the final 10:44 of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second half, as the Rebels continued to pull away, it became more 
than Baker could bear and with 14:49 left in the game, he erupted when LaDay 
Smith was called for throwing an elbow. Baker got a technical -- and his 
money's worth during a minute-long arm-waving, screaming tantrum -- but Manuel 
made both free throws and the Rebels were coasting, 63-40. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we started the game playing pretty good," Baker said. "We didn't 
make the shots early, but we were getting the shots we wanted. Then we sort of 
got control of the game, but their pride or whatever seemed to take over and 
they really tightened it up and we just didn't respond very well."

ALEMANY SHRUGS OFF ROAD DISADVANTAGE, BLITZES RIVAL ST. BERNARD, 57-37 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's rare indeed when a basketball team swaggers into the gym of its chief 
rival -- ranked among the top teams in California and possessing two players 
who have already signed with Pacific 10 Conference schools -- and dispatches 
that team by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday was such a night for the Alemany High girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving notice to the rest of the state that they, too, are a force to be 
feared, the Indians blew past seventh-ranked St. Bernard, 57-37, in a Mission 
League game at St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed that we're a lot more experienced this year than last year," 
Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. "Last year they beat us twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany, ranked sixth in California by Cal-Hi sports, improved to 15-0, 3-0 in 
league play, thanks primarily to a strong effort by post players Zevette 
Mitchell and Carly Funicello.  
</P>
<P>
 The duo combined for 22 points in the first half and badly outplayed St. 
Bernard's heralded 6-foot-4 senior tandem of Olympia Scott and Marte Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who has signed with Stanford, and Alexander, committed to by Arizona, 
did not score in the first quarter and combined for only 14 points the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, Alemany's 6-foot senior forward, outscored them by herself, 
finishing with 18 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zevette stepped up and had the best game of her life," Hearlihy said. "We 
needed to have a big day inside and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mitchell: "Last year I was intimidated against St. Bernard. Tonight I 
felt confident shooting-wise. Everything was pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello, a 6-foot-3 sophomore center, had 10 points in the first half, and 
finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and two blocked shots before fouling 
out in the fourth quarter.

ISKANDER MUFFLES THE TOP GUN AS GLENDALE DRAWS AWAY, 63-49; HIGH SCHOOL

 The prospect of guarding the opposition's best scorer every game would 
probably be enough to give Glendale High senior Tamer Iskander nightmares. If 
he weren't getting so darned used to it, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the nightmares for his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Iskander held Pasadena's Donald Guyton -- considered by some the best player 
in the league -- to six points Tuesday, keying the Dynamiters' 63-49 Pacific 
League victory -- their first at Pasadena since 1988.

 "Everybody said, 'You've got to cover Guyton. You've got to cover Guyton,' so 
that's all I was thinking about," Iskander said. "Coach (Bob Davidson) told me 
he was going to put me on the shooters this season and just to not let them 
shoot. So I didn't let them shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Like an annoying fly that you can't kill no matter how much you swat, Iskander 
was all over Guyton, who came into the game leading Pasadena in scoring with an 
average of 20.1 points. He was held scoreless for the first 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his three baskets, two came well after the game was decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly were very conscious of him," Pasadena Coach Bill Duwe said of 
Guyton. "Every time he went somewhere, someone was already there. Obviously 
he's a marked player, but he's been facing that all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Iskander scored only three points, but he added eight assists when unstuck 
from Guyton. 
</P>
<P>
 When Guyton managed to shake Iskander loose, there was 6-foot-3 junior James 
Fuller, who played strong defense inside along with scoring 15 points and 
grabbing eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Jose led the Dynamiters (14-4, 2-0 ion league play) with 18 points, 
including four of six three-point shots. Jose made two of his three-pointers 
during a critical stretch late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena (11-7, 1-1), which trailed throughout, pulled to within 36-34 on a 
three-point shot by Josh Sadler, but Jose countered with one of his own, 
launching a 20-6 Glendale run that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always shoot better when we start to get our confidence," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duwe, whose team was a slight favorite for the league title as the season 
began, said that stretch was where the Bulldogs lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were right there, then something happened to our basket and we couldn't 
put a ball in the ocean," he said. "Every kid (on Glendale) shoots the ball 
really well. We'd make a three, then they'd come back with a three." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has opened the league schedule with victories against Crescenta 
Valley and Pasadena, teams that swept the Dynamiters last season. They will 
play Muir, the only other serious competitor for the Pacific title, on Friday 
night at Glendale.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; UC SAN DIEGO HITS CHAPMAN HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman learned about humility Tuesday night when the Panthers were soundly 
defeated by UC San Diego, 77-61, in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Panthers (8-5) had defeated the Tritons earlier in the season, 
81-68, in the Redlands Tournament, UC San Diego (12-3), winners of 10 of its 
last 11 games, quickly took control.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were magnificent," Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky said of the Tritons. "They 
were really ready to play. They came out and controlled the tempo. They took a 
10-point lead early and we never recovered. They kept their poise, the sign of 
a real good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman shot only .339 from the field, falling behind, 25-12, on Rodney 
Lusain's three-point basket at 12:02 of the first half. With Lusain hitting 18 
of his game-high 20 points in the first half from the outside, and freshman 
center Matt Aune muscling his way inside with 18 points, the Panthers could do 
little to counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons took a 44-28 halftime lead on Aune's last-second basket. Chapman 
made a five-point run at the start of the second half, but UC San Diego went on 
an 11-3 run, led by Aune, for a 55-36 lead with 14:01 left to play. The 
Panthers went six minutes without scoring during the spell and never got closer 
than 14 points with 1:29 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Mumaw led Chapman with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Golden State Athletic Conference men's game: 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia 77, Fresno Pacific 68 -- Craig Martin had 19 points and eight 
rebounds, Timothy Morris added 13 points and Vujadin Jovic had 10 points and 
eight rebounds to lead Concordia (11-5, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference women's play: 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno Pacific 75, Concordia 69 -- Gitte Mejer made 12 of 16 shots and 
finished with 26 points for visiting Concordia in the conference opener for 
both teams. Julie Workman added 24 points for Concordia. Fresno Pacific (9-5, 
1-0) made 20 of 30 free throws and Concordia was six of six. Concordia was 
called for 23 fouls and Fresno Pacific had 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 71, Azusa Pacific 48 -- Tina Demarsh scored 17 
points and had eight assists for SCC (13-3, 1-0). Jamie Zitterkopf added 14 
points and 17 rebounds. TOM BIRSCHBACH

THEATER REVIEWS; AN ILLUMINATING 'SHADOW BOX'; BOLSTERED BY SENSITIVE, HONEST 
ACTING, THE PLAY SAYS A LOT ABOUT THOSE FINAL DAYS BEFORE ONE SUCCUMBS TO 
TERMINAL ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a time when terminal disease seems about to touch every area of American 
life, Michael Cristofer's "The Shadow Box" is as relevant as when it was 
written a quarter-century ago. Cristofer never mentions the illnesses that are 
about to take their toll on his three protagonists, and that makes his play's 
effect even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is bolstered by some sensitive, well-defined and honest 
performances in director Chuck Ketter's incisive, moody staging at the Vanguard 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketter takes Cristofer's ingredients -- three terminal patients who are stable 
enough to live in cottages on the grounds of the hospital, but who are too far 
gone to leave completely -- and balances their varied reactions to their 
situation with those of their families, who have come to share their final 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Each patient is interviewed periodically by a staff member on a closed-circuit 
television setup. Ketter has chosen to have the Interviewer (Dina Bartello) 
appear onstage, a valid choice considering Bartello's telling performance -- 
clinical and cool with just a hint of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 But considering Ketter's nice use of TV monitors, a disembodied voice would 
have been more effective, as it is in some productions of the play, giving an 
even more profound sense of the patients' isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard's small performing area is well-suited to the action, with three 
pedestals on which the patients stand, like witnesses at a trial, during their 
conversations with the Interviewer, each facing a monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 At center, like an island in an unfriendly sea, is the cottage sitting room of 
Brian. Ketter moves his cast like passing filmic images across this simple, 
sparse set in a choreography of despair and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 But all is not dark in Cristofer's microcosmic society. There is humor enough 
to balance the weight of what the playwright is saying about holding on or 
letting go, about what should be finished, tied together, resolved before the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Knapp is crisp and buoyant as Brian, who makes a game of placing his 
life in cubbyholes before it's too late. There is a sort of poetry in the 
performance of Becky Saunders as his free-wheeling ex-wife, a born bohemian who 
has taken the pose too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's family is rounded out by Mark, a gay hustler who has found a sort of 
twisted salvation in his relationship with Brian. Mark is given a tight-wound 
portrait by James Cude. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Goldberg's warm, almost cuddly Joe, a blue-collar type who has never given 
himself a chance to succeed, is a perfect match for the finely delineated 
performance of Brenda Parks as his wife Maggie, who is desperately disturbed by 
the emptiness Joe's illness has forced on her. As their teen-aged son, Steven, 
Ed Trevino is as self-involved as he should be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real heartbreak in this production is the little charades played out by 
Sue Ozeran as Felicity, who has been hanging on until her daughter Clare 
returns, and Laurel Kelsh as her other daughter Agnes, who writes Clare's 
letters so mama won't remember that Clare has been dead for years. These two 
performances are outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The staging is rewarding in its inner depth, especially in the complicated 
chiaroscuro of D. Silvio Volonte's lighting design, which becomes as much of a 
character as any of the others.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'BAD SEED' TELLS ITS SECRETS EARLY; A GENERALLY CAPABLE CAST 
PLAYS OUT THE HORRORS OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD MURDERER IN THIS BANG-UP STORY. PROBLEM 
IS, MOST OF THE CHARACTERS KNOW TOO MUCH TOO SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Maxwell Anderson's "The Bad Seed" was first staged in 1954, its tale of a 
cold-blooded 8-year-old murderer was considered a horror story. Today it would 
take its place beside too many similar stories to give it much shock value. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Anderson's parable about the bad seed of complacent slaughter 
reappearing in the second generation down the line was scientifically behind 
the times. That doesn't matter. It's still a bang-up story, and its O. Henry 
twist at the end can still elicit a grim, ironic smile. 
</P>
<P>
 The production at Cabrillo Playhouse is true to its time, and director Sandy 
Silver for the most part keeps it moving at the right speed. What she hasn't 
done is re-create the eerie suspense that Anderson carefully builds. Most of 
the problem, in a script that telegraphs its secrets enough on its own, is that 
Silver allows her actors to be too intent early on about things that they don't 
yet realize. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is the pint-sized killer's mother's early worried and distraught 
glances at her picture-perfect daughter almost from the beginning, when no 
indication of little Rhoda's evil has yet come to light. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's own giveaways, upstairs neighbor Monica's harping on Jungian 
theory, visits by a crime writer who knows much about homicide, etc., have to 
be clouded by such natural staging as to cloak their purpose. This production 
points them out blatantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Silver has gathered a generally capable cast to play out the 
horrors of Rhoda's shenanigans. Barbara Kerek Anzlovar is solid as the mother, 
outside of a tendency to fall apart too soon and too openly, and a feeling 
sometimes that she is less concerned about what Rhoda has done than about her 
own guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Taylor gets the laughs that are due her as the neighbor-landlady 
Monica and is also very effective when she doesn't interpret her admitted 
flightiness by rattling off her lines. Much more stable in intent is the 
performance of Ronald Sinclair as the fumbling handyman who recognizes what 
Rhoda is and plays a game of cat-and-mouse with her. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of the evening is the important one, that of the dimpled 
darling herself, the ideal little girl with a dazzling smile and a heart as 
chilly as it is cunning. Young Jessica Holley underplays her lines with great 
aplomb and has learned that subtext, the contrasting emotions behind the spoken 
words, is an actor's most valuable tool. It's a lesson the adult cast members 
should watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Holley is also brimming over with the charm, grace and humor Anderson 
describes. Mary O'Brien is fine as the starchy teacher who suspects Rhoda's 
evil, and Danette Haddad effective as the besotted mother of Rhoda's latest 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Vibrans, Bill Reed, Ron Lance and John Petersen hit their marks properly 
in a production that looks good on Diane Green's charming suburban apartment 
setting but that should be darker in tone and more guarded with its secrets.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SEALS' PERFORMANCE BARELY MAKES A RIPPLE; THE VETERAN SINGER 
SERVES UP ROTE VERSIONS OF HIS HITS, CONVEYING JUST A SMIDGEN OF GOOD-TIME 
SPIRIT IN A LIKABLY FORGETTABLE SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Merle Haggard's music were a movie, it might be something fine and gritty, 
like John Huston's "Fat City." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine what kind of movie Dan Seals' music might inspire. 
"Barney Meets the Care Bears," perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 In his 55-minute early show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House, the veteran 
cow-pop (did I forget an "L" somewhere?) singer gave a likably forgettable 
performance that might only find its cinematic equal in a feature-length film 
of goldfish feeding or of large friendly dogs exploring a lawn. There just 
wasn't much going on. 
</P>
<P>
 That's no great shame. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are country artists who serve as a moral compass for our society 
or who swim the far reaches of the soul, there certainly are enough others 
merely taking a musical sponge-bath that there's no reason to single out Seals. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Texas-born singer, who was half of the pop duo England Dan and John 
Ford Coley and is brother to Seals and Crofts' Jim Seals -- has said he grew up 
listening to Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson. While his show did convey a smidgen 
of their good-time spirit, there was no attempt to approach their artistry or 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he and his able quartet generally served up rote versions of his 
hits. Seals has a pleasant, but undistinguished, voice, aided neither by 
emotion nor by the sound mix Monday, which sometimes lost his lyrics in the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't fit all his hits into the 13-song set, but there were still quite a 
few, including "My Old Yellow Car," "Bop," the moderately rocking "Three Time 
Loser," "Everything That Glitters (Is Not Gold)" and the encore "One Friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The standouts, such as they were, included his version of Jesse Winchester's 
"Sweet Little Shoe" -- delivered with some rich, low vocal harmonies from his 
band mates and a beguiling musical arrangement -- and "They Rage On." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly divorced from the mood of that song's subject -- the crushing 
frustrations of growing up in a small town -- his vocal was undeniably lovely 
and again was given a fine harmony support from his band.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat to his credit, Seals did introduce several new songs in the 
performance, ones due out shortly on a Warner Bros. album to be titled "All 
Fired Up." 
</P>
<P>
 The title tune, as well as the album's "Call Me Up" and one presumably called 
"Still Reeling From Those Rock and Roll Days," was anything but fired up -- 
just more of the same professional, uninspired stuff that has been Seals' 
trademark for years.

LABOR STRIKE TEAM INSPECTS FARMS; AGRICULTURE: STATE OFFICIALS LAUNCH TWO-DAY 
ENFORCEMENT EFFORT IN COUNTY. SANTA PAULA NURSERY IS FINED AND SHUT DOWN FOR 
WORKERS' COMP VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 State investigators Tuesday launched a crackdown on Ventura County 
agricultural operations suspected of violating labor laws, including a Santa 
Paula flower grower who was shut down for allegedly failing to insure his 
workers against on-the-job accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first day of the two-day enforcement effort, members of a 
multi-agency strike team inspected farms and nurseries from Oxnard to Santa 
Paula in response to complaints that workers were being paid below minimum wage 
or were not being paid at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide effort is expected to continue today, including a sweep through 
the food-rich farm belt that stretches from Saticoy to Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is part of an overall effort that we are going to be making throughout 
the year," said Jose Millan, who heads a year-old statewide effort to enforce 
labor laws designed to protect farm workers and other laborers. "We are going 
to build upon this for a major sweep later this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators are members of the Targeted Industries Partnership Program, 
or TIPP, established in late 1992 to beef up enforcement in the state's 
agriculture and garment industries. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, members of the joint enforcement and educational program have 
conducted more than 600 agricultural inspections statewide and issued more than 
400 citations resulting in more than $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula on Tuesday, investigators added another $16,000 to that total. 
</P>
<P>
 At Windward Farms, a small nursery located just north of the Santa Paula 
Airport, workers told investigators that they are paid irregularly and often 
their paychecks can't be cashed because of insufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker said he had not been paid in nearly a month. Another said he is 
owed payment for 70 hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here is bad," said one worker, wrapping dried flowers in sheets of 
plastic underneath a run-down fiberglass shed. "We go to cash our checks and 
sometimes there aren't any funds. Sometimes it takes days to get our money." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitton, owner of the flower ranch, told state investigators that he owes 
money to a few workers but that due to an accounting problem there has been a 
delay in payment. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he realized some workers have tried to cash checks but could 
not. He said there are now sufficient funds in the bank to cover all of the 
checks that have been written. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stay in business in California and we're trying to make a 
decent workplace," Whitton said. "It takes all of my resources to keep this 
thing going. All of my money goes to my employees." 
</P>
<P>
 At the rear of the property, workers dipped flowers into steaming vats of 
sodium chloride, citric acid and water. Many employees weren't wearing gloves 
or masks. Runoff from the vats collected in a pond at the rear of the property, 
a few hundred yards from the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Smith, environmental health specialist for the county, said the county 
responded to a complaint of chemicals being dumped at Windward Farms about two 
years ago. No violations of hazardous waste laws were found. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the complaint made Tuesday, Smith said he will conduct another 
inspection at the flower ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said they will review the handling and disposal of 
chemicals to determine whether there were any violations of state health and 
safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the injustice of it all," said Roy A. Byron-Cooper, a Ventura-based 
inspector with the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health. "It's 
the little guy who doesn't know any better and who ends up getting screwed." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the failure to provide workers' compensation insurance to the 
flower ranch's 16 employees that prompted state investigators to shut down the 
operation. Investigators ordered Windward Farms to cease operation until 
insurance was secured and issued Whitton a citation for $16,000 -- $1,000 for 
each employee not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitton said he is in the process of acquiring workers' compensation 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said they will continue to review the case to determine if 
more citations and fines should be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not know the extent of the environmental problems. We did not know the 
extent of the wage problems," Millan said. "Those are significant here." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors visited two other agricultural operations Tuesday. No violations 
were found at one of the sites, an Oxnard nursery. At the other site, a farm 
labor contractor, no crews were working. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed partly in response to criticism that the state's agriculture industry 
was riddled with abuses, TIPP has been conducting inspections up and down the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to coordinate and strengthen the efforts of state and 
federal agencies responsible for enforcing labor law. 
</P>
<P>
 Major sweeps have been conducted in Kern, Imperial and Riverside counties. 
Smaller sweeps have been done in San Diego, Orange and San Luis Obispo 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Millan said the current two-day sweep -- which includes employees from 
Cal/OSHA and the state labor commissioner's office -- is aimed at addressing 
concerns that not enough is being done to enforce farm labor laws in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Also toward that end, the state labor commissioner has assigned Deputy Labor 
Commissioner Tony Guilin to do field inspections throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But the enforcement effort has drawn the wrath of farm worker advocates who 
charge that the program is a public relations ploy designed to polish the 
state's tarnished image when it comes to labor law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates say they have little confidence in the program, blasting it as too 
weak to scare lawbreakers into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the Labor Commission's effort is more than a cosmetic effort, which 
frankly I see a two-day operation as being," said Eileen McCarthy, an attorney 
for California Rural Legal Assistance. "Because the abuses are so rife in this 
area, this kind of enforcement really can't be done on a catch-as-catch-can 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such remarks, Millan said he believes the enforcement campaign is 
paying dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize there have been problems and we have addressed those problems 
with the limited resources available to us," said Millan, noting that the 
program recently received an additional $894,000 in funding to stay alive 
through fiscal year 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program gets us out of our offices and into the fields and the nurseries 
where the problems exist."

OXNARD CUTS WATER RATES FOR BUSINESSES; ECONOMY: CITY ALSO SLASHES TRAFFIC FEES 
IN AN EFFORT TO DRAW NEW INDUSTRY. OFFICIAL CITES THE LOSS OF JOBS IN RECENT 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard rolled out the welcome mat for new business Tuesday, 
cutting water rates for large customers and slashing traffic fees in half in an 
effort to attract new industry to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the fee reductions will result in substantial savings to 
businesses interested in moving to Oxnard, said Steven Kinney, the city's 
economic development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of jobs in the last several years, and we need to make them 
up," Kinney told City Council members. "This is really a stimulus program. It's 
not just a break for developers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the reduction in traffic fees will only benefit new development, the 
lower water rates will result in a windfall to the largest businesses in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new schedule, homeowners will continue to pay escalating rates for 
greater water consumption. But apartment buildings, businesses and industry 
will now pay lower rates the more water they use. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble -- the city's largest water user -- will benefit most, saving 
$430,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings will average about $9,000 a year for the 10 apartment buildings with 
the highest water use, about $32,000 annually for the 10 businesses with the 
heaviest water usage and about $70,800 annually for the 10 manufacturers that 
use the most water. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved a reduction in traffic fees for new 
development from $348 per trip to just under $174. Under the new rate, a 
typical industrial company opening a 10,000-square-foot building will save 
about $10,400. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut the fees by half, city staff identified $212 million in traffic 
improvements that can either be delayed or paid for from as-yet unidentified 
sources. Among the projects that will need alternative funding are new 
interchanges for the Ventura Freeway at Rice and Rose avenues, and a new 
freeway bridge over the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of revenues troubled Councilman Tom Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows these improvements are vital," Holden said. "What's going to 
happen down the road if we have 50% lower traffic fees, but are not able to 
make the improvements because no new funding source is found?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Tom Frutchey countered, saying the lower fees would help attract 
new businesses that, in turn, would generate property and sales taxes to help 
pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Plisky said high fees have hurt Oxnard's ability to attract 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've choked off business to the point where we don't have another choice" 
but to reduce fees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to reduce traffic fees was supported by representatives from the 
Building Industry Assn. and the National Assn. of Industrial Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also approved adjustments to the city's utility rates for 
trash, sewer and water as part of a broad study of how to deliver utilities 
more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the changes approved unanimously by the council, the rates that a 
typical homeowner will pay for each utility will drop slightly beginning Jan. 
25. Sewer rates will fall 1.4%, water rates 0.5% and trash rates 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The total monthly bill for all three utilities for a typical homeowner will 
fall to $61.14 from the current $61.71. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, water rates will drop by 14.6%, but almost all of that will be 
realized by the city's largest water customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Water rates are scheduled to fall by 36% for the largest apartment houses, 
between 21% and 45% for large businesses, and 35% for large manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates will remain nearly the same for typical single-family homes, with 
the total monthly bill declining nine cents to $19.82. The adopted rate for 
small water users was lower than the city first announced last week, when 
single-family homes were expected to pay 23 cents more a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But rates will rise 17% for high-use homeowners, 20% for small apartment 
buildings, and between 36% and 141% for small businesses. That translates to 
monthly increases of nearly $10 for homeowners who are heavy water users, $2 
for small apartment buildings, and between $4 and $7 for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was criticized by perennial council candidate Roy Lockwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we had a case where industry was subsidizing homeowners," Lockwood 
said. "As now proposed, residences will be subsidizing industry."

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN PRIEST'S THEFT TRIAL; COURTS: DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR 
DAVID DEAN PIROLI SAYS ANOTHER CLERGYMAN AT THE SIMI VALLEY CHURCH EMBEZZLED 
THE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As jury selection Tuesday opened the trial of a Simi Valley priest accused of 
embezzling $60,000 in collection money from two Ventura County churches, his 
attorney won permission to fight the already sensational charges with a new 
allegation: Another priest did it. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Father David Dean Piroli told Superior Court Judge Allan 
Steele that the money was actually embezzled from St. Peter Claver Church by 
its head pastor at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Beada said he has evidence that Father James McKeon 
took cash and checks from parishioners' donations, then planted the money in 
Piroli's car and bedroom because the younger priest threatened to blow the 
whistle on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people's theory in this case is that Father Piroli was stealing cash that 
came into the church coffers by way of collection money," Beada said. "I have 
evidence, direct evidence, that Father McKeon was taking money from the same 
source . . . and that he had access to Father Piroli's residence and Father 
Piroli's car." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Steele agreed to let Piroli use this defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge refused to admit evidence that would have stacked lurid new 
allegations onto the case -- a prosecution assertion that Piroli kept company 
with and spent money on a male prostitute and a defense contention that McKeon 
frequented a gay bathhouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of these issues have direct bearing on whether Piroli took church 
funds, Steele ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who was Piroli's supervisor and has since moved on to become a pastor 
at another parish in Westlake Village, declined through a church employee to 
comment on Beada's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
which oversees the priests, said of the allegations, "I can't comment on any of 
them because I have so little knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 The statements in open court added a seamy new layer to a case that has 
already shaken two tightly-knit church communities that Piroli once served -- 
St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The case came to light May 27, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood police who were called to roust loiterers outside a Sears store 
found Piroli sitting in his church car with a young man, a small amount of 
cocaine and $10,000 cash in small bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Church employees found $50,000 more in Piroli's rooms at the rectory, along 
with parishioners' donation checks and St. Peter Claver collection envelopes, 
some of them torn open, prosecutors said. Donations were ordinarily taken to a 
safe place in the church offices before being deposited in a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, as prosecutors and church officials pondered possible criminal 
charges against him, Piroli disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 He resurfaced July 30, 1992, at the U.S.-Mexico border, trying to re-enter 
California with two undocumented immigrants in his trunk. One of the 
immigrants, Israel Palacios, was the same young man who was with Piroli in 
Hollywood when he was initially arrested, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace sought permission to have a 
Hollywood police officer testify about the cocaine and to identify Palacios as 
a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace argued that such evidence would back her theory that Piroli was 
embezzling church funds to support a cocaine habit and a boyfriend. She also 
sought permission to show jurors gay pornographic pictures found in Piroli's 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said he would allow jurors to hear evidence about the drugs and see a 
photograph of Palacios in swimming trunks that was found in Piroli's possession 
-- to support Peace's contention that Piroli was spending money on the man and 
had a close relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said that unless Peace produces court documents showing Palacios 
had been convicted of prostitution, he would not let jurors hear about it. 
Without such proof, the judge also refused to allow the prosecution to inform 
the jury about Palacios' presence in the car trunk at the border or see the 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Beada said he had witnesses ready to testify that Father 
James McKeon was seen at gay bathhouses in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steele refused to let Beada present any such evidence, ruling that the 
discussion of homosexuality was "gratuitous." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, Steele excused several potential jurors for hardships, 
and because some said they had already developed opinions on Piroli's case 
after reading newspaper articles about his arrest and arraignment.  
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to continue this morning, and opening arguments 
and testimony are expected to begin next week, attorneys said.

VANDERKOLK GETS ANOTHER STINT ON BUDGET PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard on Tuesday agreed to relinquish her 
position on the county's powerful budget committee to make room for her 
colleague, Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who was removed from the committee last year after a bitter board 
dispute, will take over Howard's position on the 12-member panel when it meets 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have served on the budget committee for three years now and that has been a 
real challenge," Howard told her fellow board members. "We've made some 
difficult decisions. . . . But I would like to step aside after three years of 
headaches." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she is "looking forward" to rejoining the group, which is 
responsible for formulating the county's fiscal policies. 
</P>
<P>
 With a year left in public office, VanderKolk had asked Howard, who as board 
chairman is in charge of making appointments to the county committees, to put 
her back on the budget panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about this," said VanderKolk, who announced several weeks 
ago that she would not seek reelection in June. "I'm looking forward to any 
lobbying to be done in Sacramento. We need to talk to our legislators and 
continue to educate them on what the issues are." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she also is determined to make sure that the money raised from 
Proposition 172 -- the extension of a half-cent sales tax approved by voters in 
November -- be used to fund the county's law enforcement activities. The county 
expects to receive between $26 million and $28 million next year from the tax. 
"We need to come out very strong and make a clear direction on how the money 
should be spent," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget committee -- which includes two supervisors and 10 other top county 
officials -- meets once a month to formulate fiscal plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is considered the most influential of all the county's 
policy-setting committees. Previously, the committee has come up with such 
plans as the county's four-day work week and early retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the head of the Board of Supervisors comes up with a list of new 
board appointees to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, then Chairwoman Susan K. Lacey recommended that VanderKolk be 
removed from the committee and Supervisor Maggie Kildee be put in her place. 
Lacey also proposed that Howard be retained for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite VanderKolk's pleas to remain on the panel, the board voted 3 to 2 to 
go along with Lacey's recommendations. Supervisor John K. Flynn was the other 
board member to join VanderKolk in protesting the ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lacey said she simply wanted to get "fresh ideas" by bringing Kildee on 
the board, Flynn speculated that VanderKolk had angered county officials by 
suggesting cuts to internal departments during her one-year stint on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, none of the board members voiced objections to reappointing 
VanderKolk to the budget committee. At Howard's recommendation, they also 
agreed to appoint Kildee as chairwoman of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to VanderKolk and Kildee, the committee includes Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg, Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon, 
county budget chief Albert Bigler, Health Care Agency Director Phillipp K. 
Wessels and other ranking administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very difficult commitment," Howard said of her three years on the 
committee. "Maria would like to serve on it and I'm pleased to put her there."

VENTURA MOVES FORWARD WITH BAN ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite protests from restaurant owners, the Ventura City Council is moving 
forward with a sweeping ordinance that would outlaw smoking at all businesses 
and restaurants, except for bars. 
</P>
<P>
 To soften the impact on restaurateurs, the council Monday voted to waive 
permit fees and give restaurant owners with bars until February, 1995, to 
comply with the ban. The law would be implemented in three months for all other 
restaurants and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoking is a health issue," Mayor Tom Buford said in an interview. "It's a 
legitimate area for governmental action." 
</P>
<P>
 In hours of public testimony before the council Monday night, nonsmoking 
advocates cited the dangers of secondhand smoke while restaurant owners argued 
that they should have the right to designate their establishments smoking or 
nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 2 for preliminary approval of the ban, with Councilmen 
Jack Tingstrom and Jim Monahan dissenting. Both are ardent supporters of the 
business community and sided with restaurateurs. A final vote on the law will 
take place later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsmoking advocates, however, swayed the rest of the council with their 
arguments. Representatives from the American Cancer Society, the Ventura County 
Medical Society and the American Heart Assn. testified about the dangers of 
secondhand smoke to employees in restaurants and other places where smoking is 
now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Millenheft, a 27-year-old tax auditor, stood in front of the council 
with his 6-month-old son in a stroller and urged the council to put public 
health above business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to guarantee my son a smoke-free environment," Millenheft said. 
"The restaurateurs say this is a freedom of choice issue. What they mean is 
that making money is more important than the health of our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owners, who submitted a petition signed by 4,396 residents against 
the ban, were disappointed by the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wagner, who owns Andria's Seafood restaurant, told the council that 
many of his patrons smoke and that the ban would drive away customers to 
eateries in Oxnard and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I thought the ordinance was necessary to my business, I'd change to 
nonsmoking in a heartbeat," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ban will prohibit customers from smoking at all restaurants, except for 
outdoor seating areas. Restaurant owners who have bars at their establishments 
must declare their bars nonsmoking or wall off the bar and install a separate 
ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban would also compel every hotel and restaurant to post prominent "No 
Smoking" signs. Smoking will be prohibited in all public places and all 
businesses, except for tobacco retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson offered a compromise that would make it easier 
for some restaurants to be classified as a bar and thus be exempt from the ban. 
But his proposal was rejected by a majority of the council, who said that by 
redefining some restaurants as bars, it would be unfair to restaurants in 
neighboring cities that have adopted similar smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be important to have a level playing field," Councilman 
Steve Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett noted that Moorpark, Ojai, Thousand Oaks and Ventura County have all 
defined bars as establishments that serve alcohol and receive less than 25% of 
gross receipts from food sales. Under Carson's compromise, bars in Ventura 
would receive less than 35% of gross receipts from food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said by tinkering with the percentage, Ventura could "really open a 
can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, gave restaurants a break by waiving permit fees for 
constructing walls and air-conditioning systems in restaurants that want to 
allow smoking in their bars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided to exempt restaurants from laws requiring that the 
construction be upgraded to all city standards. Property owners are usually 
compelled to upgrade other parts of their buildings to meet stricter seismic 
safety codes and other new standards. 
</P>
<P>
 All violations will be considered infractions, punishable only by fines 
ranging from $100 to $500.

 Ventura County supervisors Tuesday agreed to move forward with plans to 
streamline the county's hazardous waste and materials inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the county's Resource Management Agency and Fire Department both 
search for code violations at businesses that deal with hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a plan unanimously adopted by supervisors, the Resource Management 
Agency would be responsible for the inspections, ending the Fire Department's 
duplicate efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials said they have not yet determined how much money the 
consolidation would save, County Ombudsman Ruth Schepler said, "You are talking 
about a decent chunk of change." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, fire officials said they were concerned that by switching 
responsibility to the Resource Management Agency, the Fire Department would be 
not be properly informed about businesses that are using hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn., 
said firefighters' lives could be in danger if they respond to a fire or 
hazardous materials spill without knowing the extent of the chemicals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about safety," Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schepler, who began studying the consolidation in the spring at the 
request of the supervisors, said the Fire Department would be given updated 
computer files on all inspections conducted by the Resource Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult for firefighters to trust anyone who is an outsider," 
she said. "It is time they learn that process." TINA DAUNT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD DELAYS FINAL ACTION ON CLINIC SITE

<P>
 Because of a breakdown in negotiations, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday delayed a final decision on whether to purchase a 
building owned by Texaco to house the west Ventura health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet said the county and Texaco have not 
yet reached agreement over who will pay to remove asbestos ceiling tiles and 
clean up soil contamination from underground fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The board postponed a public hearing on the matter until next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to work out a compromise that might be suitable to Texaco," 
said Ray Ruiz, the county's manager of real estate services. "Hopefully within 
the next week we can reach some sort of agreement on that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors tentatively agreed two weeks ago to purchase the 
building at 133 W. Santa Clara St. for $1.3 million -- pending an agreement 
with Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
 The building would serve as the new location for the West Ventura Family Care 
Clinic, which is now operating in cramped quarters at 110 N. Olive St., 
Ventura. TINA DAUNT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County commercial real estate market made slow but steady 
improvement in 1993, though robust growth could be as long as three years away, 
according to an annual report issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "By all indications, it's going to get steadily better," said William Schenck, 
senior vice president and district manager for the Oxnard office of Grubb & 
Ellis, a commercial real estate company that issued the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In retail, shopping centers with major department stores or discount stores 
such as Wal-Mart or Target had a 7% vacancy rate, while strip malls and other 
shopping centers without a major anchor store had a 16.5% vacancy rate, the 
report showed. The overall retail vacancy rate of 9% is the same as the past 
three years, retail brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The industrial market, by contrast, saw vacancy rates drop from 14.7% in 1992 
to 12.3% in 1993 -- the lowest vacancy rate since 1989, Grubb & Ellis brokers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Office vacancy rates dipped as well, to 21%, the lowest since 1989 and a 
six-point drop from a high in 1990 of 27%, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of new office, retail, or industrial space is generally flat, 
brokers said. "Somewhere in the next two to three years, we'll start to see new 
development," said Michael Blahonsky, a Grubb & Ellis broker. "We were late 
getting into this recession, and we'll be late getting out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, given the history of the commercial real estate market in the last 
few years, Blahonsky said many such predictions have proved futile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've not been through anything like this before," he said. "The dynamics are 
such that we just don't know sometimes. We never thought this was going to 
happen in the first place." CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Ventura police are searching for a robbery suspect who held up a pizza 
delivery business wearing a black trench coat, pink gloves and a blue 
handkerchief tied over his face. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager of Domino's Pizza on Thompson Boulevard told police that he was 
working inside the store about 6 p.m. Monday when he heard a dog barking 
outside the rear door.When the manager opened the door to look outside, a man 
armed with a small, silver-colored revolver confronted him and gestured for the 
manager to fill a bank bag with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 After the manager complied, the robber forced him into the walk-in freezer and 
piled several items in front of the door. The manager escaped about 30 minutes 
later and flagged down a passing police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager described the suspect as a white male of medium build with severe 
acne on his forehead. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; JURY TO RULE ON SUSPECT'S SANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge decided Tuesday to let a jury determine whether a 
24-year-old man who is accused of killing a Santa Paula ranch foreman is 
mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch's decision came after two psychiatrists 
who examined Jose Luis Gonzalez could not agree on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set jury selection for Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a 23-year-old transient, is charged with murder in the May 14 death 
of Rosario De la Cruz, 47, who was shot four times in the chest as he stood in 
his Santa Paula home. Attorneys said De la Cruz told his wife just before he 
died that it was Gonzalez, a longtime family friend, who shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Gonzalez was sent to Patton State Hospital after two Ventura County 
doctors concluded he was severely mentally ill and could not understand the 
criminal court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to the court dated Oct. 10, Patton's medical director said 
Gonzalez "is now able to understand the nature of the charges" against him and 
should be tried as soon as possible, while he is still mentally competent. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily said he believes it will be difficult 
for a jury to understand the technicalities of the issue. He said he wanted 
Storch to decide the matter, not a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison said prosecutors felt that a jury 
was the best way to decide the issue. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BEARDED BANDIT ROBS GREAT WESTERN BANK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura branch of Great Western Bank was robbed Tuesday by a man wearing 
mirrored sunglasses and sporting a neatly groomed full beard and mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there were no other customers inside the bank on South Mills Road 
when the robbery occurred at 12:50 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect approached a teller and gave her a demand note that had been 
hidden in a file folder.After she gave him money, the suspect left the bank. No 
weapon was seen and no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the suspect as a white male with salt-and-pepper hair and 
beard, 40 to 43 years old, nearly 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds. He 
was wearing a long-sleeve turquoise jersey T-shirt with a white stripe and 
jeans, said FBI Special Agent John Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have no suspects, but they believe pictures from the bank's 
surveillance camera may help to identify the robber. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A barroom brawl in Port Hueneme left one man in the hospital in serious 
condition and another man in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ellis, 23, of San Diego was arrested after Robert Bowers, 41, of Port 
Hueneme was stabbed in the neck with a broken beer bottle.The two had been 
playing pool and drinking together most of the evening, said Sgt. Jerry Beck of 
the Port Hueneme Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that just after midnight, Ellis attacked Bowers without 
provocation, lunging at him with a broken beer bottle.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowers was taken to St. John's Regional Medical Center, where he underwent 
surgery early Tuesday to repair nerves damaged in the attack. He is listed in 
stable condition, said a hospital spokeswoman, who added that the attack came 
close to cutting an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Ellis a short distance from the bar.  
</P>
<P>
 He was covered in blood and suffering from a broken nose, Beck said. He was 
booked into county jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and 
inflicting grievous bodily harm. His bail was set at $5,000. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SYSTEM SNAG DELAYS NEW LIBRARY HOURS

<TEXT>
<P>
 An expected increase in hours at the Simi Valley Library has been delayed 
because of a lag in the delivery of an automated $70,000 check-out system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping to have the system this month," said Dixie Adeniran, director 
of the county's library agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Adeniran said the system should be installed by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines, which Adeniran said resemble bank cash machines, will allow 
patrons to check out material without a library employee.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the automated system is in place, officials hope to keep the branch open 
an additional 11 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-run library's weekly hours were slashed from 54 to 32 when the 
library agency had its state funding cut by 40% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Library, one of 15 run by the countywide agency, will be the 
first to install the automated system. A similar system is planned for the 
Camarillo Library. SARA CATANIA

OXNARD; FIRE-POLICE MERGER HEARING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A showdown over a plan by the city of Oxnard to merge the fire and police 
departments was postponed Tuesday for three weeks after the City Council asked 
for more time before addressing the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the money-saving proposal has been scheduled for Feb. 1 at the 
council's 7:30 p.m. session. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay occurred when the council turned down a plea by Bill Gallaher, 
president of the Oxnard Firefighters Assn., to shift a hearing scheduled for 
Tuesday's afternoon session to the evening to accommodate a large turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared after City Manager Thomas Frutchey asked Gallaher to call off a 
telephone campaign by supporters of the firefighters who oppose a merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clerical staff on (City Hall's) fourth floor is essentially not getting 
anything done," Frutchey said. "If we could stop the campaign, then the City 
Council can discuss this rationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members suggested that city firefighters were transferring 
telephone calls to the city manager's office, and questioned whether the 
firefighters were conducting political activity on city time. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallaher denied the charge. Later, at an impromptu rally outside City Hall 
attended by more than 100 firefighter supporters, he said emotions are running 
high over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, we're upset about the postponement," he said. "We have a lot 
of people who came here tonight to speak. This is very, very inconvenient."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HIGH SCHOOL WEIGHS LONGER, FEWER 
CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal High School teachers and administrators are scheduled to decide by Feb. 
1 whether to change class schedules so that students would spend 90 to 120 
minutes in three or four classes a day instead of taking six 50-minute periods. 
</P>
<P>
 At an all-day conference, teachers learned about alternative scheduling at 
four area high schools.Educators from Simi Valley's Royal High School then 
split up to discuss the issue. A survey of the faculty will be taken in coming 
weeks, Principal Mike McConahey said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials seek to gauge faculty interest in proceeding with the 
proposal by this fall or the fall of 1995, McConahey said. If teachers want to 
go ahead, the community will be consulted through public meetings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My motivation is to find anything we can do to improve the learning 
environment," McConahey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers from Hueneme, Newbury Park, Oak Park and Agoura high schools told 
Friday's gathering that the revised schedules have forced teachers to become 
more creative in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking fewer classes for longer periods during the day allows students to 
focus on fewer classes at a time. Classroom discussion or laboratory work can 
go into greater depth with more time in one sitting, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching five or six 50-minute periods each day does not allow teachers to get 
to know students like the longer classes do, said Rob Hall, a social studies 
teacher at Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 50 minutes goes just like that," Hall said, snapping his fingers. "You 
tend to deal with the same four or five kids every day. It's the kid who needs 
the most help or the kid who's most boisterous." BRENDA DAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY PLANNING PANEL GETS NEW CHAIRMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vowing to make meetings shorter, friendlier and even entertaining, Irving 
Wasserman has taken over the chairmanship of Thousand Oaks' five-member 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Carpenter, who has served on the Planning Commission for three years, 
moved into the vice chairman's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the Planning Commission, which reviews all proposed development, 
Wasserman said he hopes to encourage public participation, in part by wrapping 
up the Monday evening meetings before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that each chairman before me has set out this same goal and not 
gotten very far, but I'm going to work very hard for shorter, crisper 
meetings," Wasserman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to enjoy coming to the meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman, a self-employed management consultant, said he hopes to boost the 
panel's credentials by arranging for all planning commissioners to attend 
educational seminars or take field trips to key development sites across the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission's next big task will be evaluating the city's General 
Plan, which maps out development projections and goals for the next several 
decades. Other important issues up for discussion soon include a wetlands 
protection ordinance and a tree preservation program. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY DELAYS PACT FOR MANAGERIAL 
WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday postponed consideration of a 
three-year contract for the city's 116 managerial employees out of concern that 
the negotiated agreement would deny longevity pay to 31 senior workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, drafted after four months of negotiations, called for the 
employees to receive deferred compensation instead of longevity pay.They would 
be allowed to set aside up to $70 in pretax income each month during the first 
year of the contract, and they would receive it in a lump sum upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second year of the contract, they would be able to set aside $125 a 
month and in the third year $180 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Sangster, deputy director of the Planning Department, presented a 
petition of protest signed by 19 senior managers. They argued that longevity 
pay, which rewards longtime employees who have reached the top of the pay 
scale, should be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to reconsider the issue in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed contract, the managers would be eligible for annual merit 
raises of up to 6%, said Roy Myers, vice president of the Thousand Oaks 
Management Assn., the labor union representing most top-level staff. The 
average raise would be set at 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a pay-for-performance schedule, not a cost-of-living one, so the 
outstanding employees don't end up getting the same raises as a total 
goof-off," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes in the contract would allow managers to consolidate vacation, 
sick and administrative leave. Those employees working 10-hour shifts who have 
been with the city for five years would receive 18 days of annual leave, and 
those who have been working for 15 years would get about 24 days a year.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW SERVICE STATION OKD OVER PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council has approved the city's first new gas station in 
more than a decade, despite passionate testimony against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lively discussion, the council on Monday night unanimously denied an 
appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to allow Shell to build a 24-hour 
service station next to a McDonald's on Yosemite Avenue at the Simi Valley 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton, who filed the appeal along with Councilwoman Barbara 
Williamson, said he was satisfied with the changes Shell made to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Shell has gone a long way to meet the traffic concerns of the 
residents," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, opponents from the nearby Indian Hills neighborhood argued that the 
gas station would increase crime, noise and traffic hazards in the area. They 
also said congestion caused by large trucks jamming Yosemite as they head for 
McDonald's will only get worse if a station is built on the adjoining site. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Regina Walczak said she was launching a boycott of Shell and 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of you are determined to turn the corner of 118 and Yosemite 
into a truck stop," Walczak told the council as she pulled a pair of scissors 
from her purse and snipped her Shell credit card into tiny pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shell spokesman Larry S. Turner said the company had agreed not to sell 
diesel fuel for trucks at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to appease residents, the company also agreed to pay $75,000 toward a 
new traffic signal on Yosemite, construct a sound wall to reduce the noise of 
the carwash, post signs saying truck diesel fuel is not sold at the station and 
move a gas pump that residents said would pose a traffic hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said he hopes to have the station open for operation within six months.

DEPUTIES IN LINKENAUGER CASE DEFENDED; REPORT: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS CALL 
WAS PROPERLY HANDLED. WOMAN WAS KILLED 14 MONTHS LATER BY HER HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies properly handled a domestic violence call 
from a Moorpark woman who was killed 14 months later by her husband, department 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement ended an internal investigation that began in October, after a 
Ventura County Probation Department report criticized the manner in which 
deputies handled a call for help by JoAnn Linkenauger on Nov. 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was fatally beaten and strangled by James M. Linkenauger on Jan. 17, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation concluded that the manner in which the call for service was 
handled was within department policy and in accordance with applicable domestic 
violence laws," said Lt. Mark S. Ball of the department's Internal Affairs 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation officials could not be reached for comment. Nor could officials from 
a battered-women's group, Coalition Against Household Violence, which has 
accused the Sheriff's Department of inconsistency in its handling of domestic 
violence calls.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the call JoAnn Linkenauger made for help occurred 14 months prior 
to her death, the probation report said it was one of a series of apparent 
mistakes deputies made in handling her complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said deputies failed to arrest James Linkenauger after JoAnn 
Linkenauger reported on Nov. 15, 1991, that he tried to strangle her and 
punched her in the face three times. Despite a cut on the woman's lip, 
Sheriff's Lt. Steve Giles decided not to arrest the husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball said Tuesday, however, that deputies did not arrest the husband because 
JoAnn Linkenauger's injuries were not consistent with a beating of the 
magnitude she described. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Linkenauger described an extremely violent altercation," Ball said. "She 
said she had been choked. She had been punched. And she had been dragged around 
the residence for over an hour, and there was no evidence to suggest that that 
did happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The probation report faulted deputies for suggesting in their account that 
JoAnn Linkenauger's credibility should be questioned if she made further 
complaints. But Ball said such comments are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would hope that any deputy would take time to write that type of 
information," he said. "That's one way we solve crimes in this country, by past 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball said there have been rumors that James Linkenauger had friends within the 
Sheriff's Department ranks, but that the investigation did not confirm the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any deputy who knew James Linkenauger before this incident 
occurred," he said, referring to the homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 James Linkenauger was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 25 
years to life in state prison. The probation report was compiled before his 
sentencing.

MOORPARK CHAMBER CANCELS PLAN FOR WEEKLY FARMERS' MARKET; SHOPPING: OFFICIALS 
CITE THE CITY COUNCIL'S CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND UNFAIR COMPETITION AND THE 
LACK OF SUPPORT FROM DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a lack of support among city officials and High Street merchants, the 
Moorpark Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday that it is dropping plans for a 
weekly farmers' market aimed at attracting shoppers to downtown Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole problem was a lack of guts in moving ahead with this 
thing," chamber President Francis Okyere said. "When it came time for people to 
step forward and take some accountability and responsibility for making this 
move, the chamber was standing there by itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials had sought city approval for the market last summer and had 
hoped that the Saturday afternoon event, featuring fresh fruits, vegetables, 
breads and other products, could make its debut in September. 
</P>
<P>
 But while expressing broad support for the idea as a way to focus attention on 
Moorpark's sleepy downtown shopping district, City Council members quickly 
raised objections ranging from unfair competition with existing businesses to 
safety concerns over the chamber's desire to hold the event in the parking lot 
of the city's Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Bernardo Perez and Pat Hunter were asked to meet with chamber 
officials and downtown merchants to see if they could work through the 
individual criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly four months of meetings and behind-the-scenes negotiations -- 
including one particularly stormy public session during which merchants 
criticized the proposal -- the chamber's board of directors voted unanimously 
Thursday to abandon the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Okyere this week officially notified council members of the decision in a 
round of phone calls and a letter from the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm a little disappointed," Perez said shortly after hearing of the 
decision. "I think a farmers' market is a wonderful idea for Moorpark and 
particularly for High Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said the City Council is at least partly responsible for letting a good 
idea die. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to step up and shoulder our responsibility," Perez said. "We should 
have been an equal supporter with the chamber in making this happen, and we 
didn't do it. Maybe next time around, we will." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Paul Lawrason was reluctant to accept blame for failing to get 
behind an idea that he said was not sufficiently worked out when the chamber 
sought city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put us to the gun, and we were supposed to react and make it positive 
and make it work," Lawrason said. "I think it might have been beneficial to cut 
us in a little bit earlier. I did not back away because of a lack of guts or 
whatever Mr. Okyere wants to call it. If this was something everybody wanted, 
by God, we'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the chamber's original plan, the market would have been run by Cynthia 
Korman, who operates the Ojai Certified Farmers' Market. Plans called for 15 to 
20 certified growers to sell items ranging from fresh fruits and vegetables to 
fish, coffee, plants, bread, pasta, eggs, honey flowers and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Lawrason said the failure of the downtown merchants to get behind 
an idea some saw as potentially threatening sealed the fate of this particular 
version of a farmers' market -- an idea he still supports in theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chamber and Francis were one proponent of this, and I failed to grasp who 
in the merchant community were strong proponents," he said. "There were a lot 
of negatives bounced around. We heard those and responded to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Cummings, president of the Moorpark Old Town Merchants Assn., said Okyere 
and chamber officials never addressed her concerns over vendors competing with 
existing businesses, and the idea of a private contractor running the market 
for profit and with advantages over other permanent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it ran into opposition because the chamber was inviting an 
independent businesswoman in and asking special favors for her to come in and 
set up an independent business," Cummings said. "There's no way I could back 
that, even though I think the farmers' market would have been an incredibly 
neat thing."

 SCHOOL: Westlake 
</P>
<P>
 SPORT: Basketball

 YEAR: Sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Aylsworth, Westlake's sixth man, has been the key to the 
Warriors' strong start in the Marmonte League. Aylsworth (5-foot-11) is a 
flashy ballhandler with a deft shooting touch from three-point range.He leads 
Westlake (9-2, 3-0 in league play) with 15.6 points, 4.1 assists and 3.0 steals 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Aylsworth scored 53 points with 10 assists and seven steals 
as Westlake defeated Newbury Park, 82-79, and Thousand Oaks, 57-52. He had 21 
points, seven assists and four steals against Newbury Park -- and was even 
better against Thousand Oaks. Aylsworth scored a career-high 32 points against 
the Lancers, including 11 of Westlake's 12 points in the second quarter and 16 
of his team's 22 in the fourth quarter. "My shot felt really good," Aylsworth 
said. "I kept putting them up and they kept going in."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: HARTMAN LAMENTS SAD ENDING

 Jason Hartman, Thousand Oaks High's standout senior forward, cried while 
sitting on the bench during the closing moments of the Lancers' 57-52 road loss 
to Westlake last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman suffered a neck injury (X-rays since proved negative) late in the 
game, but that is not why tears filled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crying because of how we've been playing," Hartman said. "It's been 
kind of frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, who have won three consecutive league titles, dropped their first 
two league games after winning all 14 last season. In each loss, Thousand Oaks 
squandered large leads in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks held a 45-35 advantage against Westlake, but was outscored, 
22-7, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers opened the league schedule with a 41-36 setback to Agoura. The 
Chargers trailed, 27-18, entering the fourth quarter but outscored Thousand 
Oaks, 23-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just haven't been scoring enough," said Hartman, who leads the Lancers 
with 18.3 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. "We have some young guys and I'm 
trying to keep them involved (in the offense), but I might have to pick up the 
scoring a little bit. We've got to hang on to leads in the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman scored 31 points in the Lancers' 89-55 rout of Channel Islands on 
Monday night. Thousand Oaks improved to 10-5, 1-2 in league play. CHANNEL

 TIMELY TALK 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Rio Mesa Coach Steve Wolf was forced to concentrate less on 
basketball and more on stopping fights during practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration stemming from many close losses led to finger pointing and 
shouting among teammates. Rio Mesa (3-9, 1-2 in league play) has lost five 
games by three points or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some internal bickering," Wolf said. "When you lose as many close 
games as we have, guys are going to start losing confidence and getting down on 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to start putting the team ahead of their own concerns about who's 
getting the most playing time and things like that. I hoped clearing the air 
would help." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good: Rio Mesa defeated San Marcos on Monday night, 68-52.

 Entering the season, Buena Coach Glen Hannah said he expected a lot from 
senior forward Robbie Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Knight has performed better than Hannah thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight (6-4) is among the area's scoring leaders with an average of 22.3 
points. He also leads the Bulldogs in rebounding (7.8), steals (2.6) and 
blocked shots (1.2). 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Knight averaged 12.5 points and 8.2 rebounds. 
</P>

 Now if only the rest of Hannah's players can do the same: Buena is 7-6, 2-1 in 
league play. MISSION LEAGUE

 Harvard-Westlake basketball Coach Greg Hilliard figured the crowd that packed 
the school's gym for last Friday's game against Loyola was the biggest in his 
nine years as a Wolverine coach. 
</P>
<P>
 All four sections of the bleachers were filled midway through the junior 
varsity game. By the time the varsity game started, fans were seated two-deep 
on the floor in front of the bleachers, just a few feet from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 One downside to such a huge crowd was parking, which is difficult to find 
during a normal day at the Studio City school, nestled in the hills along 
Coldwater Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I parked in Woodland Hills," one fan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other damper was the final score. Harvard lost for the first time this 
season, 62-53.

</P>
<P>
 The Wolverine fans spent most of the night chanting "overrated, overrated," 
referring to Loyola's 6-foot-5, UCLA-bound guard, Toby Bailey. When Bailey took 
over the fourth quarter to lead the Cubs to the victory, Loyola fans responded 
with chants of "overpriced, overpriced."

 NO THANKS, WE'LL PASS

 North Hollywood had an opportunity last week to add 6-foot-7 Taft transfer 
Johnny Williams to an already talented squad, but after some investigation and 
discussion, Coach Steve Miller passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally made the decision," Miller said. "I'm not going to allow him to 
play because I feel that the problems he's had. . . . I think there's a time 
and a place you gotta say, 'Hey, you can't keep doing this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who had several disciplinary problems at Taft, was expelled for 
fighting shortly before the season opener and is now enrolled at North 
Hollywood. The City Section last fall passed a rule under which athletes sent 
to another school for disciplinary reasons are automatically ineligible to 
play. However, if Williams moves into the North Hollywood attendance area, he 
immediately would be eligible under state rules, City Commissioner Barbara 
Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller telephoned Taft Coach Jim Woodard last week to discuss the particulars 
of Williams' expulsion. After that and a discussion with Dave Smith, an 
assistant principal at North Hollywood, Miller decided against taking Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a future in front of him and he needs to know it's time to stop," 
Miller said. "He's been given a lot of chances."

 North Hollywood's Damon Ollie was the leading rebounder among players from 36 
teams in the Las Vegas tournament last month. Ollie, a 6-foot-5 senior center 
who is averaging 14.8 rebounds in 12 games, grabbed 45 rebounds in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man," Coach Steve Miller said. "He rebounds like a fiend. Once he gets 
his hands on the ball, you can forget it. He doesn't drop it."

 Basketball teams at North Hollywood and Van Nuys have been given a clean bill 
of health after being directed by the City Section to conduct internal 
investigations regarding the alleged recruitment of former Banning standout 
Kenny Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, who was declared ineligible last fall after he falsified an 
address change in an attempt to transfer to Fremont, told the coaching staff at 
Banning that he had been recruited by a handful of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington told Banning coaches he was contacted by representatives of North 
Hollywood, Van Nuys, Crenshaw, Washington and Fremont highs. Banning Coach Marc 
Paez, who formerly coached at Cleveland, supplied the City athletics office 
with a list of the player's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Fiege last month directed administrators at the five schools to 
investigate the charges. And the verdict: 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them has ever heard of Kenny Washington," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said she considers the matter closed. Washington is appealing his 
eligibility ruling. GOLDEN LEAGUE

 CHANGING OF THE GUARD 
</P>
<P>
 Go for four in '94?  
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill, which has won or shared three consecutive league titles, isn't in 
the running for a championship this season. In fact, making the playoffs seems 
a tall order. The Rebels have struggled to a 1-8 start entering the week and 
were winless in league at 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The season might have ended before it really began. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we weren't going to be real strong coming off summer league," Coach 
Steve Hurst said. "Then we lost a couple of guys and that really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Aguilar, perhaps the team's best returning player, suffered a broken 
hand a few days before the season opener, and another starter, Zamien Calvin, 
was ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 No Quartz Hill player has a double-figure scoring average. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Derrick Barker of Antelope Valley had a shadow last Friday night, 
and his name was Jerome Payton. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, who entered the game averaging 21.4 points, scored one basket and 
finished with seven points as Palmdale won, 75-53. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere he went, I went," Payton said of his man-to-man assignment. "I had 
to stick with him because he can light it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Payton, a 5-foot-10 point guard who averages 10.5 points and 4.7 assists, is 
one of several Palmdale players who come at the opposition in waves. The 
Falcons might not be particularly tall -- the starting five range in height 
from Payton to 6-3 Al Lairson -- but there are plenty of them from which to 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep bench helps Palmdale, which runs a motion offense and numerous presses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have five guys on the bench who could start for any other team in 
the Golden League," Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Pharoah Davis is drawing a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highland standout, one of the region's best players, is dangerous when he 
gets his mitts on the ball. Unfortunately, everyone knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He isn't even shooting 20 times a game," Coach Tom Mahan said. "He has to 
kick it back out (to the perimeter players)." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who has a scholarship offer from San Diego State, makes the most of his 
shots, however. He has made 47 of 90 from the floor (52.2%) in league play and 
is averaging 20.1 points overall. The best thing is, the players he passes to 
aren't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Dedeaux (13.5 average) and Lee Guilbeau (10.0) give the Bulldogs the 
most potent scoring trio in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forward John George of Littlerock prefers to work hard for his supper. George, 
a junior and one of the High Desert's best players, has a better shooting 
percentage from the field than he does from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-4 1/2 center-forward has made 89 of 144 shots from the field (61.8%) and 
44 of 73 from the line (60.3%). NORTHWEST VALLEY

<P>
 SAVING THE WORST FOR LAST 
</P>
<P>
 For Taft, it was another tale of two halves. As in have and have not . 
</P>
<P>
 Taft (9-6) held an 11-point lead at halftime last week in its conference 
opener against Granada Hills but collapsed thereafter. Granada Hills rallied 
for a 74-71 victory and its second conference victory in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the fourth time in as many losses the Toreadors blew a halftime 
lead. In the three other defeats, the intermission margins were of nine, nine 
and four points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no bench," Taft Coach Jim Woodard said. "Fatigue is a big, big 
factor." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 TOO MUCH HART 
</P>
<P>
 If someone had told Saugus Coach Eric Olsson his Saugus team would hold No. 1 
Hart to 34 points last week, Olsson probably would have licked his chops. The 
Centurion defense did its job but Saugus lost, 34-28, after leading by as many 
as nine points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 'em beat," Olsson said. "It was a game we controlled the whole way 
until the end. But once they caught us they spread the floor and made us foul 
them. They're a good free-throw shooting team. For us, it was a lack of 
offensive production in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart shot 29% from the floor, but Saugus shot only 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart Coach Mike May values a special team statistic: contested shots. The goal 
for each game is for Hart to contest at least 80% of the opposition's shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Hart plays defense, 34 points is usually enough. Two days after the 
Saugus game, the Indians held Canyon to 16% shooting from the field. No. 10 
Canyon, which averaged 81 points during a recent eight-game winning streak, 
made only one basket in the final 20 minutes 50 seconds of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 AROUND THE LEAGUES . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * The opening round of Northwest Valley Conference play wasn't kind to the 
four schools that play in the 4-A Division West Valley League. Teams in the 3-A 
North Valley League -- the lower of the City Section's two divisions -- won 
three of four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it was Kennedy -- the only team from the West Valley with a 
losing record -- that recorded the lone victory for the 4-A entries. Kennedy 
beat El Camino Real, 44-34. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth (8-7) is close to having five players with double-digit scoring 
averages. Eddie Miller is at 16.3, Trenell Floyd 14.7, Marcel Wilson 10.5, 
Jerome Joseph 10.2 and Tariq Hill 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar is the biggest surprise of the Valley Pac-8 Conference basketball 
season. The Spartans (3-0 in conference play) have won more conference games 
than any other team. Conference foes Grant and North Hollywood are each 2-0. 
Sylmar (8-6) is off to its finest start in several years. The Spartans have not 
win more than four games in each of the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Baptist is off to its second best start in Coach Maury Neville's 
16-year tenure. The Knights (10-3) started 11-3 in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Hollywood guard Arthur Lee is shooting 81.6% (31 of 38) from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark's Mike McKenzie, who stands only 5-10 and didn't figure prominently 
in Coach Tim Bednar's preseason outlook, has 74 rebounds in 15 games -- an 
average of 4.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousand Oaks soccer player James Pashley scored five goals and had two 
assists in victories last week against Channel Islands, Agoura and Westlake.

GORE PRESIDES AT L.A. SUMMIT ON INFO AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore took a meeting with the corporate elite of the 
entertainment and telecommunications industries Tuesday in a daylong summit in 
which he warned that the disadvantaged should not be left stranded on the 
shoulder of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a UCLA conference in which gray-suited industry titans mingled 
with Armani-clad deal-makers, Gore said the Clinton Administration is willing 
to break down regulatory barriers to permit telephone and cable TV companies to 
compete in offering a broad array of interactive services, but only if the 
information highway toll is not too steep. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president was accompanied by Lily Tomlin in the guise of her famous 
telephone operator character, Ernestine, which befit the Hollywood meets 
Washington meets Ma Bell meets Future Shock tone of the event. "Let me see if I 
understand," Tomlin said to Gore. "Is this about billions of Baco-Bits in the 
cyberspace salad bar?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 communications industry executives packed into UCLA's Royce 
Hall to hear Gore and powerbrokers such as TeleCommunications Inc. Chief 
Executive John C. Malone, News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, Sony Corp. of 
America President Michael P. Schulhof and QVC Network Chief Executive Barry 
Diller give divergent answers to that question during the daylong "Superhighway 
Summit" sponsored by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives generally praised the vice president's remarks. But there 
was no broad consensus achieved at the summit, and some worried about too much 
government interference, especially after Gore noted that the FCC will be 
involved in policing the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The devil will be in the details, but basically what we heard was right on," 
said Bell Atlantic Chief Executive Raymond Smith, one of the most aggressive 
proponents of the interactive future. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also offered some unexpected fireworks among the ego-charged 
panelists, with Time Warner Chairman Gerald R. Levin and Disney leader Michael 
D. Eisner trading pointed jabs during the final panel discussion of the day. 
When Levin pointed out that Warner Bros. had the leading domestic movie box 
office share three years running, Eisner countered that net profit is a more 
important measurement of success. 
</P>
<P>
 And tensions surfaced between companies laying the delivery lines and those 
committed to producing the programming -- which may be a hint of things to 
come. Among the concerns most commonly voiced: that producers will somehow be 
relegated to a second-class position. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the conference, the sun-drenched brick patio was transformed into a 
deal-making, handshaking, sunglass-wearing Hollywood playground as talent 
agents and studio executives emerged from the dark auditorium to see and be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the great schmoozefests of all time," gushed Peter Black, 
president of Xiphias, an Los Angeles-based interactive software firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the courtyard, a woman was screaming into her cellular 
telephone: "I was told it was a done deal! The numbers aren't negotiable!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that Barbra Streisand and Oprah Winfrey might put in appearances ran 
rampant through the parking lot staff, which included about 20 Secret Service 
support guards and their explosives-detecting dogs. ("We don't even pay any 
attention to the Hollywood types," averred security officer Scott McLean). 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists Quincy Jones and Diller came in through the back door, as did 
Tomlin. Still, UCLA traffic coordinator Steve Rand said this was not the 
biggest celebrity event UCLA had seen: "The MTV awards two years ago -- we 
filled the intramural field for that," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not atypically for Hollywood, the most compelling reason many gave for 
attending the conference was that everyone else was. For the last year, 
representatives of the communications and media industries have demonstrated an 
almost compulsive need to trade information highway metaphors at symposiums and 
conferences with titles such as "Digital World," "Multimedia Expo" and "Digital 
Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Although everyone agreed that the highway is coming -- and soon -- there was 
little consensus about how it will evolve, how much it will cost or how quickly 
people will be able to access it through their computers, telephones or 
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some said the summit was a good way for often-adversarial government 
and industry leaders to hash out their roles in building the nation's new 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're attempting to demystify this so people won't be scared into creating 
legislation," said former junk bond king Michael Milken, who is involved in 
interactive educational projects. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of the cable, phone and computer executives who have been working on 
the notion of interactivity for some time, Hollywood was just doing what it 
does best: creating a shared perception of reality that, in an odd cultural 
process, often becomes reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet members of the Hollywood crowd seemed unsure of their place in the 
sparring between phone, cable and computer executives over how digital age 
entertainment and information will be delivered. "I feel like an English major 
in an organic chemistry course," said Disney's Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't about programming," whispered HBO chief Michael Fuchs to his 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the participants said they expect entertainment applications to drive 
the building of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entertainment is going to be the core of every one of these opportunities," 
said Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. "What will drive this 
into the home is not the ability to get a license plate. The consumer wants 
'Jurassic Park.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The large turnout reflected the growing importance of the superhighway debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the Clinton Administration's regulatory packages will contain 
provisions that encourage private investment, foster competition and provide 
open and equal access to new networks. The legislation, he said, is designed to 
"avoid creating a society of information haves and have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president, who is spearheading the Administration's 
telecommunications policy, urged the media leaders to wire every school, 
library, hospital and clinic to the information superhighway by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must build a new model of public-private cooperation that, if properly 
pursued, can obviate many governmental mandates," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Ted Harbert, president of ABC Entertainment: "Schools can't even 
afford chalk, and they are talking about putting a personal computer on every 
desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner's Levin said Gore's call to wire all the schools, libraries and 
hospitals was in fact largely a reality. "We are much of the way there 
already," he said, noting that more than 80% of schools in areas served by Time 
Warner cable are already hooked up. "We don't want to see an information 
aristocracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Eisner: "We all knew this was coming. The concept is valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the Federal Communications Commission will be delegated the 
responsibility to design the "specific measures" to achieve the goal of 
universal service. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Gore appeared to leave a lot of room as to when and how the 
national information infrastructure develops. For example, Gore said the 
definition of universal service "will evolve as technology and the 
infrastructure advance." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Clinton Administration's goal of encouraging telephone and cable 
TV companies to build a "national information infrastructure," there were 
indications that a brutal competition lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability to create this electronic highway is the easy part," assured 
Richard C. Notebaert, president of Ameritech, a regional phone company. But he 
predicted there would be a lot of "road kill" as companies struggle to 
"determine what consumers want."

CLINTON GETS 1ST-CLASS TOUR OF CZECH CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, a leader known for thinking great thoughts on weekend 
retreats, was shown the sights of this history-steeped capital Tuesday night by 
a different sort of Renaissance man, Czech President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving from the Brussels NATO summit Tuesday afternoon for meetings with 
East European leaders before going on to summits in Kiev and Moscow, Clinton 
was led by the playwright-president around Prague castle, onto the 15th-Century 
Charles Bridge over the Vltava River, and out for an evening of dining and jazz 
in one of Central Europe's trendiest towns. 
</P>
<P>
 The one sour note of the evening occurred an hour and 40 minutes into 
Clinton's visit to the Reduta nightclub, when what turned out to be a 
firecracker went off in the street outside. The presidential limousine quickly 
pulled up onto the sidewalk in front of the club's door, and a tense-faced 
President strode briskly to the car as Secret Service agents held a bulletproof 
coat in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Clinton was back in the heavily policed safety of the Atrium 
Hotel, a structure as new as the Charles Bridge is old. 
</P>
<P>
 During his chats with Clinton, the gentlemanly Havel betrayed none of his 
government's recent unhappiness with the United States over the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization's insistence on slowing the new Eastern democracies' drive 
for membership. And he had praised Clinton in a radio address to Prague 
residents last Sunday as a man with "a remarkable ability to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 A long-anticipated highlight of the trip was to be the walk on the bridge, a 
twin-tower marvel begun in 1357 and adorned with 30 oversized statues of saints 
that is considered one of the most beautiful in Europe. To the east lay 
Prague's Old Town. Atop the soaring bluffs to the west is Hradcany Castle, a 
walled fortress that includes the presidential palace and the Gothic splendor 
of the Cathedral of St. Vitus. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle, illuminated in icy white light, towered above the ancient city and 
the dark, cold waters of the Vltava. It seemed a scene from a medieval fairy 
tale as the two leaders strolled along the fabled bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was the 20th Century, and this moment was not fated to be one of 
shared reflection for two contemplative heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides had been planning the event for months as a 
made-for-television spectacle of the U.S. President meeting a hero of the 
struggle that freed the captive nations of the former Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the two presidents were not quite alone: There were Czech police, 
the Secret Service and White House advance staffers, of course. There were TV 
newsmen Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Ted Koppel and their respective camera crews. 
Instead of sharing deep thoughts, the two leaders were giving interviews and 
struggling to be heard over the din of aides and crew members shouting "Down!" 
and "Get out of the shot!" to pedestrians stepping into the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 American culture was not far away. As Clinton strolled, a Dixieland band on 
the street below was serenading with "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, 
Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge has, in fact, become a testament to the unruly forces of the 
free-market capitalism that Clinton has come to Prague, in part, to celebrate. 
The bridge, built to the specifications of Charles IV, Czech king and Holy 
Roman Emperor, has now become a hive of street vendors hawking ceramics, 
knickknacks, inexpensive art, and even Western tapes and CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city residents complain the kiosk capitalists have made it impossible to 
enjoy the bridge except in early morning, and the government has tried -- 
without success -- to bring them under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit crowded the center-city area around the bridge with thousands 
of Prague residents, most of them young, many apparently familiar with 
Clinton's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Chaloupecka, a 26-year-old executive assistant, had heard about Clinton's 
decision to focus his Administration's efforts on domestic needs rather than 
foreign policy. "I think he's rather a courageous man," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prague has about 20,000 Americans among its 1.2 million inhabitants, and many 
of them were there to watch Clinton as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard E. Suydam, a teacher, said he wished Clinton the best on his domestic 
agenda but was not overwhelmed. "I've seen Presidents come and go," said 
Suydam, who exercised his American franchise to vote for Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 After their walk, Clinton and Havel headed for a pub called the Golden Tiger 
for Pilsner beer and breaded veal chops. 
</P>
<P>
 There, along with the beer and the huge slabs of meat, Clinton managed to 
squeeze in a conversation with Jirina Kopold and her husband, Bedrich. He had 
met them 24 years ago, when their son Jan was among his classmates at Oxford 
University. Jirina's mother, Marie Svernoa, a founder of the Czech Communist 
Party, had guided Clinton around Prague during his student days. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, it was off to the Reduta. Before his precipitous exit, according to 
those allowed inside, the President was handed the inevitable saxophone and 
played "Summertime" and "My Funny Valentine," his eyes tightly closed in 
concentration. He reportedly got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is on Narodni Street, where the so-called Velvet Revolution -- the 
almost bloodless overthrow of the Communist regime -- started on Nov. 1, 1989, 
with Havel playing a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, when Clinton visited Hradcany Castle as part of the 
official welcoming ceremonies, he was duly appreciative of its grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters in the Hapsburg Room, filled with portraits and gilt, 
Clinton stretched his arms wide and joked, "You'll notice President Havel's 
modest surrounding." 
</P>
<P>
 When he came to Prague as a student, he said, "No one invited me here." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters after a 45-minute private chat with Clinton, Havel insisted 
that his government was pleased with NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program 
aimed at bringing new Eastern nations slowly into the Western Alliance. "Our 
attitude to the plan is very favorable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it was clear the Czech leader wanted equal treatment. At the 
briefing, each man stood behind a lectern. But Havel, who at five feet six is a 
head shorter than Clinton, stood on a small step. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit is scheduled to include morning talks today with the leaders of the 
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will visit a historic Jewish cemetery in a quarter that Adolf Hitler 
once wanted to make part of a museum of extinct peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will visit a former state-owned department store that reopened last 
October as a Kmart and now overflows with Western-style consumer goods, 
including a Little Caesar's pizza restaurant.

 LESS CITY: The City Shopping Center in Orange has been losing "store after 
store," says General Manager Jack Boyster, since May Co. moved out two years 
ago. Soon they might all be gone. . . . Boyster says redevelopment plans "may" 
force The City to shut down all its stores by the end of this year. It would 
reopen, with a mix of new and old tenants, at the end of 1995. "When we're 
finished, we expect a bigger and better mall -- you won't even recognize the 
place," he says. . . . You might not recognize the name either. Boyster says no 
name has been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
 LIQUIDATION GAME: The latest casualty at The City is Clubhouse Pizza. Next to 
go: Oshman's Sporting Goods, which will shut down in two weeks after a major 
close-out sale. Several stores at The City are offering liquidation sales. But 
they aren't going out of business. . . . "We need these sales to compete with 
the other stores that are going out of business," says an employee at one 
women's store there. 
</P>
<P>
 SAD MEN: Good Housekeeping magazine this month lists the 327 best mental 
health experts in the country, and among them is Dr. Ellen McGrath, a Laguna 
Beach clinical psychologist. McGrath says it's men -- not women -- whose 
numbers are up in counseling. And mostly men over 45. . . . "As women's roles 
are changing, men are seeing their sex roles change," she says. "Some of these 
men are turning into couch potatoes without realizing why."

 THEY SHRUNK EO? The short 3-D film at Disneyland, "Captain Eo," starring 
Michael Jackson, has been such a popular attraction since it opened seven years 
ago that the Disney folks are coming up with another 3-D movie short. . . . 
This time it's "Honey, I Shrunk the Theater," based on the movie series of a 
similar name. Disneyland spokesman John McClintock says the new film, due by 
early 1995, may replace "Eo." But if it does, he insists, it has nothing to do 
with Michael Jackson's legal troubles.

COUPLE DIE IN LATEST IN SERIES OF ARSON FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 An elderly couple died Tuesday morning as a result of a house fire that 
investigators say may have been the work of a serial arsonist terrorizing a 
neighborhood of neat bungalows in Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Caleb Young, 85, died in the blaze and his wife, Ollie, 81, died after she was 
rushed to a hospital. Both victims suffered burns and smoke inhalation in the 
fire that gutted their white frame home, arson investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in the 2000 block of West 30th Street was one of a dozen suspicious 
blazes in the neighborhood over the last three to four weeks, said Phillip J. 
Weireter, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of fires has damaged houses, garages and vehicles, but there had 
been no injuries until the Youngs died Tuesday morning, Weireter said. He added 
that no suspects had been caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a neighbor's garage, one of those earlier arson blazes severely damaged 
the rear of the Youngs' home on Christmas Eve, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross had offered the couple vouchers to obtain temporary housing 
during repairs, but they were too attached to the bungalow to leave. The 
repairs had just begun when the second fire was set. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and relatives stood grieving in front of the burnt-out bungalow 
Tuesday afternoon. Smoke had stained the white, wooden shingles over the wide 
porch and heavy stone balustrades. Pink roses and bird of paradise flowers 
bloomed near the front steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the home was a charred ruin. The floor was crumbly, soft and wet. 
Family photos were blackened by heat and soot. Oddly, though, some things 
survived: albums, for example, in which the Youngs saved Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
 As arson investigators poked through the ashes for clues, firefighters fanned 
out through the neighborhood Tuesday afternoon, handing out leaflets to nervous 
residents. The residents were asked to call (213) 485-6175 if they had any 
information about the blaze. "This is one in a series of fires occurring 
recently in this area," the flyers read. 
</P>
<P>
 Weireter said investigators are exploring the possibility that all the blazes 
are the work of one arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, too, fear that a firebug may be stalking the area. Many of them are 
elderly people who have lived in the neighborhood for decades, raising their 
children in the well-maintained homes with neatly trimmed lawns. Over the 
years, the quiet avenues have been a peaceful enclave amid the meaner streets 
that surround the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought this little house in '45, and now all this trouble is started," 
said 79-year-old Moralle Gray, a widow who lives on 30th Street. She said that 
the garage of a neighbor to the rear of her home was recently set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to sleep with one eye open," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very scary," said Sherry Travis, a 20-year resident of the neighborhood, 
as she watered her lawn. "Will your house be next when you go to sleep?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frightening," agreed Sylvester Bank, who has lived in the neighborhood 
for 10 years. "I just wish somebody would catch whoever is doing it. I will be 
on the lookout for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Caleb and Ollie Young were married 54 years ago. They moved into the bungalow 
in 1946. Caleb worked as a presser at a dry cleaner in Burbank and Ollie was a 
homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just two people who lived for each other," said Alfonso Campbell, a 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youngs had no children, but they lavished attention on their nieces and 
nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Nephew Walter Young has fond memories of the late 1940s and early 1950s when 
he would ride streetcars to spend weekends at the home of his aunt and uncle. 
He also recalls his uncle driving him all the way to San Francisco to see a 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were warm and loving people," said Marilyn Young, Walter's wife. "I 
admired their strength as a couple. They just kind of nurtured everyone in 
their own little ways and with cards and phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 They also loved animals and had buried two dogs in a pet cemetery. Their last 
dog was a little mutt named Bobo. On Tuesday morning, he ran terrified from the 
flaming house, crossed the street, lay down and died.

NATO BROADENS THREAT TO LAUNCH BOSNIA AIR STRIKES; EUROPE: CLINTON AND ALLIES 
STATE READINESS TO SAVE OTHER AREAS AS WELL AS SARAJEVO. MILITARY ACTION 
APPEARS MORE LIKELY, BUT SECURITY COUNCIL APPROVAL IS NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and the 15 other Western Alliance leaders Tuesday broadened 
NATO's threat to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina, declaring they are prepared 
to launch air strikes in two areas -- in addition to Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision effectively extends the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
warning made last August to use air attacks to prevent the fall of the Bosnian 
capital to include the besieged Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Tuzla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of the United Nations Security 
Council, " said Tuesday's declaration, which came at the end of the two-day 
NATO summit meeting, "to carry out air strikes in order to prevent the 
strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other threatened areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
</P>
<P>
 An additional phrase, agreed to by the NATO leaders only at the last minute, 
said that NATO officials should draw up expanded plans for air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which Clinton stressed was made unanimously after prolonged 
official-level discussions Monday night and into the early hours Tuesday, 
appeared to make Western military intervention somewhat more likely. Clinton 
told a post-summit news conference that an actual decision to use force 
"depends largely on what the Bosnia Serbs do." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of NATO's potential involvement, however, no air strikes can 
be launched without the approval of the U.N. Security Council. Although the 
declaration widens and toughens the circumstances under which the alliance 
would use force in Bosnia, Clinton said he did not interpret it as a lowering 
of the tripwire that would send NATO aircraft -- mostly American jets -- into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that the threshold is lower," the President said, "but there are 
more instances in which air power can be used now under the NATO policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not air strikes would actually be launched, the President said 
before a NATO audience, "depends on the behavior of the Bosnian Serbs from this 
moment forward. . . . And what the military commanders come back and 
recommend." 
</P>
<P>
 Inclusion of the Tuzla region -- where nearly 1 million people live in the 
largest area still under Bosnian government control -- in NATO's new plan is 
aimed at reopening the airport in the eastern Bosnian city. That installation, 
which rebel Serbian units have kept closed, is considered vital for the flow of 
relief supplies to the region's beleaguered civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes to free the enclave of Srebrenica, southeast of Tuzla, would 
enable trapped Canadian forces among the U.N. peacekeepers there to be replaced 
by fresh Dutch troops. That transfer has been prevented by hostile Serbian 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who had warned against any new NATO 
threat, remained defiant Tuesday as his followers continued to besiege Sarajevo 
with an artillery assault. He reiterated an earlier position by stating, from 
his base just outside the capital, that the alliance declaration "would prompt 
us to reconsider land concessions offered to the Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, the Bosnian Serb army's chief of 
staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, played down the seriousness of NATO's new threats, 
the Associated Press reported. "They cannot strike at us without also hitting 
U.N. forces," he said. "Our tactics are to keep close to the U.N. troops." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Clinton had warned that the alliance should not use threatening 
language against the warring forces in Bosnia unless it was prepared to carry 
out the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Tuesday news conference, Clinton insisted that because he had 
recommended that strong language against the Serbs not be included in the 
declaration unless the alliance meant business, the threat was therefore real. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner also insisted that the alliance was 
prepared to act militarily. "My impression is that there is a clear 
determination not to continue the (Bosnian) situation as it stands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether NATO had a choice of acting militarily or "packing up and 
leaving," Woerner replied, "Preparedness to leave, no -- preparedness to do 
what is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement on air strikes reportedly came after a recommendation by the 
French and British, who along with the Canadians and Spanish have troops in the 
former Yugoslav federation under U.N. auspices. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior White House official told reporters aboard Air Force One that 
France and the United States were never at loggerheads over Bosnia and had 
reached basic agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
 At a NATO leaders' dinner Monday night, French President Francois Mitterrand 
and British Prime Minister John Major pushed for action on Srebrenica and 
Tuzla. Clinton said yes, but only if the declaration also reaffirmed the NATO 
commitment to Sarajevo, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said any use of U.S. air power at Srebrenica and Tuzla would be close air 
support of U.N. troops, and he added that the United States was also willing to 
supply technical assistance such as electronic equipment for the Tuzla airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official flatly ruled out any commitment of U.S. ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Major and Mitterrand were not enthusiastic about the idea of air 
strikes around Sarajevo, and he expressed concern that use of force there might 
constitute a major escalation, because it would constitute direct intervention 
on the side of the city's largely Muslim defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement on Bosnia came at the end of an extraordinarily successful 
European debut for Clinton in Brussels, the first leg of his first trip to the 
Old World as President. 
</P>
<P>
 As he departed for Prague later in the day, he could look back on a number of 
considerable achievements. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * He presided over the rejuvenation of an alliance that had lost its way amid 
the debris of the Cold War, restoring its sense of purpose and cohesion. "A 
historic turning point," Woerner said. At a news conference, Woerner said the 
leaders of the alliance were "impressed with the strong leadership, resolve, 
and personal conviction of the American President." Other leaders made similar 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 * He was able to announce Monday a major agreement with Ukraine and Russia to 
eliminate more than 1,800 warheads from Ukraine, now the world's third-largest 
nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
 * He sold his initially controversial "Partnership for Peace" initiative to 
some skeptical allies in such a way that, in the end, all signed on 
enthusiastically. The plan offers close military cooperation with the new 
democracies of the former Soviet empire, stopping short of offering the full 
NATO membership that many of these countries wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 * He blessed European unity and an independent West European security grouping 
in a manner that made Europeans glow yet at the same time underscored America's 
commitment to the continent by pledging to keep 100,000 troops there. 
</P>
<P>
 * With European Union Commission President Jacques Delors nodding approvingly 
beside him, Clinton also urged the rich nations of Europe to open their markets 
to the struggling new democracies to the east, arguing that increased trade is 
a key ingredient to the prosperity needed to fend off rising nationalism in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 * He survived the sensitive Bosnia issue and, although the alliance's new 
position hardly marked a bold departure, the President kept both his dignity 
and NATO's unity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps most important for transatlantic relations in the medium term, 
Clinton touched a chord among Europeans from prime ministers to taxi drivers 
that triggered an outpouring of warmth and goodwill in Western Europe unseen 
since the 1963 visit of another youthful American President -- John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall mood of the summit itself in many ways merely reaffirmed that at 
times of genuine crisis, Europeans appear willing to stop bickering among 
themselves and look to the United States for leadership.

RUSSIA'S NEW PARLIAMENT OFF TO A WILD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wild scrum around ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky trashed the 
cloakroom. An accused coup plotter was proposed as Speaker. And goggle-eyed 
deputies, appalled at the new levels of legal chaos, compared their new forum 
to a psychiatric ward. 
</P>
<P>
 But all in all, Russia's second attempt in recent history to launch a 
parliamentary democracy got off to a tolerable start Tuesday as its new 
lawmakers, elected last month in the country's first true multi-party 
balloting, opened their first session. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time ever, Russia has achieved accord on the rules and norms 
that are a must for all political forces," President Boris N. Yeltsin told 
deputies. "We must preserve this for the sake of national peace and to make 
sure dictatorship never returns to Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Duma -- the lower, 450-seat chamber expected to be the feistier -- the 
first key vote brought good news for Yeltsin, indicating that although his 
opponents appear to hold a majority, they may not be able to make it work. 
Nationalist and Communist groups failed to ram through a procedural move on the 
minimal size of factions and were forced to compromise with Yeltsin backers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies have a strong incentive to accommodate Yeltsin. The building where 
the Duma met is still missing windows, blown out in the battle over the Russian 
White House that raged last fall. Yeltsin dissolved Parliament in September and 
routed his armed opposition in early October with troops and tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Poltaranin, a close Yeltsin adviser, half-joked that at one point in 
the Duma session, he wanted to warn deputies that if they didn't shape up, the 
division that backed Yeltsin still had plenty of tanks and shells left. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, Poltaranin was cheered by signs that the new opposition will be 
weaker than it had appeared: "We didn't lose and we didn't win so the day is 
ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers faced another specter designed to keep them in shape. Dapper in a 
dark, German-made suit and alligator belt, Zhirinovsky threatened to dominate 
the session, even going so far as to make hand signals to the acting Speaker on 
how to put questions to the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by bodyguards, he created a rash of his now-familiar loudmouth 
scandals, beginning with the chaotic rush of cameramen that greeted his 
entrance, knocking over tables and coatracks in the cloakroom. A neo-fascist 
who advocates Russian military expansion southward and a one-party 
dictatorship, Zhirinovsky shocked the world by winning nearly a quarter of the 
Russian vote among party lists in Dec. 12 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 During the lunch break, he took swipes at Western leaders who have refused to 
meet him. He said it was "very strange" of President Clinton, who plans to snub 
him during this week's Moscow summit, to refuse to see a leading Russian 
opposition figure such as himself. Commenting on French President Francois 
Mitterrand's proposals for intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Zhirinovsky said 
that "in his dotage, he has gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 More worrisome, however, were Zhirinovsky's open attempts to control the Duma 
through its chairman, Georgy Lukava, a civil aviation official and member of 
Zhirinovsky's misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party. As the oldest member 
of the Duma, Lukava, 69, was given the privilege of opening the session. But 
then, instead of passing his chairmanship on to an elected Speaker, he turned 
the discussion in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukava -- who wore a pilot's uniform adorned with medals and who displayed a 
Soviet-era habit of calling deputies "comrades" -- kept his head cocked toward 
Zhirinovsky, who sent Lukava signals like a third-base coach on when to cut off 
a discussion and when to continue it. 
</P>
<P>
 When calls mounted for a new Speaker, Zhirinovsky snarled that Lukava would 
remain until a permanent Speaker was elected and ordered him to shut off the 
hall's microphones. Deputies finally grew so incensed that they boycotted all 
voting -- thus paralyzing the Duma -- to demand Lukava be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott succeeded -- another victory for pro-Yeltsin deputies and a sign 
that they will not be as outnumbered as they had feared, and might even seek to 
control about half of the Duma. When Dec. 12 voting results first came in, it 
had appeared that reformists could only count on a quarter to a third of 
lawmakers. But many independents apparently voted with them Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin allies hoping to push ahead with reforms also must cope with a 
Parliament thrown back to square one on rules of order. Yeltsin scrapped 
parliamentary guidelines developed over recent years, leaving deputies with 
little more than the new constitution and guesswork on how to run sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no documents but the constitution, that's why it's all I carry 
around with me," said Andrei Goltsblatt, a legal staffer at the Duma. "There 
are no written rules, no procedures. All you can do is try to interpret the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the lack of rules, the Parliament can be turned into Zhirinovsky's 
zombie," he said. "He tells them how to vote and they do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky lost in his attempt to keep Lukava as Speaker, but the chaos did 
seem to be reaching alarming levels, with prolonged disputes over everything 
from the majority needed for a vote to pass to when to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Makarov, of the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice bloc, walked out at the 
day's end with a tortured look in his eyes and would say only, "Psychiatric 
clinics have visiting days too." He added that a fellow Russia's Choice member 
who is a psychiatrist was best suited for the deputy's job. Several of his 
colleagues also compared the Duma to a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The circus atmosphere reached a climax in the late afternoon when Lukava 
proposed that he give up the chairmanship to Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the former 
chairman of the Soviet Parliament who is now on trial for his alleged role in 
the August, 1991, coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
Lukyanov is a Duma deputy, as are such colorful figures as reactionary TV 
journalist Alexander Nevzorov, psychic healer Anatoly Kashpirovsky and 
weightlifting champion Yuri Vlasov. 
</P>
<P>
 The upper chamber, the 178-seat Federation Council, roughly equivalent to the 
U.S. Senate, lived up to expectations that it would be more staid -- and more 
efficient -- than the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, meeting in quarters about a mile from the Duma's, whipped through 
technical questions and had begun voting on its new Speaker by Tuesday evening, 
with one of Yeltsin's allies, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir F. Shumeiko, 
the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Parliament met under a new state symbol -- the two-headed eagle -- and 
with a new name, the Federal Assembly. It has far fewer powers than its 
predecessor, which could change the constitution easily and ended up blocking 
many of Yeltsin's attempts to move away from communism and toward private 
property and a market-driven economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new constitution, Yeltsin has the right to dissolve the Duma under 
certain circumstances and work only with the Federation Council.

CONGRESS CAMPAIGN FUNDS GO FOR PLEASURE TRIPS, CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWIGHT MORRIS and WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a law barring diversion of campaign funds for personal use, members of 
Congress continue to spend their political war chests on pleasure trips, luxury 
cars or limousines and even memberships in the House gymnasium, according to 
reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEC has scheduled a hearing for today on proposals that would put new 
restrictions on campaign outlays that are primarily for personal benefit and do 
not advance candidates' election prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, which describes itself as a 
citizens' lobby, wants the agency to lay down tough new rules for use of 
campaign funds and then enforce them vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line for us is, members of Congress should not be living off their 
campaign funds," Wertheimer said. He will be a leadoff witness at the FEC 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's arguably personal, they should not be allowed to spend campaign funds 
for it without making a very strong case that it's justified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer said the FEC and the Senate and House ethics committees often have 
been negligent in enforcing a 1989 law that forbids "personal use" of money 
collected during election campaigns. At issue is how to define the vague phrase 
"personal use." 
</P>
<P>
 Some veteran politicians contend that it is impossible to distinguish between 
an event related to reelection, such as a dinner with prominent supporters, and 
a personal evening with friends who are political allies. 
</P>
<P>
 But an analysis of spending records filed with the FEC before the 1992 
election indicates that some expenses financed by campaign contributors confer 
considerable personal benefits on members of Congress or candidates for the 
Senate or House. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, $156,729 in campaign funds raised by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato 
(R-N.Y.) were used to lease and maintain two "campaign cars" in New York and 
Washington over a six-year period ending Dec. 31, 1992. In addition, D'Amato's 
campaign account paid $23,645 for limousines during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 One Lincoln Town Car was leased for $927 a month in Washington. Another 
Lincoln Town Car was leased for $647 a month in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the senator defended the expenditures. "These are all 
reasonable expenses for car services and transportation associated with the 
campaign," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.) used campaign funds to pay a $4,028 bill at 
the Four Seasons hotel on Maui in Hawaii, after her 1992 election but before 
she was sworn in as a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said the Hawaiian trip was originally envisioned for campaign 
fund raising. When that did not work out as planned, Moseley-Braun did not seek 
compensation from the campaign for an equal amount of personal expenses, the 
spokeswoman said. The report filed with the FEC, however, did not reflect that 
she paid for the Maui hotel out of personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign treasury also paid an unusually high salary of $144,550 to Z. 
Kgosi Matthews, the manager of her campaign. He also collected thousands of 
dollars in unitemized reimbursements from the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant meals were frequently financed by campaign funds, although the cost 
of the repasts did not appear to be related to enhancing election chances for 
the lawmakers who ran up the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), for example, used campaign money to pay for 
meals totaling $545 at a hotel in Jakarta and $349 at a hotel in Taiwan, along 
with smaller dinner bills in Singapore and Saudi Arabia. They were a small part 
of outlays over six years totaling $106,894 for restaurant meals that had no 
apparent connection to fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye used campaign funds to finance 403 meals costing less than $200 each, 
including a $12.50 bill at the Szechuan Garden in Rockville, Md., and a $22.59 
meal at the Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu. A spokeswoman at the senator's 
Honolulu office did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawmakers used campaign funds to pay $100 annual fees in the House gym, 
including Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) and Rep. Michael A. Andrews (D-Tex.). 
A spokesman for Hunter said the lawmaker has decided to pay his House gym 
membership -- now $400 a year -- out of his own pocket, although the FEC never 
frowned on the practice in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Some campaign money indirectly benefited family members of candidates. Rep. 
Ralph M. Hall (D-Tex.) paid $17,277 in rent over a recent two-year period for a 
campaign office in a building owned by two of his sons. "I don't see any 
problem with it. It's convenient . . . right next to my congressional office," 
Hall told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hall used campaign funds to pay his daughter-in-law, Jodie Hall, 
$39,644 in 1991-92 as his only full-time employee. "I want to have somebody 
there I can trust with my money," he said.

 Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) paid himself $21,459 to rent campaign space on the 
ground floor of a condominium he owns.

 Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.) used campaign funds to pay a $653 bill at the Doral 
Hotel in Miami in March, 1991, where he said he played golf on the famous Doral 
Open course with labor union backers attending winter meetings of the AFL-CIO 
in Florida. "It certainly was a difficult course, but it (the expense) was very 
much campaign-related," Frost insisted.

RELEASE WHITEWATER PAPERS, TOP CLINTON AIDES NOW SAY; WHITE HOUSE: PRESIDENT 
APPEARS TO BE LEANING TOWARD DISCLOSURE. CRITICISM OF PRIVACY ARGUMENT IS 
GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Senior White House officials have concluded that President Clinton and First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton must abandon their insistence on withholding 
documents related to their involvement in the Whitewater real estate project 
and begin disclosure promptly after the President's return from Europe, aides 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that Clinton may be ready to heed his aides' advice, the President 
noted, in a televised interview Tuesday night, that he had agreed earlier to 
cooperate with Justice Department investigators. But "people said that's not 
enough, so I think we have to evaluate that and see where we are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made the statement in an interview with Dan Rather on "CBS Evening 
News," in which he once again denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton aides, frustrated over the pounding the White House has taken on the 
issue, also said that they increasingly believe Atty. Gen. Janet Reno should 
appoint an independent prosecutor to look into allegations about Whitewater and 
the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in Arkansas. Reno has opposed 
such a move so far, but it has been advocated by a growing number of senior 
Democrats in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton and members of the senior staff have met several times to discuss 
the issue in recent days, according to officials who say the First Lady has 
modified her insistence that the papers are private and should not be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to assert privacy and say we don't have to do this, but 
there's a reality here. Nobody wants to see the presidency unravel over this. 
That's where it is," said one senior official when asked about the First Lady's 
view of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House officials continue to argue that Clinton should resist calls 
to release the papers, saying that the demands are politically motivated and 
that yielding would weaken him and the prerogatives of the presidency. But that 
camp appears to have dwindled in recent days as Administration officials have 
watched steady criticism wear away Clinton's support within the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three days, for example nine Democratic senators -- Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Charles S. Robb of Virginia, 
Bob Kerrey and J. James Exon of Nebraska, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, 
Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Russell D. Feingold of 
Wisconsin -- have said that they favor an independent prosecutor and public 
release of additional information. Those declarations wiped out an earlier 
White House policy of portraying all calls for an independent investigation and 
release of information as motivated by Republican partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence I have seen or heard about which suggests any wrongdoing 
on the part of the President or Mrs. Clinton," Feingold said. "But I do not 
believe it serves their interests or the interests of the nation to have any 
sort of shadow or questions about whether an unbiased investigation has been 
conducted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it is reality or not doesn't matter -- the perception is that the 
White House is withholding information," Kerrey told the Associated Press. 
"This one is not going away, so the way to get it off the table is to get 
someone independent to take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 That perception -- that the White House is trying to hide something -- has 
driven a raft of stories about Whitewater ever since the disclosure, shortly 
before Christmas, that a file relating to the investment had been in the office 
of White House lawyer Vincent Foster on the day he committed suicide. The file 
was removed subsequently by White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 After some initial delay, the President agreed to turn over that file and 
related papers to Justice Department investigators but has refused to make them 
public. David Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer, negotiated with the Justice 
Department to deliver the documents under a subpoena, a move aimed at 
preventing leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater was a real estate development company in which the Clintons 
invested with a friend, James B. McDougal, and his wife, Susan, in 1979. 
McDougal owned the Madison Guaranty thrift, which was seized by federal 
regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47.6 million. The real 
estate deal went sour as well, and the Clintons have said that they lost 
$68,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican members of Congress and government investigators have raised 
questions about whether money from the thrift may have found its way into 
Whitewater's coffers. They also have asked whether the thrift may have received 
favorable treatment from the Arkansas state authorities while Clinton was 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, White House officials tried to hold to that position and insisted 
that any further discussion of the matter was unwarranted. But aides have grown 
increasingly glum about the ability of Republicans to use Whitewater as a 
weapon against Clinton -- one that could undermine his credibility at precisely 
the time that he is preparing to launch what promises to be a titanic struggle 
over health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they expect to outline the case for disclosure 
to Clinton when he returns from his European trip. With Mrs. Clinton apparently 
resigned to the necessity of that position, aides expect it to prevail. But 
precisely what form the disclosures would take remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House officials in recent days have suggested a partial release of 
Whitewater documents in which some would still be withheld from the public. 
Many Democratic strategists, however, believe that approach would be futile and 
potentially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unclear is how the appointment of an independent prosecutor would be 
handled. So far, White House officials have taken the position that the 
decision is entirely up to Reno. Reno, in turn, has argued that she has no 
reason to appoint an independent prosecutor -- that the career prosecutors 
currently handling the case in the Justice Department are fully capable of 
acting independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno has argued that anyone she appoints directly would appear more political 
than a career prosecutor.

COLUMN ONE; BAD TIMES FOR A BOOM TOWN; IN THE '80S, MORENO VALLEY WAS A MODEL 
OF AFFORDABLE, IF REMOTE, SUBURBIA. THEN CAME THE RECESSION. TODAY, ROCKED BY 
FORECLOSURES AND DASHED HOPES, THE CITY TRIES TO REGAIN ITS BALANCE.

<P>
 With a spirit that harked back to the migration of Dust Bowl refugees to 
California, Jon and Therese Crupi moved to this residential frontier in 1987, 
beckoned by the promise of security and the new life they thought it offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crupis -- and a hundred-thousand others like them during the 1980s -- fled 
not drought and dust, but the real estate madness of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties and the maladies of urban life. In so doing, they created the 
fastest-growing city in California and a construction boom stoked by 
middle-class hopes and affordable housing on these onetime potato fields and 
sheep ranches 70 miles east of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Crupis are learning a bitter lesson of recessionary economics. They 
owe more on their house than it's worth after they re-mortgaged it in 1990; 
they're six months behind on their payments and they're thinking about handing 
the key to the lender and walking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley, a boom town in a boom county in a boom decade, has gone bust 
for the Crupis and thousands of others who stand on the brink of financial 
ruin. The city, which once seemed a picture-book suburban success story, now 
offers a cautionary tale for other outlying meccas built on the urban flight of 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 So what went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Moreno Valley represents the blooming of a good idea at a bad 
time. In the 1980s, people seeking an affordable version of suburbia stretched 
their finances to the limit to enter the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strategy that made sense when Southern California's economy was 
healthy. And lenders cooperated, arranging mortgages with very small down 
payments. But when the aerospace, real estate and construction industries 
collapsed a few years ago, these new homeowners' equity -- and the city's 
fortunes -- fell precipitously. The pendulum swing has left Moreno Valley and 
many of its residents struggling to regain their balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people had higher expectations than were realistic," said Mayor Bonnie 
Flickinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds City Manager Norm King: "There's no question, a lot of expectations have 
been dashed, both among residents and at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Life is still good here, they say, just not as good as some people had thought 
it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by many measures, this community, which is entering its 10th year of 
cityhood, is maturing handsomely now that the construction dust of the 1980s 
has settled. Trappings of the good life abound: civic and church groups for 
adults, sports and Scouts for the youngsters. Tidy subdivisions inside 
cinder-block walls sprawl across the city's 50 square miles; neatly tailored 
retail and business centers flank both sides of the Moreno Valley Freeway -- 
California 60. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moreno Valley also rates high in areas in which no city wishes to excel. A 
little more than 1,000 of Moreno Valley's 22,608 mortgage holders -- almost 
4.5% -- had their homes repossessed in 1993, according to TRW REDI Property 
Data, which provides real estate statistics to lenders. That is one of the 
worst rates in Southern California. The value of the defaulted mortgages: 
$123.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of default notices was twice that of Southern California as a whole, 
said John Karevoll, financial editor of Dataquick Information Systems, another 
real estate database service. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate bust has sent shock waves from the neighborhoods to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1989 -- riding the development boom -- the city luxuriated with $16 
million in reserves on a $45-million annual operating budget, reflecting a 
steady stream of developers' fees. In 1992, its savings dropped to $2.8 
million. Since then, the City Council has eliminated 87 of 301 city jobs and 52 
employees were laid off to save $2 million annually. By doing so, the city 
hopes to have $5.6 million in the bank by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The current financial difficulties contrast with the city's earlier problems 
-- simply keeping pace with the astronomical growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moreno Valley Unified School District has tried mightily -- and for the 
most part successfully -- to add enough classrooms to keep pace with the flood 
of students, but it is still in need of another high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement also has suffered in the boom and bust cycle; the city 
contracts with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department but can only afford to 
hire less than one officer per 1,000 residents, giving Moreno Valley one of the 
lowest policing levels in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Moreno Valley was ripe for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "A huge portion of Moreno Valley's homeowners bought when property values were 
fairly high, and they put down very small down payments," Karevoll said. 
"Today, property values have dropped to, or below, the level of the mortgages 
themselves. Homeowners don't have any equity left." 
</P>
<P>
 But the view was different in the mid-'80s. Attracted by housing prices half 
that of metropolitan Los Angeles, these first-time homeowners accepted horrific 
commutes as the price for freshly built homes, driveways with no oil stains, 
streets with no gangs and the camaraderie of other young families sharing the 
same dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley was not the only place that drew newcomers chasing the notion 
that a better life could be found on the fringe of a metropolis. Antelope 
Valley, Chino Hills, Rancho Cucamonga and Temecula also boomed. Communities 
like these, spawned in the late 1980s just as the real estate market was 
peaking, took the hardest hit when the bottom fell out, Karevoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Moreno Valley is still a model suburban community. 
</P>
<P>
 The town is flush with youth sports; the local Bobby Sox girls softball team 
won the national championships last summer on its first try. 
</P>
<P>
 Churches -- many of them still operating out of storefronts and other rented 
buildings -- far outnumber bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure there's graffiti, but it is eliminated within 24 hours by diligent city 
paint and sandblasting crews who respond to a graffiti hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed, police-trained citizen volunteers patrol the streets with two-way 
radios. They not only help thwart crime, police say, but also check on homes 
when occupants are away and provide traffic control at accidents. The volunteer 
patrol is so popular that there is a waiting list for the next training class. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no civic centerpiece in town, but there is the next best thing: a 
sparkling, year-old shopping mall that might as well be the town center, 
complete with security guard towers to watch over the parking lot. Indeed, city 
officials hold office hours not at City Hall but at the mall's food court, 
where they meet with constituents next to the carousel. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley, many say, is still homey, despite the numbers. "I love this 
town," said Sheryl Hart, who moved here 8 1/2 years ago from an Irvine townhome 
and teaches math at the local adult school. "I've never been to the mall for 
more than a half-hour where I don't run into someone I know. It's not like 
Orange County. We've still got a small town atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so, but things are changing rapidly. From 1980 -- four years before 
the city incorporated -- to 1990, the area's population increased from 28,309 
to 118,779; today, growth has stalled as it approaches 135,000. The rapid 
change and declining financial fortunes of the city have exacted a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were first-time home buyers who were already living on the 
edge who decided to make the move out there and make the (financial) stretch," 
said Roger Cruzen, spokesman for Great Western Bank. "That was the theory of 
the day, before the market hit its peak: To stretch, and get as much house as 
you could. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then these people got even closer to the edge, living from one paycheck 
to the next to make their house payments." 
</P>
<P>
 The repercussions of sudden growth -- followed by its sudden drop-off -- have 
also hit City Hall, which is grappling to catch up to provide streets, services 
and other amenities for the young city. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the school district increased elementary schools from seven to 21; 
grew from one middle school to eight, and from one high school to four. The 
district still needs one more high school -- but doesn't have the money to 
build it -- and is talking about double sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 By its own standards, the city is woefully behind in establishing parks and 
ball fields -- and is working with the school district to share playgrounds and 
other recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With gang and other criminal activity increasing, law enforcement remains 
understaffed. Moreno Valley's rate of serious crime was 76.6 per 1,000 
residents in 1992, according to the FBI. That rate was significantly lower than 
the city of Los Angeles (93.6) and significantly higher than Orange County 
(56.3). 
</P>
<P>
 And the city is still struggling to develop a local job base, hobbled by the 
recession. A disproportionate number of local residents were employed in 
defense and aerospace jobs in Southern California, and regional cutbacks have 
hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest nearby employer is March Air Force Base, which abuts the city's 
southwest boundary. But the base's post-Cold War role has left local officials 
worried about its future as an employer. For now, the largest private source of 
jobs in the city is Price Club, with 300 employees; the largest manufacturer is 
a Rohr Industries plant, where 235 workers build aircraft engine covers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Employment Development Department estimated Moreno Valley's 
unemployment rate in November at 12.6%, compared to 11.8% for Riverside County 
as a whole, and 8.6% for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno Valley is still a bedroom community, with three-quarters of its 
employed residents holding jobs outside the city, according to a City Hall 
survey. Jobs simply have not followed the residential flood to Moreno Valley, 
sparking concern about the insidious effects of long hours on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are letting their marriages go into remote control, and now they're 
eroding," said the Rev. Bob Mink, pastor of Moreno Valley Christian Church. 
"The commutes not only take time out of their lives, but add a fatigue to it 
they don't always recognize." 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in property values added new financial stresses to families 
disheartened that urban woes have followed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowell Myers, a professor at USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning and a 
self-described student of the American Dream, says disillusionment typically 
accompanies the birth of a new community, especially when its residents are 
overtaken by the same quality of life problems they were fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they bought into just isn't there anymore," he said of young families' 
dreams and investments. "It's more congested, the crime has followed them out, 
and the deal they thought they were getting -- the cheapest home around -- 
isn't a deal anymore. Now they're in the hole, they've still got long commutes, 
and they're surrounded by urban problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, of course, has soured on Moreno Valley. Truck driver Dave Allen 
moved his young family here nine years ago and bought his first house for 
$67,000; they sold it for double that in 1989 and purchased a larger home for 
$158,000. Allen said he doesn't know what the newer house is worth today -- and 
doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place has gotten a bad rap -- gangs, violence. . . . Well, I don't see 
it," he said. "This is a great place. People who bought here for an investment 
are eating it. But we moved here to live here, and we love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers think Moreno Valley and communities like it will rebound. Great 
Western's Cruzen notes that with property values apparently bottoming out, 
Moreno Valley is again "an incredibly attractive place for the first-time 
market. We're seeing extremely favorable (home) prices. One person's misfortune 
is another's opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the unfortunate are the Crupis, who thought they were sitting pretty in 
1987 when they bought the house, for $83,900, with an FHA loan of less than 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Crupi already had an hourlong commute to his job as an assistant 
controller at a Garden Grove company. The drive worsened when the company moved 
to Irvine and he could find no equivalent job closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Jon if he could handle the drive," Therese Crupi said. "He said, 
'When I pull into the driveway at night and my kids come running out to hug me, 
I'll know I'm home, and everything is fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Crupis -- on a tight budget with mounting bills -- fell further 
into debt and took out a second mortgage. The house was reappraised at $117,000 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the burden of the bigger debt, Jon Crupi was no longer being 
greeted in the driveway by his children. They were in bed when he left for 
work, and in bed when he came home. Because of the commute, he was "comatose" 
in the evening and literally woke up in the morning in a cold sweat, his wife 
said. Increasing marital stress sent the Crupis into counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom fell out when Jon Crupi's work began to suffer and he lost his job. 
In October, he finally found new work, 15 minutes east of here in Beaumont. But 
the Crupis worry that it might have come too late. They are six months 
delinquent on their first mortgage. Combined with the second mortgage, they owe 
$106,000 on a home that is worth less than that, based on the sales of 
comparable homes in their neighborhood, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first glance, this was a great place to live. All the conveniences were 
here -- movie theaters, miniature golf, Mervyns, Toys R Us," Therese Crupi 
said. "But with the gangs, all the unsupervised latchkey kids, the (financial) 
stress . . . well, we're sick and tired of the American Dream as it relates to 
this place. We want to get out of here.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't call us victims of Moreno Valley because we signed up for this," a 
resigned Therese Crupi said of her experience. "But now we're trapped."

VONS OPENING IN COMPTON STIRS ECONOMIC HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are already nearly 600 supermarkets in Los Angeles County, but the 
opening of a new Vons this morning in downtown Compton is being treated with 
the same degree of hoopla usually reserved for the first Wal-Mart in a lonely 
stretch of mid-America. 
</P>
<P>
 High school bands. Live radio broadcasts. A VIP buffet. To community and 
corporate officials, the Vons in the Compton Renaissance Plaza shopping center 
represents a milestone -- the first new full-service supermarket to open in an 
area scarred by the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supermarkets are significant because inner-city residents pay (up to) 15% to 
20% more for food products than suburbanites," said Bernard Kinsey, co-chair of 
RLA, the private agency created as the city's main response to combat the 
effects of the riots. "By increasing competition, we'll get better prices, 
quality and service. And that's what is lacking in the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the level of excitement also serves to underscore the continuing need for 
more retail services and jobs in neighborhoods impacted by the riots. It also 
focuses a harsh spotlight on the degree of new job-creating investments by 
other industries in the riot-torn areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than flee, as took place after the Watts riots of 1965, most major 
inner-city retailers agreed to rebuild. For companies such as Food 4 Less -- 
the primary supermarket chain in South-Central Los Angeles, which saw two of 
its outlets burned down and 40 others looted -- rebuilding was no minor 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The supermarket industry, however, has been the only major corporate player to 
pledge substantial chunks of capital for new inner-city business development 
since the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Of about $280-million that RLA (formerly known as Rebuild L.A.) says has come 
in corporate pledges that would directly result in new jobs and businesses, 
$220-million is from Vons, Ralphs, Smart & Final and Food 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 The commitment by supermarkets in Los Angeles also reflects an emerging 
national trend of inner-city development that preceded the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newark, N.J., community activists helped establish a supermarket in a 
neighborhood that lacked one for 20 years. New supermarkets have also begun 
opening in neglected neighborhoods of Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Miami, San Diego 
and Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Marketing Institute, a national trade group, launched its own urban 
community building initiative in March, 1992, and will soon meet with a task 
force of the National League of Cities to develop methods to make it easier for 
supermarkets to open in urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarkets are considered a key component to rebuilding efforts in 
neighborhoods with chronic unemployment because they have a multiplier effect, 
providing additional jobs and services while serving as a magnet to attract 
additional small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Markets are sort of the cement, the nuts and bolts needed for additional 
businesses to prosper," said Food 4 Less Vice President Darius Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the market for new markets is particularly strong, according 
to a recent Consumers Union report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to other cities, Los Angeles is a very expansive territory and -- as 
a result -- public transportation is not as efficient," said Mariko Takayasu, a 
spokeswoman for Consumers Union. "That means residents of South-Central Los 
Angeles have to rely more on liquor stores." 
</P>
<P>
 RLA Executive Board member Marilyn Solomon calls the supermarket investments 
"an appropriate initial step. . . . Clearly, the community (also) needs other 
kinds of facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, meanwhile, say that RLA's $220-million figure in new investment is 
exaggerated because Vons and others had already planned to open inner-city 
outlets before the riots and because the locations of new markets include North 
Hollywood, Pomona and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five minutes after RLA opened its doors, the whole county said (the 
rebuilding efforts) can't just be for South-Central Los Angeles or Pico-Union," 
said Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition for Substance 
Abuse Prevention and Treatment, which has led the fight to limit liquor stores 
in South-Central. "The minute it was diffused, pretty soon North Hollywood was 
declared the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
 Vons spokeswoman Julie Reynolds said the 352-market chain -- whose 
$100-million pledge to open up to 12 outlets has been touted by RLA as the 
largest single post-riot corporate investment in inner-city neighborhoods -- 
decided in late 1991 to launch an urban development program. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1960s through 1980s, the growth in Southern California occurred 
primarily in suburban areas -- it was more difficult to operate in urban areas 
and many retailers focused on the easier growth opportunity," Reynolds said. 
"We took a look at the population density in the inner city and identified 
approximately 1.7 million to 2 million inner-city residents who . . . did not 
have access to a Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the disturbances broke out several months later, executives at Vons made 
a rapid and prudent reassessment," Reynolds said. "That resulted in an 
expansion and acceleration of the urban development program." 
</P>
<P>
 Vons -- the Southland's largest supermarket chain, which for years had shut 
stores in South-Central Los Angeles -- says it will also open a new supermarket 
in Inglewood this year and another at Slauson and Vermont avenues in 
South-Central in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its $100-million urban development commitment, Vons also includes a 
new store that opened last month in Pomona and another opening later this year 
in North Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlet opening today in Compton was designed, developed and constructed by 
African American firms and its 103-employee staff will include several 
graduates of a government-funded post-riot job-training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "People give rhetoric to wanting to help inner cities -- this is the way to do 
it," said black activist Danny Bakewell, whose Compton Commercial Development 
Corp. was the project developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly across Compton Boulevard from a Boys market, the new Vons will offer 
much needed competition and a wider array of services, said shoppers outside 
the Boys. The new Vons complex will house a First Interstate Bank, a dry 
cleaning center, and service delis and bakeries, unlike the chain's only other 
South-Central outlet, on El Segundo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Ralphs, the first of four new urban supermarkets pledged by the 
Compton-based chain opened last June on Magnolia Boulevard in North Hollywood. 
Another is slated for the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood supermarket is considered to lie within an area in which 
RLA is seeking to spur investment, Kinsey acknowledged, because at least 20% of 
the neighborhood's residents live below the federal poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't define what the RLA area is," said Ralphs Chairman Byron Allumbaugh. 
"It just so happened that our North Hollywood store fit into that area. We've 
been working on that location for 10 years and we finally got it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Smart & Final, which operates discount outlets that sell food products in 
bulk, has opened four new stores since the riots -- in South-Central Los 
Angeles, Huntington Park and West Hollywood. The 135-store chain has pledged 
$50 million to build 12 new outlets in neglected neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these stores would "absolutely" have been opened with or without 
riots, said spokeswoman Leanne Reynolds. "(The unrest) accelerated our program 
because it clearly called into attention the demand and the need. And we also 
saw at the same time real estate values were going down and we were able to get 
more real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said Smart & Final also intends to participate in developing two new 
shopping centers in Inglewood. Kinsey, who will soon step down from his RLA 
post, is expected to announce today that he is forming a private real estate 
investment trust to help develop at least one of the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less, which owns the Boys, Viva and Alpha Beta chains, has pledged $10 
million to keep Los Angeles high school athletic programs funded. It has also 
targeted $30-million in new supermarket investment, according to RLA. However, 
only one of four projects -- at Imperial Highway and Western Avenue -- is new. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other projects described as a new investment is the planned 
construction of a market on a Community Redevelopment Agency-administered lot 
at Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. That project has been on the drawing 
board for nearly a decade, drawing protests from community groups because the 
land has remained vacant for so long.

 CAR CULTURE: The percentage of San Fernando Valley workers who use public 
transport is small in all communities, above, but there is a range of 
fluctuations in local bus-a-phobia. . . . For example: 7.5% use public 
transport in Mission Hills-Panorama City-North Hills, 6.4% in North Hollywood 
and 6.2% in Van Nuys-North Sherman Oaks. It's 1.7% in Chatsworth-Porter Ranch 
and only 1.3% in Granada Hills.

 FURRY FRIENDS: West Valley homeowners angry over the decision to halt coyote 
trapping have a new thing to be annoyed at: There are now so many coyote 
complaint calls to Los Angeles animal regulation officers -- about 30 a day -- 
that they were ordered to stop responding and refer callers to a downtown 
spokesperson (B1). "People have a pressing problem . . . and cannot get an 
answer from officers with 30 years of field experience," a Woodland Hills 
resident complained. 
</P>
<P>
 NO LICENSE: How do you register an otherwise legally owned handgun? Well, you 
don't, as the Street Beat column explains (B2). 
</P>
<P>
 GIFT HORSE: For just about anybody else, what to do with a 5% pay raise would 
pose no problems. But not for elected public officials such as those on the Los 
Angeles City Council and Board of Supervisors. With just one exception, they 
chose not to take the raise, given the gloomy state of local government funding 
(B5).

 KICK'S AFTERMATH: It's just a soccer game between two private Valley high 
schools, but it carries a lot of hidden emotional freight. Notre Dame plays at 
Harvard-Westlake today, returning to the field where a media and legal bomb 
went off a year ago (C8). A Harvard player injured Notre Dame's Ryan Herrera by 
kicking him in the head -- and was arrested, apparently the first such case in 
state history. . . . Playing for Notre Dame: Herrera, who says he still has 
neurological problems. Using Public Transport

 STEERING GROWTH: More than 85% of Ventura County's population lives in cities 
-- and county leaders want to keep it that way. . . . A decade ago, the county 
adopted a policy limiting most growth to cities. "Cities are better able than 
the county to deliver urban services," said Stan Eisner of the Local Agency 
Formation Commission, which manages city boundaries. . . . Another benefit: 
preventing sprawl. "You can drive from city to city through open fields," 
Eisner said. "If we didn't do this, we'd look like the San Fernando Valley."

 FAT FIGHTERS: At Ventura County meetings of Take Off Pounds Sensibly, 
membership is swelling -- literally. "I've had lots of calls from people who 
have gained weight over Christmas," said Kari Lee Patterson of Oxnard, who 
oversees TOPS' 11 local chapters. . . . The meetings offer weigh-ins, 
encouragement and awards for lost poundage. "Sometimes it takes 10 years, but 
they do it," she said. . . . Next rush: "Just before summer, when swimsuit 
season starts." 
</P>
<P>
 PAIN RELIEF: If deciding between aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen already 
gives you a headache, here comes Aleve, the first new over-the-counter pain 
medication in a decade (D1). . . . The drug, sold by prescription as Naprosyn, 
is good for aches in joints and teeth, said pharmacist Bob Field in Thousand 
Oaks. . . . Over-the-counter sales are fine, he said, but should be limited to 
drugstores where buyers can ask questions. "For 17 years, the FDA said this is 
a dangerous drug. It shouldn't be sold at 7-Eleven." 
</P>
<P>
 CHURCH RELIEF: That Christmas Eve burglary attempt at Ventura's Our Lady of 
the Assumption Church hasn't been solved. But the church has received donations 
of $1,000 and $200 for repairs. . . . "We didn't solicit them; we just 
announced what happened," Msgr. Donal Mulcahy said. The burglar did $985 damage 
to the church's vault, which contained gold-plated chalices but no cash. . . . 
"People think the collection money is in there," Mulcahy said. "We send it 
straight to the bank." Urban County

NEEDLE EXCHANGE CUTS RISKS, STUDY FINDS; AIDS: UNDERGROUND SAN FRANCISCO 
PROGRAM CURBS ADDICTS' SHARING OF SYRINGES, DOCTORS REPORT. SURVEY REBUTS 
CHARGES THAT SUCH PRACTICES PROMOTE DRUG USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An underground needle exchange program in San Francisco -- illegal but 
operating with the express backing of the mayor and the tacit approval of 
police -- has been found to be highly effective in reducing risky behavior 
among drug addicts and, contrary to the fears of critics, does not promote drug 
abuse, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The research, published in today's issue of the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., along with similar research from New York, prompted leading 
doctors in Los Angeles to call for a far-reaching needle exchange program in 
Los Angeles County, where a small underground program has met with limited 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's report, researchers from UC San Francisco interviewed 5,644 
intravenous drug users and discovered that as participation in the needle 
exchange program went up, the percentage of addicts who shared syringes -- a 
practice that puts them at risk for infection with the virus that causes AIDS 
-- went down, from 66% before the exchange began four years ago to 35% now. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the study found, the average age of intravenous drug users has 
increased, while the number of first-time drug users has dropped dramatically 
-- indications that the needle exchange is not enticing young people into a 
life of drug abuse, as some critics have contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that syringe exchange reduces needle sharing and doesn't 
lead to increased substance abuse," said John Watters, a UC San Francisco 
health policy analyst and lead author of the study. "I am disappointed that the 
policy decisions that are being made with respect to this issue are being made 
based on fear and ideology, rather than on scientific evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-volunteer program, called Prevention Point, allows intravenous drug 
users to trade their dirty syringes for clean ones. It began in 1988, with 
volunteers passing out clean syringes as they pushed a beat-up baby carriage in 
which addicts could surreptitiously deposit their used needles. It has since 
won city backing and expanded to seven sites in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years Gov. Pete Wilson has vetoed legislation that would have made 
this project legal and cleared the way for others like it. But in March, 1993, 
San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan defied Wilson and declared a public health 
emergency so that the city could provide funds for the Prevention Point. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, meanwhile, officials of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. 
convened a news conference Tuesday afternoon to call on local authorities to 
follow Jordan's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data seems to be pretty conclusive now that these needle exchange 
programs do help to reduce the transmission of AIDS and other blood-borne 
diseases," said Dr. Richard Wigod, chairman of the group's committee on AIDS. 
"We would like to see this done here in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospects for that are uncertain. Mayor Richard Riordan and the County 
Board of Supervisors have supported the legislation that Wilson vetoed, but 
whether they would invoke emergency powers to defy the governor and expand the 
Los Angeles program is unclear. AIDS activists are now trying to persuade them 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can work out the process of making it happen, all evidence suggests 
that it will in fact happen," said Phill Wilson, public policy director for 
AIDS Project Los Angeles, an activist group. But John Schunhoff, the county's 
AIDS program director, was more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best bet is we'll go on with the current situation, which is that there 
are underground programs but not official funding or sanction by the county," 
he said. "But that's just my bet. I don't know for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 There an estimated 1.5 million intravenous drug users in the United States and 
400,000 in California. AIDS infection rates in this population vary greatly, 
however, although experts are not certain why. Some studies suggest that half 
of all IV drug users in New York are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus. But in San Francisco, the estimate is 14%, and in Los Angeles, 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco and New York studies published in today's journal add to a 
growing body of medical evidence showing that needle exchange programs reduce 
risky behavior among intravenous drug users. None of these studies, however, 
has proved that clean-needle projects actually cut down on the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York researchers did report that their city's needle exchange 
program -- which became legal in the summer of 1992 -- has helped keep AIDS 
infection rates stable. The lead author of the study, Don C. Des Jarlais of 
Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, said he expects to be able to show 
the program actually caused infection rates to go down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably start seeing that in our 1993, '94, '95 and '96 data," he 
said. "We see dramatic decreases in sharing, so there is good evidence that 
even the underground syringe exchanges were having an effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the New York project became legal, participation has skyrocketed, from 
1,000 addicts to 17,000, Des Jarlais said. The San Francisco researchers found 
similar patterns. During the spring of 1989, shortly after the program began, 
it exchanged 7,821 needles, compared with 343,883 in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Watters and his colleagues found, 61% of all the addicts they 
interviewed had used the needle exchange within the previous year, and nearly 
half -- 45% -- said they usually obtained syringes from Prevention Point.

DEFENSE SAYS WRONG PRIEST IS ACCUSED IN EMBEZZLEMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for a Simi Valley priest accused of embezzling $60,000 in church 
collection money won permission Tuesday to fight the charges with a new 
allegation: Another priest did it. 
</P>
<P>
 As jury selection began in the trial of Father David Dean Piroli, the attorney 
told Superior Court Judge Allan Steele that the money actually was embezzled 
from St. Peter Claver Church by its head pastor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Grand Jury indicted Piroli in 1992 on two counts of theft, 
alleging that he had taken the collection money from St. Peter Claver in Simi 
Valley while he was assistant pastor there and from the church where he worked 
previously, Sacred Heart in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Beada said he has evidence that Father James McKeon 
took cash and checks from parishioners' donations, then planted the money in 
Piroli's car and bedroom because the younger priest threatened to blow the 
whistle on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele agreed to let Piroli use the defense, but the judge refused to admit 
other new allegations: a prosecution claim that Piroli kept company with and 
spent money on a male prostitute, and a defense contention that McKeon 
frequented a gay bathhouse in Los Angeles. Steele ruled that neither of the 
issues have direct bearing on whether Piroli took church funds. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who was Piroli's supervisor and has since moved on to become a pastor 
in a Westlake Village parish, declined through a church employee to comment on 
Beada's statements. And Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which oversees the priests, said he had no 
knowledge of the allegations and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Piroli came to light in May, 1992, when Hollywood police were 
called to roust loiterers outside a Sears store and found Piroli sitting in his 
church car with a young man, a small amount of cocaine and $10,000 in small 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Church employees later found $50,000 more in Piroli's rooms at the rectory, 
along with parishioners' donation checks and St. Peter Claver collection 
envelopes, some of them torn open, prosecutors said. Donations were ordinarily 
taken to a safe place in the church offices before they were deposited in a 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, as prosecutors and church officials pondered possible criminal 
charges against him, Piroli disappeared. He resurfaced July 30, 1992, at the 
U.S.-Mexico border, trying to re-enter California with two illegal immigrants 
in his trunk. One of them, Israel Palacios, was the same man who was with 
Piroli in Hollywood when he was initially arrested, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace sought permission to have a 
Hollywood police officer testify about the cocaine and to identify Palacios as 
a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace argued that such evidence would back her theory that Piroli was 
embezzling church funds to support a cocaine habit and a boyfriend. She also 
sought permission to show jurors pornographic pictures found in Piroli's rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele said he would allow jurors to hear evidence about the drugs and see a 
photograph of Palacios in swimming trunks that was found in Piroli's possession 
-- to support Peace's contention that Piroli was spending money on the man and 
had a close relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said he would not allow jurors to hear the prostitution 
allegation unless Palacios had been convicted as a prostitute. The judge also 
refused to allow the prosecution, without such proof, to show the jury the 
pornography or to inform it of Palacios' presence in the car trunk.

ON CALIFORNIA: DANCING WITH DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And now, from those wonderful folks who taught us that we are what we drive, 
that beyond mere transportation automobiles are about luxury or freedom or 
muscle or even patriotism, the heartbeat of America and all that, now comes a 
new pitch. Environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 We begin with Natural Gus. Natural Gus is a dinosaur-mascot, sort of like 
Barney. Unlike Barney, Gus is not his own boss. He works for General Motors. 
Monday the mascot could be found at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, an 
annual Convention Center extravaganza designed to let auto makers show off the 
latest in fender curves and fuel injection systems. This year the show offers a 
theme: The Automobile and the Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Natural Gus. He stood on an exhibit hall stage, singing to a small 
clutch of children about clean air and alternative fuels -- natural gas, see? 
-- and, most of all, about GM's commitment to clean skies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earth is our home," Gus sang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep it clean," Gus sang some more. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, he assured the kiddies, will do its "best, but it's up to you to do the 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Move now to Ford's corner of the show. Amid a sprawl of new pickups and 
redesigned Mustangs, Ford representatives have placed on display a "Yuletide 
card" box, allowing show attendees to recycle Christmas cards -- proceeds to 
benefit a "nonprofit, non-sectarian home for neglected and abused children." 
Close by looms a huge color portrait of a pristine mountain scene -- snowcaps 
and blue skies reflected on the surface of a lake. "Ford," a caption declares, 
"supports conservation of endangered species, preservation of tropical rain 
forests and natural births of animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, it's the same. From Toyota to Mercedes, almost every major car 
maker is showing off a prototype of some kind of electric or solar or gas 
vehicle. "Let's create our future together," spokesmodels tell the curious who 
gather around these often strange-looking machines. Other manufacturers tout 
new, environmentally sound components, such as asbestos-free brake liners. 
Potted evergreens and photographs of blue skies are everywhere. And the small, 
independent experimenters in electric vehicles and the like, banished in 
previous years to back corners of the show, find themselves in more prominent 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year," one said, "they stuck us next to the car wax guy and the guy who 
sells coffee cup holders. This year we actually are getting some people to come 
by." 
</P>
<P>
 This choice of theme is no accident. It reflects what a lot of people believe 
-- or, at least, hope -- is a sea change coming soon to California and its 
cars. Current law mandates that, by 1998, 2% of all new autos sold in the state 
must be pollution-free. Given present technology, that means electric. The 
percentage is supposed to climb to 5% by 2003. As the auto show program points 
out, these requirements "will change cars more . . . than they've changed since 
the Model T -- and at least 17 other states are on the verge of adopting our 
vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We pause now, however, for a reality break. Natural Gus and recycled Christmas 
cards aside, supporters of the coming zero-emissions requirements are braced 
for one last political assault on the electric car movement by the Big Three. 
Already there have been direct appeals by Detroit executives to Gov. Pete 
Wilson to suspend the mandates. Legislation to do the same was introduced 
earlier this month. And there is much talk in Sacramento of a concentrated 
lobbying effort against the coming zero emission rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit people argue that the regulations are unreasonable, unworkable, 
unnecessary. Not only is the technology lagging, they suggest, but so is 
consumer demand. Having trained customers over decades to expect vehicles with 
power and range -- cars with muscle -- the auto makers now claim that wimpy 
little electric things simply won't sell. Who wants to buy mere transportation? 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the rules -- an alliance of environmentalists and utility and 
aerospace officials -- see this emerging campaign as the last scream of a 
dinosaur industry. They believe electric cars offer an opportunity, not only 
for clean skies, but also for new business: the mass production of a new kind 
of automobile, or at least components, in places other than Detroit. Like, say, 
California. They concede, however, that defeat would be a tremendous setback 
for any movement away from internal combustion engines, exhaust pipes and that 
brown stuff you can see most any day out an L.A. window. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there it is. Right now, the auto makers convened in Los Angeles are 
demonstrating that, when it comes to environmentalism, they can talk a terrific 
game. Later this year we should learn where the slogans end and the commitment 
begins. It should be, as one famous former Detroit executive would put it, the 
year when the rubber meets the road.

NESLER MAY NOT SEE CASH FROM TV DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ellie Nesler, serving a 10-year sentence for gunning down her son's accused 
molester, has sold her rights for a TV movie that will depict her life and 
sensational crime, but it is unclear if she will actually pocket any of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 A state prosecutor said Nesler's $110,000 movie deal with two well-known 
Hollywood producers may violate a California law prohibiting convicted felons 
from profiting from their crimes. If the state proceeds with a claim against 
Nesler, part of the money may be taken to reimburse Medi-Cal for treating 
Nesler's breast cancer while she is at the Central California Women's Center at 
Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the money could also go to the family of Daniel Driver, the 
35-year-old convicted child molester accused of sodomizing Nesler's son, then 
6, at a church camp in 1988. Nesler was found guilty last summer of voluntary 
manslaughter in the death of Driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at bringing a case that will attach (Nesler's) proceeds from 
any movie," Jo Graves, a prosecutor with the state attorney general's office, 
said Tuesday. "One problem may be the constitutionality of the statute. In New 
York, a similar statute was recently struck down." 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler, 41, was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison for killing Driver 
at a preliminary hearing last April. The hearing was to determine if Driver 
would stand trial on charges that he molested Nesler's son and three other 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the state decides not to bring a claim on behalf of Medi-Cal or 
Driver's family, Nesler is unlikely to profit from the movie deal. The $40,000 
advance has already gone to pay for expert witnesses in Nesler's trial, 
according to her sister. And the remaining $70,000 will be spent on attorney 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellie won't see a dime of it and neither will her two children," Nesler's 
sister, Marrietta Adams, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler agreed during her trial to the TV movie, which will be aired on the Fox 
network. The agreement was revealed in a probation report presented at her 
sentencing hearing. Adams said her sister had no real choice but to sign the 
movie deal with producers Howard Braunstein and David Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Ellie didn't sign the deal, she wouldn't have been able to hire the expert 
witnesses at the trial," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood had initially shown great interest in Nesler's story but cooled off 
when it was revealed that she was under the influence of methamphetamine at the 
time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be an honest portrayal of what went down and what was going 
on in everyone's head at the time," producer Steinberg said. "We're dealing 
with a person who grew up good and bad. We're not interested in June Cleaver. 
This is a real person who had a real problem and dealt with it in her own way."

WILSON FINDS HE ISN'T ONLY GOVERNOR WOOING BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The next time somebody accuses Gov. Pete Wilson of exaggerating the threat 
posed by other states luring employers -- and jobs -- out of California, he 
will have a ready rejoinder. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the Twin Cities Tuesday to tout what he calls the California 
Comeback, Wilson found evidence to support his view that the competition for 
commerce is fierce, and that the Golden State is the bull's-eye in the sights 
of other states urging companies to move. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson was trudging through the icy streets here to meet with corporate 
executives, his counterpart -- Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson -- was in Hollywood 
courting movie producers with offers to film more features in this state, as 
they did with the recently released "Grumpy Old Men." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Wilson and the legislative leaders who accompanied him were telling 
their story to officials at 3M, Target Stores and General Mills, among others, 
Minnesota's trade team was mailing out pamphlets offering "Ten good reasons for 
California businesses to locate here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's goal is to turn negative impressions around and to spread the news 
that California is "back in business" and eager to help any company that wants 
to start a business or expand an existing one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor insisted that he was not trying to persuade companies 
to leave Minnesota for California, only to expand their holdings in his state 
rather than in Oregon, Nevada or Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a raid,' he told local reporters gathered at the Hotel St. Paul to 
hear his pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome Gov. Wilson into the state," said Lynn Kenagy, director of 
communications for the Minnesota Trade and Economic Development Department. 
"I'm sure our companies are happy to listen to what he has to say. But it may 
be a tough sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenagy's department is sending the recruiting brochure to California 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the pamphlet boasts that the cost of living in 
Minneapolis-St. Paul is 19% lower than in Los Angeles, that Minnesota's crime 
rate is 34% lower than California's, and that Minnesota's businesses pay less 
for energy and their workers pay less for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Wilson has been bragging about a recent 7% reduction in the rates 
businesses pay to insure themselves against on-the-job injuries, Minnesota 
rates were cut 16% in 1992. For many occupations, employers here pay far less 
than their California competitors, Kenagy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the news greeting Wilson and a bipartisan delegation of legislators 
was bad. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for 3M Corp., which was host Tuesday for a luncheon for the 
California contingent, said the state has demonstrated a "far more conciliatory 
and consistent" attitude toward business in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dayton Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based owner of Target and Mervyns, 
which already bills itself as the largest retailer in California, expects to 
build eight new Target stores and two new Mervyns in the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Bear, 3M's director of state government relations, said it will take 
a while for California's new attitude toward business to affect the expansion 
plans of major manufacturers, which are drawn years in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been so difficult for so long that it will take a sustained, positive 
change to influence our executives that they should consider California 
seriously for expansion," Bear said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of the kind of frustrations companies face doing business in 
California, Bear said that 3M filed forms in 1985 to remove a Camarillo plant 
from the state's list of sites that treat, store or dispose of toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company still is waiting for the state to process the forms and remove 
the site from the list. In the meantime, the firm must pay higher fees than it 
should, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To wait from 1985 until 1994, that's absurd," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is just the kind of problem Wilson has said he hopes to fix by 
streamlining California's permitting and regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been one recent example of a Minnesota company expanding operations 
in California, but it may not be one that Wilson cares to boast about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Opus Corp. will be building a 17-story, twin-tower office complex in 
downtown Sacramento for the California Department of Justice. Wilson's General 
Services Department awarded the $60-million job to the Minnesota firm last 
year. Opus beat out two experienced California developers that also sought the 
contract.

PANEL OKS SMOG CHECK PLAN SHORT OF U.S. DEMANDS; POLLUTION: SENATE 
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE'S ACTION BRINGS SHOWDOWN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
AGENCY NEARER. THE BILL IS EXPECTED TO BE PASSED FRIDAY AND WILSON IS EXPECTED 
TO SIGN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving closer to a showdown with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, 
a legislative committee on Tuesday approved an overhaul of the California 
automobile Smog Check program that falls short of federal demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The action occurred only four days after the sudden collapse of talks between 
California and federal officials aimed at devising a compromise that would 
enable California to comply with U.S. clean air standards and avert a 
threatened loss of federal transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 7-2 vote, the Senate Transportation Committee approved the bill and sent 
it to the full Senate for what probably will be final passage Friday. Gov. Pete 
Wilson is expected to sign it into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would impose heavier penalties against fraudulent operators and 
authorize roadside remote sensors for random identification of heavy polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 Renewing the battle that the state and federal government fought to a 
cease-fire last summer, the bill retains the state's current system of 
inspecting and repairing vehicles at the same garage every other year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill leaves the door open to separating the two functions if clean air 
standards are still not met, but federal EPA officials insist that California 
must, at the outset, separate inspection stations from the auto shops that 
repair cars that fail the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the current system charge that it contains a built-in conflict of 
interest that encourages gouging of motorists and results in dirtier air. State 
officials concede that the system needs reform, but assert that they, not the 
EPA, know best how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal EPA officials favor the split system for use in the smoggiest regions 
of California, including most of Southern California, that do not meet 
standards of the Clean Air Act. If California does not comply, it faces the 
loss of at least $800 million a year in highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that the EPA will be unhappy with this legislation as it 
stands," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City), a lead California 
negotiator. "We will wind up in court, (but) I am confident it will withstand a 
court challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the hearing room, Katz, a supporter of the bill carried by Sen. Newton 
R. Russell (R-Glendale), said he believes that a court fight between the state 
and federal governments might further delay the loss of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz told the committee that state and federal negotiators had achieved 90% 
agreement on a compromise solution last Friday when the EPA "pulled the plug" 
and abruptly served notice that it had started the clock on imposing the 
sanctions this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 However, EPA Regional Administrator Felicia Marcus has said, "There is every 
reason to expect that we will never impose these sanctions, provided that 
California works quickly to establish an acceptable smog check program." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he advised Clinton Administration officials that if they believe 
some political advantage could be secured against Republican Wilson by 
insisting on a decentralized program, they were mistaken. He noted that the 
Russell bill was first approved by a heavy bipartisan vote last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The two negative votes against the bill in the Transportation Committee were 
cast by Sens. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), both 
longtime smog fighters. Hayden has filed a lawsuit demanding enforcement of the 
federal clean air standards in California.

A FUSION OF NUCLEAR FACTIONS; GOVERNMENT: U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SPONSORS 
MEETING OF SCIENTISTS AND ADVERSARIES IN CAMPAIGN FOR OPENNESS. SHE IS 
ADVOCATING RELEASE OF COLD WAR DATA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The scene Tuesday morning was a sign of the changing times: As Edward Teller, 
the father of the hydrogen bomb, watched, the nation's top energy official 
walked over and hugged an anti-nuclear activist. 
</P>
<P>
 For Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who has shaken the nation by releasing 
details of secret radiation experiments on unknowing subjects, it was a moment 
that symbolized her effort to bring a "culture of openness" to government. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary, going on the road with her campaign to declassify the secrets of the 
Cold War, convened the unprecedented meeting Tuesday of leading nuclear 
scientists and longtime nuclear opponents. O'Leary asked for support from, 
among others, a Catholic priest who has been arrested 35 times for protesting 
nuclear research at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 She expressed her sympathy to a victim of government radiation poisoning, 
saying: "In so many ways we are all victims. We are also victims of our 
mistrust of one another." 
</P>
<P>
 And responding to a request from anti-nuclear activists, the secretary said 
she would immediately ban the shredding of any classified documents while the 
search is under way for additional evidence of improper radiation testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting in downtown San Francisco was the first of at least three public 
forums designed to help the Department of Energy shape its policy for 
declassifying about 32 million pages of documents on nuclear research. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to documents on human experiments and nuclear testing, the 
department is attempting to declassify information on annual plutonium 
production rates, the size of the nuclear arsenal and hundreds of other 
sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Energy Department officials hope the forums will help generate 
public support for declassification and neutralize opposition from an 
entrenched bureaucracy within the department that resists opening its files. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some have said this is a PR effort," O'Leary said. "It's not. This is about 
our future. It's about the survival of a nation. It's about the survival of our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the scientists who spoke at Tuesday's forum were the 85-year-old Teller 
-- who helped persuade President Ronald Reagan to push forward with the Star 
Wars defense program -- and officials from Stanford Linear Accelerator and the 
Lawrence Livermore lab, one of the nation's two nuclear weapons research 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the scientists were supportive of the idea of declassification, saying 
it would aid industrial growth, energy development and the negotiation of arms 
limitation treaties with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teller, who was an early advocate of reduced secrecy in nuclear affairs, 
cautioned that recent reports about Cold War experiments on unknowing victims 
have overstated the harm that was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that human experiments without the consent of the people is wrong," 
he said. "I also believe that the actual damage that has been done has been 
grossly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a decade of criticizing the government from the outside, 
anti-nuclear activists were surprised to find themselves in the same room with 
Teller -- their archenemy -- and other nuclear experts. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, activist Anne Herbert noted that she wrote the widely circulated 
slogan, "Practice random acts of kindness and senseless beauty" and praised 
O'Leary's campaign for government openness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe being inspired by the person who is in charge of Los Alamos 
(nuclear weapons research facility)," Herbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary, who was standing a few feet away, came over and gave her a hug 
saying, "Can I give you a random act of kindness?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although they say they are impressed with O'Leary and are pleased to be 
courted, some opponents of nuclear weapons remained skeptical that the 
secretary can overcome the Energy Department's bureaucracy and nearly 50 years 
of entrenched secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope she can do it," said Jackie Cabasso of the Western States Legal 
Foundation. "But I hold on to a healthy dose of skepticism."

VIOLATING $10,000 CASH LIMIT NOT A CRIME, JUSTICES RULE; LAW: SUPREME COURT 
SAYS GOVERNMENT NEEDED TO PROVE A GAMBLER KNEW HE WAS BREAKING THE STATUTE. HE 
PAID A CASINO DEBT WITH A SERIES OF $9,000 CHECKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a setback for the government's effort to police money laundering, the 
Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a person cannot be convicted of a crime just 
for deliberately skirting a requirement to report cash transactions of $10,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a prosecutor must prove that the person knew he was violating the law 
by breaking up the transactions into lesser amounts to avoid having them 
reported to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 decision throws out the conviction of a Portland, Ore., restaurant 
owner and part-time gambler who paid off a $160,000 casino debt in Reno with a 
number of cashier's checks, all of which were for amounts slightly less than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on this action alone, gambler Waldemar Ratzlaf was convicted of evading 
the federal reporting requirements, sentenced to 15 months in prison and fined 
$26,300. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices concluded that he was not proven guilty of "willfully 
violating" the law, as Congress specified. Certainly Ratzlaf knew a $10,000 
transaction would trigger the reporting requirement, but he did not know that 
drawing a series of $9,000 checks from different banks to avoid the requirement 
was itself a criminal act, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not dishonor the venerable principle that ignorance of the law 
generally is no defense to a criminal charge," said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
for the majority. "In particular contexts, however, Congress may decree 
otherwise," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general matter, some crimes are so obvious -- stealing, for example -- 
that violators cannot contend they were unaware their actions were illegal. But 
in the growing number of complex regulatory laws that make otherwise legal 
behavior a crime, both Congress and the high court have set a higher threshold 
for judging guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, for example, the court gave tax protesters a surprising victory 
by ruling that they cannot be convicted of criminal tax evasion unless 
prosecutors prove that they knowingly and willfully violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Congress first required financial institutions to report large cash 
transactions to the Treasury Department. The law includes transactions that are 
the equivalent of cash, such as those made with cashier's checks. Legislators 
wanted to track the flow of cash from the drug trade as well as stop ordinary 
tax cheating by making it harder to hide the money. The law was stiffened in 
the Money Control Laundering Act of 1986 to also make evading the reporting 
requirement illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ginsburg noted, however, the law says that it punishes only those who 
"willfully violate" its provisions. That requirement "mandates something more" 
than evidence that a person restructured his transactions, she said. "The 
government must prove the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was 
unlawful," she concluded in the case (Ratzlaf vs. United States, 92-1196). 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's decision comes as a mild surprise. Ten of 11 circuit courts that had 
considered this issue had sided with the government, including the U.S. Court 
of Appeals in San Francisco, which affirmed Ratzlaf's conviction. The judges 
said that if a person deliberately evaded the reporting requirement, that was 
enough to justify a guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling also marks the second time in a row that the justices on a 5-4 vote 
have reversed a decision in a criminal case. Last month, on the day before 
adjourning for its holiday recess, the justices overturned the seizure of a 
drug dealer's home and property because he had not been given a hearing in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsburg's opinion in the money laundering case was joined by Justices John 
Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the dissenters, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said that Ratzlaf "will 
be laughing all the way to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, the ruling will make it somewhat harder for officials to track 
and punish tax cheats and drug criminals, as well as those who deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, lawyers for Ratzlaf said that he generated a large amount of 
cash from his Portland restaurant. Government prosecutors labeled him a "high 
stakes gambler" and said that they suspected he had evaded paying income taxes 
on his winnings.

RESPONSE ON RADIATION STUDIES SUGGESTS AN ICEBERG IS BELOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some 4,000 American civilians have given government investigators accounts of 
studies that they believe may have exposed them to radiation, suggesting for 
the first time that the Cold War's human guinea pigs may be far more numerous 
than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a far larger number of U.S. military veterans -- roughly 8,000 -- 
have called the Energy Department to report accounts of experimentation on 
servicemen. Those calls are being directed to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, which has acknowledged in recent days that radiation experiments 
involving human subjects were conducted at 48 of its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls, coming into the Energy Department's hot line at a rate of as many 
as 700 per hour, have swamped a hastily organized reporting system and 
overwhelmed a government effort designed to "come clean" with Americans and 
possibly compensate victims. 
</P>
<P>
 When she unveiled her department's new openness policy, Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary said that her agency's records indicated between 600 and 800 human 
subjects may have been used in past radiation experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 And while officials do not yet have a system to handle the volume of calls 
they are receiving, they cautioned that they do not want to discourage the 
overwhelming public response to O'Leary's initiative. As they work to piece 
together a picture of experiments from three decades' worth of confusing and 
incomplete documents, government workers are counting on the torrent of 
information they are getting from citizens to plug "holes" in the government's 
records, a senior Energy Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know the total universe" of radiation experiments conducted under 
federal sponsorship, said Michael Gauldin, an O'Leary spokesman and a key 
member of a government task force established to review the conduct of 
radiation experiments performed between 1944 and 1974. "There's never been a 
net cast to catch all of this, so we really have no idea the extent of what 
went on. It is impossible to overestimate the problems we may have. But we are 
determined to overcome them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gauldin said the Human Radiation Inter-Agency Working Group has begun to 
organize itself to oversee the task of culling and classifying documents on 
what could be thousands of radiation experiments conducted across the nation 
with government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the task is the fact the Energy Department did not exist during 
the entire period under study. Several agencies -- including the Atomic Energy 
Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration, which were 
subsumed into the Energy Department in 1977 -- as well as several Pentagon 
offices, appear to have funded most of the studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, those organizations frequently sponsored the studies but allowed 
researchers broad latitude in organizing and maintaining their experimental 
logs and material. As a result, some of the documentation that could confirm a 
subject's participation may have been lost or destroyed, officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
 That has prompted government investigators to remind universities, hospitals 
and research institutions that it would be illegal to destroy documents related 
to the search. In addition, the investigators are developing chain-of-custody 
procedures like those used in the handling of criminal evidence to ensure that 
existing documents are not tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the government's task force has gathered those documents, it will 
have the monumental task of sifting through them and recommending which of 
those experiments may qualify subjects for compensation or for some form of 
government action. 
</P>
<P>
 While some experiments underwritten by the government were designed to benefit 
the health of the subject, others were not. While some government-sponsored 
experiments informed subjects of the nature of the experiments, others clearly 
did not. And while some continued to track the health of subjects over the long 
run, others did not.

HEALTH REFORM'S CALL: PHYSICIAN, CAMPAIGN THYSELF; MANY ARE TOSSING THEIR 
STETHOSCOPES INTO THE RING, DESPITE FACING PAY CUTS. THEIR CONCERN IS 
MEDICINE'S FUTURE.

 Under normal circumstances, high-paid physicians seldom aspire to lower-paying 
jobs. But with health care reform rising to the top of the nation's political 
agenda, a surprising number are willing to trim their incomes for a seat in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running for a pay cut," said Brenda Fitzgerald. The Georgia 
obstetrician-gynecologist is one of two dozen physicians -- 19 of them 
Republicans -- who have either declared their candidacies or have strongly 
indicated that they intend to run for Congress in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) are the only 
physicians now in Congress. McDermott is author of a bill to provide national 
health insurance for all Americans -- a measure that most, if not all, of the 
physician candidates oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, at least three incumbents are likely to be challenged by 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 If a health care reform bill passes Congress this year, as expected, 
candidates elected in November would be sworn into office too late to vote on 
the issue. But their candidacies will likely influence the deliberations by 
focusing attention on the medical Establishment's criticism of President 
Clinton's health care reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will help to shed the light of truth" on the Clinton plan, said Irwin 
Savodnik, a Torrance psychiatrist seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 While none of the physicians is running solely on the health care issue, all 
have indicated it was a factor in their decision. Fitzgerald, who has left her 
practice to seek the GOP nomination to challenge Rep. George (Buddy) Darden 
(D-Ga.), sees it as "a continuation of my decision to take care of patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, most Republican physicians who are running -- including all 
three likely California candidates -- are adamantly opposed to the Clinton 
plan. Morton Levine, a Northern California pediatrician who expects to 
challenge Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), said he will warn voters to be wary of 
Clinton's big-government solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Sister -- that's Hillary (Rodham) Clinton -- has got some scary things in 
mind for us," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the doctors think that their expertise is sorely needed in 
Congress these days. "I'm in the middle of this," said John Steel, a urologist 
who has resigned as chief of staff at Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego to 
run as a Republican against Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego). "There is nobody 
like me in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Because American physicians currently earn an average annual salary of 
$170,600, most will be earning less if they are elected to a $133,644-a-year 
seat in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And while many admit to using their personal wealth to finance their 
campaigns, all expect to get big contributions from like-minded doctors who are 
also upset with the Clinton health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But none sees the income issue as an obstacle. In fact, Greg Ganske, a 
Republican running for Congress in Iowa, said he assumes that because he is 
leaving his job as a well-paid plastic surgeon, voters may be willing to trust 
him more than they would a career politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will know I'm not doing it for financial gain, and people generally tend 
to like their doctors," Ganske observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ganske, many of the physician-candidates indicated they will emphasize 
their lack of experience in politics to try to appeal to voters who distrust 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Levine said he has become so disillusioned with the 
practice of medicine that he views entering politics as an opportunity for a 
career change. As he sees it, solo practitioners like himself are becoming 
"dinosaurs" with the current emphasis in medicine on managed care and 
cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two doctors are seeking Senate posts. Perhaps the best-known physician in the 
1994 race is Bernadine P. Healy, the former National Institutes of Health 
director, who is running for the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. 
Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio). Her chief Republican primary rival is Lt. Gov. 
Mike DeWine. CONGRESSIONA

RUSSIA-LATVIA CLASH BRINGS WORST FEARS INTO THE OPEN; BALTICS: MILITARY BASE 
DISPUTE PROMPTED COMBAT ALERT FROM MOSCOW. BUT RESTRAINT PREVAILED; NOBODY WAS 
HURT. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a scenario many of Russia's neighbors dread, the kind of incident that, 
in the worst of imagined cases, might bring Russian troops marching in to 
occupy a tiny country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials on both sides, that is what nearly happened in Latvia 
this week when a zealous local official sent the militia to surround a Russian 
military compound, arrest two Russian generals and pack them off in handcuffs 
to be summarily deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Latvia apologized Tuesday, Russia's Defense Ministry had put an 
airborne division on combat alert and warned Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis 
that troops were ready to cross into his country in 15 minutes if the militia 
stood its ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Retreat came swiftly, nobody got hurt and the official who started it all was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scuffle highlighted the insecurities that have prompted some newly 
independent nations on Russia's western flank to seek protection in NATO -- an 
appeal that prompted the 16-nation Western alliance Monday to offer them a 
"Partnership for Peace" that stops short of full membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong showing of ultranationalists in Russia's parliamentary elections 
last month has especially alarmed the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania -- seized by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident in Latvia could also lend weight to Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's appeal -- expected to be repeated in talks this week with President 
Clinton -- that the West allow his country a special role in policing former 
Soviet areas, especially to protect Russian-speaking citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's role in the partnership and in the former Soviet Union will be on the 
agenda when Clinton arrives here tonight for a summit. The two leaders will 
also discuss Russia's scheduled withdrawal of 20,000 former Soviet troops still 
deployed in Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been pressing Yeltsin to keep the promised withdrawal on 
track toward its year-end completion; it hopes that will defuse nationalist 
tensions in the two Baltic countries and avoid clashes like the one that 
occurred this week in the Latvian capital of Riga. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Andrejs Rucs, the top official of Riga's Vidzeme district, ordered 
Latvian militia Sunday to surround a Russian army compound that includes a 
stadium, a swimming pool, a military housing agency and a quartermaster's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucs told Russia's Interfax news agency that he wanted the militia to seize 
documents from the housing agency. He said he thought they might prove that 
retiring Russian servicemen were illegally obtaining Latvian residence permits 
to avoid going back to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing a forcible seizure of the compound, which was not yet scheduled to be 
turned over to the Latvians, three Russian generals arrived Monday to meet with 
the official. Negotiations broke down when the Russians suggested putting their 
own armed guards around the place. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Rucs ordered the militia to seize the three generals, though he 
has no arrest powers. One general was soon released because he "behaved 
politely," Rucs explained to reporters, while the other two were handcuffed and 
whisked through the woods in a minibus toward the Russian border. Talks in Riga 
on the pullout of Russian troops were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Russian combat alert and a stern protest by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who called the incident a "gross provocation," a 
bewildered President Ulmanis moved against the local official; the generals 
were freed unharmed in Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 In an all-night session, Latvia's Cabinet stripped Rucs of his post. The troop 
withdrawal talks resumed. Latvian officials breathed a sigh of relief that 
Russia had reacted with restraint.

TRANSPORTATION SUMMIT PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the first specific efforts to carry out the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration announced plans Tuesday for a 
meeting to discuss strategies for improving transportation links among the 
United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the three nations participating in the recently ratified 
trade pact will be invited to the North American Transportation Summit here in 
March, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrowly approved by Congress in a showdown vote last month, NAFTA would 
reduce tariffs and remove trade barriers among the three nations over a period 
of 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said his department would work with other agencies -- including the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service and Customs -- and officials in Mexico 
and Canada in a task force that will recommend ways to upgrade existing border 
crossings and plan longer-term improvements. Pena would not estimate the 
eventual cost of improvements.

MEXICO STEPS UP BID FOR TRUCE WITH ZAPATISTA REBELS; REVOLT: OFFICIAL OFFERS TO 
LISTEN TO THEIR DEMANDS, GOING SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST RECOGNITION FOR THE GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government, struggling to put down a 
deadly Indian rebellion in southern Mexico, stepped up peace efforts Tuesday 
with a call for a truce and an offer to listen to the guerrillas' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' newly appointed peace negotiator, former Mexico City Mayor Manuel 
Camacho Solis, sounded a conciliatory note in his first public remarks, even 
suggesting that the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as the guerrillas call 
themselves, could be recognized as a legitimate force. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a reality," Camacho said in a news conference. "If we are going to 
reach an end to the conflict, we have to talk to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition as a legitimate "belligerent" force is one of several demands the 
Zapatista rebels set forth in a five-page statement delivered late Monday to a 
newspaper in Chiapas, the impoverished southern state where the rebellion broke 
out New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista rebels also said they were willing to begin talks with the 
government if a cease-fire is declared and the Mexican army stops its 
"indiscriminate bombings" and withdraws from Chiapas. If the conditions are not 
met, they said, they would "continue their advance to the capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho, who has a reputation as an able negotiator whose skills were honed in 
the political fights that go with running this ungovernable capital, declined 
to comment on the specific demands presented in the rebel statement until he 
could verify its authenticity. But he was careful not to rule out any 
condition. "We have to find a dignified, political solution for everyone," he 
said, adding he was calling for a truce to allow peace talks to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 His tone came in marked contrast to the hard-line approach adopted, thus far, 
by other officials, including Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, the interior 
minister and former Chiapas governor who lost his job Monday in the wake of the 
rebellion. The dismissal of Gonzalez, his replacement with a respected veteran 
of human rights, and the appointment of Camacho appeared to signal a shift in 
Salinas' strategy in handling the Chiapas crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Salinas' moves were aimed at containing the political damage his 
government has suffered as the uprising spawned a growing sense of insecurity 
at home and a deteriorating image abroad. By naming a negotiator like Camacho, 
who enjoys credibility with both the left and the right, the government buys 
time and creates the impression of taking the initiative in working for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going the military route without the alternative of political negotiation 
could represent a major setback and an eventual dismantling of (Salinas') 
economic program because of the element of social-political violence, which in 
any country with a fragile system scares investors," said El Financiero 
columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho said he had met with army officers late Monday and on Tuesday made a 
point of meeting with Roman Catholic Church bishops, despite earlier attempts 
by the government to blame some priests for inciting the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho said he has not yet contacted the rebels, but he did not indicate when 
he might do so. He said, however, that he planned to travel to Chiapas today. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the talk in Mexico City was of peace, the army was reported to be 
preparing an offensive against about 400 guerrillas dug in around the northern 
Chiapas town of El Bosque.

CLINTON SALES PITCH AIMED AT UKRAINE LAWMAKERS; DIPLOMACY: THE PRESIDENT IS 
STOPPING IN KIEV TODAY TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR PACT ON DISMANTLING OF COUNTRY'S 
NUCLEAR ARMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Going at the former Soviet Union with the same sales strategy that won 
approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Clinton is 
launching a whirlwind campaign to seek support from Ukraine's truculent 
Parliament for his deal to get rid of the country's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a two-hour stop today at Kiev's airport to express his newfound 
admiration for Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, Clinton and other 
Administration officials plan to lavish promises of aid and affection on 
Ukraine as the reward for keeping Kravchuk's promise of nuclear disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
 And where some U.S. officials foresaw trouble in Ukrainian nationalists' 
immediate opposition to the agreement, a buoyant Clinton professed to see 
nothing more than the normal workings of democratic government. Whenever any 
country's leader concludes an agreement, there are always critics in the 
legislative branch, Clinton said in Brussels at the conclusion of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This always happens," he said at a news conference. "Every decision every 
executive makes is going to be second-guessed by people of the legislature. 
It's almost the way the system's set up. It shouldn't surprise anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we approved the side agreements to NAFTA, we didn't know at the time 
whether everybody in Congress would think it was a wonderful idea," Clinton 
noted before flying to Prague, capital of the Czech Republic, for meetings with 
East European leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The political and economic chaos in Ukraine makes its Parliament, the Rada, a 
far cry from the U.S. Congress, but Administration officials suggested Clinton 
will try to win Ukrainians over with the same appeals to self-interest and gain 
that work in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Ukraine, which has been shivering through a winter of 
heating fuel cutbacks and runaway inflation, the President will hold out the 
prospect of doubling U.S. economic aid almost immediately, from $155 million to 
$310 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentrated sales pitch is intended to help Kravchuk overcome 
nationalists' fierce opposition to the arms deal, under which Ukraine will 
agree to dismantle more than 1,800 nuclear warheads inherited from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian politicians of several stripes have already denounced the agreement, 
but some members of Parliament said the promise of $1 billion worth of nuclear 
fuel as compensation, along with increased U.S. aid, would swing some votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some U.S. officials said they were dismayed by early objections 
from powerful members of the Rada. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one reason we were trying to keep the details of the agreement under 
wraps -- to give Kravchuk a chance to sell it to the Rada first," a senior 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to timing, the State Department's desire to help Kravchuk 
sell the pact appeared to collide with the White House's desire to trumpet the 
President's diplomatic success. On Sunday, White House officials were 
encouraging reporters to write about the prospect of an agreement at the same 
time that State Department officials were pleading with them not to. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton believes this agreement is more likely to hold than several similar 
promises Ukraine made but never kept -- largely because of the money involved 
and Kiev's desperate need for aid, another White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Kravchuk also plan to discuss several issues that remain 
unresolved in the agreement, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the agreement was still only a 
draft and needed some work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the trilateral talks in Moscow will end successfully. But if the 
document is not ready, then the meeting will have a consultative nature," 
spokesman Yuri Sergeyev told a news conference in Kiev, according to Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we succeed in achieving agreement and a document is worked out fully, it 
will be signed. But the form has not been worked out fully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything less than a firm, concluded agreement would be a severe embarrassment 
to Clinton, who announced the pact with great fanfare Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official insisted that despite the Foreign Ministry statement, Kravchuk 
has made a commitment to sign Friday. "They presumably don't want the Rada to 
feel that they are being informed only after the agreement has been concluded," 
he said -- though that is, in fact, the case. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, officials said, there is still plenty of time for politicking 
over the pact, signed or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in March, and Kravchuk 
has told U.S. officials that he plans to submit the entire nuclear question to 
the new Rada once it is in place, three months or more from now.

ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS AGREE ON TRANSFER OF CIVILIAN POWER; MIDEAST: DELEGATES AT 
EGYPT TALKS REPORT PROGRESS -- BUT NO BREAKTHROUGH -- ON DIFFICULT SECURITY 
ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Israel has agreed on the transfer of most civilian government functions to a 
new Palestinian self-governing authority, and negotiators made progress on some 
of the most difficult issues blocking an agreement on Palestinian autonomy, 
delegates said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we'll be able to really consider it a milestone that has been 
accomplished on the way to doing this agreement," chief Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Shaath said of the agreements now covering almost every aspect of 
civilian administration in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; the areas 
have been in the Israelis' hands since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting for the second day in this Egyptian Red Sea resort, negotiators tried 
to go beyond the crucial security issues that for months have stymied agreement 
on Palestinian autonomy. Instead, they sped their way through other nagging 
issues -- from economics to who controls the telephones -- that have also 
remained in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, closed meeting between Shaath and Israeli delegation chief Amnon 
Shahak, Palestinian negotiators said they expected to reach agreement this week 
on 37 of 38 areas of civil administration in Jericho and Gaza, which will pass 
into Palestinian hands for a five-year period of autonomy once an agreement is 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching full agreement on electricity, telephones, transportation and 
population registration, negotiators will have only planning and zoning issues 
to discuss next week, Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able today to move very rapidly and I think very positively in most 
of the departments that used to have difficulty in the transfer of authority to 
the Palestinian side," he said. "So I hope we will be able to write the 
document on the civil issues and the transfer of authority before the end of 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators from both sides denied reports they had reached agreement on the 
difficult security issues of the size of the Jericho enclave and control of 
international border crossings; delegation sources did report progress on both 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian side clearly has dropped its demand for a large enclave around 
the city of Jericho. But the two sides are still disputing key areas that the 
Palestinians insist on including outside the city, among them several religious 
sites and an access to the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we finally settled on what we have been offered by the Israeli side? I 
say we have not made that agreement, but we have really not gone back to zero 
point. On the contrary, I think we have made use of the progress that happened 
(in earlier talks) in Cairo, but we are not yet satisfied," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, on the issue of international border crossings, Shaath said the two 
sides "made progress, but we are still short of a sign-able agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians appear to have accepted the idea of Israeli-Palestinian 
monitors of West Bank residents entering the autonomous areas but are still 
disputing control of roads from the border crossings to Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the issues we are in full agreement, some in partial agreement, some 
are totally un-agreed. It's going to take a long time," Israeli delegation 
spokesman Ami Gluska said. He said the issue of what area around Jericho will 
fall to Palestinian control "is right now at a point where we do not exactly 
see eye to eye." 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of Jericho and border crossings have bedeviled the talks since they 
opened in mid-October. Shaath said the two sides are moving on to other issues 
to keep things going toward an agreement until security issues can be resolved. 
A subcommittee on security met throughout the past two days on the issues and 
was scheduled to resume its talks this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the subcommittee on civil administration is scheduled to take on the 
potentially difficult issues of water and archeology later this week; a third 
subcommittee today will begin looking at legal issues, including specific 
powers of the Palestinian self-governing authority that is to assume power once 
the Israelis withdraw.

NATO THREAT OF AIR STRIKES MET WITH DEFIANCE; BOSNIA: BOMBARDMENT SHUTS DOWN 
SARAJEVO AIRPORT, CUTTING OFF AID. PEACE TALKS IN JEOPARDY, SERBS WARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Serbian nationalists who have laid siege to Bosnia-Herzegovina for 22 months 
reacted Tuesday to a NATO threat of air strikes by bombarding Sarajevo and 
warning that any move to stop them might scuttle paralyzed peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortar attack on the Bosnian capital's airport shut down the vital food 
airlift on which Sarajevo's 380,000 trapped residents depend. U.N. officials 
said they could not immediately determine which side in the ruthless struggle 
for the capital had fired those shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief flights to Sarajevo have been canceled for most of the past week 
because of intensified Serbian shelling of the densely populated city center 
and the airport, which is under U.N. control but unable to operate when under 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's shelling, however, was said by the U.N. commander in Sarajevo to 
have been provoked by an initial outgoing barrage by the Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 At a summit in Brussels, President Clinton and other leaders of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization renewed a 5-month-old threat to launch air strikes 
against Bosnian Serbs if they persist with the strangulation of Sarajevo and 
expanded the warning to include other besieged enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic showed defiance even before the NATO 
leaders worked out the final wording of their threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the anti-Serb resolution is adopted, it will not help the peace process 
but would jeopardize it," Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA from 
his mountain stronghold in Pale. 
</P>
<P>
 His nationalist followers kept up their artillery assault on Sarajevo 
throughout the day, which the commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, Belgian Gen. 
Francis Briquemont, said was instigated by government shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine people were killed in the artillery exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, Croats and the government have been engaged in Western-mediated 
peace talks for 17 months and are scheduled to resume the costly peripatetic 
meetings in Geneva next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic, who was blamed by leaders of the European Union (formerly the 
European Community) for blocking progress at the last negotiating session in 
Brussels just before Christmas, underscored his warning against the NATO 
declaration by saying it "would prompt us to reconsider land concessions 
offered to the Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mediation of EU envoy Lord Owen and his U.N. counterpart, Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader, Mate Boban, have drafted a 
plan for dividing Bosnia into three ethnic ministates, with half of the 
republic going to the Serbs, about 17% to Boban's forces and one-third destined 
to remain under Bosnian government rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Karadzic's rebels have yet to withdraw from any of the territory they 
have agreed to cede to rump Bosnia in exchange for capitulation, his comments 
to SRNA suggested even less of the occupied land would now be on offer at the 
peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO's warning, which includes possible air strikes in the besieged eastern 
towns of Tuzla and Srebrenica, was also aimed at pressuring the Serbs to comply 
with deployment and aid delivery plans of the U.N. Protection Force, which has 
been thwarted in its effort to rotate fresh peacekeeping troops into 
Srebrenica. 
</P>
<P>
 UNPROFOR has also made little progress in getting Serbian compliance with 
plans to open Tuzla airport, which the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees needs as a staging ground for relief missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian obstacles put up in the east and fighting between Croats and Muslims 
in central Bosnia have blocked aid convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. relief agency has expanded the amount of food airdropped to starving 
and isolated Muslim communities because of difficulties in transporting the 
crucial supplies by road, said UNHCR spokeswoman Alemka Lysinski. The Reaction 
in Bosnia: More Bullets 
</P>
<P>
 The action taken Tuesday on Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is undergoing the worst 
fighting in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
</P>
<P>
 NATO leaders extended the threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to try 
to force open a key airport and relieve a besieged U.N. peacekeeping unit. 
</P>
<P>
 THE U.N. REACTION 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali "welcomed the political will 
expressed in the final communique of the Brussels summit, which will strengthen 
the U.N. role and actions in favor of peace," his spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REACTION ON THE FRONT LINES 
</P>
<P>
 Warring factions continued to shell Sarajevo, halting relief flights into the 
city just hours after they had resumed, and Muslim-Croat fighting raged in 
central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 AIR STRIKES WOULD BE USED . . .  
</P>
<P>
 1. To force open a key airport for relief flights (Tuzla) 
</P>
<P>
 2. Relieve a trapped Canadian peacekeeping unit (Srebrenica) 
</P>
<P>
 THE "SAFE AREAS" 
</P>
<P>
 Six mainly Muslim enclaves were designated by the United Nations last year as 
"safe areas" to be protected. They are currently encircled by Serb artillery 
and cut off from each other. The six areas: Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bihac, Srebrenica, 
Zepa and Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels bent on taking territory for a Greater Serbia have conquered 
70% of Bosnia. Croatian nationalists -- partly inspired by the Serbs' 
unsanctioned land grab -- have firmed up control over most of the rest. The 
toll: 200,000 Bosnians dead and more than 2 million homeless. American policy 
precludes stationing U.S. troops in the former Yugoslavia. But the Clinton 
Administration has offered to supply up to 25,000 American forces to police a 
ceasefire in the currently unlikely event of a peace settlement.

N.Y. STATE POLICE CHIEF LIKELY TO BE CLINTON DEA NOMINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York State Police Supt. Thomas Constantine is expected to be tapped this 
week by President Clinton to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, sources 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantine, whose appointment requires Senate confirmation, would succeed 
former U.S. District Judge Robert C. Bonner, a George Bush Administration 
appointee who resigned in October to return to Los Angeles to practice law. The 
DEA chief oversees a 3,500-agent organization whose mission is to enforce the 
nation's drug laws. The agency operates in 53 countries and all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that Constantine is confirmed, he will inherit a job that will have 
been altered slightly as a result of Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing 
government" effort. Initially, Gore's task force had proposed merging the DEA 
into the FBI to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. But the organization 
and some law enforcement experts resisted the idea. Instead, Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno gave FBI Director Louis J. Freeh authority to ensure that the two agencies 
work more closely together to fight drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantine, who acknowledged in November that he was under consideration for 
the post, speculated then that the Administration's interest in him stemmed 
from his experience with anti-drug campaigns in New York. The 54-year-old 
Buffalo, N.Y., native has been a member of the state police force for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantine could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Sources said that the 
announcement would come within the next day or two.

MILITARY COURT CRITICIZES NAVY, RULES TAILHOOK FLIER TO FACE COURT-MARTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy flier charged with indecent assault on a woman in the Tailhook scandal 
lost an attempt Tuesday to avoid court-martial, although military judges found 
the Navy "careless and amateurish" in the case it brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assembly-line technique in this case that merged and blurred 
investigative and justice procedures is troublesome," said the Court of 
Military Appeals, the military's highest tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled, however, that Lt. David Samples has failed to establish that 
he was given full immunity for his actions at the rowdy September, 1991, 
aviators convention in Las Vegas. Samples was granted a more limited 
"testimonial" immunity by Vice Adm. J. Paul Reason in a letter, which 
constituted a promise that he could not be prosecuted based on what he had told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples' court-martial at the Norfolk, Va., naval base, the first stemming 
from the Tailhook Assn. convention, was stopped in October after the trial 
judge turned down the immunity claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy charged that Samples took part in an incident at the convention when 
an intoxicated young woman was lifted into the air by three officers and 
stripped of her clothing below the waist.

BOBBITT TESTIFIES THAT HE NEVER STRUCK HIS WIFE; JUSTICE: HE SAYS HE USED 
PHYSICAL FORCE TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST HER. DEFENSE WITNESSES IN MUTILATION 
TRIAL CONTEND HE TOLD THEM HE ENJOYED FORCED SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the second day of Lorena Bobbitt's trial for cutting off her husband's 
penis, John Wayne Bobbitt returned to the stand Tuesday to testify that he 
never hit his wife, but was sometimes forced to physically restrain her from 
assaulting him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that has brought hordes of journalists from around the world to this 
small town 30 miles west of Washington, a jury of seven women and five men 
listened -- at times it seemed uneasily -- to the most intimate details of the 
Bobbitts' stormy marriage. Bobbitt himself seemed embarrassed as he described 
such things as the "rug burns" he suffered on his knees when the couple made 
love on their living room rug. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-year-old manicurist from Venezuela, Mrs. Bobbitt faces up to 20 years in 
prison if convicted on a charge of "maliciously wounding" her husband by 
cutting off his penis on the night of June 23 last year after he came home 
drunk and, she says, raped her. She is expected to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt, who has denied having raped his wife and said that he fell asleep 
that night and did not engage in sex, was acquitted of marital assault in the 
same courtroom last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with his estranged wife now on trial, defense attorneys presented new 
testimony and other evidence not introduced at the earlier trial to bolster 
their contention that the burly ex-Marine beat and otherwise abused his wife on 
numerous occasions during their tempestuous, four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 While not disputing the fact that Mrs. Bobbitt mutilated her husband, the 
defense team led by Virginia attorney Blair Howard hopes to prove that she was 
driven by Bobbitt's abuse into a "deep psychological despair" that caused her 
to feel an "irresistible impulse" to sever his penis after a night of violent, 
forced sex. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was perhaps the day's most damaging testimony for Bobbitt, two 
acquaintances of his testified that he told them on one occasion when they were 
talking about their sex lives that he enjoyed forced sex and making women 
"squirm." 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he liked forced sex . . . that it turned him on," testified Jonathan 
Whitaker, who met Bobbitt at the home of a mutual friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kaopur, a friend of Whitaker's, also was called to testify about the 
conversation in which Bobbitt allegedly confided his sadistic impulses toward 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard also called to the stand a parade of witnesses who said that they saw 
Bobbitt abuse his wife on several occasions. One testified that at a Christmas 
party she saw Bobbitt pin his wife to the wall and call her a "bitch" because 
she was too embarrassed to show off the skimpy lingerie he had bought her. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the defense tried to undermine Bobbitt's contention that he never 
abused his wife by recalling him to the stand as a hostile witness and asking 
him about specific instances of abuse alleged by Mrs. Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 As in his earlier appearances on the witness stand, Bobbitt frequently 
stammered and seemed at times to have trouble understanding the questions. But, 
although he appeared confused, he continued to steadfastly deny ever having 
beaten his wife, contending that he used physical force only as a means of 
keeping "her from hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the muscular 200-pound bouncer painted a picture of the flip side of 
marital abuse, saying that his petite but quick-tempered wife frequently flew 
into emotional rages in which she would assault him and he would be forced to 
restrain her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never hit my wife," Bobbitt said. "I never hit her at all." Asked if 
he ever used physical force against her, Bobbitt replied: "Just to push her, 
hold her down, restrain her from hitting me." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, his voice rising in accusation and anger, asked Bobbitt about an 
incident in which Mrs. Bobbitt said that he hit her in the face while they were 
driving home from a restaurant. Bobbitt conceded that the incident had occurred 
but said it was she who began hitting him in her rage over being denied a table 
at the restaurant because he was too casually dressed.

S&L TIE TO FIRST LADY'S LAW FIRM PROBED; BANKING: FDIC ASKS IF ATTORNEYS WHO 
REPRESENTED U.S. IN CASE AGAINST THE THRIFT'S ACCOUNTANTS MISLED REGULATORS 
ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal banking regulators have begun an investigation of the Rose Law Firm's 
involvement with a failed savings and loan owned by a former business partner 
of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is trying to determine whether lawyers at 
Rose -- the Little Rock, Ark., firm in which Mrs. Clinton was a partner -- 
misled regulators about the potential for a conflict of interest when they 
represented the federal government in a case against the now-defunct Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan's accountants, said David Barr, a spokesman for the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators hired the Rose firm in 1989 to sue the accountants, Frost & 
Co., for negligence in auditing the S&L's books. Ultimately, the law firm 
received $400,000 in legal fees from the FDIC and settled the case in 1991 for 
$1 million. The government had sought $6 million from Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 While Madison was still in business in 1985, Rose attorneys, including Mrs. 
Clinton, represented the thrift and its owner, James B. McDougal, when it 
sought state regulatory approval for a novel plan to sell stock and raise money 
to keep the S&L afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to raise capital was approved by a state regulator appointed by 
then-Gov. Bill Clinton but was never acted on because of the thrift's worsening 
financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The state regulatory approval for the stock plan has become a key issue in a 
federal criminal investigation of ties between McDougal and the Clintons. The 
issue has raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's role in helping McDougal win 
the beneficial state ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 In their efforts to win state regulatory approval for Madison, the Rose 
attorneys relied on an audit report on the S&L by Frost & Co. to make its case 
in favor of the stock plan. When the law firm represented the FDIC in 1989, it 
was hired to sue the Frost firm on behalf of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC officials said they do not have evidence that they were purposefully 
misled by the Rose firm but cannot find any documentation and do not recall 
ever being told by Rose lawyers that it had represented Madison four years 
earlier in the state case. The Rose firm has insisted that it told the agency 
about the earlier case. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released by the FDIC show that in 1989, Rose senior partner Vincent 
Foster, who later became deputy White House counsel and who committed suicide 
in July, 1993, solicited the federal agency's legal work on failed financial 
institutions in Arkansas. After the Rose firm won the right to handle legal 
work on Madison, much of the work was done by Webster Hubbell, now the No. 3 
official at the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, who handled the FDIC suit against Frost, insists that the federal 
regulators were told about the firm's prior involvement in the case. "Mr. 
Hubbell has said that he disclosed all the information that was requested and 
won a substantial settlement in the case for the FDIC," Justice Department 
spokesman Carl Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC said its inquiry is separate from an ongoing Justice Department 
criminal investigation of Madison and Whitewater Development Corp., the 
Arkansas real estate venture owned jointly by the Clintons and McDougal and his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 If the regulatory agency finds that it was misled by the Rose firm, it could 
move to bar the firm from receiving further work from either the FDIC or the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with cleaning up and 
disposing of the assets of failed S&Ls. And if the agency finds that any Rose 
attorneys made false statements to federal officials about their potential for 
a conflict of interest, the FDIC could seek to press criminal charges, Barr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC investigation, being supervised by Jack Smith, deputy general 
counsel, has found no indication that false statements were made, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a direct challenge to one of the First Family's chief 
contentions about the Whitewater real estate venture, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) 
said Tuesday that he does not see how the Clintons could have lost $68,900 on 
the investment, as they have maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Leach said, his analysis of the records of the Clinton investment in 
the Ozark mountains property deal indicates that they may have broken even or 
lost at most $9,000. McDougal, who was 50-50 partners with the Clintons in the 
deal, said last weekend that he believed that the Clintons invested and lost 
about $9,000 in Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has cited the large reported loss in deflecting suggestions 
that the Clintons may have benefited from the failure of Madison, which 
ultimately cost taxpayers more than $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, the senior Republican member of the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee, noted that McDougal sank a much larger stake in the deal, 
yet granted the Clintons an equal share in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an obvious gift," Leach said in a session with reporters. "The 
question is, what was the quid pro quo?" 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House aide Bruce Lindsey disputed Leach's figures and vigorously 
denied the implication that Clinton had profited from his association with 
McDougal or used his office to benefit the Arkansas businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clintons submitted their records to an independent accounting firm who 
did a reconstruction and found that the Clintons invested almost $69,000 in 
this investment and that they lost the entire amount," Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional and Justice Department investigators are seeking to learn 
whether Clinton, as governor, granted McDougal and Madison Guaranty favorable 
regulatory treatment that kept the institution open for several years after it 
had become insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to know whether funds were illegally diverted from Madison to 
Whitewater or to retire a $50,000 debt from Clinton's 1984 campaign for 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach also accused the Clintons and their defenders of engaging in a 
"conspiracy of silence" about Foster's role in Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that Foster, who negotiated the Clintons' sale of their share in 
Whitewater and who prepared the delinquent tax returns for the partnership, was 
intimately involved in the deal and suggested that it may have been a factor in 
his suicide. Foster shot himself in the head July 20 in an isolated federal 
park in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no basis whatsoever to speculate that Whitewater had 
anything to do with Vince's death," Lindsey said. "It's ghoulish to try to 
connect the two without proof."

WORK-BASED WELFARE IS BACKED BY STATES' GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The association of state welfare administrators Tuesday endorsed President 
Clinton's call for a two-year time limit on welfare but warned that states will 
resist paying much of the cost for reforming the public assistance system. 
</P>
<P>
 In what several observers called a sign of widening consensus, the American 
Public Welfare Assn. endorsed many of the ideas under consideration by the 
Administration's internal welfare reform task force, including the central 
recommendation that most welfare recipients be required to accept work after 
two years on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a strong sign that the states want serious welfare reform," says White 
House policy aide Bruce Reed, co-chairman of the Administration's welfare 
reform group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state welfare association, in a report, said that states should be 
required to pick up only 10% of the expense of moving to such a work-based 
system -- which it estimated could cost more than $15 billion over the next 
five years. The distribution of costs between the states and the federal 
government will be "a crucial issue," in the welfare reform debate, said Sid 
Johnson, the APWA's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 On many issues, the group's recommendations track the proposals contained in 
the working paper completed last month by the Administration's task force on 
welfare reform. The President has not yet reviewed the recommendations and the 
White House has signaled repeatedly in recent weeks that it may delay the 
introduction of a welfare reform bill to avoid conflict with the pending health 
care reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Administration task force, the APWA called for granting states 
greater flexibility to conduct experiments in welfare reform, stepped-up 
efforts to collect child support payments and a shift in the focus of welfare 
offices toward seeking work for recipients "from the very beginning of their 
receipt" of public assistance. The report also calls for phasing in the work 
requirement by imposing it first on new recipients and guaranteeing welfare 
recipients public employment if private work is not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The support for a mandatory work requirement represents a significant 
evolution in the state welfare administrators' views, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a statement that a system that has been consumed with determining and 
maintaining eligibility should shift its focus to supporting and providing 
work," said Mark Greenberg, a staff attorney at the Center for Law and Social 
Policy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the agreement, the report also highlighted some of the likely areas of 
contention once the welfare reform debate begins.

JONES SEEKS GOP NOMINATION FOR SECRETARY OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pledging to work for campaign finance reform, Republican Assemblyman Bill 
Jones of Fresno announced Tuesday that he will seek the GOP nomination for 
secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a former Assembly minority leader, said if elected he will seek to 
establish realistic contribution limits, require contributions by check only, 
ban money transfers between officeholders and candidates, and require fuller 
public disclosure of expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, I will actively fight any form of public campaign financing," Jones 
told a Capitol news conference, "to prevent California citizens from suffering 
the indignity of having their hard-earned taxes pay for the campaign 
consultants of political candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 A rancher-businessman, Jones, who was minority floor leader in 1991-92, is the 
third candidate, and only Republican, to declare for the race to succeed 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu, a Democrat. Eu has been nominated as U.S. 
ambassador to Micronesia in the South Pacific.

MORNING BRIEFING: ROUGH-AND-READY RAIDER FANS DON'T EXACTLY FIT STEREOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post came away from Sunday's Raider game at 
the Coliseum with this candid look at our city: 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened to the California sports fan as a laid-back, tofu burger 
and bean-sprout eating, Valley-speaking, surfer dude? They ain't here at Raider 
games, I promise you. A Sunday afternoon at a Raiders' game is unlike an 
afternoon anywhere else in the NFL, NBA, NHL, major league baseball or college 
anything. The people who think they're tough in Yankee Stadium wouldn't even 
get out of their cars here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Wilbon: "That paragliding fool has no idea how lucky he is that he didn't 
actually land in the Coliseum during Sunday's game. The beating he'd have 
received here would have been 100 times the pounding he took ringside in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Raider veteran Howie Long said afterward, 'If there's one stadium in 
America you don't want to dive into, this is it.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many holes in one has Jack Nicklaus recorded in a 
professional career that began in 1962? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Just another day in a parking lot: KCBS-TV reporter Rory Markas fought through 
traffic recently, trying to get to UC Irvine's Bren Center, where the Clippers 
were holding a mini-camp. The camp was closed, but Markas was hoping to 
interview some players in the parking lot as they were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 He got there in time, but couldn't find his cameraman, so he called his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the cameraman?" Markas asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you?" the guy on the desk asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bren Center," Markas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I sent him to the Burn Center." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dust this: Brotherly love goes only so far, according to former Dodger Pedro 
Martinez, who said he will do whatever it takes to win baseball games. 
Martinez, who was traded to the Montreal Expos in November, said it will be a 
little odd facing his brother Ramon when the Dodgers play the Expos, but, well, 
it's still a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to brush him back, I'll do it," Pedro said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in the name: Martinez says nobody in Canada expects him to take the 
place of the popular Delino DeShields, who came to the Dodgers in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never hear about Delino," Martinez said. "All I ever hear about is that 
people there expect me to be the second Dennis Martinez. That's all people talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields knows about those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 24 and feel my best baseball is ahead of me," he said. "But people talk 
about me like I've been here for 10 years."  
</P>

 An honest Joe: Joe Gergen of Newsday took a look back at his prediction that 
the New York Giants would flounder this season when he reprinted this passage 
from his column of Dec. 31, 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Giants are not going to become contenders again with (Lawrence) Taylor or 
(Phil) Simms in the lineup. Tonight, New York's Eve, is the time for 'Auld Lang 
Syne,' for reminiscing about past glories. Tomorrow is the time to begin 
formulating realistic plans."

 Looking back: On this day in 1972, the Lakers lost to the Cincinnati Royals, 
108-107, after having won 34 of their previous 35 games.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There must be a joke about Whitey Herzog beating the Rams out of Anaheim, but, 
then again, he never lived there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It won't be long before people forget that he ever served as general manager 
of the Angels. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi has a tough job ahead of him with the Angels, who today look like 
a last-place team in the American League West. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda was sleeping at the Pennsylvania home of friend Vince Piazza 
recently when he heard loud noises coming from the basement. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Pow. . . . pow. . . . pow. . . . pow.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was Vince's son, Mike, attacking baseballs delivered by a pitching machine 
in the family batting cage at 1 a.m. . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it came as no surprise that the National League rookie of the year was 
at Dodger Stadium Monday when optional winter workouts began. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He's got tremendous work habits," Lasorda said. "There won't be any sophomore 
jinx for him. If anything, he's going to work even harder this year than 
last.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Before his .318, 35-home run, 112-RBI season, Piazza tore up the Arizona Fall 
League. . . . A year later, outfielder Todd Hollandsworth had a smoking bat in 
the desert. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hollandsworth is a longshot to make the varsity this season because he will be 
only 21 in April and has spent only three years in the minor leagues, but 
Lasorda saw the 6-foot-2, 193-pound left-handed batter and thrower hit a home 
run estimated at more than 450 feet. . . . Fred Claire said he has talked with 
a representative of Greg Hibbard, but expressed doubt that the Dodgers would 
sign the free-agent pitcher. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we would like to have a lefty starter," Claire said, "but we are 
happy with our starting five." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that none of the five right-handers -- Pedro Astacio, Orel 
Hershiser, Ramon Martinez, Tom Candiotti or Kevin Gross -- won as many as 15 
games last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hibbard was 15-11 for the Chicago Cubs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A Piazza-autographed jersey will be among items up for bid at the third annual 
Hollenbeck Youth Center sports auction Jan. 18 at Dodger Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My votes for the Amateur Athletic Foundation's Southern California athletes of 
the year went to Piazza and former Thousand Oaks High track and 
field/basketball star Marion Jones. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA wide receiver J.J. Stokes, who finished seventh, will be the highest 
Heisman Trophy vote-getter returning next season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner, once considered among the worst, was voted the best major league 
owner in a readers' poll conducted by Baseball America. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most lopsided category: 1,685 voters preferred grass fields, only 38 
artificial turf. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Those Chris Farley basketball commercials on ESPN, showing the hefty comedian 
trying to emulate the collegiate feats of Rumeal Robinson and Christian 
Laettner, are more enjoyable than some of the games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I watch Kansas play, I realize why Roy Williams was Jerry West's 
first choice to succeed Mike Dunleavy as Laker coach. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Noting the poor free-throw percentages across the country, USC Coach George 
Raveling says: "We ought to put more emphasis on rebounding missed foul shots." 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 What makes the string of upsets at Santa Anita, where there is another Pick 
Six carryover today, so baffling is that the track is playing as fairly as it 
has in years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gogarty finished third Sunday in his first race since being purchased by Bob 
Knight and Pete Newell, who are friends of trainer Wayne Lukas. Jockey Gary 
Stevens wore Indiana crimson silks with a Hoosier basketball emblem on the 
back. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If there is a filly good enough to run in the Kentucky Derby this year, it 
could be Lakeway, who ran seven furlongs Saturday as fast as Breeders' Cup 
sprint champion Cardmania did later in the day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand fans from Phoenix are expected to support hometown hero Michael 
Carbajal when he defends his light-flyweight title against Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez in a rematch Feb. 19 at the Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A relief pitcher named Todd was examined by Dodger physician Frank Jobe and 
advised to skip working out for two weeks because of an elbow problem -- Todd 
Williams, that is.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SAFETY HOSKINS GRINDING IT OUT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been the longest season starting strong safety Derrick Hoskins has 
ever played and he's feeling the wear and tear physically. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long, long season for me," said Hoskins, who replaced Ronnie 
Lott before the start of the season. "We're going into our 18th game, not 
counting preseason, and my body is starting to wear down." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins, a second-year pro from Southern Mississippi, realizes that he can't 
run as fast or jump as high as he did two months ago and that he walks with a 
slight limp that wasn't there in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is not ready to call for help yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to be strong mentally," said Hoskins, who has started all 17 
games and has two interceptions. "But I'll know better now when it comes to 
keeping myself ready for an entire season next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins' improved play has been a key in the Raiders' ability to stop teams in 
the second half over the last month of the season. In the Raiders' victory over 
the Broncos on Sunday, Hoskins helped the secondary make a statement with a 
sideline hit on Denver tight end Reggie Johnson early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 One strength the Raiders have going to Buffalo is the play of their secondary. 
Although Denver moved the ball in the air against them the last two weeks, the 
Raiders feel that they have an advantage against the Bills, whose air attack is 
not as strong as in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once teams move the ball against us, we try to iron things out on the 
sideline," Hoskins said. "I think the last two weeks, we've done a good job at 
that and shut down people in the second half. We know that we can't stop teams 
on every play. We just have to keep playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC has not won a Super Bowl in 10 years and Raider Coach Art Shell feels 
that it's time the losing streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt that the Raiders belong in the Super Bowl," Shell said. 
"It's been a long time since we've been there, which was the last time the AFC 
won.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be easy but it's time for us to go back and win the darn 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders won Super Bowl XVIII and are the last AFC team to do so. Since 
then, Buffalo and Denver have each lost three times, while Miami, Cincinnati 
and New England have lost once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a broken fibula in the first 
quarter against Denver, was put on injured reserve. He was replaced on the 
roster by Warren Powers, a fifth-year pro from Maryland, who was with the Rams 
in 1992. LONNIE WHITE

FISHING REPORT: DFG PLANS TO DOUBLE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trout fishing in the city is on the upswing, thanks to the Department of Fish 
and Game's expanded Urban Lakes Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a positive public response to the program it started last year, the DFG 
plans to nearly double the number of urban lakes in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties to be regularly stocked with catchable trout in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 On the list for this year are Echo Park Lake near downtown Los Angeles, Balboa 
Park Lake in the San Fernando Valley, Alondra Park Lake in Torrance, Cerritos 
Park Lake, Kenneth Hahn Park Lake in Baldwin Hills, La Mirada Park Lake, Magic 
Lake in Willowbrook, Lincoln Park Lake in Lincoln Hills, Centennial Park Lake 
in Santa Ana and Tri-City Park Lake in Placentia.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: JUDGE RULES AGAINST GILL-NETTERS' REQUEST FOR 
INJUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego Superior Court judge last Thursday denied a request by gill-net 
fishermen for a preliminary injunction to delay the removal of gill nets from 
California waters until their lawsuit against the state of California is 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gillnetters Assn. sued the state last March, seeking to declare Prop. 132 
unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory and deals with more 
than one issue -- the establishment of ecological reserves as well as outlawing 
gill nets.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Arthur W. Jones, who denied the gill-netters' request for 
an injunction, will decide the case against Prop. 132 in San Diego on April 1.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the measure, passed in 1990, use of the efficient but 
controversial fishing gear -- known to trap mammals and birds as well as 
targeted species -- became illegal within three miles of the coast or within 
one mile of or in water less than 70 fathoms (whichever is less) around the 
Channel Islands on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Paulk, president of the United Anglers of Southern California, spearheaded 
the signature-gathering effort to put the measure on the ballot. He called its 
passage "the most important step ever taken to restore our fisheries" and said 
he is looking forward to a final resolution on the issue "so that we may 
concentrate our efforts on other things." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fishing stinks: Four Los Angeles anglers aboard the vessel Hildago, fishing 
off San Cristobal near Cabo San Lucas, were overwhelmed recently during an 
encounter with hundreds of hungry dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Two in the group passed out on the deck in a cold sweat. But this had nothing 
to do with the strength of the fish. The dorado had taken refuge beneath the 
floating carcass of a huge whale, rotting fast beneath the hot Baja sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a die-hard when it comes to fishing," angler Dick Rutherford told Fishing 
International, "but even with a heavy cold, that carcass put me on my knees." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous animals in southeastern Ohio? Humans. More precisely, pot 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 A large area where marijuana is being cultivated on public lands has been 
dubbed the "weed belt," and according to Backpacker Magazine, hikers run the 
risk of encountering such obstacles as bear leg-hold traps, dynamite and fish 
hooks strung between trees at eye level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A moose is generally no match for a bear, but a moose does not always go 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Batin, in Western Outdoors Magazine, recalls coming across the 
site of one such encounter between a bull moose and a brown, or grizzly bear, 
while with fly-fishing guide Jim Bailey in Alaska's Talkeetna Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge area of Alpine tundra had been ripped from the earth and on the ground 
lay a set of antlers with a record-book spread of more than 68 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey determined that the bear had chased the moose into a lake and charged 
the animal when it emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "A brown bear can kill a full-grown moose like this in a matter of seconds 
with the right bite behind the neck, or it can take 15 minutes or longer," 
Bailey told Batin. "From the depth of the ruts and torn up area, I'd say it was 
some battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The bear apparently buried the moose and fed on the carcass until going into 
hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
 Batin found only a few scattered bones, some dried-up hide and part of a 
spinal column. "All in all, not much left of a 1,200-pound animal," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Locally, fishing for bottom fish has been the most productive and 
lingcod remain the most prized of bottom fishes. The Pacific Dawn, running out 
of CISCO Sportfishing in Oxnard, ran a "lingcod special" on Sunday near Santa 
Rosa Island and 16 anglers boated 37 fish, most weighing more than 20 pounds. 
Randy King, marina manager at Lake Casitas, landed a 38-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico: Striped marlin are abundant off Cabo San Lucas, as is typical of 
January. And an occasional large blue marlin is showing at the scales. Alfonso 
Vicente of Spain landed a 528-pound blue after a two-hour fight at Jaime Banks. 
Dorado are also plentiful and wahoo are showing more frequently. San Jose Del 
Cabo: Yellowfin tuna are the main fare, with anglers scoring in double figures 
fish to 30 pounds. But dorado are abundant as well. Victor Gutierrez of 
Victor's Panga fleet said a camper at Rancho San Luis reported dorado -- 
typically a pelagic fish -- chasing baitfish onto the sand. The camper claims 
to have landed eight dorado from the beach. Revillagigedo Islands: The season 
is underway and off to a good start. Skippers John Grabowski of the Red Rooster 
III and Frank LoPreste of the Royal Polaris arrived at the islands off southern 
Mexico in the past few days and both reported Tuesday that the tuna were so 
plentiful that fishermen were releasing those weighing less than 150 pounds. 
There were not yet any 300-pounders, but several weigh more than 200. Both 
vessels are due back late next week. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Starting March 1, fishermen must wear their fishing licenses 
attached to their outer clothing above the waist or around the neck -- either 
pinned or in a clear holder. It is hoped that the new regulation will reduce 
loss of revenue to the Department of Fish and Game by illicit fishing. . . . A 
38-mile section of the Upper Sacramento River, closed since July of 1991 
because of a toxic spill, will open when the season begins April 30. However, 
to protect the fragile wild trout fishery, most of the section of river will be 
restricted to catch-and-release.

LOS ALAMITOS; PLANO TURNS SOUTHLAND UNCERTAINTY INTO MIXTURE OF BUSINESS, 
PLEASURE

<P>
 After winning the training title at the Sacramento harness meeting last 
summer, Rick Plano turned the second half of 1993 into a working vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano had too many sharp horses in his stable to put them all in the pasture 
and sit on the sideline, waiting for harness racing to resume in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he shipped 20 horses to Vernon Downs in Vernon, N.Y., where both he 
and his wife, Maryann, had grown up. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano raced at Vernon Downs for a few months before shipping to a New Jersey 
farm centrally located between Freehold Raceway and Garden State Park. He won 
several races on the East Coast and sold half of the horses he had taken with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano moved back to California in November and began preparing for the new 
year. When a harness meeting was announced for the winter at Los Alamitos in 
mid-December, Plano's stable was almost ready. Last Friday night, the opening 
night of the Premier Harness Racing Assn. meeting, Plano, of La Palma, had 
eight starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not knowing if we'd be racing here was the downside or the sad side to 
training here this winter," he said. "If we didn't open, we would have gone 
back to New York or New Jersey. We were as close to dead as we could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Plano won only one race on Friday, but it was the one to win -- the $11,000 
feature for older pacers. Plano drove his wife's 4-year-old gelding, 
Keepyourpantson. Keepyourpantson has earned more than $129,000 and has come 
into his own in the last year after racing in the shadow of another Plano 
trained-pacer, The Starting Gate, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Plano sent The Starting Gate to the East, where he finished second 
in the $1-million North American Cup at Greenwood Raceway in Toronto and proved 
to be competitive with some of the nation's best 3-year-old pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Keepyourpantson stayed in California for the first half of 1993 and won seven 
of 12 starts, racing primarily in California-bred stakes. He was among the 
horses Plano took with him last fall and he won at both Hazel Park in Michigan 
and at Vernon Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Keepyourpantson defeated the top older pacers at Los Alamitos, 
including Vacationing, a 5-year-old gelding from Doug Ackerman's stable, and 
Positron, a 7-year-old horse with earnings of more than $305,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Keepyourpantson will race in his own age group Saturday night in the Breeders 
Championship for 4-year-old pacers. In most years, there are no state-bred 
stakes for 4-year-olds, but last year was anything but normal. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no harness racing in California since the Sacramento meeting 
ended in early August, and several stakes were not conducted. Instead of 
refunding payments to owners, the races will be held over the next month. 
Overall there are eight stakes -- four Breeders Championships and four races in 
the Electioneer Futurity series -- to be run for 4-year-olds this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Plano has horses in most divisions of the 3- and 4-year-old stakes, among them 
Maxanali, a 3-year-old pacing filly, who was a stakes winner at Sacramento, and 
the 4-year-old trotter, Hays My Game, one of the best of his generation. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Handle figures from opening weekend were less than projected, but officials 
were not overly concerned. They were happy simply to be racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's program was shortened to 10 races when three simulcast races from The 
Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., were canceled because of a snowstorm 
there. Friday's handle was $758,035. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meadowlands simulcasts went off without any problems on Saturday night and 
handled more than $136,000, a figure that pleased General Manager Fred Kuebler. 
Saturday's total handle was $736,026. 
</P>
<P>
 The track plans to simulcast three races each night from The Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, harness racing averaged $899,040 on the first two nights, which 
included live cards of 12 and 10 races. This year's purses are based on an 
average handle of $850,000 and to get there, harness racing will need full 
fields of competitive horses and good luck with the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the horses on the backstretch are not ready to race and a majority of 
those that are haven't had a recent start. Many of last weekend's starters 
hadn't raced since last summer's Sacramento meeting and didn't have qualifying 
races in which to gauge current form. That problem will sort itself out over 
the next few weeks, but until then some bettors might be wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to bet on horses that don't have any (recent past performance) 
lines," Kuebler said. "I wasn't sure anyone knew we were opening. It wasn't 
near enough time to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuebler said filling this week's races will be the toughest chore of the 
meeting because an additional night's worth of horses will be needed to round 
out the racing week. The track filled 10 races for Thursday's program, but 
chose to use only nine, saving one for Friday or Saturday. Of those nine, two 
are short fields of stakes horses and two are for maidens. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Post time might actually mean something in 1994. In previous harness meetings, 
post time was more like a ballpark figure of when a race might start. Last 
Saturday, races were going off about every 21 minutes, which meant the 13th 
race -- the last live race -- began shortly after 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Croghan, who did not drive during the 1993 California harness season, 
drove two winners on Saturday, including Big Bad John, a 6-year-old New 
Zealand-bred gelding, who might be headed for the richer series later in the 
meeting. Croghan, 40, won the Los Alamitos driving title in the fall of 1992, 
the last time he drove. Steve Warrington, the leading driver in California last 
year, will not be back. He committed to racing in New Jersey before it was 
known that a harness meeting would be conducted at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two stakes on Thursday's card, an $11,500 Breeders Championship Trot 
for 3-year-old colts and a $13,800 trot for 3-year-old fillies. The latter race 
includes Lil Eggie, a winner of five of seven starts in 1993.

CAL LUTHERAN TO BEGIN DEFENSE OF TITLE WITH UNBEATEN RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran, which completed a undefeated nonconference basketball schedule 
last week, will begin its quest for a third consecutive Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title against Occidental at home tonight at 
7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen (11-0) are in the midst of a school-record winning streak, but 
they realize those victories do not account for anything in the SCIAC 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new season," Coach Mike Dunlap said. "We're enjoying the fact that we 
have this streak going and we're going to ride it as long as we can, but we're 
not going to worry about it. If it comes to an end, we're going to get back in 
the saddle and try to ride another one." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to take pressure off his team, Dunlap minimizes the fact that the 
Kingsmen won the SCIAC title outright in 1992 and tied La Verne last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude is that we are defending nothing," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental (6-4) will be led by Blair Slattery, the last season's SCIAC player 
of the year. Slattery, a 6-foot-7, 220-pound senior forward, is averaging 24.7 
points and 14.3 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Slattery) is the best player in the conference; I have no problem saying 
that," Dunlap said. "He's a known quantity, so we'll definitely go after him." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran has six players averaging double figures in scoring. Senior guard 
Damon Ridley is averaging 19.5 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.5 
steals. Senior forward Derrick Clark is averaging 14.5 points and 7.5 rebounds.

HOW TO BAIL YOURSELF OUT FROM A SEA OF CHRISTMAS DEBT; CREDIT: FOR MANY, 
HOLIDAY GLOW TURNS TO A BLANCH WHEN THEY REALIZE THEY OWE MORE THAN THEY HAVE. 
THERE'S A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY TO DEAL WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you went a little overboard with your kids' Christmas presents -- all 
right, a lot overboard -- and you probably shouldn't have offered to fly all 
your relatives in for that New Year's reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the magic of the holidays was just too overpowering, you say. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you're paying the price. In fact, for some people, the spirit of the 
Christmas just past will linger for months ahead as holiday bills roll in and 
debt collectors follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday expenses often are compounded by other big winter bills, like higher 
heating costs, annual insurance premiums or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough season . . . (but) people really hit the credit cards," said 
Craig J. Costanzo, who runs Management Adjustment Bureau Inc., a Buffalo, N.Y., 
collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Visa reported a 32% jump in retail spending on cards between 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, compared with the same period in 1992. MasterCard 
said charges were up nearly 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 Costanzo -- who also is president-elect of the American Collectors Assn. trade 
group in Minneapolis -- says many of the nation's 6,000 debt-collection 
agencies are anticipating a busy spring and summer, when credit issuers start 
passing on overdue accounts from the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real growth industry," Costanzo said of business. "No. 1, there's more 
debt to be collected; No. 2, credit grantors are cutting staff back and 
outsourcing more work." 
</P>
<P>
 About 227 million accounts totaling $75 billion were handed over to collection 
agencies in 1992, the most recent year for which data are available, the ACA 
says. That compared with 232 accounts and $70.6 billion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The average recovery rate is 19 cents on the dollar. Of that, debt collectors 
keep up to half. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's best to work with a creditor before your account reaches this stage 
-- at the very least to avoid a poor credit rating -- it's also important to 
understand your rights and responsibilities under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 You're still responsible for your debts, and the creditor that hired the 
collection agency can take legal action against you. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which became law 15 years ago, 
outlaws unfair collection practices, including harassment, by collection 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important for you to know what your rights are and not to be 
intimidated by the collector," said Gerri Detweiler, director of BankCard 
Holders of America, a consumer group based in Herndon, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Detweiler notes, for instance, that collectors cannot call you before 8 a.m. 
or after 9 p.m., cannot use abusive language; cannot tell others about your 
debt, even family members; and cannot collect more than you owe. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get debt collectors off your back by simply writing them to cease all 
communication with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Detweiler and experts from other consumer groups advise that individuals be 
honest about debt problems and try to work out a repayment schedule with the 
collector. Sometimes, a collector might even accept less than what is owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Costanzo says collection agencies often will act as a "financial resource for 
getting people to work out their debts." But he admits abuses sometimes exist 
in collection practices, especially in the absence of industrywide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he says, collectors lose their tempers under pressure. "When people 
are abusive to you all day you're just going to pop. This is a very difficult 
business," Costanzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Cherico, a spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. 
in Arlington, Va., says most consumer complaints about bill collection agency 
harassment eventually are settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission polices serious collector abuse of the law 
through class-action civil suits. In the past 14 years, the agency said, it has 
sued 30 collection agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many creditors, particularly larger ones, prefer to bypass debt collectors 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the last resort for us," said Phil Davis, a senior vice president at 
NationsBank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. "We will work out accounts in-house up 
until the time the account is seven months delinquent and then charge it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us that much more control over collections." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said his bank may do things such as negotiate a lower interest rate, 
lower the minimum payment or even waive interest for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who is having some significant personal financial problems . . . 
because of illness or if they're out of work, you want to bend over backwards 
for," he said. "(But) . . . if the consumer has enough income to pay us, we may 
not be as flexible with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides working directly with a creditor, consumers also can turn to the 
National Foundation for Consumer Credit of Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400,000 families met last year with counselors at the foundation's 
1,000 offices.

FORD MAY END EFFORT TO DESIGN ELECTRIC VEHICLE; AUTOS: THE COMPANY IS 
CONSIDERING POSTPONING DEVELOPMENT UNTIL A BETTER BATTERY IS AVAILABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. may cancel its program to build an electric vehicle from the 
ground up, its director said Tuesday, calling the effort financially wasteful 
until more advanced battery and related technology is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a step would increase pressure on California to relax its mandate 
requiring auto makers to sell zero-emission vehicles in the state beginning in 
1998. Car makers worldwide want the mandate repealed.  
</P>
<P>
 A delay of Ford's new electric vehicle program would leave the company likely 
to rely on the conversion of existing internal-combustion engine vehicles if it 
is to meet California's regulations. The company will continue testing its 
prototype Ecostar, which is essentially an electric conversion of its European 
Escort van. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are reassessing the appropriateness of spending money on a ground-up 
vehicle," Dennis Wilke, director of Ford's electric vehicle programs, 
acknowledged after a speech to the World Automotive Congress. "If the battery 
and powertrain technology are not there, it's a waste of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilke said Ford has spent more than $100 million on electric vehicle 
development in the past two years. The company is now considering whether such 
spending should be directed more at technology advancement rather than product 
development, Wilke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reassessment comes just two months after Alexander Trotman was named 
chairman and chief executive of Ford. Publicly, Trotman is more pessimistic and 
outspoken about electric vehicles than his predecessor, Harold Poling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Detroit auto show last week, Trotman told reporters that Ford hopes to 
persuade the California Air Resources Board to drop its mandate in favor of 
proposals that would rely on alternative fuels and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can achieve the Clean Air Act objectives without a mandate," 
Trotman said. "There are other feasible alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford officials said Tuesday that they will soon present a plan to California 
officials showing how federal pollution standards can be met without requiring 
zero-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric power is the only viable option in the near term for meeting the 
state's rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will call for a mix of vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas, 
methanol and other alternative fuels. It will also advocate a stronger smog 
check system -- currently a matter of conflict between the state and federal 
governments -- and a program to remove high-polluting clunkers from California 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three began a lobbying push last fall aimed at persuading California 
to relax the electric vehicle mandate. The auto makers argue that they are 
unable to produce a vehicle with sufficient range and a low enough cost to 
attract buyers. The main obstacle: the lack of a good battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit sees 1994 as a key year in the electric vehicle debate. The ARB will 
review its emissions regulations this year, and the companies say they must 
make production decisions soon. 
</P>
<P>
 While Detroit appears increasingly optimistic that a rollback will occur, 
electric car proponents in California say the state will not readily fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have no reason to believe the mandate won't hold," said 
Diane Wittenberg, manager of electric transportation for Southern California 
Edison, a strong supporter of electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jacqueline Schafer, the ARB's new chairwoman, said at the Los Angeles 
Auto Show last week that the agency had no plans to kill or delay the 
zero-emissions regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the auto makers continue to conduct advanced battery research 
in tandem with the federal government and the electric utility industry. The 
auto companies are also pursuing electric car development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only General Motors Corp. has unveiled a ground-up electric vehicle 
-- the two-seat Impact -- but the company has backed away from a promised 1995 
rollout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has been more secretive about its electric vehicle programs. Trade 
publications indicate that Ford is working on a small, four-passenger commuter 
car. There has also been speculation that the company would build an 
electric-powered family van developed in Europe.

JAMES FLANIGAN: TROUBLE AND TRADING; MEXICO REFORM HAS BALANCING ACT WITH 
REBELS, WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a long way from the jungles of Chiapas in southern Mexico to the carpeted 
offices of Wall Street, where international traders make judgments on financing 
for Mexican industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is on Wall Street that the Indian uprising against the Mexican 
government, which has claimed more than 100 lives in the past week, is having 
its most important economic impact, because it is arousing the concerns of 
credit rating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico needs the approval of those agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's, 
Duff & Phelps -- for its government and individual companies to be able to 
borrow at reasonable rates, a most important consideration for a country that 
borrows almost $20 billion a year -- roughly 6% of its total economy -- to 
finance development. If Mexico could gain a higher investment rating, it could 
qualify for international pension fund investments, which would put its 
industries on the road to world-class status. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, Mexico was on its way. Enthusiasm for the economic reform 
policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement had made the country a bright hope of the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
 But the violence was a wake-up call, a reminder that Mexico is still a poor, 
developing country with an economy characterized by vast income disparities, a 
fledgling industrial base and a system of agriculture that historically has 
proved a source of social and economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has not turned off, but it has turned cautious. "These events 
would make anyone take notice, but we are encouraged by Mexico," says David 
Roberts, senior analyst of Duff & Phelps. "We would like to see more exports to 
reduce the trade deficit and more internally generated capital rather than a 
continuing buildup of debt," says Kristin Lindow, senior analyst with Moody's 
Investment Service. Mexico's investment rating will not be upgraded anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their caution is justified," says Sebastian Edwards, chief economist for 
Latin America at the World Bank. "But caution should be accompanied by more 
knowledge and understanding. It would be disastrous if financial markets turned 
off Mexico now, because Salinas' reform program is designed to remedy the 
economic troubles that are behind the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 What's really going on in Mexico, and what's the outlook? 
</P>
<P>
 The uprising, first of all, is occurring in the country's poorest region, 
inhabited by more than 3 million people, most of whom retain the Mayan culture, 
and by tens of thousands of refugees from Guatemala and elsewhere in Central 
America. Where per-capita income for most of Mexico's 85 million people is 
about $3,000 a year, people in Chiapas live at a subsistence level of about 
$230 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas has been hurt by the worldwide decline in coffee prices in recent 
years and by the traditional Achilles' heel of the Mexican economy: 
agriculture. Mexico, a country once characterized by vast landed estates, is a 
place where land reform never quite worked. The distribution of land to the 
peasantry from the revolution of 1910 to the early 1930s resulted in small 
farmers living on uneconomic, one- and two-acre plots called ejidos.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, custom and regulation said ejidos could not be sold. So agriculture, 
which helped form capital and family wealth in the United States and other 
countries, has not contributed capital to the Mexican economy. One of Salinas' 
reforms is to allow ejido owners to sell their property, but in Chiapas, this 
has been misunderstood and in fact has contributed to the unrest, says Luis 
Maizel, a La Jolla-based investment manager currently traveling in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of agriculture's failure to serve as a source of capital, Mexico's 
attempts at economic development have been characterized by boom and bust -- 
development interrupted when credit became overextended and was cut off, as 
happened in the 1980s after the oil boom turned into the Mexican debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy's current growth began when Salinas came into office in 1988 and 
opened Mexico to world markets and global competition. He privatized state 
industry and, reckoning that the only way Mexico would develop would be in 
partnership with the United States, concluded the NAFTA agreement, which went 
into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' policies have improved the Mexican economy: Inflation has dropped to 
8% and is headed for 5% this year; Mexico's high birthrate has been declining 
for several years. The outlook, in other words, was good heading into 1994, an 
election year when Salinas will leave office, probably to be replaced by Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the current secretary of social development. 
</P>
<P>
 "And nothing has happened to seriously disturb that outlook," says Abraham 
Lowenthal, director of the Center for International Studies at USC. "The unrest 
in Chiapas doesn't mean the country is falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 International investors seem to agree. D.A. Campbell & Co., a Los Angeles 
investment firm specializing in Mexican issues, saw little U.S. selling of 
Mexican stocks in recent days. And Salomon Bros. in New York found similar 
patience among investors. "The bottom line is the country and the good Mexican 
companies have not changed," says Juan Carlos Garcia, a Salomon research 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country has changed. "Just look at the official reaction to this 
uprising," says World Bank economist Edwards. Mexico is a country that has 
known terrible violence in its history -- its revolution was so bloody that 
leading groups finally compromised in the 1930s on a single party, which has 
ruled the country to this day. In 1968, the government of President Gustavo 
Diaz Ordaz summarily shot student demonstrators in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it's different. The Mexican Army initially went at the Chiapas 
rebels with guns blazing and bombs falling. But with Wall Street looking on 
nervously, Salinas' government quickly adopted a more accommodating stance. 
This week, it replaced the controversial governor of Chiapas with a 
human-rights administrator, is offering to negotiate with the uprising's 
leaders and has pledged to increase social welfare funds for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a long way from Mexico to Wall Street, but the distance is getting 
shorter. Mexico's Financial Uprising 
</P>
<P>
 International credit experts, aroused by the violence in Chiapas, also are 
concerned with the build-up of public and private borrowings by the Mexican 
government and industries. Those borrowings are shown by a burgeoning current 
account deficit, which has tripled since 1990 as Mexico has sought funds to 
finance its economic development.

SYNTEX GIVEN OK TO SELL NAPROSYN OVER THE COUNTER; MEDICINE: THE FDA APPROVES A 
NON-PRESCRIPTION VERSION OF THE POPULAR PAIN RELIEVER, SETTING THE STAGE FOR A 
COMPETITIVE BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration has approved a popular prescription arthritis 
drug for marketing as an over-the-counter pain reliever -- a move that will 
cause competitive headaches for the makers of Advil, Tylenol and other pain 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, naproxen sodium, is the first non-prescription pain reliever to win 
FDA approval since ibuprofen a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naproxen's long record of use clearly indicated that the drug could be sold 
over the counter, provided the manufacturer modified its dosage and labeling," 
FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured by Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto, the drug has been sold by 
prescription in the United States under the brand name Naprosyn since 1976, 
mostly for arthritis and inflammation. The non-prescription version, to be 
marketed for Syntex by Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble, will be sold under 
the brand name Aleve. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's approval sets the stage for a spirited fight in the 
$2.3-billion-a-year over-the-counter pain reliever market. The Syntex-Procter & 
Gamble product will go up against such established ibuprofen brands as Advil, 
produced by American Home Products Corp., and Upjohn Corp.'s Motrin IB. Another 
competitor will be Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol, whose active ingredient is 
acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in for a real marketing battle, and we want to do it the right way," 
said Syntex Chairman Paul E. Freiman, explaining why his firm formed a joint 
venture with consumer giant P&G in 1988 to seek FDA approval for a 
non-prescription version of Naprosyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the marketing costs for Aleve will be steep enough to erase any 
profits from the sale of the product for the first few years. Freiman agreed 
with that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different chemical compound than previous pain medicines, but you have 
to educate the consumer," said Kristine E. Bryan, an analyst at S.G. Warburg & 
Co. in New York. "Just like any new branded entity, it costs a lot of money to 
gain that shelf space." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan estimated that Aleve will generate U.S. revenue of $250 million during 
Syntex's 1995-96 fiscal year, but said the actual figure will depend on the 
success of P&B's marketing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for American Home Products said the company is "confident that 
Advil's proven record of safety and efficacy will remain unchallenged by the 
introduction" of Aleve. 
</P>
<P>
 Syntex and Procter & Gamble will have exclusive rights to market the 
non-prescription drug for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Syntex shares gained 37.5 cents to $16.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Tuesday. The stock has traded as high as $23.250 during the past 52 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Naprosyn and another naproxen-based drug, Anaprox, generated $928 million, or 
32%, of Syntex's worldwide sales of $2.13 billion for its fiscal year ended 
July 31. Syntex's patent for Naprosyn expired in December. Since then, more 
than half a dozen manufacturers have begun marketing generic versions of 
Naprosyn. To preempt its rivals, Syntex's Hamilton Parma Inc. unit began 
marketing its own generic version of Naprosyn in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Freiman said the generic versions have caused a "rapid falloff" in sales for 
the more costly Naprosyn brand. Syntex expected a sales decline, but the rate 
has been "on the fast end" of its estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's announcement Tuesday was therefore welcome news for Syntex. It 
followed a recommendation in June by FDA advisory committees that naproxen 
sodium not be approved for non-prescription use. The panels were concerned that 
because the drug acts slowly, consumers might take too much. There was also 
concern about misuse of the drug by children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the drug for non-prescription use, the FDA asked Syntex to reduce 
the daily dose, extend the time between doses and add label warnings for 
children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said naproxen sodium can be taken for headaches, colds, toothaches, 
muscle aches, backaches, menstrual cramps and arthritis, and to reduce fever.

MARKET BEAT: WHEN IT COMES TO FUND INDUSTRY, PUBLIC TRUST MUST BE A MUTUAL 
ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mutual fund industry's long honeymoon with the media may be over. At issue 
is whether the press -- and, more important, the public -- can continue to 
trust the industry's ability to vigorously police itself. 
</P>
<P>
 This is more than an academic question: The $2-trillion fund industry has been 
built up largely on investors' trust over the last 10 years. The fund business 
is, arguably, the cleanest $2-trillion business in the nation and perhaps the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the phenomenal growth in fund assets, especially since 1990, the 
potential for scandal, self-dealing and irresponsible marketing has mushroomed. 
Two developments point up the fund industry's new vulnerability: 
</P>
<P>
 * Last week, Denver-based fund giant Invesco fired a star portfolio manager 
for allegedly failing to follow the firm's rules on reporting personal 
securities trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing has raised questions -- and generated a host of news stories -- 
about the adequacy of controls over the ballooning ranks of fund managers who 
have been entrusted with the public's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Thursday, state securities regulators, the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons and the Consumer Federation of America will jointly release a public 
poll showing that many people who are buying investments through banks have no 
clue about the risk involved. The poll results will directly indict bank sales 
of mutual funds, which have rocketed since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest investor survey will almost certainly add momentum to federal 
regulators' campaign to change the investment sales practices of banks. Indeed, 
a similar survey done for the Securities and Exchange Commission in November 
showed 41% of investors who bought mutual funds through a bank believed that 
the funds were backed by the bank's assets. (They aren't.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a fund industry problem? Many fund executives say it isn't; they blame 
the banks. But that is being extremely shortsighted. In both examples here -- 
the internal-controls issue and the problem of a confused public -- it's time 
for the fund industry to do what it has historically done very well: police 
itself intensively. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 * The public needs to feel sure that it is getting a square deal from fund 
managers. Americans have turned to funds in huge numbers largely because they 
believe they can't compete in financial markets on their own. There is a deep 
distrust of Wall Street, big-time traders and brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 If investors begin to doubt that fund managers are much different from the 
market crooks who paraded through federal courts in the 1980s -- people whose 
main goal was to enrich themselves, to others' detriment -- the fund industry 
will lose one of its most important selling points with the small investor. 
</P>
<P>
 In firing fund manager John Kaweske, Invesco alleged only technical violations 
of company rules on personal securities trades. But in the aftermath of that 
firing, the media has begun to ask many questions about what fund managers are 
allowed to do with their personal money and whether they can profit at the 
expense of their fund shareholders -- by trading in their own accounts ahead of 
trades they make for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the big fund companies have insisted -- convincingly -- 
that they would never allow such "front running" and that they have the 
internal controls in place to make sure it doesn't happen. "Our rule is simple: 
You don't do it," says Jon Fossel, head of fund company Oppenheimer Management 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some fund industry executives say the bigger issue is whether fund 
managers should be allowed to trade privately in individual stocks, period. 
Front-running is obviously illegal, but there are many more gray areas that 
arise when a manager can own a stock personally and potentially influence it 
with fund money, or discuss it with other fund managers in the same company who 
could influence it. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rogers, head of fund company Ariel Capital Management in Chicago, says he 
simply doesn't trade in individual stocks himself. "I feel that I should have 
my money in my own fund," he says. "If I'm selling my shareholders on the idea 
of diversification, I think I should follow that advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that extreme a policy is necessary -- or beneficial in the long run -- 
is a matter of great debate, however. Telling star managers to stop trading the 
market personally is asking them to stop doing what they're paid to be very 
good at. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with permitting" personal trading, says Michael 
Lipper, head of fund tracker Lipper Analytical in New York. "The problem I have 
is, how (well) do you police it?" 
</P>
<P>
 What is important now is for the industry to take a close look at how it 
monitors its managers and whether tighter rules, or tighter enforcement, are 
needed. And the rules should be communicated directly to investors by the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * If fund buyers don't understand what they own, the industry is sitting on a 
time bomb. The SEC-commissioned investor survey last fall, and the survey due 
out Thursday from the state securities regulators and the AARP, both show that 
a substantial number of new fund investors don't grasp a simple concept: Mutual 
funds aren't insured by the government or a bank. Owning them entails risk of 
loss if the market goes against you. And nothing about bank-sold mutual funds 
makes them any safer than other funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose fault is it that people don't understand basic market risk? It's easy to 
blame the banks, who now make 15% of all fund sales. Obviously, many 
conservative savers are walking over to in-bank securities salespeople and 
asking for something that offers higher returns than meager 3% CD yields. The 
salespeople are merely obliging their customers, and the fund companies are 
only too happy to let the banks sell their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund executives concede -- often unapolo- getically -- that they can't make 
sure that every conversation between a bank salesperson and a new investor 
includes the necessary caveats about risk. "At the sales desk, there's nothing 
more we can do to police this, other than with the fund literature itself," 
says Oppenheimer's Fossel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe and maybe not. Many fund companies' literature -- the jacket to a 
prospectus, for example -- certainly could be made more dramatic in warning of 
risk. (How about big red letters on a black background, stating "THIS 
INVESTMENT IS NOT INSURED"?) 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the funds could demand that bank clients follow some simple rules that 
many now don't: For example, demand that an in-bank salesperson get the 
customer's signature on a form that states explicitly that the customer 
understands the risks in owning a fund. (California banks are ahead of the 
curve on this: A recent poll by the California Bankers Assn. found that more 
than 90% of CBA member banks get such signed statements.) 
</P>
<P>
 Is this expecting too much of the funds? Are they being asked to protect the 
public from itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But in the long run, the industry ought to realize that if the public 
fails to grasp the unavoidable risks it is taking via the funds, the 
accusations, anguish and lawsuits that will fly in the next stock and bond bear 
markets -- and the outflow of money from the funds -- will be as unprecedented 
as the current flow of money into the funds. The Funds' Achilles Heel? 
</P>
<P>
 In a November survey of investors who purchased mutual funds through their 
bank, the level of misunderstanding about fund investments was shockingly high. 
An example: 
</P>
<P>
 "Are mutual funds sold by a bank backed by the bank's assets?" (Percentage of 
investors responding:) Yes: 41% No: 40% Don't know: 19%

the companies announced.Fluor emerged as the obvious victor last week when Rust 
International Corp. of Birmingham, Ala. -- one of the two engineering firms 
under consideration by Mercedes -- said it had received a rejection letter from 
the German auto maker. The Irvine engineering company's core subsidiary, Fluor 
Daniel, will provide construction management services for the

 Semiconductor Book-to-Bill Ratio Goes Up: The industry ratio for the North 
American market increased in December, according to statistics collected by 
World Semiconductor Trade Statistics and released by the San Jose-based 
Semiconductor Industry Assn.December bookings in the North American market 
(orders based on a three-month moving average) were $2.276 billion -- up 3.0% 
from the $2.210 billion recorded in November -- and 20.0% higher than the 
$1.896 billion figure posted in December, 1992. The December book-to-bill ratio 
is 1.04. November's preliminary ratio remains unchanged at 0.99. A book-to-bill 
ratio of 1.04 means that for every $100 worth of products shipped (billed), 
manufacturers received $104 worth of new orders (bookings).

 Nintendo to Lay Off 136 U.S. Workers: Nintendo of America, a unit of Japan's 
Nintendo Corp., said the layoffs will occur in the Seattle area as some 
manufacturing jobs are moved to Mexico.The workers received notice this week 
that they will be laid off in March. As a result of the job cuts, Nintendo's 
U.S. work force of about 1,300 people will be reduced by 10%. Redmond, 
Wash.-based Nintendo is the first major Seattle area company to move jobs to 
Mexico since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect Jan. 1.

 USAir Held Liable for Fatal Crash: A federal judge in Cleveland ruled USAir 
Group Inc. is financially liable for the March, 1992, crash in which 27 people 
died at New York's La Guardia Airport. Families of those killed and survivors 
are seeking compensation for the crash, and awards will be determined later.The 
company said it could not estimate what the cost may be, and has said it would 
pay "reasonable" compensation to survivors and the estates. A jury has yet to 
decide whether the company is liable for punitive damages, which are not 
insured. The National Transportation Safety Board decided that ice and snow on 
the wings of Fight 405 to Cleveland caused a problem during the Fokker F-28's 
attempted takeoff. The plane veered off the runway and crashed.

 Treasury to Call In Bonds Early: The action is being taken on long-term bonds 
that pay 8.5% interest in order to save money, the fourth bond issue since 1962 
that the Treasury has redeemed early.The government's decision to do so 
reflects the same plunge in interest rates that has made it cheaper for the 
average homeowner to refinance mortgages. The Treasury said that on May 15 it 
will call $2.4 billion worth of 25-year bonds that were scheduled to mature May 
15, 1999. Any bonds not turned in on May 15 will no longer earn interest. About 
$961 million of the bonds are held by private investors and the rest are in 
government accounts.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; PROFIT TAKING FINALLY ENDS DOW CLIMB

<P>
 Market Overview * Blue-chip stocks suffered their first setback of the new 
year Tuesday, as profit taking broke the market's string of seven consecutive 
sessions of higher closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index rebounded from Monday's plunge. But many Asian 
markets suffered another round of deep profit taking, which continued early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields dipped amid optimism that upcoming government data will 
show that inflation remained in check last month. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average eased 15.20 points to 3,850.31, leading the 
broad market lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's slight decline ended four straight all-time highs on the Dow as well 
as record closes Monday for broader indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market was stronger than the Dow would suggest, some analysts said. 
Losing issues outnumbered winners by just 11 to 10 on the Big Board and by a 
smaller margin on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had close to a moonshot rally in blue-chips, particularly in autos," 
said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York. 
"The big surprise is it took until the seventh trading day of the new year for 
the market to show a little profit taking. I think it's very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian markets, meanwhile, were hit much harder by profit taking than were 
U.S. shares. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dove 211.13 points to 11,155.81. 
The selloff continued early today, with the index down 416 points near midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's chief stock index, down 3% on Tuesday, was off another 5% early 
today. And in Malaysia, the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange index, down 5.8% on 
Monday, slumped another 7.2% early today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, however, stocks recovered somewhat from Monday's slide in the 
wake of civil unrest. The Bolsa index gained 95.45 points, or 3.9%, to 
2,554.56. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fourth-quarter earnings reports from two large industrial firms weren't well 
received. Alcoa reported a quarterly loss. Though expected, its shares fell 2 
1/2 to 71 5/8. International Paper was off 3/4 to 72 7/8 after saying 
fourth-quarter operating earnings rose 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 But many industrial issues continued to advance, led again by the autos. GM 
gained 1/4 to 59 1/2, Chrysler surged 7/8 to 59 5/8 and Ford rose 1 to 68 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Cincinnati Milacron, up 1 to 23 1/8; Parker Hannifin, 
up 5/8 to 39, and PPG Industries, up 5/8 to 77. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil-related stocks fell amid new pessimism about OPEC's willingness to rein 
in production. Schlumberger fell 1 3/8 to 59 1/2, Chevron lost 1 to 90 3/4, 
Halliburton dropped 1 1/2 to 32 and Enron Oil & Gas sank 1 1/8 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hilton Hotels leaped 2 5/8 to 63 1/2 after saying that fourth-quarter 
earnings should be up 20%, despite a onetime charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biogen surged 5 to 46 1/4 after the biotech firm said it is concluding 
clinical trials for its multiple sclerosis drug a year ahead of schedule, which 
could speed federal approval of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in foreign trading, London's FTSE-100 index lost 26.8 points to 
3,413.8. In Frankfurt, the DAX average ended down 5.04 points at 2,228.75. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed at 18,485.25, up 41.81 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield eased to 6.23% from 6.24% on Monday, as 
interest rates marked time ahead of inflation reports for December. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders said they expected news of low inflation today and Thursday, 
following last week's report of modest jobs growth. On Friday, the Labor 
Department reported a smaller than expected gain in non-farm payrolls in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in fixed-income securities welcome news of low inflation because 
higher prices in the economy can diminish the value of their holdings. In other 
markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold for current delivery gained $3 to close at $388.00 an ounce on the New 
York Comex. Silver closed at $5.11, up 7.4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forecasts for a frigid weekend in the Midwest and Northeast helped push 
light, sweet crude oil prices up 18 cents to $14.85 a barrel on the New York 
Merc, after Monday's 65-cents-a-barrel dive. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar edged slightly higher in an extremely quiet session.

L.A. CONVENTION BOOKINGS UP 49% OVER 1992; TOURISM: OFFICIALS HESITATE TO 
DECLARE A TURNAROUND, THOUGH, NOTING THAT THE CITY STILL LAGS FAR BEHIND SOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign that Los Angeles' battered tourist industry is on the mend, 
convention bookings during the last half of 1993 were nearly 50% higher than in 
the final six months of 1992, according to the Los Angeles Convention & 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism officials remain cautious, however. They note that a complete 
turnaround remains a long way off and that Los Angeles lags far behind cities 
such as Anaheim, San Diego and San Francisco in attracting large conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego, for example, booked more than 300 large-scale conventions and 
meetings during the last six months of 1993. Los Angeles signed up 117 future 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are encouraged, but we still haven't totally turned the corner," said 
Cheryl L. Phelps, regional manager for Hyatt Hotels in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 49% increase in Los Angeles bookings reflects in part a dismal 1992, when 
the Los Angeles-area tourist industry suffered because of the city's riots. In 
addition, many groups were waiting to see the outcome of the $500-million 
expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the . . . riots and the economic malaise, people were very reluctant 
to make a commitment" and come to Los Angeles, visitors bureau spokesman Gary 
Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the center neared completion and concerns about visiting eased, more 
groups -- ranging from the National Assn. of Broadcasters and the American 
Postal Workers -- agreed to hold their conventions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown hoteliers have already reported improved bookings this year as a 
result of the expanded center's opening in November. The Hilton and Towers said 
room bookings are running 15% ahead of last year, while Hyatt Regency Los 
Angeles reports a 41% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I think the worst is over," said Michel Tourniaire, general 
manager of the Hotel Inter-Continental Los Angeles, which was nearly sold out 
for five days in November with members of the International Assn. of Amusement 
Parks and Attractions, the first major group to meet at the expanded Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, hotel owners are concerned that business may worsen in 1995, when only 
eight major groups -- compared to 19 this year -- are scheduled to meet at the 
Convention Center. Uncertainty about the center's expansion and fears triggered 
by the Los Angeles riots -- which occurred at a time when major groups were 
booking space for 1995 -- have held down reservations for next year, center 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 14 major conventions are booked at the center in 1996, and officials 
say the figure could climb to more than 20.

NATIONAL MEDICAL REPORTS IT LOST $226.1 MILLION IN SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises Inc. said Tuesday that it posted a second-quarter 
loss of $226.1 million, or $1.36 a share, largely because it declared its 
psychiatric hospital business a discontinued operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest results contrast with a restated profit of $52.3 million, or 47 
cents a share, in the year-ago second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the three months ended Nov. 30 slipped to $769.9 million from 
$785.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based company said it decided to divest itself of its 61 
psychiatric hospitals on Nov. 30, 1993, and expects to dispose of the 
properties by the end of its fiscal year in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss from discontinued operations for the latest quarter was $287.3 million, 
or $1.73 a share, compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or 15 cents, the prior 
year. Income from continuing operations was $61.1 million, or 37 cents, 
compared to $78 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical said the loss from discontinued operations includes an 
estimated loss on disposal, plus operating losses during the divestiture 
period. The company will continue to operate its psychiatric hospitals until 
they are divested. 
</P>
<P>
 NME Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Barbakow said results in this fiscal 
year will continue to reflect the company's efforts to resolve its legal 
problems and refocus its business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enormous energy, time and resources have been dedicated to these tasks, and I 
am encouraged by the rapid progress made in the last seven months," Barbakow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow said the company is concentrating on its core general hospital 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, National Medical has settled billing disputes with several 
insurance companies, although it remains under investigation by federal 
authorities, who served criminal search warrants on Aug. 26 at 12 locations.

PEOPLE: ATLANTIC RECORDS MAKES GOLDBERG OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that had been expected for months, Atlantic Records on Tuesday 
officially named Danny Goldberg its president. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has been one of the music industry's worst-kept secrets since word 
that it was coming first leaked out last fall.Goldberg, 43, plans to relocate 
to New York next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main goal is to not screw up what already is a very strong and healthy 
company," Goldberg said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic is part of Time Warner's Warner Music Group. Goldberg fills a post 
left vacant in 1990 when Doug Morris moved up to become co-chairman/co-chief 
executive of Atlantic Group, a title he shares with label founder Ahmet 
Ertegun.  
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic has been one of Time Warner's hotter labels recently, scoring 
especially big with the success of the Stone Temple Pilots. It is also expected 
to announce soon an exclusive deal with veteran producer and composer David 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg started his career as a rock journalist, working for such 
publications as Billboard, Rolling Stone and Circus, where he was editor. He 
later served as vice president of Swan Song, Led Zeppelin's record company.

JUDGE UPHOLDS DEADLINE FOR PRUDENTIAL SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday turned down a request by California and at least three 
other states to push back a Saturday deadline by which investors in Prudential 
Securities' Energy Income partnerships must decide whether to accept a 
class-action settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary S. Mendoza, California's corporations commissioner, had requested a 
90-day delay, arguing that investors were hopelessly confused and had no way to 
calculate how much they would receive under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. in New Orleans 
rejected the request. Livaudais, who presides over the federal Energy Income 
class-action suit, said he was persuaded by written arguments from Prudential 
and other parties that investors have had enough time to make up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Livaudais has not given final approval to the settlement and is not 
due to make a final ruling until after a "fairness hearing" next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate order, he said he will allow Stuart C. Goldberg, an investors' 
lawyer who objects to the settlement, to call a witness at the hearing and 
present evidence in support of his position that the settlement is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Income Funds, a series of money-losing oil and gas investments, 
were the largest of Prudential Securities' limited partnership programs. More 
than 130,000 investors -- many of them retirees or people near retirement -- 
put $1.44 billion into the program from 1983 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged that Prudential 
deliberately misled customers about the safety and performance of the 
partnerships. The proposed class-action settlement would pay about $120 
million. After attorneys' fees, investors are expected to get $90 million -- 
less than one-third of their out-of-pocket losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors must mail in a form "opting out" of the settlement by Saturday or 
they will be bound by it automatically. Those who opt out may pursue individual 
arbitration cases against Prudential or participate in a separate procedure 
resulting from the firm's recent settlement with the SEC. However, it is not 
yet clear how much investors are likely to receive under the SEC procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza called Livaudais' decision "very disappointing" and complained that 
Prudential has been unfairly pressing investors to make a quick decision about 
settling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has shown Prudential's failure to provide investors with enough 
information to make appropriate decisions, and I'm afraid that pattern appears 
to be continuing," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Murray, director of corporate risk management at Prudential, acknowledged 
Tuesday that there is no way for customers to figure out how much they will 
receive under the class-action settlement. The sums will vary depending on how 
many participate and the precise amount of attorneys' fees awarded.

SATELLITE, VIDEO INDUSTRIES STRUGGLE FOR AIR; TECHNOLOGY: NASA SAYS IT NEEDS 
WAVES REGULATORS HAD PLANNED TO ALLOCATE TO DEVELOPERS OF A LOWER-COST 
ALTERNATIVE TO CABLE TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A promising new video technology, which federal regulators backed a year ago 
to encourage a lower-cost alternative to cable TV, may be stalled because of a 
battle with the satellite industry over scarce airwave space. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration says communications 
satellites will need the same part of the radio airwaves that was planned for 
use by the video service. Federal regulators may decide as early as this month 
whether the new video technology will have to share the airwave space or 
whether other alternatives must be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between NASA and proponents of the fledgling video technology, 
known as local multi-point distribution service, could foreshadow the bitter 
battles that are likely to emerge over the valuable radio spectrum. The Federal 
Communications Commission is preparing this summer to conduct the nation's 
first auction of the airwaves for a new generation of wireless communications 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 LMDS mimics the operation of cellular phone systems by using an array of 
super-high-frequency microwave transceivers. It can broadcast into consumers' 
television sets up to 50 channels of cable TV as well as local telephone 
service, video conferencing and interactive TV. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA has been joined in its fight for the airwave space by a number of 
satellite operators, including Calling Communications Corp. and Hughes Aircraft 
Co., which are seeking as much as half the disputed radio spectrum to deploy 
their own new high-tech video and communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the commission first proposed authorizing the spectrum for LMDS, there 
wasn't any existing use of spectrum by satellite users and it was an easy 
solution to accommodate a new technology," said Tom W. Davidson, a Washington 
communications lawyer who represents Calling Communications, based in West 
Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 But as other parts of the radio spectrum have been gobbled up by new users 
such as cellular telephones and now LMDS, Davidson said, "satellite systems 
have nowhere else to go" to deploy new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Charles Force, associate administrator for space communications at NASA: 
"It appears that there is a significant possibility for interference with LMDS 
from satellite uplinks; this was no secret to the FCC." Force suggested 
delaying nationwide LMDS service for four years so the satellite industry can 
develop technology to accommodate LMDS without interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, the government allocated the disputed 27.5-to-30-gigahertz radio 
spectrum band for fixed satellite use. (A hertz is a single unit of frequency 
in an electromagnetic spectrum that ranges from radio and TV waves through 
X-rays and cosmic rays.) But that part of the spectrum remained unused until 
August, when NASA launched an experimental satellite that will use those 
frequencies for advanced communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, LMDS was already in operation on a trial basis in Brighton 
Beach, N.Y. The service was given provisional approval by the FCC in December, 
1992, after a Freehold, N.J., company named Cellularvision patented the 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellularvision said it will need as much as 80% of the 2.5 gigahertz of 
disputed airwaves for LMDS service. The FCC, believing that LMDS can coexist 
with satellite use, signaled its intent in December to authorize nationwide 
deployment of LMDS, which could bring the government an estimated $1 million or 
more for each of the 489 local licenses that would be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enough flexibility in the system so that our service won't interfere 
with theirs," said Shant Hovnanian, chief executive of Cellularvision. "Their 
beam is going straight up into the sky; ours is going straight down from an 
office building. There's no way they will interfere with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 FCC officials could not be reached for comment. But industry sources say the 
agency has indicated it will take up the issue at its January meetings. It may 
decide whether satellites can share the spectrum with LMDS, or it may force 
LMDS to find another part of the spectrum -- not an easy task as the airwaves 
become more crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "This technology could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars," Hovnanian 
said, "It could take off like cellular telephone technology did" in the 1980s.

WESTINGHOUSE TO CUT 6,000 JOBS, DIVIDEND; EARNINGS: '93 NET IS EXPECTED TO FALL 
10% TO 20% FROM PREVIOUS YEAR. CONGLOMERATE WILL TAKE A $750-MILLION CHARGE.

<P>
 Westinghouse Electric Corp., in an effort to strengthen its business, said 
Tuesday that it will slash its work force by 6,000 during the next two years, 
take a $750-million charge and halve its annual dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 The conglomerate also said it is going ahead with plans first announced in 
November, 1992, to sell Westinghouse Communities, a builder of retirement 
homes; Westinghouse Electric Supply Co., and its distribution and control 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company said it is canceling a previously announced plan to sell 
its Knoll furniture unit, saying a new management team is expected to 
strengthen the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking these actions to improve our operating performance, accelerate 
the divestiture of non-core businesses, rebuild our equity base and improve 
financial flexibility," said Michael Jordan, Westinghouse's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will enable us to grow our core businesses and emerge a stronger 
international competitor in our key markets," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The badly damaged conglomerate said the actions came too late to help 1993 
operating earnings, which are expected to decline 10% to 20% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan attributed much of the decline to deterioration in the company's 
environmental services business. "This was a major disaster in 1993," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first meeting with industry analysts since taking the reins of 
Westinghouse in June, Jordan vowed to meet internal growth goals of 10% to 12% 
and to modernize the company's outdated corporate culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe our core businesses are sound. . . . We can grow these businesses 
and grow the cash flow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being named Westinghouse's chief executive, Jordan has carried out a 
top-to-bottom review of the company, whose divisions are involved in 
broadcasting, power generation, hazardous-waste services and the manufacture of 
electric products and military gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, who was recruited from Pepsico, said he hopes the latest restructuring 
will be the company's last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe there shouldn't be another one," Jordan told the large 
roomful of analysts during a two-hour presentation at a Manhattan hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse's stock ended off 12.5 cents at $14 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, as Wall Street reckoned that the company still faces major problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse said the $750-million, fourth-quarter charge will include $350 
million to cover companywide layoffs of 3,400 employees in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the cuts, coupled with attrition, are expected to result in a 
work force reduction of 6,000. It employs nearly 55,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge includes $215 million for divesting and restructuring non-core 
businesses and $185 million to help resolve various legal disputes, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westinghouse also said it will cut its annual dividend on common shares to 20 
cents a share from 40 cents. Wall Street analysts said the company's financial 
condition has limited its ability to make more changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have preferred if they had gone further," one analyst said. "I've got 
the gnawing sensation that they wanted to do more but couldn't risk their 
balance sheet." Analysts also said the plan may not be enough to revive the 
giant conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 They cited the company's failure to take aggressive steps to stabilize its 
future, such as appointing a chief financial officer. Chief Financial Officer 
Warren Hollinshead announced in September that he would relinquish his post to 
prepare for early retirement.

2,300 WORKERS STRIKE GM TRUCK PLANT IN LOUISIANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,300 workers struck General Motors Corp.'s Shreveport, La., truck plant 
Tuesday, dealing a major blow to the auto maker's fragile relationship with the 
United Auto Workers union. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike threatened to halt production of hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
GM's hot-selling 1994 compact pickups. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike is GM's first since September, 1992, and the first since it signed 
an expensive new national UAW contract three months ago that was expected to 
buy labor peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute could be the first of a string of new labor battles for the giant 
auto maker. More than 40 UAW bargaining units have yet to reach local plant 
agreements with GM, and UAW officials are getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a warning shot across GM's bow," said J.P. Morgan analyst David 
Bradley. "If the UAW really wanted to get tough with GM, they would have picked 
a component plant that would have shut down more of GM's other plants." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, the UAW waged a nine-day strike over job cuts at the 
Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant that forced 10 assembly plants to halt 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has worked hard to patch up relations with the UAW under Chief Executive 
Jack Smith. But even as Smith signed the new national UAW contract in November, 
UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich threatened a new round of local strikes 
unless local negotiations picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of United Auto Workers Local 2166 struck the Shreveport truck assembly 
plant after an 11 a.m. EST strike deadline expired, a GM spokeswoman said. The 
strike followed 26 consecutive hours of talks that failed to produce a local 
labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks were scheduled to resume at 11 a.m. EST today. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Danford, Local 2166 financial secretary, said the dispute centers on 
the number of jobs needed to run the plant, which builds about 4,000 Chevrolet 
S-Series and GMC Sonoma trucks a week. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's stock closed up 25 cents at $59.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

TOYS R US EXPANSION TO INCLUDE MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toys R Us Inc. said Tuesday that it will franchise new stores in the Middle 
East and open 115 more company-owned stores in other regions in its most 
ambitious expansion to date. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's largest children's specialty retailer also said it will buy back 
up to $1 billion in company stock over the next few years. The stock closed at 
$38.75 a share Tuesday, up 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us recently named new chief executive and chief operating officers, 
moves that are allowing founder and Chairman Charles Lazarus to concentrate on 
the company's overseas expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really heavily focused on international expansion," said Larry D. 
Bouts, president of the company's international division. "We've just got so 
much opportunity out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouts said Toys R Us aims to boost foreign sales from about 20% of its 
business to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has signed agreements with a business group in Saudi Arabia and 
with Al Futtaim Sons Co. of the United Arab Emirates to operate franchise 
stores there and in Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait. Bouts said he could not 
name the Saudi partner, which is still negotiating real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects the two groups to open a total of about five new stores in 
the next few years. The stores will look like U.S. outlets but will have Arabic 
signs and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's pretty big cultural differences, and their religious laws are very 
specific in terms of packaging and in terms of marketing," Bouts said. "Women 
have to be very well-covered, so if there's a game or a pool float, bathing 
suits aren't a good idea on the external packaging." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's going to be a barrier we can't overcome," he said, noting 
that he has seen Barbie dolls, "tastefully displayed," in most Middle Eastern 
toy stores he has visited. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and locally made toys will be sold in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Bronston, an analyst for Prudential Securities, praised the moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This company's management is not stuck in a rut and is welcome to new ideas 
and new ways of business to grow the company." she said.

SILO CLOSES 6 STORES IN SOUTHLAND; RETAIL: INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG 
ELECTRONICS STORES AND A WEAK ECONOMY HAVE SQUEEZED PROFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Silo, a Philadelphia-based consumer electronics retailer, has closed six of 
its Southland stores, but the company refused to comment on reports that it 
plans to close its nine remaining stores in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has 11 stores in San Diego County, but Silo spokesman Michael 
Randels said those stores will stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 Silo this week closed its stores in Burbank, Montebello and Fullerton and last 
week shut down its locations in Long Beach, Cerritos and Mission Viejo. Some 
local Silo employees said the company informed them that it plans to close the 
other nine stores and that the company will announce closings later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard those reports too, but we won't be making any announcements about 
those stores," Randels said. "We don't want our competitors to know what we'll 
be doing. For the time being, those stores will remain open." 
</P>
<P>
 Randels acknowledged that the inventory at some of the remaining stores is 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the stores are in Los Angeles, and the others are in Temple City, 
Canoga Park, San Dimas, Torrance, Westminster, Santa Ana and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Silo has struggled in the Los Angeles area because of 
strong competition and a relatively weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumer electronics is increasingly competitive, and there's a profit margin 
squeeze," said Monroe Greenstein, an analyst at Lazard Freres in New York. 
"Also, Los Angeles is the weakest major market in California."  
</P>
<P>
 Sears and Circuit City have been Silo's biggest competitors in Los Angeles, 
Greenstein said. Circuit City last week escalated the price war among consumer 
electronics retailers by announcing plans to slash prices and boost promotions 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Silo recently closed some stores in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Randels said customers who purchased products from Silo stores that have since 
closed are receiving service from nearby companies that have repair contracts 
with the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Christina Lima in Ventura contributed to this report.

 * The market on Tuesday recovered much of Monday's stunning drop as worries 
about growing civil unrest receded somewhat. The Bolsa index shot up 95.45 
points, or 3.9%, to 2,554.56, after tumbling 165.92 points, or 6.3%, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many large U.S.-based investors who own Mexican stocks say they remain 
confident that the Chiapas uprising is an isolated incident and no reason to 
exit the market. But they also concede that the general selloff in emerging 
markets worldwide so far this year suggests that Mexican stocks may go lower 
before they go substantially higher, as Mexican investors in particular take 
some money off the table.

 The economy has been careening toward disaster since the 1991 Persian Gulf 
War. International trade sanctions -- which prohibit the export of oil among 
other goods -- and the policies of President Saddam Hussein have fueled 
hyper-inflation, pushing many citizens into poverty and increasing crime rates.

 U.S. Seeks End to Pirating Publications in Arab States: The United States said 
it is negotiating agreements with Gulf Arab states to end the production and 
sale of pirated U.S. books, tapes and other intellectual property in the 
region. The issues will be a priority when Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown 
and a U.S. trade representative delegation meet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, next 
week with officials from the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi 
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. U.S. 
industry estimates it loses about $500 million a year from copyright 
infringement and pirated software in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

 Drop in European Auto Sales Biggest Since WWII: Sales within the European 
Union fell 15.3% in 1993, prompting auto makers to call for a freeze on 
Japanese imports."Japanese manufacturers must share the burden of the present 
market decline," said Giorgio Garuzzo, president of the European Automobile 
Makers Assn. and chairman of Fiat Auto. Japanese car makers accounted for 12.4% 
of the sales, up from 11.9% last year. In April the Japanese agreed to cut 
imports in 1993 by 9.4%. An agreement between the European Union and Japan in 
1991 called for the lifting of all quotas on Japanese imports by 1999 in 
France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece. Trade officials are expected to meet 
next month.

 China's Economy Is Booming: The economy grew at record speed in 1993, with 
industrial output rising to $403 billion, an increase of 23.6% over 1992, the 
government said. It was the highest growth rate since China began its open-door 
and reform policies in 1978 and one of the highest since the communist 
revolution in 1949, excluding years when radical political campaigns make 
official figures suspect.

 While most frequent travelers are aware that flying is one of the safest modes 
of travel, they are often unaware that there are some things they can do to 
increase their survivability in the unlikely event they are involved in an 
airplane accident. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of businesses that have frequent fliers are recognizing 
this and beginning to take extra steps to prepare their employees, said Linda 
Pearson, president of Safeair Services based in Irving, Tex. Pearson, a former 
flight attendant, conducts seminars on passenger safety for corporations such 
as Arco Oil, J.C. Penney, Texas Instruments, AAA Insurance, Burlington Northern 
and Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminars teach safety tips that go beyond the basic information available 
to passengers when they board a plane, she said. In addition, participants go 
through drills to prepare them to react quickly in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of being in an airline accident is remote. In 1992, for 
example, the rate of fatal accidents was .052 per 100,000 departures.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, there were 22,215 fatalities involving passenger cars and only 49 
deaths involving commercial airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is a reason for the increased interest in passenger safety 
training. "Aircraft are much safer than they were 20 years ago," said Matt 
McCormick, chief of the survival factors division of the National 
Transportation Safety Board in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft manufacturers have incorporated many safety features, ranging from 
special floor lighting to help lead passengers to exits to automatic fire 
extinguishers in the lavatories. As a result, more people are likely to survive 
a crash, McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next critical step is being able to get out of the plane safely. This fact 
was brought home tragically in February, 1991, when a commercial airliner ran 
into a commuter jet on the runway at Los Angeles International Airport. 
Twenty-two of the 89 people on board the larger aircraft died in the accident. 
Of those who did not survive, 19 were out of their seats, which implied they 
had survived the initial impact, said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatakiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why it's so important to think in advance about how you would get out 
of the plane, Pearson said. And frequent travelers, many of whom are business 
travelers, are particularly at risk because they feel as if they already know 
the information, she said. "But they may not know the type of aircraft they're 
on, and the doors may operate differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many people forget that the flight attendants, who are trained to 
evacuate the aircraft in the event of an emergency, may be knocked out, injured 
or killed in that emergency, Pearson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some safety tips from Pearson, the National Transportation Safety 
Board and the Federal Aviation Administration that can help maximize 
survivability after a crash. Some of this information is contained in the 
safety materials found in airline seat backs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear natural fibers. Synthetic fibers, including nylon stockings, will melt 
if there is intense heat. The more tightly woven the fabric the better, since 
it will slow down any burning and give your body some protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear comfortable clothing. Pants are better than skirts for women since they 
are less apt to impede movement and they protect legs from heat and friction 
burns. Wear leather-soled, tie-on shoes. No high-heels, "flip-flop" sandals or 
slip-ons that could come off easily or otherwise interfere with your movement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know what model plane you're on. Note how its doors operate.  
</P>
<P>
 * Count the seat rows. Know how far you are from both your nearest front and 
back exits. "In an emergency, people's first instinct is to try to go back out 
the way they came in," Pearson said. But that's not always the best way out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice buckling and unbuckling your seat belt. It buckles differently than 
a car belt, and you want to be able to release it without fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be aware of other passengers. Note anyone around you who might need 
assistance or could impede an evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice getting into a brace position. Get in a low tuck with your hands 
under your legs. "Your objective is to keep your body from flailing," Pearson 
said. If you brace yourself by crossing your arms and grabbing the seat in 
front of you, make sure you don't lock your elbows, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always wear your seat belt. Without a belt on, any sudden descent or 
unforeseen turbulence could throw you against the ceiling or knock you against 
the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't let kids play on the floor. The NTSB recommends using child safety 
seats for children under 2, although that is not currently mandated by the 
Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take off your glasses during takeoff and landing. This applies to sunglasses 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 * Never put a heavy object in the bin over your head. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't put hazardous materials in your baggage. Federal regulations forbid 
this. Some common items banned by the FAA include Mace, aerosols, fireworks, 
flares, safety or "strike-anywhere" matches, as well as lighter refills. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of thinking through these matters in advance is to let you be in 
control of your situation during an emergency. If you aren't prepared, shock is 
more likely to paralyze you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like learning CPR or defensive driving," Pearson said. "The point (of 
practice) is to get your reactive skills up."

 In my sales training and motivational speaking business, I travel several 
times a month. Having an organizational plan is essential, so I have a list of 
everything that needs to be done as I prepare for a speaking engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on my "to do" list:  
</P>
<P>
 * Call the hotel in advance and ask if it supplies hair dryers in the room, so 
I won't waste valuable luggage space.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ask about fitness facilities and whether or not I can go running safely, so 
I can pack proper workout clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the buttons on all clothing. Often a button has been knocked off when 
my suits have been cleaned for a trip. To find a button missing after leaving 
can be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put one- and five-dollar bills in a separate envelope to use for tipping 
porters and bellhops.  
</P>
<P>
 * Make a packing list. The list includes everything I might possibly need for 
any trip. Each time I travel and discover something else I need, I add it to 
the list. When I pack, I simply go down the list.

SEC PROBING MORTGAGE BANKER'S LOSS OF JOB, STOCK; EMPLOYMENT: FORMER REGIONAL 
DIRECTOR OF FRANKLIN MORTGAGE CAPITAL SAYS SHE WAS FIRED WITHOUT CAUSE AND HAS 
BEEN UNABLE TO COLLECT THE $943,000 HER SHARES WERE WORTH WHEN THE FIRM WAS 
SOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Barbara Bunte thought her success was evident and her retirement savings 
assured. 
</P>
<P>
 During six years as West Coast regional director of Franklin Mortgage Capital 
Corp., she built the operation into a major mortgage banking business, 
expanding it from 13 employees to 180, from funding $5 million in new home 
loans each month to funding $200 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as a shock to Bunte that, while she was home in April recuperating 
from a broken ankle, her boss announced to the staff that she was resigning. 
But that wasn't the case, she said: In fact, at age 55, she was unceremoniously 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, she learned later, she may also have lost her retirement account: 
100,000 shares of Franklin stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was sold in mid-December to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a major 
New York brokerage and investment bank, for $30 million. That amounts to $9.43 
a share, which would make Bunte's stake worth $943,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte alleges that Stephen P. Terry, Franklin's former president, fired her 
without cause and then sold the Falls Church, Va., company to DLJ without 
informing her and without acknowledging that she owned a 3% interest in 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying repeatedly to get what she says is her due, Bunte filed a 
complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal agency has 
referred the case to its enforcement division for investigation. An agency 
spokeswoman said such attention to a complaint by an individual is rare. Citing 
SEC policy, she would not comment further on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other top managers at the Tustin operation -- the largest of three 
Franklin Mortgage offices nationwide -- have also said that they were forced 
out during the last few years and have complained that they were treated 
unfairly. Apparently none of them had a written agreement, though, as Bunte 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry has not responded to several requests in the last three weeks for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted in December in National Mortgage News, an industry magazine, as 
saying that Bunte resigned voluntarily and therefore forfeited the right to her 
100,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson Dean, managing director of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners LP, said the 
Franklin Mortgage sale was not hindered by the SEC investigation of Bunte's 
allegation. However, he said, DLJ has an agreement with Terry that the 
investment bank will not be responsible for Bunte's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a matter between Steve Terry and Barbara Bunte," Dean said, adding 
that DLJ plans to leave Franklin's current management in place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte and Terry met when they were both employed by Merrill Lynch. She was a 
senior vice president and regional director based in Tustin; he was a vice 
chairman based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch closed its Tustin operation, but an investor purchased the 
branch and, in March, 1987, sold it to Terry's newly formed Franklin Mortgage 
Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bunte's leadership, the West Coast operation became the most successful 
of the three regional operations of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the West Coast operation originated nearly $2.4 billion in loans, 
according to company documents supplied by Bunte's lawyer. By comparison, the 
Virginia operation made $774.5 million in new loans that year, and the Texas 
operation made $16.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte said that her efforts for Franklin helped make the company an attractive 
acquisition for DLJ. She says she was forced out at Franklin to prevent her 
from sharing the benefits of the deal. When she left Franklin, she was told 
that her shares were worth $490,000 -- about half of their value at the price 
subsequently paid by DLJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunte was unaware of DLJ's interest in the company, she said, when she was 
pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before she lost the job, Bunte had suffered a broken ankle and torn 
ligaments. She was at home recovering, she said, when Terry called and offered 
her a position that would have required her to travel by air.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of an ear problem, she said, she cannot travel in airplanes. Terry was 
aware of that, Bunte said, so was offering her a job that he knew she could not 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, Terry announced in a memorandum to Franklin's staff that Bunte had 
resigned. She tried to cash in her company shares at the time, she said, but 
Terry said he would not give her the money unless she signed an agreement not 
to compete with him in mortgage banking. She refused to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the summer, the two continued to discuss a settlement, Bunte said, 
but could not agree. She filed the SEC complaint at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trusted this man," Bunte said. "I guess I trusted him to the point of being 
stupid."

NEW SOFT DRINK WON'T BE QUITE THE REAL THING; MARKETING: BOTH COCA-COLA AND 
PEPSI ARE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE A CROSS BETWEEN REGULAR AND DIET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coca-Cola Co. may be getting ready to introduce a not-quite-diet cola in North 
America as part of a move by soft drink makers to lure customers who want less 
sugar but don't like diet drinks, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the new drink, rumored to be called Coca-Cola Light, could counter 
the launch by archrival Pepsico Inc. of a mid-calorie cola, called Pepsi Max, 
in Canada this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Coke, the world's largest soft drink bottler, officially declined to comment 
on what it describes as market speculation, and spokesmen would not confirm 
whether such a product exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi Max, which promises 50 calories a serving instead of 150, and a taste 
closer to that of regular Pepsi, is designed to appeal to the estimated 
one-third of cola drinkers who switch constantly between diet to regular 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Coke could introduce its own mid-calorie cola early this year as 
part of a strategy of offering new products with short life spans but big 
profit potential while brand-name popularity lasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coca-Cola could consider the introduction of another cola product -- a 
mid-calorie Coca-Cola," said Natwest analyst Michael Branca. "The feeling is 
that there is some potential for a mid-calorie cola product in North America 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the Pepsi Max introduction makes it likely both Pepsi and Coke 
will have mid-calorie colas in the North American market by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada is not necessarily a testing ground for the U.S. market," said Pepsico 
spokeswoman Ann Ward, "but something like a mid-calorie cola is a possibility 
for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 With North American soft-drink sales growing only about 4% a year, Coke is 
bent on finding niche markets that may last only as long as the customer's 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are brands that work for two or three years and then disappear but 
could still make a lot of money during that time," said Brown Bros. Harriman & 
Co. analyst John Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Coke will vastly expand its product introduction schedule over the next 1 1/2 
years, M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola executive vice president for North 
America, told a group of Atlanta business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 18 months, we have introduced two dozen products around the 
world; in another 18 months, that may seem like a slow pace," Ivester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say the "quick-hit" strategy makes sense in a market of 
rapidly changing tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're faced with fickle (consumers), fickle is a great way to be," said 
Jesse Meyers, publisher of the Greenwich, Conn.-based Beverage Digest 
newsletter.

 Summa Industries: The Fullerton industrial equipment manufacturer, formerly 
Morehouse Industries, reported a quarterly profit of $231,000, or 15 cents a 
share, which included an extraordinary gain of $100,000 from an accounting 
change.That compared to earnings of $143,000, or 14 cents a share, for the same 
period a year earlier. Sales for the company's first fiscal quarter, which 
ended Nov. 30, rose 57% to $3.3 million from $2.1 million. The company said the 
sales increase was primarily because of a subsidiary acquired July 30.

FIELDSTONE BEGINS 84-HOME PROJECT IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fieldstone Group of Cos., Southern California's second-largest home 
builder, has started building 84 single-family homes on nearly 33 acres that it 
recently purchased in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has already begun at Fieldstone Arbor, where each home will be 
priced in the high $200,000s. The land was purchased by a company subsidiary, 
Fieldstone Communities Inc., for an undisclosed amount from Unocal Land & 
Development Co. of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Vairin, regional manager for Fieldstone, said homes will range from 
2,505 to 2,929 square feet, and designs will include a four-bedroom, one-story 
home with various upgrades to allow the buyer to personalize the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldstone, based in Newport Beach, last year stopped making payments on a 
$150-million development loan for the 2,300-acre La Costa planned community in 
northern San Diego County. A consortium of banks, led by Continental Bank in 
Chicago, contended that the home builder owed at least $60 million in back 
payments. The terms of that loan are still being renegotiated, said Jim Hansen, 
division manager for the San Diego region of Fieldstone. The default, which was 
by the parent company and not its subsidiary, does not affect the purchase of 
other properties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton land purchase comes on the heels of Fieldstone's purchase last 
year of 70 single-family lots at EastLake Greens, part of a master-planned 
community in Chula Vista. The company's project, named Fairway Ridge, has 
prices beginning in the low $200,000s. Fifteen of 22 Fairway Ridge homes under 
construction have already been sold, according to Brian Milich, a project 
manager at Fieldstone. In 1993, privately held Fieldstone, the second-largest 
residential builder in Southern California behind the William Lyon Co., 
constructed and sold 1,082 homes for $237.5 million. The previous year, 
Fieldstone built 1,225 homes and generated revenues of $301.5 million.

<P>
 FHP International Corp.'s latest marketing effort is on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The health maintenance organization, based in Fountain Valley, hopes that by 
advertising at the newly built Anaheim Arena, it can warm up to potential 
customers for its fast-growing medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, the company began touting itself by displaying its distinctive 
blue logo on center ice at the arena, home of the NHL's expansion hockey team, 
the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP spokesman Eric Morely said the company signed a three-year contract with 
Walt Disney Co., owner of the Mighty Ducks, four months ago for an undisclosed 
sum. The ad is seen every time the hockey players skate past the center of the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Other perks include having FHP's name in programs and on a new marquee to be 
erected at the end of the month. The kicker will be on Jan. 24, when hockey 
fans will receive hockey pucks with FHP's logo engraved on them.

 Homedco Contract: With all the talk these days of health care reform, it is 
not surprising that managed-care companies, which deliver health care at 
decreased costs, are the new darlings of the medical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantages of managed care in proposed health care reform is not lost on 
Homedco Group Inc., a Fountain Valley home health-care firm.The company, which 
leases respiratory and intravenous equipment and supplies home nursing 
services, has been increasing its number of contracts with managed-care 
operations at a steady clip. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest deal was signed two weeks ago with Kaiser Permanente of Northern 
California. Although terms of the agreement were not disclosed, Homedco 
spokeswoman Suki Shattuck confirmed that it is a "multimillion contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Homedco, with 17 of its 215 branch offices in Northern California, will not 
provide nurses in the two-year contract, but it will supply all the equipment 
necessary for Kaiser nurses to treat patients at home, Shattuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Homedco has attempted to sign up more managed-care 
companies, selling them on the premise that home treatment is among the most 
cost-effective ways to treat most patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about a third of Homedco's revenue comes from managed-care 
contracts, including those with Kaiser Permanente of Southern California and 
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. of Cypress, another large health-maintenance 
organization.

 Hormone Drug Deal: SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc. is beefing up its line of drugs 
for treating illnesses caused by a lack of testosterone -- the male sex 
hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Costa Mesa, said Monday that it has signed a deal with a 
New Jersey drug manufacturer to distribute a drug that replaces the lost 
hormone or boosts deficient testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI spokesman Paul Knopick said the licensing deal with Schering-Plough Corp. 
of Madison, N.J., increases SPI's own line of such chemicals. SPI already 
manufactures such drugs, but the license to sell Schering-Plough's Oreton 
Methyl "gives us a more complete package," Knopick said. "This adds to our 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs such as Oreton Methyl can treat a wide range of male illnesses, such as 
impotence and other chemical imbalances. Oreton Methyl can also be used to 
treat inoperable metastatic breast cancer for women who are one to five years 
past menopause.

BANK OF NEWPORT FINALLY FINDS NEW PRESIDENT -- A COMPETITOR'S; THRIFTS: AFTER 
10-MONTH SEARCH, VETERAN O.C. BANKER DAVID T. BLANKENHORN IS LURED AWAY FROM 
COMMERCE CENTER BANK POST.

<P>
 Troubled Bank of Newport, after searching 10 months for a president, has lured 
veteran Orange County banker David T. Blankenhorn from a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenhorn, who is president of Commercial Center Bank in Santa Ana, will 
join Bank of Newport next Wednesday as president and chief executive. He fills 
a position vacated last March when Ronald L. Rodgers, the bank's founding 
president, resigned under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known the bank a long time. It's a good franchise," Blankenhorn said. 
"This is a good opportunity for me. I like it where I've been, but the 
(Commercial Center) bank's not owned locally and is for sale. I want to be with 
a locally owned bank, hopefully in a long-term situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Center is owned by the bankrupt estate of Canadian Commercial Bank 
in Edmonton, Canada, an institution whose assets are being liquidated by the 
accounting firm of Price Waterhouse-Canada in Toronto. Commercial Center, which 
with nearly $400 million in assets is Orange County's largest community bank, 
is the last major holding that remains to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is not the best for us," Garth MacGirr, the Price Waterhouse 
partner overseeing Commercial Center, said of Blankenhorn's departure. "But 
this was an opportunity for David that he couldn't pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sorry to lose him. He's a good man. He knows Orange County particularly 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenhorn, 54, of Newport Beach has been president or chief executive at 
four county banks since 1980. He cultivated a reputation as a turn-around 
specialist during stints at Heritage Bank in Anaheim and American Interstate 
Bank in Newport Beach. Both banks eventually failed, however. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was vice chairman and chief executive of CommerceBank in Newport Beach 
from 1980 to 1983 and was president of Orange City Bank, which since has been 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Newport has had problem commercial real estate loans dating back to 
the county's last recession during the early 1980s. Its real estate woes have 
only grown worse during the current long-running economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a wake-up call to 
directors in the form of a cease-and-desist order, the agency's most severe 
directive. Regulators said directors were not paying enough attention to what 
management was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers resigned in March as directors became increasingly uncomfortable about 
the bank's continued losses and the continued criticism from federal 
regulators. For 1992 the bank lost $4.8 million -- the most among Orange County 
banks. Rodgers left just before the bank reported a loss of $530,000 more for 
the first quarter last year. A profitable second quarter reduced the six-month 
loss to $287,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, four directors, led by Chairman E.O. Rodeffer, agreed to pump $2.8 
million into the bank to shore up its capital, the final cushion against 
losses. Close Up: David T. Blankenhorn 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 54. 
</P>
<P>
 Residence: Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 New Position: President and chief executive, Bank of Newport 
</P>
<P>

QUALITY SYSTEMS GETS UNIVERSITY CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quality Systems Inc. said Tuesday it has won a contract from the University of 
Alabama School of Dentistry to provide a computer-based management system for 
medical and dentistry practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the Tustin-based company calls for installation of a 
sophisticated system that will provide the university with on-line, automated 
data collection to support such services as billing, claims processing, patient 
registration and appointment scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, other capabilities such as patient selection and assignment, student 
tracking and grading will be added, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the contract was not disclosed at the university's request, a 
company official said.

INVESTMENT BANK SETTLES PARKER SUIT; FINANCE: CRUTTENDEN & CO. HAD BEEN ACCUSED 
OF MISLEADING THOSE WHO INVESTED IN COSTA MESA MAKER OF EQUIPMENT FOR CLEANING 
AUTO ENGINES, WHOSE STOCK IS NOW WORTHLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investment bank Cruttenden & Co., accused of misleading investors in a stock 
deal, has agreed to settle out of court for $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began in 1990 when Cruttenden, based in Irvine, helped find more 
than three dozen wealthy people from the San Francisco Bay Area to invest $5.3 
million in Parker Automotive Corp. Parker Auto, a small, publicly held Costa 
Mesa concern, made equipment for cleaning car engines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker Auto lied to the investors, some of them contend in a lawsuit: 
Despite glowing promises, the company was in deep trouble and its checks were 
bouncing even as it was selling the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Parker Auto even delayed payment of some of the 
$371,000 in fees it owed to Cruttenden for handling the stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Auto filed for bankruptcy less than a year later, and its assets were 
sold off. The stock is now worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Michael E. Parker last year admitted to deception while running the 
company. He pleaded guilty to hiding Parker Auto's troubled finances from his 
bankers to obtain a $2-million line of credit from Home Bank of Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 He is serving 11 years in federal prison for another bank fraud. An accountant 
hired by Parker Auto's subsequent owner later concluded that the company's 
books had been "cooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen investors -- including heirs of the Levi Strauss blue jeans 
fortune -- who sank a total of $3.5 million into the company sued Parker Auto 
and its top officers, Cruttenden, national accounting firm Ernst & Young and 
Timothy L. Strader, a prominent Orange County developer and a Parker Auto 
director who was also briefly president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, filed in 1991 in Orange County Superior Court, the investors 
said Cruttenden knew -- or at least should have known -- about Parker Auto's 
troubles, especially because, as a broker, Cruttenden made a market in Parker 
Auto's stock. (A brokerage makes a market in an over-the-counter stock by 
keeping shares on hand to sell and by agreeing to buy shares at the publicly 
quoted price. This guarantees that investors can always buy or sell a 
particular stock.) 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for Cruttenden said the investment bank was not aware of any alleged 
financial chicanery at Parker Auto. Further, said lawyer said Gregory P. 
Lindstrom, Cruttenden was not required to know what kind of shape Parker Auto 
was in: The stock offering, he said, was a private sale to wealthy, presumably 
sophisticated investors -- with professional advisers -- who took the risk on 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say their investment advisers are at fault, not us," Lindstrom said. "But 
it was cheaper to settle than to face a long, expensive trial." 
</P>
<P>
 If the investment banker had known that Parker Auto was a fraud, Lindstrom 
said, then Cruttenden Institutional Sales Director Robert S. London -- also 
named in the lawsuit -- wouldn't have lost tens of thousands of dollars of his 
own money investing in Parker Auto. 
</P>
<P>
 Still waiting for the suit to come to trial in May are Ernst & Young and 
developer Strader, from whom the investors are likely to win the most money if 
they prevail. That's because Strader and the accountants are said by investors' 
lawyers to have the deepest pockets of any of the remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the defendants are the imprisoned Michael Parker, former Chief 
Financial Officer Eric A. McAfee and Vice President Diane M. Parker, Michael 
Parker's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen J. Corradi, the company's former controller, has already settled for a 
"modest" sum, said Ronald Rus, one of the investors' lawyers.

TAMING THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE?; SCHOOLS: THEODORE SIZER'S MISSION IS NO LESS 
THAN A RESTRUCTURING OF SECONDARY EDUCATION. AND NOW, WALTER ANNENBERG IS 
GIVING HIS COALITION $50 MILLION TO GET THE JOB DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Imagine the amazement, the giddy elation you might feel if you learned you had 
just inherited $50 million, and you will have some idea of the mood these days 
at the Coalition of Essential Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still numb," said Theodore R. Sizer, director of the school-reform 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 His phone has not stopped ringing since last month's announcement that his 
Brown University-based project would receive part of the largest single gift 
ever made to American public education: a five-year, $500-million challenge 
grant from publishing mogul Walter H. Annenberg. Long-lost professional 
acquaintances were calling, Sizer said, insisting that they had intended to 
call for months -- and then hinting broadly that perhaps a portion of the 
coalition's new fortune might tumble in their directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated behind a plain wooden schoolteacher's desk, Sizer gazed over his 
horn-rim glasses and said: "It's very hard to be civil." 
</P>
<P>
 This is difficult to fathom, because civility and decency seem to be at the 
core of this 61-year-old educator. A professor of education at Brown, Sizer is 
a former dean of the School of Education at Harvard University and was 
headmaster and history instructor at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. He is a 
firm adherent to the principles of American educator John Dewey (1859-1952), 
who loathed the notion of teaching by rote and instead advanced the maxim of 
"learning by doing." 
</P>
<P>
 In his tweeds, and with his Brahminesque elocution, Sizer resembles no one's 
image of a revolutionary. Yet in ignoring such things as test scores and 
bypassing the ranks of experts to listen instead to teachers and 
schoolchildren, he has emerged as one of the leading voices of school reform.  
</P>
<P>
 School reform was for many years "a huge umbrella phrase that meant both 
everything and nothing," said Theodore R. Mitchell, dean of the graduate school 
of education at UCLA. Recently, Mitchell said, there has been "a winnowing-down 
from 100 concepts (of what the phrase means) to four or five" -- of which 
Sizer's is among the best known and least faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer has distinguished himself in large part by advocating ideas that can be 
adapted readily to local situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the beauty of his principles," said Kathy Lesley, principal of 
Pasadena High School, which joined the Coalition of Essential Schools in 1991. 
"There are no set prescriptions. They're ideas, and you have to fit them to 
your school."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Sizer began studying and visiting hundreds of American high schools. 
His research was synthesized in his 1984 nonfiction book "Horace's Compromise," 
in which his protagonist -- a composite character based on a number of teachers 
Sizer encountered -- begins: "I am a high school teacher. Let me tell you how 
it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with its 1992 sequel, "Horace's School," the book became a primer in the 
swelling move to restructure secondary education. Sizer decried the rigidity of 
conventional classroom teaching and learning and called for flexibility that 
focused on students' needs. In turn, he made a demand that was at once obvious 
and radical: that high school students actually learn before they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer's "nine common principles" provide the foundation for the Coalition of 
Essential Schools, established at Brown in 1984 and housed since October under 
an umbrella organization known as the National Institute for School Reform. 
Nearly 700 public and private high schools and middle schools around the 
country have joined the coalition, pledging to redesign themselves according to 
goals Sizer has put forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, this is one of the most significant reform efforts going on in 
the country," said Ilene Straus, principal of Lincoln Middle School in Santa 
Monica. She said her school, with a student body of 1,050, joined the coalition 
because "schools are alienated," and because "you get a sense of some of the 
most current thinking, cutting-edge practices in education." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stein, who calls himself the CEO -- for chief educational officer -- of 
O'Farrell Community School in San Diego, said he was attracted to Sizer's 
project because "people are desperate to even smell change. When you're in the 
city, most of the time you don't have the luxury to be intellectual. Usually 
you're too busy trying to keep the kids safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Stein added, "we liked what the coalition had to say." 
</P>
<P>
 So, apparently, did Walter H. Annenberg. His gift to American public 
education, announced in a White House ceremony, included equal grants of $50 
million to Sizer's project and to David Kearns' New American Schools 
Development Corp. in suburban Washington, D.C. Among the immediate effects of 
the grant is that the National Institute for School Reform will now be known as 
the Annenberg National Institute for School Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The renamed institute will establish a network of "exemplary redesigned" 
elementary and secondary schools to be designated as Annenberg National 
Schools. At least 20% of those schools will be in the nation's nine largest 
school districts, including the Los Angeles Unified School District. (L.A.'s 
Hollenbeck Middle School and Jefferson High School are members of the 
coalition; many others are pursuing reform through the district's LEARN 
program.) 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond what Brown University President Vartan Gregorian called the 
"stunning generosity" of Annenberg's grant, Sizer, for one, was celebrating the 
implications for America's schoolchildren. School reform, he said, can mean 
nothing if it is just an abstraction, just a theoretical phrase tossed about by 
self-interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it means reform of schools, when 50 of us get together with a bunch of 
kids to try to help them learn," Sizer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But other people, they say well, 'Should we have an elected or an appointed 
school board?' 'Should we have vouchers?' Most of the howling and screaming is 
about this kind of thing, and not much gets done for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figure out what's right for the grown-ups," he went on, adding darkly, 
"We have a long history of using children to meet our social problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation for the mess so many public schools find themselves in is a 
huge game of population catch-up, Sizer said: "This country went from partial 
enrollments to essentially full enrollments at the same time the population was 
expanding." Demographic reshuffling has continued, and schools have too often 
been overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer said his coalition recognizes this diversity by assuming that "no two 
communities are ever alike -- and that, therefore, no two solutions will ever 
work the same way. The notion that there is only one set of standards is 
something we won't buy." 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than talk about incentives for change, Sizer points to what he 
calls "disincentives" -- justifications that some schools use for maintaining 
the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a continued belief that the high school should continue offering 
what it has always offered," Sizer said. "The system screams that it is too 
much to expect change -- and what it results in is intellectual chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 Very few school districts or states say they want serious reform, Sizer said. 
"They say, 'We want test scores to go up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Such frank assessments have not earned Sizer universal affection. He 
acknowledges "a whole bunch" of criticism of coalition-style learning, most of 
which faults Sizer's approach for being too soft or for allowing too much 
discretion by teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lincoln Middle School, Straus said that at first, Sizer-style reform 
efforts received mixed reviews from parents and from some teachers. Dividing 
the school into teams of students and teachers confused some parents, who 
wondered what was wrong with school the way they knew it. "Double-block" 
periods, in which students stay with the same instructor for two subjects 
back-to-back provided more flexibility and a chance for in-depth learning, 
Straus said -- but also raised questions from some parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've changed the structure of the school, and we've changed the way we 
teach," she said. "Initially, things that are different and that don't feel 
like the way you knew it are bound to make some people uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Mitchell said that at the conceptual level of school reform, however, 
Sizer has "no serious detractors." After many years in which "school reform" 
meant "looking in a mechanistic way for a single lever to pull" to improve 
things, Mitchell said, Sizer's coalition was "the first of the school-reform 
strands to embody and to bring to life the principles that people had been 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer in any case is untroubled by the prospect of ruffling academic feathers. 
Nothing less than the future of the country is at stake, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy depends upon devoted and informed citizens," he said upon learning 
of the Annenberg grant. "And the secure future of a decent America depends upon 
schools which prepare such citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer acknowledges the frustration felt by many in America's schools, but he 
refuses to give in to gloom. He rejects the possibility, for example, that by 
the time some students are in high school, they might already be considered 
lost educational causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never a lost cause," Sizer said. "All sorts of people who have been 
written off can go on to perform beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 His optimism is mixed with a firm sense of determination. "Our assumption has 
got to be that it is never going to be unsolvable -- because to say that 
problems in schools are unsolvable is far too despairing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the richest nation in the world," Sizer said, "that is not a silly 
statement."

DRAWING ATTENTION; FORENSIC ARTIST JEANNE BOYLAN HAS SPENT 14 YEARS PERFECTING 
THE ART OF SKETCHING SUSPECTS. SOME OF HER INTERVIEWING TECHNIQUES MAY BE

 Jeanne Boylan, free-lance forensic artist, never travels in a straight line. 
Like a child's connect-the-dots puzzle, her life zigs and zags -- from trauma 
to trauma, crime to crime: 
</P>
<P>
 * New Year's Eve in a roach-filled motel on Sepulveda Boulevard in Manhattan 
Beach, called in after the slaying of Police Officer Martin Ganz. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 28 in the San Fernando Valley, on case of the serial child molester, 
still at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 23 in Antioch, Calif., on the abduction of Ruth Mayer, a jeweler's wife 
"stolen" along with the family cars and gems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mid-December in St. Louis, Mo., on the kidnapings of Angie Housman and 
Cassidy Senter, ages 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in November to Petaluma, Calif., working on the kidnaping case of Polly 
Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Her schedule shows that police agencies nationwide are discovering what those 
in the Pacific Northwest have known for years: When the trail grows cold on a 
horrible crime, call Jeanne Boylan. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 years and 7,000 cases, she has become the most visible practitioner 
in the time-honored -- she'd call it time- worn -- field of forensic art. Her 
job: to extract a picture of the criminal's face from the traumatized memory of 
the person who saw the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sketch of the suspect in the Polly Klaas kidnaping, based on the memory of 
two 12-year-old witnesses, was so accurate that one police officer calls it 
"eerie -- almost like a photo of the guy they finally caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Her drawing of a suspect, based on the memory of a witness to the slaying of 
Ganz, brought in new leads, says Sgt. Bob Stoneman of the L.A. County Sheriff's 
Department, which is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called Boylan in because the first composite, done by our own staff 
artist, brought almost no response." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Sheriff's Department named two possible suspects, still at 
large, in the Ganz killing. "We received tips about the suspects, and in doing 
follow-up we found wanted posters on them. Their pictures have a very strong 
similarity to the composite done by Boylan," Stoneman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan's methods are unorthodox. To this day, she says, most in her profession 
do their job by showing the witness catalogues of eyes, noses and mouths, and 
asking them to pick the features that most resemble those of the perpetrator. 
She shows the victim nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Memory is too fragile," she says. "Each piece of new visual information 
pollutes and buries the memory further. By asking a victim to select from 
hundreds of features that might approximate those of the criminal, you add 
layers of contaminants over the original image, which is intact somewhere in 
the recesses of the victim's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan spends hours gently interviewing witnesses, rather than interrogating 
them. The results, say those who have worked with her, are detailed sketches 
that make the detectives' phones ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's great," says Portland Police Detective Gary Sandell, who recalls a 
violent armed robbery at a Baskin-Robbins store in which the only witnesses 
were two battered and traumatized kids. "We sat them down with Jeannie, who 
drew the suspect based on their memories. We made an arrest the next week and 
realized Jeannie's sketch and the suspect's mug shot were almost identical." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her efforts to promote her techniques are largely ignored by others in her 
field, most of whom are police officers. ("At meetings I'm ostracized; if I sit 
down with them at lunch, they move to another table.") 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan, 39, says she'd happily start a school, free of charge, to share her 
insights with others -- but she thinks no one would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan, whose home is a cabin in Bend, Ore., respects the law enforcement 
community immensely, she says. "They do such excellent work that I don't even 
like to talk about any of this, because it might sound as if I'm criticizing 
them. I'm not -- I just think this area of forensic art is a weak link." 
</P>
<P>
 So weak, so low a priority, that she was ready to chuck her career and look 
for something else when the Polly Klaas case turned her around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Polly, I came in to cases after the crime was over, the victim was dead 
or the damage was done. In this instance, there was a chance she was still 
alive and we could help save her." 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan was called to Petaluma about 10 days after the kidnaping, because a 
sketch done by a local police artist had not produced good leads. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the original composite looked so unlike the man ultimately arrested 
that sheriff's deputies who stopped Richard Allen Davis and questioned him for 
38 minutes on the night of the kidnaping never made the connection. 
</P>
<P>
 What Boylan found shocked her, she says, even after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 12-year-old girls who were in the bedroom with Polly had been 
interviewed by press, police, FBI and "just about everyone on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The police artist had questioned them together (an absolute no-no, in Boylan's 
view), using a catalogue of faces and supplemental photos (another Boylan 
no-no, but one the FBI recommends). 
</P>
<P>
 "So the girls picked everything -- nose, ears, eyes. A headband, which he 
apparently never really wore. They said he was very tall, and the artist 
perhaps didn't realize that the girls' fear made him seem taller than he is." 
(Her sketch listed the suspect as 5 feet, 7 inches rather than 6 feet, 3 
inches.) The girls were terribly confused by the time she arrived, Boylan says 
-- in fact, they were "traumatized, alienated, frustrated and exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan got her composite by interviewing the girls separately, in the relaxed 
atmosphere of their homes, with no relatives around. The resulting sketch was 
what local news reporters called "a bull's-eye," although Boylan says other 
evidence led to the capture of the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Mike Kerns of the Petaluma Police Department defends the original 
sketch, made by an officer from a neighboring department. "The first one wasn't 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People must remember that composite sketches are only likenesses; they are 
not to be considered a portrait of an actual person. When viewing a composite, 
you have to look at individual characteristics and not look at the whole 
(drawing)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan's victim and witness interviews take about three hours, with the best 
information surfacing in the last hour, she says. In that time, she never 
refers to the crime or the person who committed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim knows why we're there," Boylan says. The goal is to remove any 
pressure to remember, and to separate the emotion of the memory from the memory 
itself. Emotion distorts the image of what the witness saw, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan relaxes clients by discussing "anything currently positive in his or 
her life -- whether it's hobbies, sports, travel, fashion, movies, family. 
About every five minutes, she breaks into the conversation, asking the witness 
about a facial feature: "Should we raise the bridge of his nose a little bit, 
or push it in further?" This method allows the original image to bubble up to 
the surface, piece by piece, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Interview technique is far more important than the artistic ability of the 
person who does the sketch, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art has little to do with this job. It is not about drawing at all." On that 
issue too she stands alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quick, five-day matchbook-cover type drawing courses are the only training 
most police artists get; they get no psychology or academics at all," Boylan 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The irony to all this is that Boylan doesn't consider herself an expert. She 
had no special training for her work, stumbling into it only because she needed 
money. Any knowledge she has gained has been from on-the-job experience and her 
own research. When she hears of an expert in memory, or in interview 
techniques, she calls or writes and tries to gain access to their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 One of six children, she grew up Montrose, Colo. (pop. 5,000), where her 
father was a plumber and her mother a homemaker. She left home after high 
school, driving her first car ("actually it was a cattle truck"), stopping in 
small towns where she did odd jobs -- from telephone operator and waitress to 
road construction. She had no idea where life would take her. 
</P>
<P>
 She eventually settled in Portland, Ore., where she decided to try college on 
a work-study program. The part-time work available was at the local sheriff's 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she was asked to start interviewing crime victims, in an attempt 
to free up more officers for street patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of those interviews, she started to draw the faces her victims 
described. ("I had always doodled faces, ever since I was a little kid," she 
says, "but I never had any training.") Soon she (and others) noticed that her 
drawings of suspects were more accurate than those of the artist. No matter. 
She was told to stop drawing or she'd be fired because that wasn't part of her 
job description. But she couldn't stop. "I just did the drawings after working 
hours," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name became known around the state, and then around neighboring states. 
Whenever a tough crime had to be solved, the law would call in "that lady from 
Portland." She was a contract worker for the Portland police detective bureau, 
from 1980 to 1993. She has also lectured in Russia, China, Japan and El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Loftus, an author and expert in the area of memory and memory 
distortion, and a professor of psychology at the University of Washington, says 
some of Boylan's dictums are impractical, given the current staffing and 
financial limitations of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she admits, "Boylan has a real talent. She's done incredible things. She 
can create images amazingly close to those of the real perpetrator. She did it 
in the Polly Klaas case, even though the witnesses' memories were contaminated 
(before she arrived on the scene). 
</P>
<P>
 "That she was able to pierce that and get back to the witnesses' original 
images is remarkable. You ought to either bottle her and sell her, or else 
analyze her to death in hopes that (her skills) can be taught to others."

KID STUFF; LAUGHTER WILL SCRATCH THE TICKLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 You're yelling. Gasping for breath. Rolling on the floor. Laughing may be a 
way your body releases tension when someone won't stop tickling you.But 
scientists aren't sure why tickling makes people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing is just one reaction. Lots of other things happen automatically when 
you get tickled. Your body tenses. Your blood pressure goes up. Your pulse 
races. Tickling excites your nerve endings. Your body acts as if it is in 
danger. You try to get away from the tickler. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are times when people don't laugh when they are tickled. Try 
tickling the bottoms of your own feet. It doesn't make you laugh because you 
know exactly where you will tickle and when you will stop. You can't fool 
yourself, so your body doesn't get tense. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are more ticklish than others. But there's just one reaction when 
tickling stops: relief.

TRISTAR SHAKE-UP: A MATTER OF PERSONALITIES; ANALYSIS: MIKE MEDAVOY'S DEPARTURE 
AND MARK CANTON'S PROMOTION HAVE LESS TO DO WITH BOX-OFFICE GROSSES THAN WITH 
HOW WELL THEY HIT IF OFF WITH SONY PICTURES CHAIRMAN PETER GUBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Medavoy seemed to have had a relatively good 1993, while Mark Canton, by 
any measure, had an awful year. Yet Medavoy is out as chairman of TriStar 
Pictures and Canton's domain has expanded to include both studios on the Sony 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxical as these developments might appear, they did not come as a shock 
to many industry insiders, who have been speculating for more than a year about 
just when -- not whether -- Medavoy would leave TriStar. Despite TriStar's 
success with such movies as "Sleepless in Seattle" and "Cliffhanger," it was no 
secret that Medavoy and his boss, Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman Peter 
Guber, never hit it off. And increasingly, Guber was said to feel that Medavoy 
was not a loyal team player. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, few observers believe that Medavoy left entirely on his own 
initiative, as both he and Sony executives maintain. "It's like when you know 
your boyfriend's going to leave you," said a director who knows the players 
well. "You pack your bags, leave and pretend that you're the one who made the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, Medavoy's departure and Canton's elevation -- both 
announced last Friday -- reinforced conventional wisdom that in Hollywood, 
personal relationships are everything. Canton, a longtime Warner Bros. 
executive who became chairman of Columbia Pictures in 1991, has been close to 
Guber for nearly a decade. Canton is also very friendly with TriStar production 
chief Stacy Lassally, a college pal of his wife, Wendy Finerman, who has a 
production deal at TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining TriStar, Lassally, whose husband, Tom Lassally, is a Warner 
Bros. executive and tennis-playing buddy of Canton's, was a key executive at 
Guber's production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of the strain between Medavoy and Guber, TriStar released only 
a dozen movies last year, and some producers and agents have reported 
difficulties in getting their projects past the political roadblocks. "It's 
been slower going there than it should be at a major studio," said a prominent 
agent and Canton ally, who, like most people interviewed for this story, did 
not want his name used. "It's clear there hasn't been a specific program for 
getting movies put into production there."  
</P>
<P>
 TriStar has some promising projects coming up this year, including the Kenneth 
Branagh-directed "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" and "Cop Tips Waitress $2 
Million," directed by Andrew Bergman. But some attribute that roster more to 
the aggressiveness of Lassally and studio president Marc Platt than to 
Medavoy's leadership. Platt and Lassally's frustration with Medavoy were well 
known to the people who worked with them. (Medavoy declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Columbia's 1993 performance has been nothing to brag about, despite such 
hits as "In the Line of Fire," packaged and produced by Castle Rock 
Entertainment, and "Groundhog Day," which got the green light from Canton's 
predecessor, Frank Price. The studio, which had major costly flops in "Last 
Action Hero" and "Geronimo," plans to release only three pictures before June. 
In addition, Columbia suffered major embarrassment last summer after 
then-production president Michael Nathanson issued a statement through his 
lawyer denying involvement in a call-girl ring operated by alleged Hollywood 
madam Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 In promoting Canton to the newly created post of chairman of Columbia TriStar 
Motion Picture Cos., Sony officials said he will operate as a team with Motion 
Picture Group Chairman Jonathan Dolgen, a tough-minded and temperamental 
executive who is credited with curbing some of the studios' extravagant 
spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will report to Sony Pictures President Alan J. Levine, who said that 
they will oversee rather than direct the day-to-day creative endeavors of the 
studios. "This is a restructuring of the way we operate our motion picture 
business in order to strengthen it," he said. Producers will bring their 
projects directly to Platt and Lassally on the TriStar side, and recently 
installed production president Lisa Henson at Columbia, Levine added. Although 
Dolgen and Canton have often crossed swords in the past, they, too, have 
"developed a terrific friendship personally," as Canton put it earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen said he is not troubled by Canton's most recent track record. "I 
couldn't think of anyone I'd rather be partnered with in doing this," he said. 
"You view somebody based on his skills and ability, not necessarily on whether 
his last three movies worked. Mark is possessed of appetite and enthusiasm. 
He's got a very steep learning curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canton: "I long ago decided this is a big canvas, not a small one, and a 
long journey." 
</P>
<P>
 The power-sharing arrangement signals that Sony is imposing further financial 
restraints on the free-spending Canton. "If they just made Canton king of all 
he sees, they would come under such intense criticism that they couldn't do 
it," said an agent who is not among Canton's admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was widely assumed that Canton would have authority over creative 
decisions while Dolgen sticks to financial matters, the two executives made it 
clear that they will not operate under such clearly defined rules. In addition 
to speculation about how the Canton-Dolgen team will operate, Medavoy's exit 
has given rise to a host of other questions. Some wonder whether the 
restructuring will eventually result in a formal consolidation of the studios, 
despite Sony's assurances to the contrary. Others, however, say the escalating 
bids for Paramount Pictures demonstrate that parent Sony Corp. is likely to 
view TriStar as too valuable an asset to be merged with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 The gossip mill has also been working overtime on the issue of whether 
Columbia marketing and distribution president Sid Ganis will be given the title 
of studio president. But a well-placed source cast strong doubt Tuesday on 
Ganis' accession, describing the rumors as "wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have also questioned whether Platt, whose relationship with 
Medavoy dates back to their days at Orion, will stay at TriStar. But others say 
Platt is not in his mentor's shadow. "Marc Platt is beyond being looked on as a 
lieutenant," said International Creative Management President Jim Wiatt.

COMMENTARY; PRETTY WOMEN, PRETTY SCARY; MOVIES: IN UCLA'S FILM SERIES STARTING 
SATURDAY, THERE'S HELL TO PAY WHEN A WOMAN UNLEASHES HER SEXUALITY. FREUD, 
YOU'VE A LOT TO ANSWER FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see, exactly where are we on the feminist timeline? On the evidence of 
"Scary Women: Female Monsters and Fiends in American Film," a new film series 
at UCLA exploring female monsters in American movies, we're still strictly in 
the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The series -- curated by Andrea Kalas and Andrea Alsberg for the UCLA Film and 
Television Archive and featuring 19 films from 1935 to 1992 -- repeatedly 
reiterates a belief women have been struggling against for centuries. Permeated 
with traditional Christian perceptions of feminine virtue, virtually all these 
films pivot on the idea that there's hell to pay when a woman unleashes her 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 This comes as no surprise; however, a handful of unanticipated themes do 
surface in the series, which begins Saturday at UCLA's Melnitz Hall and runs 
through Feb. 1. At the top of the list is the idea that more often than not, 
feminine evil is rooted in a perversion of the mothering instinct. Mothers who 
are unable to release their offspring into life (as well as mothers who just 
don't give a damn) turn up left and right in stories in which the drive to 
nurture accelerates into a need to control, which ultimately explodes into 
total mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally noteworthy is the omnipresence of psychoanalytic theory in these 
movies. By the 1930s, when this series commences, the ideas that rocketed out 
of Vienna had had a profound effect on Hollywood, and abnormalities of any sort 
had come to be seen as the terrain of psychiatry. Hence, shrinks are 
prominently featured in eight of the films, and Freudian notions about 
sexuality are central to nearly all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The series falls short in a few regards, most notably in its failure to 
examine state-of-the-art scary women who haven't yet solidified into 
archetypes. Where, for instance, is Julia Roberts' "Pretty Woman"? (She's just 
a cute kid in need of some quick cash. Turn a trick? No problem.) Or how about 
Madonna in "Truth or Dare," in which she gives a narcissistic display of steely 
control so extreme that it's terrifying? Or Sherilyn Fenn in "Boxing Helena," a 
film that took the idea of female victimization to new depths of depravity? How 
about Demi Moore in anything? Her shameless immersion in the cult of the body 
is disconcerting, to say the least. (Last year's "Indecent Proposal" was like a 
mash note to Moore's well-toned rear end.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The closest the series comes to addressing current scary film females is with 
the 1992 movie "Poison Ivy," which features Drew Barrymore as a sociopathic 
stoner chick whose problems are the result of an abandoning father and 
inadequate mothering (oh, that again). What makes this threadbare story 
contemporary is Barrymore's wardrobe (she's got lots of tattoos) and the fact 
that changes in censorship laws made it possible for Barrymore's Ivy to seduce 
her surrogate daddy on screen in a surprisingly graphic sequence.  
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of censorship in film is thrown into high relief when one 
rewinds from "Poison Ivy" to the pair of films that open the series Saturday. 
Chaste little thrillers that center on female characters whose unresolved 
relationships with their mothers make them vulnerable to malevolent 
poltergeists, "The Haunting" (1963) and "The Uninvited" (1944) seem quaint by 
today's standards of on-screen horror. 
</P>
<P>
 We're clued in, for instance, that the female protagonist of "The Haunting," 
played by Julie Harris, is being pushed to the breaking point by pesky ghosts 
when she gets drunk and paints her toenails red. It is, however, a 
non-supernatural fit of sexual jealousy that finally pushes Harris over the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual jealousy is a leitmotif that turns up in virtually every film in the 
series, and it drives the plot in many of them. The idea of the woman whose 
jealousy transforms her into a depraved stalker is central to Jacques 
Tourneur's 1942 film "Cat People," which explains itself in a voice-over (from 
a therapist) as being about "the descendants of an ancient race of people who 
fell away from Christianity and began to worship Satan and are afflicted with 
corrupt passions that drive them to transform into cats and kill" (woman as a 
cunning, catlike creature is an ancient stereotype). Tourneur tips us off at 
the beginning that we're dealing with a loose cannon in his film: In the 
opening scene his heroine introduces herself as an artist, then throws a wad of 
paper on the sidewalk -- a catperson and a litterbug to boot! 
</P>
<P>
 Equally comical is Nathan Hertz's 1958 film "Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman." Set 
in the flying-saucer-obsessed '50s (wow, what a paranoid decade), the film 
chronicles the woes of a woman who has an encounter with a UFO that causes her 
to mutate into a giant, thus enabling her to get revenge on her philandering 
husband. In one hilarious scene, two therapists discuss this bummed-out 
heroine's midlife crisis and sadly conclude "she's aging" (the idea that aging 
is a crime women are forbidden to commit comes up in several films). This 
neglected wife may be past her prime, but she's not too old to wear a two-piece 
swimsuit when she stalks the land wreaking destruction in her path! 
</P>
<P>
 The female stalker in Clint Eastwood's 1971 directorial debut, "Play Misty for 
Me," is considerably more menacing, and the stalker reaches an apotheosis in 
the 1987 film "Fatal Attraction." Thinly disguised morality tales that tell us 
with a wagging finger of the wages of a one-night stand, these films are wildly 
conservative in their sexual politics and are infused with a disturbingly 
negative view of women. 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said for Brian De Palma's "Dressed to Kill" (1980), a truly 
reprehensible film that verges on pornography. One can't really take this film 
to task for its negative depiction of women, however, because it's an 
equal-opportunity smear job that expresses a searing contempt for the human 
race in general. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Dressed to Kill," the story of a sexually hung-up woman whose frustration 
with her husband's insensitivity in bed leads her to pick up a guy in a museum, 
shifts its focus midway to a crazed man who must dress as a woman in order to 
act out his killer instincts. De Palma's contempt for women really comes 
through in this shabbily drawn character; any transvestite who'd run around in 
a wig as cheap as the one this man wears can't have much regard for the female 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Male cross-dressing is also a crucial plot point in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 
horror classic "Psycho," which opens with the activities of a cool blonde whose 
greed and lust drive her to commit a crime. "Psycho" tosses out several red 
herrings before revealing the real monster of the piece -- a selfish mommy who 
played a little too fast and loose with her son's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 The mommy problem is also central to 1992's "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," 
which chronicles the descent into madness of a perky young blonde played by 
Rebecca De Mornay whose mothering instincts are thwarted by a miscarriage and 
emergency hysterectomy; she's left with no alternative but to kill several 
people. Reproductive mishaps are also central to David Cronenberg's "The Brood" 
(1979), the grisly tale of a woman whose suppressed rage takes the form of 
murderous children she breeds in tumorous growths. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronenberg modeled the evil mutant children of "The Brood" after the character 
played by Patty McCormack in "The Bad Seed," the 1956 film that interprets the 
drive to do evil as some kind of genetic affliction rather than a matter of 
moral choice. In a similar vein is the 1973 film "The Exorcist," which was 
dismissed by critic Pauline Kael as "the biggest recruiting poster the Catholic 
Church has had since 'Going My Way' "; the film makes a wildly emotional case 
for the religious right in its handling of ideas of good and evil. Religious 
fanaticism -- along with mother problems -- is also at the heart of De Palma's 
"Carrie," the story of a teen-age girl who's blossoming sexuality enrages her 
psychotically devout mother, thus making Carrie fertile ground for vengeful 
telekinetic powers. Conflict around the notion of unnatural desire also rears 
its head in Tony Scott's 1983 vampire fable "The Hunger," which finds Susan 
Sarandon flirting with a lesbian affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughably dated in many respects, Lambert Hillyer's 1936 thriller "Dracula's 
Daughter" is a far superior vampire film, and has a tenderness toward its 
subject that's completely lacking in the Scott film. Hillyer's is essentially a 
love story about a female vampire who is destroyed when she falls in love with 
one of her victims, thus echoing a theme that resonates through this entire 
series: Romantic love is a purifying nectar that tends to cramp the style of 
aspiring female monsters.

O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; BORODIN ENSEMBLE A LESSON IN LONGEVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Borodin String Quartet is just one year away from celebrating its 50th 
anniversary, a record for longevity matched by few other chamber-music 
ensembles. But like most veteran groups, it has gone through changes in 
personnel to survive this long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were students and very young," when it was started, recalled cellist 
Valentin Berlinsky recently, speaking through a translator from Montreal, where 
the quartet is playing before coming to Orange County for a concert Saturday at 
the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had dreams to be soloists, to start solo careers, but we really loved 
quartets, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlinsky, 68, and violist Dmitri Shebalin, 63, are the remaining members of 
the original quartet, formed in 1945 at the Moscow Conservatory of Music. 
Violinists Andrei Abramenkov, 58, and Mikhail Kopelman ("the baby, at 45") 
joined in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes meant changes in musical interpretation, too. But Berlinsky was 
reluctant to get into details. "This is a long conversation," he said. "You 
could write a book on this, the changes and their impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every quartet is a very little group, and it is very complicated to work 
together. If someone is conducting a big orchestra and has his own 
interpretation, all the soloists have to follow his interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a quartet, the parts are much more sophisticated and complicated than in 
an orchestra. Sometimes we don't come to a certain decision right away. We 
discuss it, play it. But our final goal is to find a constant for everybody. 
That's what we try to achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet will play works by Brahms and Tchaikovsky locally, as part of the 
chamber-music series sponsored by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The two works -- Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No. 3 and Brahms' String Quartet 
No. 3 -- were composed in the same year: 1876. Brahms' quartet -- his last, 
written at the same time as his First Symphony -- has gone into the standard 
repertory. But Tchaikovsky's, which is regarded by some critics a patchwork 
affair, has not. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the musicians "feel very close to Tchaikovsky," although they remain 
adamantly "against the idea of talking about music. We really prefer to perform 
and the audience to hear the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Local audiences may be more familiar with the quartet's eminent 
interpretations of the music of Shostakovich. The musicians played all 15 of 
his quartets at Ambassador Auditorium in 1988 and 1990. This year, Berlinsky 
said, they will play the cycle six times "around the world," including the 
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor at the end of the month, and then in 
Lisbon, Frankfurt and London, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotionally, it's very difficult," he said, "not only for the quartet, but 
for the public. His music is heavy and difficult, but at same time, there is a 
lot of emotional and psychological variety in it. But I want to make a 
parallel. It's the same with all the great composers -- Beethoven, Schubert, 
Bartok. It's emotionally very difficult to play cycles of all their quartets." 
</P>
<P>
 The four musicians live in Moscow and see each other "every day. But actually, 
even though we basically live in Moscow, we spend most of our lives in hotels 
around the world," Berlinsky said. They play 100 concerts a year, spending 
"something like eight months outside (Russia). Sometimes our wives come with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the political transformation in the former Soviet Union -- from 
communism to efforts at a free-market economy -- has not been particularly 
difficult because "we can have a contract with the West and earn (hard) 
currency. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many people like that. We are a minority. The process of change 
has been so painful for Russians because the economy was destroyed. There was 
no economy. It's a very painful process and needs a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The painful process, they said, explains the political emergence of Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky, leader of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. 
Zhirinovsky has become notorious for making anti-Western statements and for 
advocating expanding Russia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people who voted for Zhirinovsky," said Berlinsky, "did not 
vote for him because they love him but because they disagree with the economic 
reforms by the government. This is their reaction. They are looking for a way 
to make their lives easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a deep crisis, in a political situation such as exists right now, which is 
going on not only in Russia, but elsewhere, people like Zhirinovsky appear, 
historically. In similar situations, such a figure would appear in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the majority of intellectual people -- most of our friends, musicians, 
artists, intellectual people, they are not supporters of Zhirinovsky. This is 
some kind of natural process. Now, it is terribly difficult for people. That 
was the mistake made by the reformers. Now they're going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Borodin String Quartet will play music by Tchaikovsky and Brahms on 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 
Presented by the Laguna Chamber Music Society and the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society. $12.50 to $25. (714) 854-4646.

CLERK FOR JUDGE IN BASINGER 'HELENA' CASE INVESTIGATED; COURTS: A LOAN REQUEST 
MADE OF THE ACTRESS AND ALEC BALDWIN PUTS SYNDY SCAIFE-RICHARD UNDER REVIEW. 
THE CLERK OFFERS NO COMMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A court clerk is under review by the Los Angeles Superior Court for possible 
misconduct in the case of last winter's Kim Basinger "Boxing Helena" trial, a 
court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the spokesperson, the review of Syndy Scaife-Richard was prompted 
by a Jan. 2 Times story that revealed that she had asked Basinger for help in 
getting a $125,000 loan from Basinger's then-fiance, actor Alec Baldwin. He and 
Basinger have since married. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaife-Richard clerks for Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin, the 
presiding judge in the breach-of-contract trial in which Basinger was ordered 
to pay independent producer Main Line Pictures $8.1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 2 story detailed the contents of a letter written by Scaife-Richard 
to Basinger five months after the trial in which the clerk said she wanted the 
money to buy a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinger's attorneys said the actress felt very uncomfortable about the 
request, particularly because her case is on appeal and stands a chance of 
ending up back in Chirlin's court. Basinger has filed for bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 The story also noted that during a noon break in the trial, a baby shower was 
given for then-pregnant Scaife-Richard, and Basinger was invited. The actress 
told The Times that she wasn't sure what to do but that she was concerned about 
the implications should she not attend. Basinger said she did and was asked to 
sign autographs and have her picture taken with some of those attending the 
party; attendees included Chirlin and some of her employees and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslet said: "All court 
employees must conduct themselves in a manner that shows no impartiality and 
reflects on the fairness of the court. Anytime something occurs that is 
contrary to that policy, the court looks into it. The Times story prompted our 
review, which is under way and remains confidential."  
</P>
<P>
 If the court -- which oversees personnel matters -- finds that Scaife-Richard 
committed any acts of misconduct, she could be subject to disciplinary action 
ranging from an oral reprimand to a cut in pay to a suspension or firing. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to comment, Chirlin would say only: "Where any court employee is 
accused of any impropriety, it is the court's responsibility to look into it." 
The judge reiterated that she had no knowledge at the time about the clerk's 
request for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Scaife-Richard declined to comment this week, she was quoted in the 
Jan. 2 article as saying that she made the request to Basinger in good faith 
and later realized it was a mistake and that she was embarrassed by it. But her 
Aug. 19 letter was followed up with numerous phone calls and a second letter in 
October detailing how she would use the loan, the actress's attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the story, Basinger's attorneys said that the judge hugged the 
plaintiffs in the case, Main Line producer Carl Mazzocone and director Jennifer 
Lynch, following the verdict and in front of the other side.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge also attended the film's premiere in September, while the case was 
on appeal and could have fallen under her purview again. Chirlin said earlier 
that in hindsight, attending the premiere was probably a mistake. She said she 
did not recall hugging anyone after the jury delivered the verdict.

SAN FRANCISCO OPERA UNVEILS '94 SEASON, MORE COST CUTTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco Opera, which announces its 1994 season today, is making 
significant, strategic budget cuts in response to a projected accumulated 
$6-million deficit acknowledged publicly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine operas to be mounted in the 1994 fall season, seven will share 
visual components with each other, using the same designer, Gerard Howland. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven operas sharing sets are Verdi's "Macbeth," directed by the company's 
General Director Lotfi Mansouri; Conrad Susa's "The Dangerous Liaisons," 
directed in its world premiere performances by Colin Graham; Verdi's "Il 
Trovatore," directed by John Copley; Rossini's rarely performed "Otello," 
directed by Laurie Feldman; Wagner's "Tannhauser," and Massenet's "Herodiade," 
directed by Mansouri and Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor," with a director to 
be announced. The company will also perform Boito's "Mefistofele," directed by 
Peter McClintock, and Prokofiev's "The Fiery Angel," directed by David Freeman, 
both in borrowed productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Howland, who is the company's new design director, will supervise all 
productions. Thomas J. Munn is in charge of eight of the nine lighting schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from his office in the War Memorial Opera House on Tuesday, 
Howland said that the productions will "not look like each other. There will be 
common elements in them, but mostly in the underpinning, like the floors. All 
scenic elements will be unique to each show. None of the elements in 
'Tannhauser,' for instance, will appear in any other production. Each show can 
be taken on its own merits." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the savings in using this new system will be "quite a significant 
amount," he said. "In having one director of design, we are knocking out the 
ego factor. And, by supervising all productions, I can dovetail them in terms 
of the cost of turnaround -- LAT

PLAN TO TRACK OFFICER COMPLAINTS STALLED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CRITICS SAY LAPD IS 
DRAGGING ITS FEET ON 2 1/2-YEAR-OLD CHRISTOPHER COMMISSION RECOMMENDATION. THE 
DEPARTMENT CITES FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 2 1/2 years after a blue-ribbon commission urged that the Los 
Angeles Police Department adopt a system for tracking personnel complaints, 
little progress has been made and it may be years before the system is in 
place, police officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The long delay in pushing ahead with OBITS -- the Officer Behavior Indicators 
Tracking System -- is intensely frustrating to some members of the Police 
Commission, and it has angered some Police Department critics, who maintain 
that the LAPD is dragging its feet in adopting a program that would make it 
easier to track complaints against police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners acknowledged that those concerns are hard to rebut, given the 
slow progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look to the community as though we're acting in good faith when it 
takes this long," Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum told department 
representatives at a meeting Tuesday. "It's not that complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners were particularly surprised when an LAPD computer expert told 
them that it could take at least a year to design computer software for 
tracking the complaints. The commission's surprise was shared by technology 
experts, who said the basic proposal -- to create a database that would include 
each officer's name and a list of complaints and commendations -- could be 
developed with far less time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those experts, certain aspects of putting the system in place 
could be time-consuming, but the basic technology is relatively simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could do the basic job with $2,000 on a personal computer," said John 
McCarthy, director of technology research for Forrester Research in Boston. 
"The question you have to ask is: 'Are we using an atomic bomb here to clear 
some debris?' " 
</P>
<P>
 William Russell, the newly appointed commanding officer of the department's 
support services bureau, agreed that the basic database could be built with 
relative ease. But he said the program needs to go beyond supplying data to 
call commanding officers' attention to subordinates with troubling patterns of 
complaints. Such a system, Russell said, would take several years to put in 
place, even if money were immediately available for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrative officer has rejected the LAPD's requests for money to 
fund a computerized tracking system three times, officials said. And department 
leaders say they do not have money within the department budget to pay for the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 That response angers many advocates of the tracking system, who complain that 
it already has taken too long to put it into place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a travesty to be this far from the Christopher Commission report and 
still be a year or two away from implementing that critical system," said Joe 
R. Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of 
Greater Los Angeles. "We desperately need that system to be able to track that 
kind of behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hoffman, legal director of the Southern California American Civil 
Liberties Union, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-and-a-half years down the line, we're essentially at square one," Hoffman 
said. "It really calls into question their commitment to this system 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been controversial since it was first proposed. Many 
rank-and-file officers believe it will unfairly punish them for complaints, 
many of whichultimately turn out to be unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents 
rank-and-file officers, has consistently expressed reservations about the 
tracking system. Danny Staggs, the league's newly elected president, reiterated 
those concerns Tuesday, saying that many officers "perceive OBITS as a negative 
management tool." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Christopher Commission -- which studied excessive force in the LAPD in 
the months after the Rodney G. King beating -- strongly recommended 
implementing a tracking system that would help supervisors identify officers 
with histories of complaints, whether the complaints were sustained or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although sustained complaints are certainly important to the decision-making 
process, a history of 'not sustained' complaints, especially if they involve a 
similar fact pattern, can be equally telling," the commission found. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the current Police Commission have vowed to press for the full 
implementation of the Christopher Commission reforms, but many of the reforms 
are stalled. Because of that, several police commissioners expressed 
frustration that the department seems unable or unwilling to move more quickly 
to adopt the program.  
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that the department prioritizes what is important to it," said 
Deirdre Hill, vice president of the commission and the commissioner who asked 
staffers to produce the update on the status of the project. "I am certainly 
not happy with the fact that funding was not identified at the outset." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum and Hill each directed department officials to produce a new cost 
estimate for a computer tracking system as soon as possible, and each pledged 
to lobby for that system with the mayor and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not let go of this," Greenebaum told staffers. "The department, the 
entire department, needs to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 In other business Tuesday, Police Chief Willie L. Williams told commissioners 
that the LAPD's investigative efforts have been hampered by shortages of 
detectives, a problem highlighted by an internal district attorney's memo that 
came to light in recent days. The July 22 memo, obtained last week by The Times 
and the Daily News of Los Angeles, blamed low morale and understaffing at the 
LAPD for a decline in the quality of cases brought to the district attorney's 
office for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information that was in that letter was not something that was startling 
or new," the chief said. He added that he does not believe morale will improve 
significantly until officers get a contract and the LAPD begins adding to its 
ranks.

'FINDER' OF TWO BOYS CHARGED WITH KIDNAPING IN BOTH CASES; CRIME: POLICE SAY 
WITNESSES HAVE REPORTED SEEING HIM WITH THE CHILDREN DURING TIME THEY WERE 
SUPPOSED TO BE MISSING. THE DEFENDANT, AT FIRST CALLED A HERO, PLEADS NOT 
GUILTY.

 A 31-year-old day laborer who was hailed as a hero for finding a missing 
4-year-old boy, but then came under suspicion by Los Angeles police after 
recovering a second child four weeks later, was charged Tuesday with felony 
kidnaping in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Lopez Palma, 31, was charged with two counts of kidnaping a child 
under the age of 14 and two counts of child stealing. Palma, who has previously 
identified himself as Enrique Palma Lopez, pleaded not guilty to all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Palma faces a possible sentence of more than 13 years in state 
prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Lopez, the prosecutor handling the 
case. Palma is being held at the Los Angeles County Central Jail on $100,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Palma came to the attention of police Dec. 5 when he claimed to have found 
4-year-old Matthew Vera at Broadway and 6th Street, two days after the boy had 
vanished from the Downtown Greyhound bus station. Palma was proclaimed a hero 
and received hundreds of dollars from sympathizers for his good deed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palma became the subject of an intense police investigation after he 
recovered 3-year-old Andrew Rodriguez on Jan. 5, nine days after the boy had 
disappeared from a Downtown video arcade. Palma was questioned extensively by 
detectives about both cases, but he was released because there was not enough 
evidence to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters after his release about skepticism that the same man could 
find two missing children in four weeks, Palma said: "It's only bingo -- good 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that because of news media coverage, a number of witnesses came 
forward in the last few days who said they had seen Palma with Matthew at 
several locations, including a homeless shelter in Santa Monica, during the 
time the child was missing. On Monday night, investigators got a call from a 
woman who said she had seen Palma with Andrew the day he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Louis Trovato said the woman, whom he did not identify, had been given a 
ride to Chula Vista by someone she met at the bus station, and that the same 
person also picked up Palma and the boy. Trovato said that the woman got out of 
the car in Chula Vista and did not know what happened to Palma or the boy after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Trovato said the woman had called police last Friday after seeing pictures of 
Palma on television. But he said police had been flooded with hundreds of phone 
calls from potential witnesses and had not had time to check her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called back last night and talked to one of our detectives," Trovato 
said. "We went and saw her and showed her pictures (of Palma) and she 
positively identified him. She said, 'Hey, that's the guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, the prosecutor in the case, said Palma's motive was not clear. Neither 
child was harmed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Palma was arrested in March, 1987, on suspicion of lewd behavior 
with a child under the age of 14, but was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Palma was arrested Sunday in San Diego as he attempted to cross the border 
into Mexico, police said. Border Patrol agents were questioning him about his 
immigration status when they discovered that a fugitive warrant had been issued 
for his arrest by authorities in Juneau, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Palma was convicted there in 1989 on a charge of petty theft, authorities 
said. Police said Palma was arrested again in 1991 and convicted on charges of 
attempted bribery of a police officer and for attempting to take an officer's 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Palma was later deported to Mexico but, after a police officer saw him last 
October in Juneau in violation of his probation, a warrant was issued for his 
arrest, said Richard Svobodny, an assistant district attorney in Juneau. Los 
Angeles police said they had had trouble tracking Palma's criminal history 
because he has used a number of aliases. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Palma would not be extradited to Alaska until his case in Los 
Angeles is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the charges in California are much more serious," Svobodny said. 
"If California wants to go first with its case, that's no problem."

ERIK MENENDEZ JURY RESUMES DISCUSSIONS ; TRIAL: ORDERED BY JUDGE TO CONTINUE 
DELIBERATING DESPITE A CLAIM OF DEADLOCK, JURORS COMPLETE A 17TH DAY. THEY 
FORWARD NEW NOTE, BUT CONTENTS ARE NOT REVEALED. 
</P>

<P>
 The jury considering murder charges against Erik Menendez, urged by the judge 
to keep striving for a verdict after reporting a deadlock, made it through a 
17th day of deliberations Tuesday without giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before adjourning for the evening, however, the panel passed a note to 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg. The contents were not 
disclosed and the note -- which could signal continuing deadlock or simply a 
question on a point of law -- will not be dealt with until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the jury foreman sent a note to the judge reporting that there 
seemed to be no hope of reaching a verdict because positions had "essentially 
not changed after three weeks of discussion and debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg ordered the panel to keep trying and it did through much of Tuesday, 
despite taking a long break, from 10:30 a.m. until 1 p.m., because one juror 
was ill with the flu. Jurors spent the afternoon behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg also held a closed hearing with the lawyers in the Erik Menendez case 
at 11 a.m., the latest in a series of secret sessions during deliberations, 
most of which have involved allegations of juror misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said they were ordered not to discuss what happened at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But later, speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, defense attorney 
Leslie Abramson did say that Erik Menendez was disappointed at the prospect of 
an ongoing deadlock in the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hoping for a verdict that would free him," Abramson said.

 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, a wealthy 
entertainment executive, and Kitty Menendez, 47, in the family's Beverly Hills 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the five-month trial, prosecutors alleged that the brothers killed 
out of hatred and greed. The brothers admitted the slayings but testified that 
they killed in fear after years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries are hearing the case because some evidence was admitted against 
only one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury, in its 19th day of deliberations, heard the conclusion 
of 400 pages of testimony they asked to have read back, mostly covering the 
brothers' accounts of the day they shot their parents. That panel moved back 
behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lyle Menendez's lawyers, Michael Burt, said his jury may also be facing 
a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's obviously a problem if they're doing that much rereading and 
deliberating as long as they have," he told Associated Press. " There is some 
dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury is deliberating on a separate floor of the courthouse. 
It has not been told of the deadlock reported Monday in the Erik Menendez jury, 
although jurors had to have been aware of the flurry of activity at the 
courthouse -- TV news crews were filming as they left at the end of the day, 
then again at lunch Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither jury is sequestered, but jurors have been told repeatedly to avoid 
reading or watching anything about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti vowed Monday that his office will 
retry either or both of the Menendez brothers if their cases end in hung 
juries, emphasizing that it would be "retried as a murder case -- because 
that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Each jury is considering three counts -- one for the killing of each Menendez 
parent and a third alleging conspiracy to murder. But Weisberg gave jurors four 
possible verdicts in the slaying of each parent, ranging from first-degree 
murder to involuntary manslaughter, which carries a penalty of two to four 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the district attorney's office said Tuesday that 13% to 15% of 
all cases tried by county prosecutors end up in deadlocked juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson said that she had anticipated a hung jury from the day the trial 
began in July.

CATHOLICS NAME GAY, LESBIAN TO ADVISORY BOARD; RELIGION: APPOINTMENTS BY THE 
L.A. ARCHDIOCESE ARE PART OF THE CHURCH'S OUTREACH TO HOMOSEXUALS. BUT ITS 
STANCE AGAINST SEXUAL ACTIVITY BY UNMARRIED PEOPLE IS UNCHANGED, A SPOKESMAN 
SAYS.

<P>
 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said Tuesday that a new advisory 
board that includes a gay man and a lesbian has been appointed to assist the 
church's outreach to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the archdiocese, which in 1989 prohibited its priests from celebrating 
Mass for a group of gay and lesbian Catholics known as Dignity, made it clear 
it is not backing down from traditional church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church's teaching is non-negotiable, so (in that sense) there's nothing 
for anybody to be advised about," Father Gregory Coiro, the archdiocesan 
spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church holds that although homosexual orientation is not sinful in itself, 
all sexual activity by unmarried people, or by married people using artificial 
birth control, is morally wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro and Father Peter J. Liuzzi, director of the archdiocese's Pastoral 
Ministry to the Lesbian and Gay Community, said the idea is to make gays and 
lesbians feel welcome and provide an environment where they may eventually 
"choose the good." 
</P>
<P>
 Liuzzi said he hopes the advisory board can assist in suggesting how best to 
present the church's teaching without alienating gays and lesbians. His 
outreach is intended to show them "hospitality," which he said includes 
acceptance, understanding and Christian love. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the ultimate aim is to help gays and lesbians remain celibate. 
"This is a delicate ministry because it involves moral issues," Liuzzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the church responds to gays and lesbians who are unable or unwilling 
to remain celibate, Liuzzi replied: "I think you have to do what Jesus did. He 
continued to show hospitality . . . and created an environment in which the 
person could continue and struggle and move in the direction of being totally 
faithful to our call."  
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was greeted with guarded approval Tuesday by Lee Werbel, 
executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any effort to allow people to practice their spirituality is definitely 
welcome," she said. But she considered it a first step. "It's really hard to 
grow up practicing a religion that actually says you're excluded. . . . That 
would cause a lot of pain. That's why my hope is this would be a very initial, 
baby first step in the process of actual acceptance, and eventually the 
teaching would change." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony joined the bishops of four other Southern 
California dioceses in ordering all priests to cease celebrating Mass for 
Dignity, a national organization of gay and lesbian Catholics. The bishops 
imposed the sanctions after Dignity two years earlier repudiated the church's 
"clear and constant moral teaching" on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the new advisory board are Rafael Vega and Marilyn Pires, 
representing gay and lesbian Catholics; Jeff and Peggy Stabile, representing 
parents of gay children; Jerome Porath, superintendent of Catholic schools; 
Msgr. Gabino Zavala, rector of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo; Joan Vienna, 
director of family life for the archdiocese; Father Jeremiah McCarthy, author 
and professor of moral theology at St. John's Seminary, and Father Gerald 
Coleman, a writer and lecturer on homosexuality and rector of St. Patrick's 
Seminary in Menlo Park.

OFFICERS QUIT TAKING CALLS ON COYOTES; ANIMAL REGULATION: THE DEPARTMENT, WHICH 
WAS RECEIVING 30 INQUIRIES DAILY IN THE WEST VALLEY ON A TRAPPING BAN, REFERS 
QUESTIONS DOWNTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 7-month-old ban on coyote trapping in the city has generated about 30 calls 
daily to animal regulation officers in the west San Fernando Valley -- so many 
that the officers have been told by their bosses to stop responding directly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Animal Regulation Department instead has asked that all coyote questions 
be referred to an animal regulation spokeswoman in downtown Los Angeles. The 
department's decision to refer all coyote questions away from animal regulation 
officers has infuriated some West Valley residents who want to talk directly 
with the officers about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem when people have a pressing problem . . . and cannot get an 
answer from officers with 30 years of field experience," said Michael Lazarou, 
a Woodland Hills resident who formed a Valley homeowner group that wants the 
city to consider lifting the trapping ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazarou contends his 19-month-old son was stalked by a coyote last month in 
his back yard, and that incident turned him, literally overnight, into an 
activist on coyote issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But animal regulation officials defend the new policy, saying the 30 or so 
daily coyote questions received at the West Valley animal regulation office 
over the past two weeks have prevented officers from performing their duties in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal regulation spokeswoman Nancy Moriarty said that the department's 
general manager, Gary Olsen, instructed West Valley officers earlier this month 
to refer the calls to Moriarty. She said Olsen did not issue an order but 
simply a suggestion to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a gag order but a way to alleviate the overload" of calls, she 
said. Moriarty added that she is an animal regulation lieutenant with 15 years 
experience in the department and therefore is qualified to answer a broad 
variety of questions about coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over coyote calls is the latest development in an increasingly 
contentious debate that began in June when the Board of Animal Regulation 
Commissioners voted to halt the trapping of coyotes by city employees. Because 
the ban was partly aimed at saving the city money and freeing up animal 
regulation officers for other duties, not at saving the coyotes, residents 
still are allowed to hire a certified pest control company to trap the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ban was supported by animal rights organizations, it infuriated 
some hillside residents in the West Valley who have grown concerned over an 
increase in coyote sightings and pet attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal experts attribute the increase to the recent brush-fires, the abundance 
of food and small wildlife and the trapping ban. The sightings have prompted 
the animal regulation board to schedule a Jan. 24 meeting in Reseda to consider 
lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Richard Felosky, senior animal regulation officer in the West Valley 
office, said he is "ambivalent" about the instructions to refer coyote 
questions to Moriarty because he enjoys helping people with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Felosky said he understands why the department would ask him to refer 
questions to Moriarty and intends to continue "following orders."

GANG LOOK HEMMED IN ON CAMPUS; BURBANK: SCHOOL OFFICIALS FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO 
ENFORCE A RECENTLY ENACTED STRICT DRESS CODE. SOME STUDENTS GRUMBLE, BUT MOST 
ARE COMPLYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In her office at Burbank High School, Assistant Principal Gaylene Van Zjill 
carefully pinned up the pant legs of a ninth-grade boy, just high enough so the 
frayed bottoms no longer draped the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she gave him detention. 
</P>
<P>
 After she found Raul Castellon in the hallway wearing a white T-shirt, 
oversized black pants and an initialed belt buckle, Van Zjill taped a small 
square of white paper over the initial. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she ordered Castellon to wear a sweater for the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have to concentrate on dressing (like a) school boy," she 
told Castellon. "Can you do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try," he allowed after some discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last week when the Burbank Unified School District began enforcing a new 
dress code that bans "gang-related apparel," students throughout Burbank have 
had to take a new approach to fashion -- at least while on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Oversized pants worn with white T-shirts, black-and-white Starter jackets, 
initialed belt buckles -- which could represent a gang -- baseball caps and 
bandannas are now on the outlawed list and can ultimately lead to suspension of 
students who continually wear them on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burbank students may not be alone. Schools throughout the state have been 
considering similar codes since Gov. Pete Wilson last September signed AB 980, 
an Assembly bill that permits local school boards to prohibit clothing they 
deem to be gang-related, said Patti Roberts, spokeswoman for the California 
School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is one aspect of trying to make schools safer not only for children 
but for teachers and administrators also," said Cindy Katz, spokeswoman for the 
governor's Office of Child Development and Education. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Burbank code is in its nascent stage, Burbank administrators like 
Van Zjill have used a mix of strict lecturing, creativity and compassion to 
help students adhere to the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hemmed pants, I've pinned pants, I have taught them to sew," she said 
sitting in her office Tuesday morning. "I will do anything to help them follow 
this code." 
</P>
<P>
 "The overriding issue is the safety and security of students on campus . . . . 
I want them to come to school to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from parents and others in Burbank has been favorable, said Supt. 
Arthur Pierce. Other local school districts have contacted district officials 
in Burbank to obtain copies of the code. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is going well," Pierce said. "At this point I have had no 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Jan. 3, there have been four suspensions at John Burroughs High School 
and two at Luther Middle School, Pierce said. At Burbank High School, no 
students have been suspended, but 18 have served detention and many have been 
warned or their parents have been called. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspension is the last resort and one that administrators would rather not 
take, Van Zjill said. She realizes too, she said, that for some students 
clothes provide a sense of identity and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to be careful not to damage ego and self-esteem," she said. "We let 
them know we're doing this out of love and concern." Dressed in a white 
T-shirt, and wearing size 50 black pants on his 30-something-size frame, 
Castellon said changing his style of dress would be hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't," he said, leaning against a wall in the hallway with a group of 
friends. "I wouldn't look the same. I've been wearing this the whole school 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Response among students to the new code has been mixed. The topic has been 
discussed in classes, during lunch breaks and even debate tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to change the gang problem," said 11th-grader Robert Pettit 
as he walked to first period Tuesday morning. "They're going to change the 
gangs' clothes. Then the gangs will start wearing something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students said the banned apparel, specifically the baggy pants, are worn 
by students who simply like the comfort of big clothes or the idea of keeping 
in step with current fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a gang member to wear those clothes," said Tenaye 
Giggles, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, like Shannon Lundquist, 18, would even take the code a step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uniforms -- that's all I say," she said. "It's more businesslike, more 
distinguished and people don't have to argue about what's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Bridget Hagen, 17, who debated the issue in a high school speech 
competition over the weekend, said students should abide by the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think schools should have the right to ban whatever they want," 
she said. "I'm glad because I don't like seeing that style . . . . I think the 
consensus of our school, especially my grade, is 'tough. Deal with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said the code, however well-intentioned, could be financially 
difficult for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have money to buy a whole new wardrobe," said Kesha Jackson, 16, who 
was wearing a banned jacket, but so far has not been disciplined. "I guess they 
know it's the only jacket I have."

GATES BACKS POLICE ACTION IN RESTAURANT ROBBERY; COURTS: THE EX-CHIEF TESTIFIES 
IN SUIT OVER SURVEILLANCE TEAM'S RESPONSE IN SUNLAND IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates on Tuesday resolutely defended 
a special police surveillance unit for waiting outside a Sunland McDonald's for 
more than 30 minutes while its manager was held inside at gunpoint during a 
1990 robbery -- saying citizens are misled by the ease with which police defeat 
criminals on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Any other action could have increased the danger to the restaurant manager, 
Gates testified in a Glendale Superior Court trial in which the manager is 
suing the city, alleging that the officers failed in their responsibility to 
protect her. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he felt great sympathy for the manager, Robbin L. Cox, but 
suggested her lawsuit was applying a television standard of what police are 
capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People watch television too much and don't know how difficult this is," Gates 
said, referring to the work of the Special Investigations Section, which 
follows suspected dangerous felons in the hope of catching them in the 
commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said that surveillance is an extremely complicated and "iffy" business, 
and that for the officers to burst into the restaurant after the four men broke 
in could have precipitated a shootout in which Cox would have been killed or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's attorney, Christopher Hiddleson, has said his client will ask for $1 
million in damages from the city and the Police Department for failing to try 
to rescue Cox, who was blindfolded and threatened with death by the robbers if 
she didn't open the restaurant safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The SIS moved in when the robbers left the restaurant on Foothill Boulevard, a 
gunfight broke out and three of the four robbers were killed. The fourth man, 
who was wounded, is serving a 17-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson called Gates to testify on police procedure and about Gates' own 
actions in reviewing the official investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson asked Gates to read two policies from the LAPD Manual. One defined 
"reverence for human life" as the primary consideration in tactics, and the 
other declared the arrest of the perpetrator of a crime "subordinate to the 
protection of life." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gates insisted that consideration for Cox's safety guided the unit 
leader, Detective Brian Davis, in his decision to hold the SIS team outside the 
restaurant, and to order that uniformed officers responding to Cox's call to 
911 for help be ordered away from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the undercover surveillance team dress in "scruffy" civilian 
clothes and could "look like the suspects" to a uniformed officer, possibly 
leading to an unpredictable confrontation between the two police groups, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the officers conducting the surveillance had no reason to believe that 
the robbers would enter the restaurant, Gates said. In similar previous 
robberies by the same men, he said, the four men had always waited outside, 
followed the manager home, then forced the manager back to the restaurant to 
open the safe. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the four men broke into the restaurant by a side door that was out 
of view of the 22-man SIS team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, you have a very delicate situation," Gates said. "You have a 
hostage situation. Then you don't go inside. You might endanger the hostage." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson asked whether surveillance officers were not supposed to keep the 
suspects in sight at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that simple," Gates said. "It's not as you see in TV where they 
follow people closely. It's very complex. Your cover can be blown very easily. 
You often have to stay in a place where you can't see everything that is going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do your best without trying to totally blow the operation. Once you blow 
the operation, the suspects are gone. You can't arrest them. Your opportunity 
to take them off the street has been lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The SIS has already lost one suit in the widely publicized McDonald's case. A 
federal court jury found that the officers acted without cause when they fired 
on the robbers, awarding $44,000 in damages to the families of the dead men and 
the survivor. Almost half of that award was levied against Gates personally, 
who the jury said condoned the use of excessive force in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, a retired FBI agent called as Hiddleson's final witness 
contradicted Gates. James P. Graham, who said he was involved in numerous 
surveillances in his 22 years with the agency, testified that the police should 
have telephoned Cox inside to warn her, and later should have declared a 
hostage situation to bring the full force of the department to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also said the surveillance leader could easily have posted an officer 
behind a wall on the west side of the restaurant where the robbers entered. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have broken off a tree branch to hide behind while they looked over 
the wall, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said they expect the trial to go to the jury today.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MOTHER 
GETS PROBATION FOR STEALING DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman convicted of stealing her 5-year-old daughter from the legal father 
was sentenced Tuesday to three years' probation, ending another chapter in a 
bizarre custody battle over the girl, Courtney Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel also ordered the mother, 46-year-old 
Catherine F. Thomas of Van Nuys, to perform 100 hours of community service and 
obey the terms of a family court order that awarded custody of Courtney to 
Kevin Thomas, a former family friend who changed his name to match the 
girl's.Kevin Thomas, who says he is gay, has no blood ties to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing Tuesday was part of a plea bargain designed to keep Catherine 
Thomas out of jail for the sake of her child, according to both the prosecution 
and defense. Accused of absconding with Courtney last July 29 during a visit, 
Catherine Thomas pleaded no contest to felony child stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want a protracted trial with the child coming out the loser," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Linda Acaldo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Thomas is scheduled to appear in court on Feb. 18 for a hearing on 
whether she should pay $15,000 in restitution to Kevin Thomas, who was reunited 
with Courtney in September after the fugitive mother and child were seized in 
Pittsburgh.

hire a certified pest control company to trap the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ban was supported by animal rights organizations, it infuriated 
some hillside residents, who have grown concerned over an increase in coyote 
sightings and attacks on pets. HUGO MARTIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVE BEGINS FOR LAW 
CURTAILING SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>

<P>
 An immigration reform group led by two former top INS officials on Tuesday 
kicked off a petition drive to place on the November state ballot a measure 
that would virtually bar illegal immigrants from public hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the "Save Our State (SOS)" initiative began dropping off petitions 
to citizens' groups advocating immigration changes.They need to gather 384,974 
valid signatures by June 8 to qualify the measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is in big trouble due to illegal immigration," said Harold Ezell, 
Western regional chief of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 
1983 to 1989 and co-author of the proposal with Alan Nelson, the INS 
commissioner under President Ronald Reagan. "We can do a lot to make it so 
uncomfortable that people who want to come here illegally know that they cannot 
survive."  
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, among the most stringent proposals put forth so far in the 
debate over illegal immigration, would require public hospitals and schools to 
report illegal immigrants to the INS. It would eliminate prenatal care for 
pregnant women who are here without papers. Illegal immigrants could receive 
emergency medical service but risk being reported to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is sponsoring a separate 
initiative to cut off most emergency medical care to illegal immigrants and 
require Californians to carry identification cards attesting to their legal 
residency. Schabarum's proposal has yet to be cleared by state officials for 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant rights groups have argued that it is jobs, not public services, that 
draw illegal immigrants to the United States. RICHARD SIMON

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RED CROSS CALLS NEED FOR BLOOD DONORS CRITICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Los Angeles Fire Department paramedic, North Hills resident Mark Gaines 
sees more blood than most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked Downtown, in South-Central and Central Los Angeles," Gaines said, 
lying on his back with a needle taped to the inside of his arm at the American 
Red Cross blood donation center in Van Nuys. "We see a lot of trauma, a lot of 
need for transfusions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, whose work motivates him to donate blood, was one of several dozen 
donors who visited the donation center Tuesday to contribute a pint of their 
own blood to the Southern California region's dwindling supply. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Red Cross spokeswoman, the region's need for blood donations is 
always more pronounced immediately after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 But in combination with a particularly severe flu virus that hit earlier than 
expected, and harsh winter weather conditions in other parts of the country, 
which prevented regular donations from leaving those areas, the need for blood 
throughout the Southland this season is dire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a critical situation," said Cheryle Babbitt, who heads blood donation 
services for the Southern California Region of the American Red Cross. "We are 
able to meet emergency situations, but if things don't improve, there is a 
possibility we won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt said the Red Cross usually has about 2,600 units of blood on hand for 
use in Los Angeles and Orange counties, or enough for about three days. Now, 
the supply is down to about 451 units -- less than what is needed for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Red Cross center in Van Nuys, donations were up slightly last week 
after people learned of the shortage, according to head nurse, Sylvia 
Swearingen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the center's refrigerator, which normally stores about 300 units of blood, 
remains nearly bare with only 18 units on its shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Wood, who has volunteered at the center for 15 years, delivering blood to 
local hospitals, said he has never seen such a dismal supply.  
</P>
<P>
 "It normally gets low during the holidays," Wood said. "But this is about the 
lowest I've ever seen it."  
</P>
<P>
 People interested in donating blood can call the Red Cross for the nearest 
donation site at (800) 974-2113. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; HEARINGS TO FOCUS ON PLAN TO RESTORE LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon will convene public hearings next 
month to air the federal government's plans to re-create the lake that gave 
Lake View Terrace its name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to hide," Alarcon told a crowd of about 75 residents during a 
Monday night community meeting on the Hansen Dam lake restoration plan. 
"Everything we have been working on will be laid out on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its master plan for the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers plans to construct a 15-acre lake behind Hansen Dam to 
replace the original lake, called Holiday Lake, which was formed when Hansen 
Dam was constructed across the Tujunga Wash. The lake was filled by silt after 
a series of floods in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are concerned that a new lake with a swimming area will draw massive 
and unruly crowds, creating traffic and safety nuisances. Others are irate that 
the old lake won't be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps will construct the new body of water in a higher area where it won't 
be affected by even a catastrophic flood, said Nedenia Kennedy, chief of the 
corps' environmental support section in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal governments will pay the $10-million estimated cost for 
the new lake, but the city must find a way to maintain and patrol it. Alarcon 
refused to divulge any details, but promised he will unveil plans to make the 
park self-sufficient through concession sales and other revenue-generating 
mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents urged officials to ensure the park will be well-patrolled. They say 
that while the park languished, drug dealers moved in. Park officials confirmed 
their complaints, but said local police are focusing more attention on the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon balked at a city park official's suggestion that community groups fund 
private patrols, as they have done in wealthier areas of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, if we're going to make this park safe, we're not 
going to do it on the backs of your donations," Alarcon said. "This community 
pays taxes and it deserves those services." GEOFFREY MOHAN

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; NO WONDER GUN 
CONTROL IS A PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allen Sheldon of Northridge is a patient, law-abiding man, an honest man -- a 
man who even in confounding times stubbornly tries to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the owner of four guns: a pistol, a shotgun and two rifles -- 
target shooting firearms he bought about 20 years ago but hasn't fired in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 So with all the recent talk about gun deaths and gun-control regulations, 
Sheldon wanted to know if he was legally required to register these weapons and 
if so, how. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple question, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no. This then, is the story of his quest for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What the hell, I'll call and see what the requirement is,' " said 
Sheldon, a business systems consultant. First call was to the LAPD's Devonshire 
Station, a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sergeant didn't know the answer, so he transferred me back to one of the 
detectives," Sheldon said. "The detective told me to take the pistol, unload 
it, put it in my trunk and drive to the station. He said someone would take 
care of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But "I couldn't do it that day because he was the only one there and was about 
to go home himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But when he tried again with another detective later, "she said, 'Oh, no. We 
don't do that. That's an old procedure we haven't done in years. You have to go 
to a gun shop.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing on, Sheldon called Sherwood International Export Corp., because it 
had the biggest gun shop ad in the Yellow Pages. "We don't know anything about 
that," an employee told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the police. "I thought the detective at Devonshire had been confused, 
so this time I called the Van Nuys Station," he said. New station, same story: 
"Call a gun shop." 
</P>
<P>
 All that got him was half a dozen gun shop employees who told him things like: 
"We don't know what it is, and we don't do it." One told him -- correctly -- 
that there is no requirement to register his firearms, but by this time, 
Sheldon was in no mood to believe anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 With what he describes as a "sense of building frustration," Sheldon asked the 
Los Angeles city attorney's office, which referred him to the district 
attorney's office, where an investigator "told me he was unaware of the 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dumbfounded that there seemed to be no structure," he said. "They 
license your car, they license your dog. I didn't understand. I guess the 
credit must go to the NRA for stopping any attempt to register guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he called The Times. And according to the state Department of 
Justice, this is his answer: 
</P>
<P>
 Those who own handguns legally acquired in any way before 1991 are not 
required to register them. Handgun purchases from gun shops for some years 
before that were recorded in Sacramento, but sales between private parties were 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, however, handgun sales between private citizens must be brokered 
by a registered gun dealer, who sends the paperwork to Sacramento just as if it 
were a new gun being purchased from a shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The department checks to see if the purchaser has a criminal history, is under 
a judicial restraining order or has been declared mentally ill. If not, 
purchasers can take delivery in 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 That paperwork is retained in a computer, forming a partial record of handgun 
ownership that apparently bolsters a widespread misimpression that handguns 
must be "registered" in California. In actuality, there is only the 
purchase-approval process with many exceptions -- such as all private party 
sales before 1991, guns brought in from other states by new residents, and 
inherited guns bought before purchase conditions were initially imposed on new 
handgun sales in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the case of shotguns and rifles, even the new purchase paperwork is 
destroyed after the 15-day clearance period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon hopes that at least the story of his fruitless search "helps some 
other people who are sitting around with a gun, wondering what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In short: nothing. Registering a legally owned gun is sort of like asking for 
a goldfish license -- in the end, there is no machinery to administer a 
nonexistent requirement.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: YULE TREES TO COME WITH FIRE WARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to several Christmas tree fires last month, the Los Angeles City 
Council voted Tuesday to require all Christmas tree vendors in the city to 
issue pamphlets warning buyers about the fire dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire warnings were suggested by San Fernando Valley Councilman Richard 
Alarcon after a Christmas tree fire ignited a house blaze in Sylmar on Jan. 30, 
killing a 3-year-old boy and injuring his mother and 4-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 14 to 0 to instruct the Fire Department to draft a pamphlet 
that Christmas tree vendors can distribute to buyers, warning them about fire 
dangers and providing tips on how to reduce the chances of a house fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning pamphlets, which will be available in English and Spanish, will be 
required as part of a tree vendor's permit to sell Christmas trees in the city. 
The vendors will pay for the cost of the pamphlet copies, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also instructed the Fire Department to launch a public service 
campaign, including the use of public access television, to educate residents 
about the fire dangers of Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon pointed out that many Catholics keep their trees up until the Epiphany 
of the Lord, a religious feast holiday celebrated Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department was instructed to return within 60 days to the council's 
Public Safety Committee with a Christmas tree safety report, explaining how the 
fire warning program will work. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; MAN ESCAPES SERIOUS INJURY IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A "very lucky" 18-year-old Pacoima man escaped serious injury Monday when a 
bullet lodged between his skull and forehead during an assault, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Javier Beltran Martinez was shot once by an unknown gunman Monday as 
he pulled his car into a driveway, said Sgt. Joe Flores of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several rounds were fired at the victim at close range, but only one bullet 
hit him in the forehead, and it didn't penetrate the skull," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred as the victim stepped from his car on Adelphia Avenue 
shortly after 6 p.m., Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores and an unidentified official at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills described the victim as a very lucky man. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center where he was treated for a 
single gunshot wound. He was released Monday night, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no motive for the shooting and no one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a clear-cut case like a gang shooting," Flores said. CHIP JOHNSON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; MAN 
CONVICTED OF MURDER OF CABBIE DURING ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood man was convicted Tuesday of murdering a taxi driver in 1991 as 
the cabbie tried to run away after his cab was commandeered. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury also found Kenneth Eugene Redman, 23, guilty of the 
special circumstance of murder during a robbery, which makes him eligible for 
the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabbie, Titus Imaku, 35, was shot several times and his body was dumped in 
an alley a mile from his cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Nigeria and the father of two, Imaku was a driver for Taxi Systems in 
Long Beach and an engineering student at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He had attended Compton College and had a business degree from Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, but "he couldn't find a job," Imaku's wife, Deborah, recalled 
after the slaying. "He decided to drive the taxi because he needed to support 
his family." 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty phase of the trial was scheduled to start today. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Robert Grace has said he will seek the death penalty.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FUND OKD 
TO AID VICTIMS OF EQUITY FRAUD SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved establishment of 
a $250,000 loan fund to aid homeowners threatened with the loss of their homes 
because of equity fraud scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Loans expected to average $5,000 will be made to low-income homeowners who 
unwittingly placed title to their property in jeopardy to obtain 
credit.Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas proposed the program, which will use 
federal funds for the loans and be administered by three minority-owned 
financial institutions -- Broadway Federal Savings Bank, Family Savings and 
Founders National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said disreputable lenders have victimized many of his 
constituents who are in financial stress. The borrowers accept loans at 
exorbitant rates, not realizing that that they can lose their homes if they 
default. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolving loan fund, called the Home Equity Fraud Intervention Program, 
was created by representatives of the Legal Aid Foundation, the Los Angeles 
Housing Authority and Communities for Accountable Reinvestment. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients will have two years to repay the loans.

COURTHOUSES TO BE BUILT; PLANS FOR 6 OTHERS PUT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a shortage of funds for courthouse construction, Los Angeles County 
supervisors agreed Tuesday to indefinitely postpone six projects on which they 
have already spent millions of dollars and to complete only two buildings -- 
one in Chatsworth and the other near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote came despite the objections of Supervisor Mike Antonovich and 
local judges and attorneys, who had lobbied for an $80-million courthouse in 
the Antelope Valley to replace a severely crowded facility there.The decision 
also displeased residents of Chatsworth, who have sued the county to block 
construction of a $51.5-million facility in the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the courthouses in Chatsworth and in Westchester near LAX is 
scheduled to begin in September and be completed in two years.

 Johnson, who works in a small, all-male fire station in Lake Los Angeles, said 
the policy violates his freedom to read his favorite publication. But Tammy 
Bruce, president of the Los Angeles NOW chapter, argues that firefighters can 
read whatever they want when they are not in the workplace. A hearing has been 
postponed until Jan. 24.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PANEL 
ENDORSES PLAN TO AID IN FIGHTING BRUSH FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to be better prepared for the next brush fire emergency, a committee 
of the Los Angeles City Council has endorsed a plan to increase city Fire 
Department funding and require that new swimming pools include hookups for fire 
hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-point plan was submitted to the Public Safety Committee by Fire Chief 
Donald O. Manning in response to a request by Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which would cost $11.6 million, will be considered next week by the 
council's Budget and Finance Committee. Manning's report calls for, among other 
things, restoration of $487,000 to the Fire Department's budget to help inspect 
properties for brush clearance requirements, $1.35 million to provide emergency 
training for firefighters and $9.8 million to replace antiquated equipment.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: COUNCIL OKS PLAN FOR POLICE TRUST FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a plan Tuesday to establish a trust fund 
for private donations given to police in the northwest San Fernando Valley 
district of Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who suggested that the city establish the fund, has already promised 
to donate $16,000 to the account to help police pay for overtime, new equipment 
or other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's contribution comes, in part, from $11,000 in campaign contributions 
that the city's Ethics Commission ordered the councilman to repay to the city. 
Bernson argued that he received the money three years ago without knowing that 
it was funneled to him illegally and said he would instead donate the 
contributions to police in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission said Bernson's plan to donate the $11,000 to police 
satisfies its request to repay the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The other $5,000 that Bernson has pledged was money that he was scheduled to 
receive from a 5% pay raise that he and other elected city officials were 
scheduled to get Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said that they liked Bernson's idea for a trust fund and 
that they may ask the city attorney to establish similar accounts for police in 
other districts. HUGO MARTIN

DWP CHIEF ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT; UTILITIES: DAN WATERS' THREE YEARS AS GENERAL 
MANAGER WERE COMPLICATED BY DROUGHT AND A LABOR STRIKE. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO 
LEAVE BEFORE THE AGENCY GETS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SOLVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Dan Waters, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
announced Tuesday that he will retire from the utility at the end of the month, 
ending a three-year tenure marked by a long drought, a nine-day strike and a 
much-debated rate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, a 32-year DWP employee who took over the utility in fall, 1990, said 
he decided in August that he would retire sometime this spring. He has been 
eligible to retire for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said he wanted to retire before the utility gets deeply involved in 
addressing looming financial challenges. Increased competition and Mayor 
Richard Riordan's attempt tap into the DWP treasury to pay for police means the 
utility must become a more efficient operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said last September's strike, and criticism of DWP management spending 
during the walkout, reinforced his decision to leave. Waters was rebuked by the 
City Council for spending several hundred thousand dollars on meals for 
management personnel who filled in for striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
 He will probably be replaced by an interim manager from within the DWP while a 
nationwide search is conducted for a permanent general manager, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, a frequent critic of DWP spending, said he intends to 
push for a change in the City Charter to eliminate a requirement that the head 
of the DWP be an engineer. Wachs said the requirement limits the applicant 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DWP needs to be overhauled from top to bottom," he said. "It needs to be 
lean instead of mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters earns $165,000 a year. The only city employees earning more are Fire 
Chief Don Manning and Administrative Officer Keith Comrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said he plans to take a couple of months off, go skiing and consider 
positions in private industry, where he said the compensation is far higher. 
His DWP pension will pay him about $110,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The general manager said he attempted to make customer service a priority and 
establish an environmental agenda for the Water and Power system. The DWP 
became the first municipal utility in the country to implement an air-quality 
program to lower carbon dioxide emissions from its generators. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout his tenure, Waters had to fend off criticism of his agency. He 
struggled through a drought that led to water rationing at the same time the 
utility was pushing a rate increase. Then came the longest strike in DWP 
history and an audit of management's spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in the public sector today, you're in a fishbowl," Waters said. 
"Anything you do is subject to criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Riordan's appointees to the DWP Commission, Dennis Tito, said Waters' 
retirement was probably prompted by a variety of factors, ranging from frequent 
criticism in the media to the difficult financial challenges that will face 
management in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while you just get sick and tired of people criticizing you," Tito 
said. "I also think a lot of it had to do with where he was in his life."

GATES DEFENDS SIS UNIT IN MCDONALD'S HOLDUP; COURTS: TESTIFYING IN $1-MILLION 
LAWSUIT, FORMER POLICE CHIEF SAYS INTERVENTION MIGHT HAVE PUT THE RESTAURANT 
MANAGER'S LIFE IN DANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates on Tuesday resolutely defended 
a special police surveillance unit for waiting outside a McDonald's for more 
than 30 minutes while its manager was held inside at gunpoint during a 1990 
robbery -- saying that citizens are misled by the ease with which police defeat 
criminals on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Any other action could have increased the danger to the manager, Gates 
testified in a Glendale Superior Court trial in which the manager is suing the 
city, alleging that the officers failed in their responsibility to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he felt great sympathy for the manager, Robbin L. Cox, but 
suggested that her lawsuit was applying a television standard of what police 
are capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People watch television too much and don't know how difficult this is," Gates 
said, referring to the work of the Special Investigations Section, which 
follows suspected dangerous felons in hopes of catching them committing a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said surveillance is an extremely complicated and iffy business and that 
for the officers to burst into the restaurant after the four men broke in could 
have precipitated a shootout in which Cox would have been killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's attorney, Christopher Hiddleson, has said his client will ask for $1 
million in damages from the city and the Police Department for failing to try 
to rescue Cox, whom the robbers had blindfolded and threatened to kill if she 
did not open the restaurant safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit moved in when the robbers left the restaurant on Foothill Boulevard 
in Sunland. Authorities say a gunfight broke out and three of the four robbers 
were killed. The fourth man, who was wounded, is serving a 17-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson called Gates to testify on police procedure and about Gates' actions 
in reviewing the official investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson asked Gates to read two policies from the LAPD Manual. One defined 
"reverence for human life" as the primary consideration in tactics, and the 
other declared the arrest of the perpetrator of a crime "subordinate to the 
protection of life." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gates insisted that consideration for Cox's safety guided the unit 
leader, Detective Brian Davis, in his decision to hold the SIS team outside the 
restaurant, and to order that uniformed officers responding to Cox's call to 
911 for help be ordered away from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the undercover surveillance team dress in scruffy civilian clothes 
and could "look like the suspects" to a uniformed officer, possibly leading to 
an unpredictable confrontation between the two police groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiddleson asked whether surveillance officers were not supposed to keep the 
suspects in sight at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that simple," Gates said. "It's not as you see in TV where they 
follow people closely. It's very complex. Your cover can be blown very easily. 
You often have to stay in a place where you can't see everything that is going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do your best without trying to totally blow the operation. Once you blow 
the operation, the suspects are gone. You can't arrest them. Your opportunity 
to take them off the street has been lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The SIS has already lost one suit in the widely publicized McDonald's case. A 
federal court jury found that the officers acted without cause when they fired 
on the robbers, awarding $44,000 in damages to the families of the dead men and 
the survivor. Almost half of that award was levied against Gates personally, 
who the jury said condoned the use of excessive force in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, a retired FBI agent called as Hiddleson's final witness 
contradicted Gates. James P. Graham, who said he has preformed surveillance 
many times in his 22 years with the agency, testified that the police should 
have telephoned Cox inside to warn her, and later should have declared a 
hostage situation to bring in the full force of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also said the surveillance leader could easily have posted an officer 
behind a wall on the west side of the restaurant where the robbers entered. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have broken off a tree branch to hide behind while they looked over 
the wall, Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said they expect the trial to go to the jury today.

POLICE IDENTIFY 2 AS SUSPECTS IN SLAYING OF OFFICER; LAW ENFORCEMENT: BOTH MEN 
RESEMBLE WITNESSES' DESCRIPTIONS AND BOTH WERE FUGITIVES AT TIME OF KILLING. 
THE GUNMAN'S CAR IS BELIEVED TO BE A RARE DAIHATSU CHARADE. 
</P>

<P>
 Detectives on Tuesday identified two men as suspects in the Dec. 27 slaying of 
Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz during a seemingly routine traffic 
stop and said the car used by the killer is a relatively rare Daihatsu Charade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, said investigators are seeking Ching Ming Tao, 37, and Jong Pal 
Kim, 30, because both resemble witnesses' descriptions, both were fugitives 
when Ganz was shot and both are thought to be willing to fire on a police 
officer to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are considered armed and dangerous," Stoneman said. "We believe they had 
a motive to commit another violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department did not reveal evidence linking Tao or Kim directly 
to the killing of Ganz, a crime that investigators believe was committed by 
just one man. 
</P>
<P>
 Tao, who has relatives in West Covina and Monterey Park, has been wanted by 
Los Angeles police since last year on suspicion of possession of a machine gun 
and related counts, Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a survivalist type -- someone who could disappear into the jungle and 
survive just fine," the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, a former Gardena resident, is wanted in the 1989 slaying of his 
girlfriend in the Wilshire District. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a fugitive since then," Stoneman said. "Because he may have crossed 
a state line, the FBI is looking for him too." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman said the names of Tao and Kim were culled from hundreds of tips that 
investigators received in the aftermath of the Ganz shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be specific about what was said, but (one of the calls) led us to 
discover that Tao was wanted and considered to be armed . . . and an extreme 
danger to a police officer," Stoneman said. "The other guy was brought to our 
attention in the same manner. Someone identified him as a person we might want 
to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz, 29, a Garden Grove resident, was working on holiday drunk-driving 
abatement patrol when he used his patrol car loudspeaker in stopping a vehicle 
in front of the Manhattan Village shopping mall about 11 p.m. for a traffic 
violation. With Ganz in his patrol car was his 13-year-old nephew, who was 
participating in a department-sponsored ride-along program. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say that when Ganz got out, the suspect opened fire. Ganz 
retreated behind his patrol car and the suspect followed him, firing several 
more shots. Ganz, who was struck three times, pulled his pistol but did not 
return fire. Detectives say the gunman pointed his semiautomatic pistol at the 
13-year-old but did not pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 As the suspect sped away in a small car, the boy called for help on the radio 
of the patrol car. Ganz was pronounced dead about 45 minutes later at the 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and another witness provided descriptions of the suspect -- a somewhat 
heavyset Asian man in his 30s -- that could fit Tao or Kim, Stoneman said. The 
sergeant said there is a strong resemblance between photographs of Tao and a 
composite drawing based on the descriptions provided by the two witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman said a surveillance camera outside a bank in the shopping mall 
provided pictures of the suspect's car that have led detectives to identify it 
as a 1988 to 1992 Daihatsu Charade, a small Japanese vehicle no longer marketed 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department said that because relatively few Charades were sold 
in this country, investigators are contacting everyone known to have one in an 
attempt to identify the car used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were none reported stolen, none abandoned and none found," Stoneman 
said. "We're using the process of elimination."

BILL BOYARSKY: TASK FORCE REPORT DESCRIBES DECLINE OF A WATER GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday was an important day in the long story of how the tangled, bitter and 
occasionally bloody politics of water has shaped California. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as exciting as May 21, 1924, when a band of rebellious Owens Valley men 
stole three boxes of dynamite and blew a hole in the aqueduct carrying water 
from the valley to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's event was in the hands of people who wore suits rather than the 
informal attire of Owens Valley ranchers. They were members of a task force 
appointed to propose ways to modernize the giant 65-year-old Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, which supplies water to Ventura, Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Their report, released Tuesday, is hard reading. I got a lot more enjoyment 
from William H. Kahrl's account of the violent 1924 water war in his excellent 
book "Water and Power." But when a 21st-Century historian writes a book about 
water, the task force's report will be part of it, for it shows the role 
politics plays in bringing water to our homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District has been a political power in California since 
it began in 1928. It was conceived by the Southern California business and 
political establishment and the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, William Mulholland, who designed and built the Owens Valley 
aqueduct. All were obsessed with a fear that our semiarid Southland plain, upon 
which they had staked their fortunes, would run out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD imported water from the Colorado River and, beginning in the 1960s, 
from the distant reaches of Northern California. Backed by big businesses and 
their powerful lobbyists, Metropolitan was a dominant force in the state 
Capitol. If the Met needed help with a bill in the Legislature, it quietly 
called on a few campaign- contributing businesses, whose CEOs or lobbyists 
pounded recalcitrant lawmakers into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mike Gage became chairman of the Met 
board in January, 1993, he realized those days were long past. Before he moved 
to L.A., Gage had been an assemblyman in Northern California. He had seen 
Northern California interests, led by environmentalists, amass enough power and 
smarts to block Southern California's once-unimpeded drive for ever more water. 
Once on the Met's board, Gage felt that the old agency must become tougher, 
leaner and quicker or it would be overwhelmed in the battle for California's 
increasingly scarce resources. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned to Nelson Rising, an attorney, land developer and high-powered 
back-room political operator. Rising is senior partner in Maguire Thomas 
Partners, which is building the big Playa Vista residential and commercial 
development near Marina del Rey. Like the developers of old, Maguire Thomas 
needs water. With Rising as chairman, a task force of 27 began studying ways of 
modernizing the MWD for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 In making its proposals, the task force noted the new realities. The MWD is 
losing to more powerful rivals. The state is giving agriculture a greater share 
of water imported from Northern California. Environmentalists may force further 
reductions from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, an important Southern 
California water resource. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, MWD was extremely powerful, but the rise of new water policy 
interest groups has diluted its impact, often to the point where it cannot 
count on support from state and federal officials representing its member 
constituencies," the report said. "The MWD is not seen as an effective 
coalition builder, often ignoring opportunities to build new alliances and 
sometimes alienating old allies. Agricultural leaders are particularly bitter. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The task force report concluded that the MWD needs to become the leader of a 
powerful regional coalition that will have clout in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the Met must sharpen up management at home. The task force said 
that the MWD engineers have spent at least $200 million and begun "blasting 
apart a mountain" for the proposed Domenigoni Reservoir in Riverside County 
without having a top level management review committee determine whether such a 
big project is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it should try to revive its old political power. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD, the report said, should rebuild its alliance with the Central Valley's 
agribusiness, which wields immense power in Sacramento because of campaign 
contributions to Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators. Metropolitan should also 
"add an additional high-level, high-profile staff person in Sacramento" and 
maybe in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the route from the river to the water tap still runs through 
the political landscape.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL OKS HIKES IN ANIMAL LICENSE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pet owners in Glendale will have to pay higher animal license fees and fines 
next month -- the first such hike in eight years, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale City Council voted unanimously to approve the increases proposed 
by Police Chief James E. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fail to obtain a dog license from the city will have to pay a $20 
fine, a sharp jump from the present fine of $3. Instead of paying $7.50 a year 
for a license for neutered dogs, owners will pay the new annual fee of $10. 
Licenses for dogs that are not neutered will jump from $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes include the onetime horse license charge, which will go from $25 
to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the police chief, which was reviewed by council members, showed 
that the city could generate $25,000 a year in additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 No figures were available Tuesday on how many licenses have been issued. But 
Glendale Humane Society officials said as many as 1,200 unlicensed dogs are out 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say half of our contacts would turn up an unlicensed dog," said Mike 
Peatrowsky, director of the Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, council members approved spending $210,000 for 12 new police 
patrol vehicles. The cars will replace 12 older vehicles, some with as many as 
100,000 miles on them, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said new cars are necessary for officer safety. The department has a total 
of 40 patrol units. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real issue to me was . . . the welfare of my officers as they are doing 
their duty," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police plan to sell the older vehicles and hope to raise about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also authorized city staff to begin negotiations with a developer 
proposing to borrow $1.4 million from the city to renovate a city-owned parking 
structure as part of the Glendale Fashion Center renovation project. TOMMY LI

 When a Korean American student told his parents that youths at his San 
Fernando Valley high school were bullying him to buy and sell drugs, the 
worried parents turned not to the school's principal but to Soung Ae Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, president of the Valley Korean Parents Assn., understands the discomfort 
immigrant parents often have in dealing with the unfamiliar American education 
system, especially if they are not confident in their English skills. The 
mother of two called the principal herself and helped smooth the path for the 
student's eventual transfer to another school. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, 45, of Chatsworth formed the parents association nearly four years ago 
with the original goal of recruiting more Korean American parents as volunteers 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District. At the time, she was a community 
representative in the district's Volunteer and Tutorial Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the association's purpose has broadened to include disseminating 
information about school policies and programs to Korean American parents, 
serving as a go-between when problems arise, and lobbying school officials to 
be more sensitive to the needs of Korean students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Oh, a Granada Hills parent, said she has benefited from the 
association's monthly seminars, which have covered everything from college 
applications to gang and drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get some information that you really don't know," said Oh, who added 
that she has learned about magnet schools and how students should prepare for 
SAT tests at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its pluralistic name, the organization is virtually a one-woman 
operation run by Kim, a member of the district's Asian Pacific American 
Education Commission and whose married name is Rubin. In addition to helping 
families with specific problems, Kim coordinates the seminars and has taken it 
upon herself to speak with school officials about being more sensitive to the 
needs of Korean students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals "should give Korean parents more of a chance to be involved in a 
school activity," Kim said, and the district should hire more bilingual 
teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, for their part, should overcome their shyness around mainstream 
Americans and volunteer in their child's school, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's next seminar will be about magnet schools, and will be held 
at the United Korean Methodist Church, 10408 Balboa Blvd. in Granada Hills. KAY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER CAFE-BILLIARD HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood man has applied to open the first combination cafe and 
billiard hall in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Grigor Ter-Nersesian has requested a conditional-use permit to open a 
5,300-square-foot hall in the 30800 block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard.The City 
Council will hold a hearing on the request at 7:30 tonight at City Hall, 4373 
Park Terrace Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Nersesian tried to open a billiard hall in Reseda last August but was 
denied a permit because of a temporary ban on new billiard businesses in that 
area. Ter-Nersesian said his new efforts will bring a "high-class operation" to 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be like a community thing to do," he said. "People will meet 
someone there, have lunch, play pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Nersesian said he plans to keep the cafe open from about 10 a.m. to 10 
p.m. The menu will feature sandwiches.  
</P>
<P>
 Ter-Nersesian said he has not yet decided whether to sell alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Ken Rufener said that if approved, Ter-Nersesian's business 
would be the first of its kind in the city. A residential neighborhood is 
nearby, and Rufener said some opposition is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city staff has recommended approval for the permit with some 
conditions, and Rufener said he is keeping an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless I hear something at the hearing that I'm not aware of now, I'm in 
favor of it," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an excellent gathering place for young people and we need that."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; RECLAIMED WATER LINE WILL BE INSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Groundbreaking is scheduled today on a project to install a 1,600-foot-long, 
24-inch-wide reclaimed water pipeline under the Scholl Canyon Golf Course, 
which is built on a former landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the water pipe and a pipe meant to carry methane gas produced by 
decomposition at the former landfill will be installed by ARB Inc. in a process 
that is expected to take about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-hole course was shut down in 1989 because leaking gas from the 
decomposition of trash reached hazardous levels. City officials have since 
resolved the problem by covering the old landfill with more dirt, installing a 
pipe system to collect methane and using the gas to generate power to produce 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new 18-hole course is being developed on the site. The 
$3.6-million course will cover 56 acres of the 410-acre former landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Froelich, the city's water services administrator, said the pipeline will 
stretch across the natural canyon portion of the golf course, not the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be in the green area," he said. "It will be in a slope area" of 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the pipeline is in place, it will be connected to the course's sprinkler 
system, said Michael Hopkins, public service director. The southern stretch 
would hook up with a two-mile pipeline that currently serves Forest Lawn 
Memorial-Park in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern end would hook up with a pipe serving Pasadena. The water would 
come from the Los Angeles-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant near the Los Angeles 
River, south of Colorado Street. TOMMY LI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SUSPECTS SOUGHT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>

<P>
 Glendale police on Tuesday said they were seeking as many as six suspects in a 
drive-by shooting that wounded a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was shot Monday on North Kenilworth Avenue near Hoover High School and 
Toll Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, the assailants were in two cars, a white Toyota Camry 
and a white Chevrolet Camaro or El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger in one of the vehicles pointed a small, black handgun at a group 
of teen-agers who had gathered on the sidewalk and fired three times, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Lief Nicolaisen said the shooting was probably gang-related. 
The victim, whose name was not released, was shot in the abdomen. He was 
treated at Thompson Memorial Medical Center in Burbank, according to police 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaisen said the boy underwent surgery Monday night and was listed in 
stable condition at that time. He declined to say whether the victim remained 
hospitalized Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one had been arrested as of Tuesday afternoon. Police are looking for the 
two suspect vehicles and two to six youths, ages 16 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's shooting was the second gang-related incident this month near a 
Glendale high school, police said. Last Tuesday, members of a different gang 
fired shots at a Glendale High student who was across the street from campus 
during lunch. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Tuesday stepped up patrols around those two campuses, Nicolaisen 
said. TOMMY LI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; MATH TUTOR PROGRAM MAY BE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school math tutoring program sponsored by the city of Calabasas may be 
extended beyond its four-week trial period due to its popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, begun Jan. 3 for students who want help in math before midterm 
exams at the end of the month, most likely will be offered several times each 
semester, said Greg Johnson, director of the Calabasas Community Services 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents have been very enthusiastic about this, of course," Johnson said. 
"But the kids have been really good about it too. They know when they need 
help, especially in math." 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 students at Calabasas High School enrolled in the trial program, 
which costs $60 for eight, twice-weekly sessions. The classes are offered 
between 3 and 4 p.m., and are limited to no more than six students for each 
instructor, Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Classes offered include pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II and Geometry. 
Seminar topics may be expanded to include study skills, science and other 
subjects, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes are a few of more than 200 offered by the two-year-old city, 
Johnson said. Others courses include karate, sign language, cartooning, 
horseback riding, computers, music, foreign languages and roller-blading.

RIORDAN, CHICK SCRAMBLE TO SAVE WARNER RIDGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As new details of the apparent collapse of the San Fernando Valley's massive 
Warner Ridge office project emerged Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
and Councilwoman Laura Chick scrambled to keep one of the Valley's major 
employers from leaving and taking about 1,500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, costly lawsuit and eight years of Byzantine maneuverings through 
the City Hall bureaucracy, groundbreaking had seemed imminent for the 
$100-million, 690,000-square-foot complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project began unraveling last week when the New York-based bank that 
was expected to provide financing notified the developers, Warner Ridge 
Partners, that it was pulling out. After learning that the bank, Morgan 
Guaranty Trust, was not participating in the project, 20th Century Industries, 
the firm that was expected to be its major tenant, decided not to go through 
with its plans to lease quarters in Warner Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake in the looming collapse of the project are the possible loss of the 
jobs in the West Valley and extra funds for a cash-strapped community college 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the political reputations of Riordan and Chick could be tarnished 
if the deal falls through. Both campaigned last spring on promises to 
revitalize the area's lagging economy and to turn around the city's reputation 
as being unfriendly to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers were stunned by Morgan Guaranty's decision not to finance the 
project. The bank reportedly loaned the real estate partnership $50 million to 
$60 million to buy the land and had footed the bills for a suit filed against 
the city of Los Angeles by the developers. The city, led by then-Councilwoman 
Joy Picus, had sought to block the project through a zoning change that was 
later declared illegal in a series of court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Guaranty officials declined Tuesday to comment publicly on their 
decision, as did the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Spound, a Warner Ridge Partners official, appealed to 20th Century to 
provide developers with the necessary construction funds in exchange for an 
equity stake in the project, according to sources familiar with the situation. 
But 20th Century's board of directors rejected the proposal, leaving Spound 
without financing or a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Riordan's interest in salvaging the Woodland Hills project and 
preventing 20th Century's possible departure was complicated because the 
mayor's former law firm, Riordan & McKinzie, represented Morgan Guaranty Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor planned to meet with the city attorney's office to see if his 
involvement would constitute a conflict of interest. "If it's legal, we want to 
be involved," said Annette Castro, the mayor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who represents the West Valley, called Riordan and 20th Century 
President James O. Curley on Tuesday in an attempt to keep the company in the 
city. "That's my No. 1 priority," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley, Chick said, was "unfortunately oblique" about the company's plans. "I 
think they're kind of at square one. But I certainly didn't get any 
reassurances or concrete responses." 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the Warner Ridge situation predicted that it would take 
outside mediators such as Riordan and Chick to save the project.  
</P>
<P>
 The unraveling Warner Ridge deal also affects Pierce College in Woodland 
Hills, which had counted on $1 million in cash in exchange for accepting 
425,000 cubic yards of dirt from the planned development.

RIORDAN APPOINTS ACTIVIST AS 2ND VALLEY LIAISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan on Tuesday announced the appointment of Georgia Mercer, 
a veteran community activist from Tarzana, to fill the second of two San 
Fernando Valley liaison slots in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer was considered the front-runner for the first appointment early last 
September, but that job went to Cecilia Aguilera, a political novice and wife 
of an attorney in the mayor's downtown law firm, Riordan & McKinzie. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer and Aguilera will divide the Valley between east and west, using the 
San Diego Freeway as the boundary, Mercer said. Mercer will represent the 
middle-class, predominantly white West Valley in addition to serving as the 
mayor's expert on Jewish and women's issues citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercer, 52, has served as the president of the Los Angeles Human Relations 
Commission, was on a civil rights task force assembled by former Gov. Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr., and worked on behalf of a host of liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the fifth of nine liaison officers who will be named in the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that because there are two of us it reflects the mayor's attempt to 
focus more on the needs of the Valley," said Mercer, who assumed her duties 
Jan. 3.

CELEBRITY STATUS MADE HIM LAWSUIT TARGET, ACTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Michael J. Fox said Tuesday that he believes a woman who purchased his 
former Studio City home targeted him for a lawsuit because he is a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of came down to what I expected all along -- that a celebrity was 
targeted," Fox said in an interview from his Beverly Hills hotel room following 
closing arguments in the case Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Ader filed suit against Fox, his business manager, Robert Philpott, 
the Jon Douglas Co. and agents Bettina Linke and Marie Gray over repairs and 
landscaping to a $750,000 house she bought from the movie star, which is 
nestled in the mountains between Mulholland Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
Philpott, the Jon Douglas Co. and its agents were subsequently dismissed as 
defendants in the lawsuit, leaving Fox as the lone defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Pomerance, an attorney representing Ader, told jurors during closing 
statements that Fox "passed the buck" on the sale of the home to his 
representatives because he was busy making movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent the implications that because he was filming a movie he didn't have 
time to deal with the contract," Pomerance said. "The bottom line was he didn't 
care. It meant nothing to Fox." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomerance also alleged that Fox and his representatives "ganged up" on Ader 
because the actor's real estate agent, Bettina Linke, wanted to find a buyer 
who would offer more money for the home, which had an initial asking price of 
$1 million. Pomerance asked jurors to award Ader more than $325,000 -- which is 
nearly half the $750,000 selling price -- to replace 14 cypress trees and other 
landscaping and to repair a damaged pool, a leaky roof and a potential problem 
with the home's foundation. Ader is also seeking an undisclosed amount in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's attorney, Scott C. Haith, told jurors that his client should not be 
found liable for the cost of replacing the cypress trees because they died of 
natural causes when they were blown over in a windstorm. Haith told jurors that 
Ader failed to prove during the trial that the trees died because they were 
diseased and that Fox had knowledge of their poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has denied and continues to deny that the trees were diseased and 
were dying," Haith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haith also reminded jurors that Ader failed to produce receipts for work she 
had performed on the swimming pool and that her estimates for damages to the 
home's roof were made by a general contractor instead of a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney also said that Fox's liability is limited to the difference 
between what Ader paid for the house and its value at the close of escrow. 
Haith said Ader failed to present evidence that the property was worth less at 
the close of escrow and hence is due nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense expert testified that the house is now worth more than what Ader 
paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Florence T. Pickard also this week dismissed a 
countersuit that Fox filed alleging that Ader breached her contract by closing 
escrow two months after the agreed-upon date of Feb. 15, 1991.

DNA CALLED CRUCIAL IN RAPE TRIAL; CRIME: THE DEFENDANT FACES 28 COUNTS. THERE 
WILL BE NO MENTION OF VICTIMS' POSSIBLE EXPOSURE TO HIV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor said Tuesday that DNA evidence will be crucial in the trial of a 
prison parolee accused of being a serial rapist who attacked women late at 
night in their San Fernando Valley homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement to a Van Nuys Superior Court jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Phillip H. Rabichow said he intends to prove that defendant Monette Johnson is 
guilty of 28 counts stemming from a string of attacks in 1991 and early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said there is no question the women -- and a man who was with 
one of the women and also sexually assaulted -- were raped by an assailant 
armed with either scissors or, in one incident, a gun. Rabichow concentrated on 
the issue of identity, saying one victim clearly saw her assailant and that 
items stolen from all six victims were recovered from Johnson's Lake View 
Terrace apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from Rabichow's opening arguments was a subplot that has served as a 
point of intrigue: whether Johnson has the human immunodeficiency virus that 
causes AIDS. Several of his alleged victims have been informed they were 
exposed to HIV, but confidentiality laws prevent authorities from revealing who 
is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of seven men and five women hearing the case will never find out if 
Johnson carries the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rabichow said the jury will hear experts and scientists explain how 
evidence proves conclusively that Johnson is the rapist. He said DNA evidence 
indicates the odds are extremely remote -- at least 1 in 1 million -- that 
someone other than Johnson attacked the six women.  
</P>
<P>
 The genetic evidence, which Rabichow said is made up of the "blueprint for all 
life," is compiled when material collected after a rape is compared to the 
victim's blood and that of the suspected attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant was matched to all of the victims . . . in each and every 
case," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney M. David Houchin did not make an opening statement and he 
declined to comment on any specific charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Identity is an issue," Houchin said, offering the only insight into the 
defense case. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims testified on the first day of the trial, but they will all 
be brought to the stand. The first victim is expected to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabichow's first witnesses were people who had contact with Johnson prior to 
his arrest in January, 1992. Each person testified that Johnson spoke clearly 
and effectively, and that it appeared his hearing was normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has served time in prison for attempted extortion, is being 
assisted during his trial by hearing aids on both ears, as well as sign 
language interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at the defense table, Johnson was asked to repeat statements he 
allegedly made to his victims, including "Where is your money?" and "Ever done 
this before?" 
</P>
<P>
 His voice in court was slurred and mumbling, in contrast to witnesses who said 
he was articulate and well-spoken as recently as two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Gary Barthelmess testified he had a January, 
1992, telephone conversation with Johnson, and said that at that time Johnson 
communicated clearly. But, according to Barthelmess, the defendant exhibited 
what appeared to be "a severe speech impediment" only one month later during a 
lineup in front of several victims.

WOMAN GETS PROBATION FOR STEALING DAUGHTER; COURTS: CATHERINE THOMAS IS ORDERED 
TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR HER ROLE IN THE BITTER CUSTODY BATTLE OVER 
COURTNEY THOMAS, 5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman convicted of stealing her own child from the legal father was 
sentenced Tuesday to three years probation, ending another chapter in the 
bizarre custody battle over 5-year-old Courtney Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel also ordered the mother, 46-year-old 
Catherine F. Thomas of Van Nuys, to perform 100 hours of community service and 
obey the terms of a family court order that revoked all her parental rights, 
including visits, and awarded sole custody to Kevin Thomas of Van Nuys, a 
former family friend who changed his name to match the girl's. Thomas has no 
blood ties to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing Tuesday was part of a plea bargain designed to keep Catherine 
Thomas out of jail for the sake of her child, said attorneys for the 
prosecution and defense. Accused of absconding with Courtney last July 29 
during a monitored visit, Thomas on Nov. 22 pleaded no contest to a charge of 
felony child stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time Thomas was charged with illegally fleeing with the girl 
during the bitter custody dispute, and she could have received as much as three 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want a protracted trial with the child coming out the loser," Deputy 
District Atty. Linda Acaldo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Thomas is scheduled to appear in court again Feb. 18 for a hearing 
on whether she should pay $15,000 in restitution to Kevin Thomas, who was 
reunited with Courtney in September after the fugitive mother and child were 
seized in a Pittsburgh train station. Missing about seven weeks, they were 
recognized by another traveler the morning after a news show on their case had 
been nationally televised. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Thomas said Tuesday he was satisfied with the sentence. "I did not want 
her jailed. I didn't see how that could serve any purpose whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he wants Courtney to see her mother, as long as security measures 
are taken to prevent another abduction. Courtney, who suffers from several 
congenital birth defects, is back in school, has been receiving counseling, and 
includes her mother and two half-brothers in her prayers each night, Kevin 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Catherine Thomas said Tuesday they have been trying to arrange 
for visitation but that Kevin Thomas and his lawyer have insisted on the 
presence of $35-an-hour private security guards they say their client cannot 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we come up with won't be good enough for him," said David S. 
Kestenbaum, one of three attorneys who have been representing the mother for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over how to arrange for visits between the mother and daughter -- 
who have not seen each other since they returned from Pittsburgh in September 
-- is but the latest complication in the 2 1/2-year-old custody case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Thomas, an openly gay bill collector, says he and Catherine Thomas, a 
single mother of three, agreed to raise Courtney together and that the girl has 
considered him her father since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catherine Thomas says Kevin has exaggerated his role as a friend and 
frequent baby-sitter and managed to legally steal her daughter from her. She 
still hopes to appeal the family court decision that declared Kevin Thomas 
legal father of Courtney, but may not have the money to cover the legal costs, 
her attorneys said.

BOARD POSTPONES 6 PLANNED COURTHOUSES; BUILDING: SUPERVISORS VOTE TO COMPLETE 
ONLY THE CHATSWORTH FACILITY AND ONE NEAR LAX. THE ANTELOPE VALLEY WILL RECEIVE 
FUNDS TO RENT SPACE. 
</P>

 Faced with a shortage of funds for courthouse construction, Los Angeles County 
supervisors agreed Tuesday to indefinitely postpone six projects on which they 
already have spent millions of dollars and to complete only two buildings -- 
one in Chatsworth and the other near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 decision came despite the objections of Supervisor Mike Antonovich and 
local judges and attorneys, who had lobbied heavily for an $80-million 
courthouse in the Antelope Valley to replace a severely crowded facility there. 
The decision also displeased residents of Chatsworth, who have sued the county 
to block construction of a $51.5-million facility in the western San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the courthouses in Chatsworth and Westchester near LAX is 
scheduled to begin in September and be completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action indefinitely postpones construction of six proposed 
courthouses that already have cost the county $16 million in land acquisition, 
design and other costs. They are located in Lancaster, North Hollywood, 
Pasadena, West Los Angeles, South Bay and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other projects in southeast Los Angeles and Long Beach that have cost the 
county nothing to date were also delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stop-gap measure, the county will lease space for traffic cases and other 
non-criminal matters to free up courtrooms in the Antelope Valley, South Bay 
and Santa Monica until there are sufficient funds to build new courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we'll be able to afford to rent two closets now," said Lancaster 
Mayor Arnie Rodio, who testified before supervisors in favor of the Antelope 
Valley courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials say they will spend up to $500,000 annually in the 
Antelope Valley, enough money to rent a commercial building for non-criminal 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse construction funds come from a designated portion of general court 
fines, court-imposed traffic school fees and parking citations. After rising 
through the late 1980s, the annual revenue for courthouse construction has been 
dropping steadily since 1989. Annual revenue fell from $25 million that year to 
$16.5 million in the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would have faced deficits of up to $312 million over a nine-year 
period if it had continued with plans to build all 10 courthouses, partly 
because over the years projected costs have gone up dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors did acknowledge the need to replace the 30-year-old Antelope 
Valley courthouse, which is so small that cases frequently are transferred at 
least 52 miles south to other facilities where courtrooms are available. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of judges representing the Los Angeles Superior and Municipal courts 
had also recommended earlier this fall that the board build the new Lancaster 
courthouse before the one in Chatsworth, because rapid growth in the Antelope 
Valley has outstripped the capacity of the existing building. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisors chose to go ahead with the projects in Chatsworth and near 
LAX instead, largely because the county has sunk about $40.2 million into those 
courthouses, compared to only about $5.8 million in the Lancaster project. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed by Chatsworth homeowners is not considered a significant 
obstacle because county attorneys have estimated that it will only cost about 
$100,000 to fight, said Chief Administrative Officer Sally R. Reed.

VALLEY BRIEFING: RAISING THE STAKES; MANY LOCAL POLITICIANS PLEDGE PAY RAISES 
FOR CITY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5% pay increase that took effect Jan. 1 proved to be a litmus test for 
elected city officials committed to solving the city's budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many felt it would be a political embarrassment to accept the raise in the 
current budget crisis. In November, the City Council voted to recommend that 
all elected officials, including themselves, refuse the raise, but left it up 
to individuals to decide how the money should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members' salaries are tied to those of Municipal Court judges, a 
consequence of the ethics reform package approved by voters in 1990, while the 
County Board of Supervisors' pay increase, under a 1953 charter amendment, is 
tied to Superior Court judges salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for officials to decide what to do with their pay increase was 
Jan. 4 Many chose to waive it, leaving the money in the account they use to run 
their offices. A few accepted the raise an donated it to charitable 
organizations. By accepting the raise,they must pay more taxes, but will reap 
the benefits of higher pensions. Donations can also be claimed as a charitable 
contribution on federal tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one official accepted the salary increase and made no public plans to 
donate it. Pay Hikes Deferred 
</P>

MAN CHARGED AGAIN UNDER BLYTHE STREET COURT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Panorama City man who was the first purported Blythe Street gang member 
charged under a sweeping injunction that bans numerous activities in a 
180-block area has again been charged with violating the court order, the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie (Speedy) Gonzales, 19, was charged in a new criminal complaint filed 
Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court after he and two others fled from officers 
of a Police Department anti-gang unit who said they observed them apparently 
selling drugs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been charged with two counts of trespassing and four counts of 
violating a court order, each of which carries the maximum misdemeanor penalty 
of six months in jail and $1,000 fine or both. The first charge was brought 
against Gonzales in late August when he was prosecuted for carrying a pager and 
a glass bottle that he allegedly threw at a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 The new case has been continued until Jan. 31, pending the outcome of a motion 
by Gonzales' attorneys to dismiss the case on the grounds that the court order 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Blythe Street gang were banned from engaging in 22 separate 
activities that are legal for most citizens, such as using pagers and cellular 
phones, in a court order obtained last February by the city attorney's office, 
which showed the activities were part of an illegal scheme.

POLICE CITE 560 FOR SPEEDING AT NORTHRIDGE INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 560 motorists have been cited for speeding since police stepped up 
enforcement at an intersection where three motorists have died since Christmas 
Day, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent incident last week, two college students were killed at 
Corbin Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard in Northridge by an allegedly drunk driver 
whose car was traveling at 80 m.p.h., more than twice the speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It solves half the problem," said Rene Monestime, the boyfriend of Barbara 
Paull of Chatsworth, one of the women killed in Thursday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see police officers giving tickets out all day, but at night, I don't see 
any patrol cars," said Monestime, who lives a few blocks from the intersection. 
"They need to be there between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. when people go from bars to 
bars, from parties to parties, or from bars to their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 After studying traffic accidents at Corbin and Roscoe over a 10-year period, 
Los Angeles Traffic Engineer Ray Wellbaum said he couldn't determine a pattern 
of when the accidents are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no more problem there at noon than 8 a.m. It's happening all around 
the clock," he said. "It makes it difficult to deal with from an engineering 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Wellbaum said that traffic signals at the intersection are working properly 
and that the type of traffic control is appropriate. He added that he will 
review police reports to see if witnesses' statements can help find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (intersection) concerns me because the number of fatalities appears 
abnormally high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police will continue to patrol along Corbin and Roscoe until they 
see a noticeable decline in speeding violations, Police Sgt. Mel Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But one or two weeks later, at some point, the speed will creep back up 
again," Cunningham said. "It will take continual enforcement to remind people 
to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are oblivious to police presence," he added. "The officers would 
point a radar gun at them and they would speed anyway."

ANOTHER RACIAL MELEE ERUPTS AT PITCHESS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 inmates clashed Tuesday at the Pitchess jail as deputies began 
re-integrating them, ending segregation imposed following a massive brawl 
Sunday between 600 African American and Latino inmates, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in Tuesday's fighting in a maximum-security dorm about 4 
p.m., said Sgt. Rich Erickson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department.Deputies used grenades filled with rubber pellets and fired rubber 
bullets to quell the fight within about 10 minutes, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl did not halt the department's plan to move African American and 
Latino inmates back into common living quarters, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, about 20 black and Latino inmates fought briefly in a 
holding cell at a courthouse in Pomona. Deputies brought that skirmish under 
control within a few minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights are a continuation of a huge melee that erupted Sunday at the 
Pitchess jail and continued throughout the night between 600 black and Latino 
inmates, leading to a one-day cooling-off period in which inmates were 
separated by race. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty people were injured in Sunday's fights, which spread to 20 dorms at the 
sprawling Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho facility in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
Inmates fought with homemade knives, wooden broom and mop handles and buckets, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24 inmates were taken to local hospitals or the hospital ward at the 
Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles. The injured inmates suffered cuts, 
head injuries and broken bones, authorities said.

LUNGREN URGES MOLESTER DATA IN LIBRARIES; CRIME: BILL WOULD MAKE NAMES AND 
DESCRIPTIONS OF OFFENDERS AVAILABLE. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OVERALL CRIME REPORT 
SHOWS MAJOR OFFENSES DOWN 3.8% IN 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren, California's top law enforcement official, on 
Tuesday called for legislation to make the names, pictures and descriptions of 
convicted child molesters available at county libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 With crime dominating the 1994 legislative session, Lungren also released a 
report showing that major crime dropped by 3.8% across California in the first 
nine months of 1993, but that homicide increased by 2.6%, based on preliminary 
reports by 49 police agencies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's crime report showed that violent crime in California dropped 4.1% 
from 1992 to 1993. Rape declined the most, falling 7.5%. It was the fifth year 
in a row that rape decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crime, including burglary and auto theft, dropped by 3.7%. At the 
same time, Lungren reported an 18.9% increase in the legal sale of guns, with 
665,229 firearms sold in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Public Safety speech, Lungren announced his support for a 
bill making the names, criminal histories, physical descriptions and photos of 
all felony child molesters available at county libraries, with updates twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a dangerous and uncertain world, parents should be empowered with the 
information they need to protect their children," Lungren told the Comstock 
Club, an organization of business people.  
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he believes parents would use the information to notify police 
whenever they see people matching the descriptions of molesters at parks or 
near schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of empowering people," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state, which has a similar law, people in Lynnwood, north of 
Seattle, torched the home of a convicted molester in July. The Washington law 
gives law enforcement authorities the right to release addresses of sex 
offenders, but does not require them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect against vigilantism, Lungren said, his proposal would not allow for 
molesters' addresses to be publicly released. But the communities and ZIP codes 
in which they live would become available. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's proposal will be in a bill being pushed by Assemblywoman Barbara 
Alby (R-Fair Oaks). The measure seeks to deter people from attacking molesters 
by adding five years to the prison terms of anyone convicted of using the 
information about molesters to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 California has 64,614 registered sex offenders, 20,236 of whom live in Los 
Angeles County. Lungren's aides did not know how many registered sex offenders 
are convicted child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other crime statistics, Lungren blamed the rise in homicide on 
juveniles, who he said are becoming increasingly violent. He called for 
legislation requiring juveniles age 16 or 17 who use firearms in a crime to be 
charged as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 He said legislation should be passed allowing prosecutors to charge those who 
illegally give a firearm to a minor with a felony, and said minors who use guns 
illegally should lose their driver's licenses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren attributed the drop in crime to increased incarceration, pointing out 
that 120,000 people are in state prisons today, compared to 24,500 in 1980. He 
noted that the Department of Corrections budget is $2.7 billion, or $85 for 
every Californian.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HANDS-ON LESSON TAKES STUDENTS BEHIND THE 
SCENES; GOVERNMENT: SANTA CLARITA YOUTHS SPEND A DAY WITH CITY WORKERS, CAPPED 
WITH A MOCK COUNCIL MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The City Council election may be three months away, but a fresh set of faces 
were in the council chambers Tuesday voting on city issues. 
</P>
<P>
 They were some of the 43 teen-agers who went behind the scenes of local 
government via Santa Clarita's Youth In Government program, shadowing city 
employees and helping them perform their daily duties. Activities culminated in 
a meeting by the student equivalent of the City Council in which they put 
knowledge from their hands-on lessons into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 During their council meeting, students proposed construction of a $212,000 
teen center along Soledad Canyon Road to help youths face problems of peer 
pressure, boredom and substance abuse. They also suggested an economic stimulus 
package that would bring an ice-skating rink to Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth In Government has doubled in size since it began four years ago at the 
suggestion of City Manager George Caravalho and Public Works Director Jeff 
Kolin, who had seen similar events in other cities. Students are selected from 
schools in the William S. Hart Union High District who apply for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only a small part of what needs to take place in terms of educating 
(teens) about what goes on in government," Caravalho said. He said he believes 
students enjoy the program because it gives them real work to perform for the 
city rather than concocted assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sief Ascar, 16, participation meant spending the morning touring Santa 
Clarita construction sites and checking buildings to make sure they were safe 
for the public, weren't wasting energy and had proper access for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fun experience," said Ascar, a junior at Hart High School who was 
paired with building and safety official Ruben Barrera for the day. "People 
should try it even if they don't want to get into government." 
</P>
<P>
 Shayna Weddle, a 16-year-old senior at Hart High School, participated for a 
second consecutive year. After working as the student solid waste coordinator 
last year, she was "promoted" to serve as public works director this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy. I didn't think I'd ever want to get involved in politics or 
government," Weddle said. "It was absolutely great. You learn all the things 
that the city has to deal with the public doesn't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students were surprised at the volume of work city employees have to do 
and council members must sift through. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an incredible amount of work they have to do in a short amount of 
time to prepare for a council meeting," said Hans Yao, a 17-year-old Saugus 
High School senior who filled the shoes of Councilman Carl Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I did was organize things," said Jon Santana, 17, a Hart High School 
senior. He accompanied Deputy City Clerk Geri Miller-Davis for the day, 
learning about election procedures and how much paperwork is necessary for a 
city to operate. "It's not easy," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell students from the city employees during the program. 
Students dressed formally, blending in with their municipal counterparts, and 
city employees appeared just as excited to participate in the program as the 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to give back to the community. We get a lot of support 
from the community for doing programs and projects and this is a chance to talk 
with the youth community," said Johnathan Skinner, coordinator of the program 
for the city. "It's a chance to show off."

DEFENDANT IN O.C. KILLING ADMITS TO MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Prosecutors won a victory Tuesday -- a first -- against one of six defendants 
in the killing of San Clemente teen-ager Steve Woods, who was speared through 
the head with paint roller rod in a crime that provoked community outrage over 
the spread of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Villalobos, 19, of San Clemente pleaded guilty to voluntary 
manslaughter and a gang-involvement sentencing enhancement in connection with 
the Oct. 15 attack at Calafia County Beach Park that resulted in the 
17-year-old's death three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for his plea during a brief, closed proceeding here before 
Municipal Judge Pamela Iles, officials dismissed a murder count and multiple 
counts of assault that were initially filed against the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos faces a state prison term of four to 14 years and remains in 
custody on $250,000 bail. A sentencing hearing was set for Jan. 25 in Orange 
County Superior Court, although it may be several more months before sentence 
is passed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother and sister expressed neither joy nor disappointment 
regarding the plea, the first guilty plea or conviction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should get life," said the victim's sister, Shellie Woods, who was 
in court. "I think they should all get life." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Woods, the mother, said she will pay especially close attention to a 
hearing today to determine whether four juveniles charged with murder and 
assault in the case will be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be very disappointed if they are not tried as adults," Kathy Woods 
said. "They didn't exactly throw pencils and crayons and lunch boxes. . . . 
We're not dealing with children." 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth defendant, 20-year-old Juan Enriquez Alcocer, was ordered last month 
to stand trial in Superior Court on all charges filed against him: one count of 
murder, 10 counts of felony assault, one felony count of throwing an object at 
a moving vehicle and a gang-involvement enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was among 10 friends in three vehicles who were pelted with rocks, beer 
cans and paint rollers by a group of 10 to 15 youths as they tried to drive 
away from a confrontation with the group at the San Clemente beach, according 
to testimony and police reports. Woods and his friends had gone to the beach 
after a San Clemente High School football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the breaking of car windows, Woods, who was a passenger in the first 
vehicle to leave the parking lot, was somehow speared through the head with the 
metal rod of a paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior at San Clemente High School fell into a coma and died Nov. 9, never 
having regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said he was pleased with the plea agreement. He 
said the evidence he could have admitted in court against Villalobos supported 
voluntary manslaughter rather than the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Other defendants in the case, all alleged members or associates of a San 
Clemente gang, still face murder charges, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each case rests on its own merits," he said. "It's a different story with 
some of these other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Paer said he could not comment on who may have actually thrown the paint 
roller rod that pierced Woods' brain. 
</P>
<P>
 In police reports, Villalobos admits to throwing a paint roller, but not at 
the vehicle that was carrying Woods. Two other paint rollers were found at the 
scene, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Michael J. Naughton couldn't be reached for comment after the 
court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous court testimony, Orange County Sheriff's Department investigators 
said an innocent question by a friend of Woods about some parties in San Juan 
Capistrano may have sparked the fatal confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the friend left the gathering to take two other people home, he pulled up 
alongside a pickup carrying several of the suspects. Thinking the pickup 
belonged to someone he knew from San Juan Capistrano, the friend called out to 
the truck, asking the occupants if they knew of any parties in San Juan 
Capistrano, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pickup did not belong to his friend and the question provoked a 
hostile response, with one of the suspects punching Woods' friend in the face, 
a detective testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend immediately went back to the gathering and told everyone to leave 
because there was trouble. As they prepared to go, several teens told police 
they saw a group of youths walking toward them, armed with a tennis racket and 
chains, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup truck containing paint rollers belonged to one of the suspects' 
fathers, who is a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the mention of San Juan Capistrano to the suspected San Clemente gang 
members could have provoked a violent response, a sheriff's gang expert 
testified. The San Clemente gang has a long, sometimes violent rivalry with a 
gang in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the juvenile suspects have said the injuries to Woods were the 
result of a "freak accident" and their clients never intended to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 All the suspects remain in custody.

ANGELS GM HERZOG OUT IN SURPRISE RESIGNATION; SPORTS: HE PROMISED WORLD SERIES 
WIN BUT TEAM FELL FAR SHORT. ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER BILL BAVASI WILL MOVE 
UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whitey Herzog dramatically appeared 2 1/2 years ago on the Angel dais, was 
pronounced savior of the organization and boldly proclaimed he'd win a World 
Series for the Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a symbolic farewell Tuesday, Herzog's voice filtered over a speaker phone 
in a cramped Angel office as he announced his retirement as general manager. He 
had been no savior. There had been no World Series, for Gene Autry or any other 
Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant general manager Bill Bavasi will replace Herzog on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, heavily criticized for being an absentee executive, departed as 
mysteriously as he arrived, saying it was time to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that it's time for me to do some of the things I want to 
do," said Herzog from Springfield, Mo. "I don't really want to be traveling all 
over and going back and forth to California or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't think Bill Bavasi was so capable of doing the job for the next 25 
years, then I don't know if I would have done this at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, 36, whose father, Buzzie, was general manager for the Angels, Dodgers 
and San Diego Padres, has been with the organization since 1981. Bavasi had 
been farm director before becoming assistant general manager in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Whitey might retire at the end of the year at the earliest," Bavasi 
said, "but for him to do it now is a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable with it, but maybe that's because I'm too dumb to know that I 
shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of Herzog's decision stunned even his closest associates. If he had 
left back in September, when he was involved in a bitter power struggle with 
team Vice President Dan O'Brien, no one would have raised an eyebrow. If he had 
resigned a year ago, fed up with the budget constraints of owner Jackie Autry, 
Gene's wife, people would have understood. 
</P>
<P>
 But to resign now, four months after receiving full authority in 
player-personnel decisions, and five weeks from the opening of spring training, 
was baffling. Herzog surrenders the final year of his $800,000 contract, and 
will be a non-salaried consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, I'm well set," Herzog said. "I couldn't spend all of the money I 
have now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite Herzog's insistence that there was no ulterior motive for his 
retirement, there were immediate rumors to the contrary. The Boston Red Sox are 
interviewing general manager candidates this week. The Kansas City Royals are 
expected to have a new owner this summer, David Glass, who is a close friend of 
Herzog's. There was talk that negotiations with relief pitcher Gregg Olson, 
which continued Tuesday, caused yet another clash with Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitey was determined that he accomplished everything he could with the 
Angels," President Richard Brown said. "If you read anything else into it, 
you're wrong. I thought he'd resign in spring training, or after the season 
started, depending on what he could accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't fault a man who's 62 to do this now." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, who was talked out of quitting last September because of his feud with 
O'Brien, appeared to be invigorated by his authoritative role after O'Brien's 
Sept. 20 firing. He declared the Angels would be aggressive in the marketplace, 
and that there would be no reason that they wouldn't contend in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there were problems that wouldn't vanish. Herzog was told the Angels 
budget needed to be slashed to about $19 million and that, instead of acquiring 
free agents, he couldn't even keep his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, taking command of negotiations, alienated several players with his 
brash, sometimes abusive style. He screamed at starting pitcher Mark Langston 
in a closed-door session. He slammed the phone in reliever Steve Frey's ear. He 
bullied agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great deal of respect and recognition among his peers," said Steve 
Comte, Frey's agent, "but the reality now is that this is a different era, and 
he hasn't crossed that bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arn Tellem, Langston's agent: "Whitey just has a different style. 
Whitey's strengths were finding and evaluating players, but not in the art of 
diplomacy dealing with lawyers and agents." 
</P>
<P>
 There was additional criticism as the Angels finished a combined 47 games out 
of first place during Herzog's two full seasons with the team. Although Herzog 
came to the Angels with the reputation of being a genius, blunders marked his 
tenure. He failed to re-sign Wally Joyner and Dave Winfield and he did enlist 
free-agent bust Gary Gaetti. He decided not to protect reliever Bryan Harvey in 
the expansion draft. There was the trade that sent fan favorite Jim Abbott, and 
the ones that brought non-producers Kelly Gruber and Von Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Whitey started to believe the accolades," said one Herzog associate, 
"and he really believed that he'd bring a World Series to the Cowboy (Autry). 
But even his magnetism wasn't going to bring him a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog came and went without even his closest friends fully understanding what 
happened. It seemed odd to them that Herzog was in town all last week, 
conducting scouting meetings and negotiating sessions, and didn't even hint at 
the possibility of leaving. It wasn't until Friday, just before departing for a 
Colorado ski trip, that he told Brown of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, figuring the decision might have been prompted more by fatigue or 
duress than anything else, told Herzog to reconsider over the weekend. Herzog 
called again, and said his decision was final. Herzog's said goodby to Bavasi 
on Monday night and Manager Buck Rodgers on Tuesday, wishing them well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as surprised as anyone by this," said Bob Harrison, Herzog's special 
assistant and close friend. "He never said a word about it. I really thought he 
would go this whole year, and then say if the club is close, or if he gets a 
bigger budget, he'd be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no indication of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers said: "I think everyone knows that Whitey has been frustrated about 
some things over the years, but I thought he'd be here past the All-Star break. 
But you know, the hardest part about this is going back to work after skiing 
and fishing. I think he just wanted to curtail the responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Herzog: "Now, I don't have any."

GATES SEEKS STATE PROBE OF SHOOTING; O.C. SHERIFF: BUT ATTORNEY GENERAL TURNS 
DOWN UNUSUAL REQUEST, AIMED AT ANSWERING CRITICISM SURROUNDING DEATH OF BLACK 
DEPUTY IN TRAINING SESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual move aimed at answering public criticism, Sheriff Brad Gates 
asked state prosecutors to conduct an independent investigation into the 
Christmas Day shooting death of an Orange County deputy, but the state turned 
him down, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office is already investigating the 
shooting, but some community groups -- most notably a coalition of black 
leaders -- have publicly questioned whether that office faces a conflict of 
interest in probing colleagues at the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said state officials see no 
evidence of such a conflict, and are "comfortable" with Dist. Atty. Michael R. 
Capizzi's office continuing to direct the probe, now in its third week. "We 
don't believe there is a conflict that prohibits the D.A. from proceeding 
independently," said attorney general's spokesman Dave Puglia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren could decide later, however, that he wants to review the district 
attorney's findings in the case to satisfy himself that local prosecutors did 
not abuse their discretion, Puglia added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he "wasn't aware that (Lungren) had made any decision. But I'm sure 
he's done whatever he thinks is appropriate, and I'll be happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the question of who should decide whether Deputy Brian Scanlan, a 
training officer, was criminally negligent when he shot Deputy Darryn Leroy 
Robins, 30, in the face and killed him about 2 p.m. Christmas Day in a parking 
lot behind a Lake Forest movie theater. Authorities say the shooting took place 
accidentally during an impromptu training exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have focused on the possibility that Robins, who was black, 
playing the part of a suspect in a car stop, may have startled the 32-year-old 
Scanlan, who is white, by reaching for a gun hidden above his car visor during 
the re-enactment, and that Scanlan then shot him. It will be at least several 
weeks before prosecutors complete their investigation and decide whether to 
file charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Lungren dated Monday, Gates said that he had "every confidence" 
in the district attorney's ability to fairly handle the case. But he 
acknowledged that his department and the district attorney do maintain a "daily 
working relationship" in county government, and he said that closeness has 
prompted some "mistrust" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to assure the community that there is a process in place upon which 
they can rely for a comprehensive and objective review of the facts of this 
case," Gates wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1985 policy established by the Orange County Board of Supervisors set down 
specific procedures for the district attorney to investigate all 
officer-involved shootings at local departments, and it is rare for local 
authorities to seek to circumvent that policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, several local officials said they knew of no precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never recall the sheriff doing something like this," said Senior Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Maury Evans. "This is the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 While black leaders said they were heartened by Gates' request, others in 
government and law enforcement took a more cynical view. 
</P>
<P>
 One prosecutor familiar with the case suggested that Gates was seeking to 
influence public opinion on the case through political posturing. He said most 
law enforcement officials realize that the attorney general would rarely if 
ever investigate an officer-involved shooting until the district attorney's 
office has completed its own review. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a weird thing for Brad Gates to do," said the prosecutor, who asked 
not to be identified. "It would be one thing for the state attorney general's 
office to be asked to review Mike Capizzi's findings. But it's another to ask 
the AG to come in at this point" before the probe is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, the senior member of the Board of Supervisors and 
its incoming chairman, said he was "a little bit shocked" by Gates' request. "I 
admit I find it somewhat difficult to understand. I assumed that when the case 
was turned over to the district attorney . . . that they had the case for 
good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he must be hearing some footsteps at his door and feels the action 
he has taken is not satisfying certain members of the public, and he thought 
this was necessary," Riley said. "I would think the district attorney would 
feel somewhat angered by that evaluation, that maybe somebody would think he 
couldn't do a good job because his building was nearby." 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi said he was not bothered by Gates' letter, a copy of which was 
forwarded to him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't taken my blood pressure, but I think it's basically the same as it 
was this morning," he said. "We're just trying to stay focused on this case." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the shooting, some area politicians and law enforcement 
officials questioned why deputies were training with loaded weapons at a public 
site, and they criticized Gates and the department for its slow release of 
information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates conceded for the first time last week that department policies on 
training and the use of firearms were apparently violated during the incident, 
but his acknowledgments appeared to do little in assuaging skeptics. In fact, 
he faced a new round of criticism last Thursday when a coalition of black civic 
groups demanded more information on the case and called for an independent 
investigation into Robins' death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Van Roberson, a coalition member who is president of the Baptist 
Ministers Fellowship Conference in Orange County, said he was glad to hear 
about Gates' request for state intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they stepped up the investigation, that's fine with me," Roberson said in 
an interview. "We need to know that someone's going to get to the bottom of 
this. You can't tell me you have no answers when you have an officer shot 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 He was frustrated, however, by the state's apparent refusal to enter the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will it take for them to step in? That's what we want to know," he said. 
"If they don't take (advice) from the sheriff, what more would it take?" 
</P>
<P>
 Robins' family members declined comment on the issue of who should investigate 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Puglia of the attorney general's office said Lungren spoke with both Gates and 
Capizzi on Tuesday. "I can tell you they are all in agreement that the district 
attorney can move ahead with the investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there are signs at the completion of the investigation that local 
prosecutors "went out of bounds in their legal discretion," state officials 
could then intervene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini stressed that Gates has no problem with 
the district attorney's handling of the case, but rather sought the state's 
help in order to answer criticism from people in the community who questioned 
the impartiality of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates "doesn't want to leave any doubts because of the high sensitivity of 
this case," Martini said. "What the sheriff is saying is that this (alleged 
conflict of interest) should not be an issue. But if it is, let's put it to 
rest and turn it over to the AG."

RIORDAN, CHICK SEEK TO SALVAGE WARNER RIDGE; DEVELOPMENT: A BANK'S REFUSAL TO 
PROVIDE $100 MILLION CRIPPLES THE WOODLAND HILLS PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA and KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As new details of the collapse of the massive Warner Ridge office complex 
project emerged Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and City 
Councilwoman Laura Chick scrambled to deal with the fallout, which included the 
possible loss of 1,500 jobs in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Tuesday that 20th Century Industries, the parent company of 
one of the state's largest auto insurers, would not lease three mid-rise office 
buildings in the Woodland Hills project as planned. Almost two-thirds of the 
firm's 2,400 employees work in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It was learned that the project was dealt a crippling, if not fatal, blow last 
week when Morgan Guaranty Trust, a New York City-based bank, notified Warner 
Ridge Partners, the developers, that it would not provide $100 million in 
permanent financing for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Guaranty, according to sources, had always been a reluctant financier 
for the project. The bank does not specialize in real estate lending and became 
involved as a favor to its client, Johnson Wax Co. A subsidiary of Johnson Wax 
was an early partner in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They only became a partner by default," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Barry, spokeswoman for the lender, refused to comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Guaranty reportedly lent the real estate partnership $50 million to $60 
million to buy the land and footed the bills for a lawsuit filed against the 
city of Los Angeles by the developers. The city, led by former Councilwoman Joy 
Picus, had sought to block the project through a zone change, later declared 
illegal in a series of court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of Morgan Guaranty's move last week, 20th Century, now 
headquartered in Warner Center, announced that it was dropping its plan to be 
the anchor tenant at the proposed 690,000-square-foot complex. 
</P>
<P>
 A desperate and angry Jack Spound, a principal with Warner Ridge Partners, 
appealed to 20th Century to lend him the money in exchange for an equity stake 
in the project, sources familiar with the situation said. But 20th Century's 
board of directors rejected this proposal, leaving Spound without financing and 
a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Until these developments, groundbreaking for the project, which has involved 
the costly lawsuit and more than eight years of Byzantine City Hall 
maneuverings, was believed to be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Riordan's interest in salvaging the Woodland Hills project and 
preventing 20th Century's possible departure was complicated because the 
mayor's former law firm, Riordan & McKinzie, represented Morgan Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor planned to meet with the city attorney's office to see if his 
involvement would constitute a conflict of interest. "If it's legal, we want to 
be involved," said Annette Castro, the mayor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who represents the West Valley, called Riordan and 20th Century 
President James O. Curley on Tuesday in an attempt to keep the company in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my No. 1 priority," Chick said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley, Chick said, was "unfortunately oblique" about what the company's plans 
were. "I think they're kind of at Square 1. But I certainly didn't get any 
reassurances or concrete responses." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dinon, senior vice president at 20th Century, confirmed that the 
company's president had received calls early Tuesday from Riordan and Chick 
offering their assistance. "But I cannot disclose the content of the calls," 
Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said 20th Century is willing to consider moving out of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During last spring's election, candidates Riordan and Chick vowed to 
resuscitate the area's flagging economy and reverse City Hall's reputation of 
hostility to business. Riordan, as the city's chief executive officer, in 
particular, has been challenged recently to make good on his pledge to enact a 
job-creating agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, Packard Bell, a Chatsworth-based computer manufacturer, 
announced that it was relocating part of its operations to Utah and was 
contemplating other moves. The firm employs 1,500 workers at its Chatsworth 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Another business considering leaving the area is Coast Federal Savings Bank, 
which has a major Granada Hills facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the past few years, the Valley has suffered as General Motors closed 
its Van Nuys plant and firms such as Lockheed Corp. and Transamerica Insurance 
Groups transferred some of their high-wage workers to other locales. 
</P>
<P>
 George Mihlsten, an attorney for major real estate interests throughout the 
region, said the city will have to move aggressively to deal with business 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other jurisdictions are offering everything from free land and job-training 
opportunities to tax breaks to lure business to them," he warned. "That's what 
L. A. is up against." 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the Warner Ridge situation predicted that it would take 
outside mediators such as Riordan and Chick to save the project. Such 
intervention might not work, but certainly the situation will remain unchanged 
without "some new chemistry," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said that if the Warner Ridge project is not built, she wants to review 
any new plans for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to ensure that the community gets the best project possible . . . 
whether that involves a reduction in its size or not," Chick said. The project 
was to have been custom-built for 20th Century, and it remains unclear if it 
could be adapted for use by other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said 20th Century was convening a committee to find an alternative 
site. The firm now leases space from Tishman West in Warner Center, but has 
outgrown its headquarters and had planned to move into the Warner Ridge project 
before November, 1995, when its current lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer had agreed to a 20-year lease with Warner Ridge with an option to 
buy. But the deal was contingent on Warner Ridge obtaining permanent financing 
by Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Tishman West President Bob Shibuya said Tuesday that he is hopeful of 
retaining 20th Century as a tenant, calling the company "one of the best 
tenants in the market, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The repercussions of the busted Warner Ridge deal were also being felt at 
Pierce College in Woodland Hills, which had counted on $1 million in cash in 
exchange for accepting 425,000 cubic yards of dirt from the planned 
development. The money was to have been earmarked for teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will offer most of the spring semester classes funded through the 
deal, estimated at nearly one-third of the curriculum, said William Norlund, 
Pierce vice president of academic affairs. Most likely, he said, the college 
will operate at a deficit this year and pay the Los Angeles Community College 
District back during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not possible to lose this kind of revenue without cutting some classes, 
but we don't want to do a disservice to our students by cutting one-third of 
our classes," Norlund said. "The impacts of this will be felt next year and the 
year after and the year after that."

MOLESTER DATA IN LIBRARIES URGED; CRIME: BILL WOULD MAKE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS 
OF OFFENDERS AVAILABLE. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REPORT SHOWS '93 MAJOR OFFENSES DOWN 
3.8% IN STATE. TOTALS IN O.C. VARY GREATLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Atty. Gen. Daniel Lungren, California's top law enforcement official, Tuesday 
called for legislation to make available at county libraries the names, 
pictures and descriptions of convicted child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 With crime dominating the 1994 legislative session, Lungren also released a 
report showing that major crime dropped by 3.8% across California in the first 
nine months of 1993, but that homicide increased by 2.6%, based on preliminary 
reports of 49 police agencies in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's crime report showed that, overall, violent crime in California 
dropped 4.1% from 1992 to 1993. Forcible rape declined the most, falling 7.5%. 
It was the fifth year in a row that rape decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crime, including burglary and auto theft, dropped by 3.7%. At the 
same time, Lungren reported an 18.9% increase in the legal sale of guns, with 
665,229 firearms sold in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Public Safety speech, Lungren announced his support for a 
bill making the names, criminal histories, physical descriptions and photos of 
all felony child molesters available at county libraries, with updates twice a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a dangerous and uncertain world, parents should be empowered with the 
information they need to protect their children," Lungren told the Comstock 
Club, an organization of business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said he believes parents would use the information to notify police 
whenever they see people matching the descriptions of molesters at parks or 
near schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of empowering people," Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state, which has a similar law, people in Lynnwood, north of 
Seattle, torched the home of a convicted molester last July. The Washington law 
gives law enforcement authorities the right to release addresses of sex 
offenders, but does not require them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect against vigilantism, Lungren said his proposal would not allow for 
molesters' addresses to be publicly released. But the communities and ZIP codes 
in which they live would become available. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's proposal will be in a bill being pushed by Assemblywoman Barbara 
Alby (R-Fair Oaks). The measure seeks to deter people from attacking molesters 
by adding five years to the prison terms of anyone convicted of using the 
information about molesters to commit a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 California has 64,614 registered sex offenders, 20,236 of whom live in Los 
Angeles County. Lungren's aides did not know how many registered sex offenders 
are convicted child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Orange County cities and the Orange County Sheriff's Department were 
included in the report released Tuesday, and the results varied drastically 
from category to category. For example, in Huntington Beach, aggravated 
assaults jumped nearly 57%, but in Fullerton they dropped nearly 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department reported a 28% increase in violent 
crimes and a 36% increase in aggravated assaults, but only a 1% increase in 
property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All counties are experiencing an increase in violence -- acts of violence 
that can encompass everything from domestic violence to gang activity," said 
Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "You can see a 
pattern in the increases we've experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini pointed to recent violent crimes in south Orange County, 
characterizing them as "a wake-up call for us to act before the situation gets 
out of hand, a window of opportunity for us to start placing priorities on 
these types of issues. We have an opportunity to turn that trend around, an 
opportunity we are now trying to seize." 
</P>
<P>
 While the city of Santa Ana has also experienced increases in violent crime, 
according to Lt. Robert Helton, "for the last several years we have noticed a 
continued decrease in the area of property crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said it is difficult to explain these two trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be that criminals are doing things differently," he said, robbing 
individuals at gunpoint or knifepoint, rather than breaking into unoccupied 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it may just be getting some people off the street who are habitual 
criminals against property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren blamed the rise in homicide on juveniles, who he said are becoming 
increasingly violent. He called for legislation requiring juveniles age 16 or 
17 who use firearms in a crime to be charged as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 He said legislation should be passed allowing prosecutors to charge those who 
illegally give a firearm to a minor with a felony, and said minors who use guns 
illegally should lose their driver's licenses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren attributed the drop in crime to increased incarceration, pointing out 
that 120,000 people are in state prisons today, compared to 24,500 in 1980. He 
noted that the Department of Corrections budget is $2.7 billion, or $85 for 
every Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling for more prisons, Lungren asked, "Could you look the parents of a 
murdered or molested child in the eye and tell them we're not prepared to pay 
$85.87 apiece and even more to keep society's predators behind bars?"

DEBATE IS A MAGNET FOR INTEREST GROUPS, MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old senior who attends an alternative high school for gay students 
in Los Angeles. A Lakewood mother who was initially "devastated" when her 
23-year-old, married son told her that he was gay. A TV production crew from 
New York filming a documentary about gays for a PBS special. 
</P>
<P>
 These and more than 300 others came here Tuesday to witness the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District's board vote, which was scheduled to determine 
the future of the first gay support group at an Orange County public high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who made the trip did so with the sense that they were 
participating in a historic occasion with far-reaching implications. 
</P>
<P>
 That was ACLU attorney Alan Friel's primary reason for being there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest was not so much in the students' trying to start a gay support 
group, but in the community's attempt to prevent them from doing so," said 
Friel. "Under California law, the government cannot discriminate on the grounds 
of sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters were joined by parents and students vehemently opposed to the gay 
support group, named the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance. They 
have accused the alliance of promoting an immoral way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Fountain Valley High School Senior Robert Dodge, 17, who 
organized the Future Good Boys of America specifically to oppose the gay 
support group. Dodge believes the law itself is being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in theory the equal-access law is good," Dodge said, "but it doesn't 
have any limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Harropson, who said he was a member of a group of concerned parents who 
have been meeting since the controversy erupted, passed out a four-page flyer 
criticizing homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homosexuality must be removed from its legitimizing status as 'lifestyle,' " 
Harropson wrote in the flyer. One backer of the support group, Brian Dreesman a 
21-year-old student at EAGLES Center -- Los Angeles' only high school for gays 
and lesbians -- said he began lining up students to make the trek to Orange 
County as soon as he got wind of the controversy back in November. 
</P>
<P>
 A half a dozen other students and teachers from EAGLES center were planning to 
join Dreesman. A television film crew from New York, which is preparing a 
four-part PBS series on the gay community in which the EAGLES center will be 
featured, followed the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (support) group is like an island of hope for gay and lesbian youth," 
said Dreesman, a former varsity football star who dropped out of a Catholic 
boys school with a 4.0 grade-point average because he said he could no longer 
deal with the emotional toll of hiding his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to educate those who are trying to prevent it and let them know 
that it's more than sex -- it's about love," Dreesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult gay-rights advocates from throughout the Orange County and the Los 
Angeles area also turned out to voice their support for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Woody, co-chairwoman of the Orange County chapter of Parents and Friends 
of Gays and Lesbians, was among them. Woody, who was shocked when her married 
son told her he was gay, later joined the group. The organization has more than 
200 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was important for them to know that not everybody opposes having 
a gay and lesbian group on campus," said Woody, whose 24-year-old son is gay. 
"I don't know that people understand or realize the depth of harassment that 
gays and lesbians undergo throughout their teen-age years." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hordes of outsiders, Fountain Valley residents like Ted Bach felt 
themselves somewhat outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach, 54, the father of four grown children who attended Fountain Valley High 
School, said he was interested in the outcome even though his offspring, ages 
23 to 31, have long since graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it's an organization promoting tolerance and understanding, I don't see 
why they can't be a part of the high school campus," Bach said. "I thought the 
numbers of people who are supportive might help sway the board."

DANA PARSONS: GUN CONTROL ISSUE MAKES FOR A DOUBLE-BARRELED DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I never want to be accused of being a limousine liberal like those white folks 
who railed during the '70s about the inequity of urban school segregation, only 
to move to the suburbs as soon as their kids became subject to busing. Sure, 
they favored desegregating the schools . . . as long as someone else was doing 
the desegregating. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when it comes to gun control, what is the position that any good 
card-carrying liberal can live with? Will gun control become the busing of the 
'90s? 
</P>
<P>
 Be advised: The operative phrase in this column will be "on the other hand . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 A Garden Grove man recently began a letter to me by saying, "I realize that 
you sensitive, sweater-wearing people cringe at the thought of some of us 
enjoying our Second Amendment right to own and use firearms . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't have been more correct. There are some people who make me cringe 
at the thought of them wielding a fork at lunch, much less a loaded gun around 
their home or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I understand why a responsible citizen worried about self-protection might 
want a gun. Sure, they could get a Doberman or a thousand-dollar security 
system, but they'd rather have a gun. They might even accept the statistic that 
guns in homes are more likely to be used in domestic fights or accidental 
deaths than in self-protection. But, to them, that's just an argument that 
affects other people. It doesn't carry much weight with someone unwilling to 
forfeit a chance of warding off an intruder, even if the odds are 1,000 to 1 
against ever needing to. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just families. What about the huge singles population? You're not 
going to convince all of them that a gun poses a danger around the house, where 
there are no children or spouses. To them, a gun is merely insurance -- perhaps 
never needed but still worth having. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in Cypress just a couple weeks ago. The odds be damned, a couple 
suddenly found themselves face-to-face with a robbery suspect in their home. A 
fight ensued, which ended when a neighbor with a shotgun killed the suspect. It 
would have sounded pretty hollow to condemn the neighbor for possibly saving 
the couple's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The story also disclosed that just before the neighbor with the shotgun 
arrived, the suspect had wrested the homeowner's handgun from her, after she 
was afraid to fire it. That reinforces what the gun-control lobby says happens 
all too often: namely, that private citizens end up being shot with their own 
weapons because they're not skilled with them or prepared to use them, and the 
criminal takes it away from them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Would I feel safer knowing that everyone out there had guns? Do I want the 
number of guns to grow to the point that the pro-gun crowd could see if they're 
right when they argue that "an armed society is a polite society?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not on your life. People walking down the street with hair-trigger 
temperaments and hair-trigger .22s do not make me feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Convince me that a ban on guns is even remotely feasible. It's easy to keep 
people from smoking in public places; it's not easy to confiscate people's guns 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun-control crowd makes a mistake if it thinks its opponents are National 
Rifle Assn. stereotypes. Most gun owners are average citizens, perhaps 
privately wishing they didn't need a gun but still quietly keeping the pistol 
in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If I could snap my fingers and make all guns disappear, I'd do it in a minute. 
I think the public's knowledge that guns are out there in such abundance is 
both consciously and subconsciously affecting our national mental health. 
Society is too vulnerable to both intentional and accidental gun deaths, and 
most people are repelled by that. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the busing debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, liberals didn't win the busing argument, because they didn't win, 
as the saying goes, the hearts and minds of people. In the abstract, many 
people favored integrated schools; when it came down to the nuts-and-bolts 
reality, they balked. A big part of the busing legacy was that middle-class and 
affluent whites left city schools in droves for suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun-control debate could go the same way. Gun sales in California 
increased 18.9% in 1993 -- to a record 665,229 firearms -- the state attorney 
general's office said last week. In Orange County, handgun sales increased 102% 
in the past seven years, much higher than the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the public is on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it would be nice if guns didn't exist. It would be nice to gather up all 
the guns. But my sense is that the general public, while agreeing with the 
sentiment, is a long way from boarding the bandwagon.

IRVINE WILL JOIN EL TORO AGENCY; PLANNING: COUNCIL SETS ASIDE RESERVATIONS AND 
VOTES TO GO ALONG WITH BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON FORMING GOVERNMENTAL BODY THAT 
WOULD OVERSEE CONVERSION OF THE AIR BASE TO CIVILIAN USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine City Council, setting aside last-minute reservations for the sake 
of resolving a six-month political fight, voted Tuesday to join the County 
Board of Supervisors in forming a new governmental agency to oversee planning 
for the conversion to civilian use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous vote, the council approved a compromise proposal, tentatively 
hammered out by Irvine and the county last month, that three representatives 
from Irvine and one from Lake Forest join with the five supervisors on a board 
of directors that will wield decision-making authority over the planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's decision marks the closest the county has come to beginning the task 
of developing a base conversion strategy, with the first meeting of the newly 
created board tentatively scheduled for Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest council members, who are expected to take up the issue at their 
meeting Tuesday, previously stated a reluctance to officially join the El Toro 
Reuse Planning Authority until they see documents outlining its structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But following the Irvine council vote, Mayor Michael Ward said he expected 
Lake Forest to join the agency, "because I think they realize that if they want 
to be part of the process, it behooves them to come along." 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the agency board would hold 
its first meeting with or without Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the feeling of the Board of Supervisors that this process needs to move 
as expeditiously as possible," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the new partnership with the county, the Irvine council backed 
away from a staff recommendation issued Friday that Irvine insist on written 
guarantees from the supervisors about several issues covered during secret 
negotiations, notably Irvine's demand that it be allowed to annex the area 
occupied by the base when the Marines abandon the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff report listed a host of written commitments Irvine was seeking 
from the county, including an issue that was critical to Irvine's acceptance of 
the deal: a "commitment to allow the annexation . . . prior to January, 1999." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council accepted a letter from Schneider stating his belief that 
the supervisors would be able to "agree to seriously discuss the city's future 
annexation of all portions of the base not designated for public benefit 
conveyance or negotiated sale to the County of Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's letter imposed three conditions on the annexation negotiations: 
they will begin only after federal officials approve a redevelopment plan for 
the 4,700-acre site; Irvine must consider sharing all tax revenue, including 
property, sales and hotel occupancy taxes and vehicle license fees; and, if the 
agency converts a portion of the base into a commercial airport, the county 
will retain control of that area. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. recommended Tuesday that the council 
accept the county's conditions with one key exception. Irvine will agree to 
discuss sharing only property tax revenue when the annexation discussions get 
underway, since that is all that the city is required to negotiate under 
current state law, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Barry J. Hammond also clarified that while annexation of the base 
property must wait until a redevelopment plan is completed, Irvine will move 
ahead on annexation of other land surrounding the base that is within the 
city's legally defined sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and the county are the only two jurisdictions that share land use 
authority over the 4,700-acre site, so the city's participation is crucial if 
the base conversion plan is to win the Defense Department's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine council members hardly discussed the agreement, apparently anxious to 
get the planning underway with no further controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Irvine, the compromise was not a perfect solution. Irvine negotiators 
gave up their demand for two additional seats on the El Toro governing board in 
exchange for some guarantee that the county and the city would begin working on 
the annexation issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A firmer commitment from the county on annexation was not legally possible at 
this time, county officials said before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also held a trump card: If the agreement with Irvine fell apart, 
the county would consider a planning board sought by North County cities that 
favor using El Toro as a commercial airport. That proposal would broaden the 
board's membership to include city representatives from each supervisorial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his council's vote Tuesday, Ward said the long debate over 
membership on the planning board should now be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North County cities, instead of trying to tear the plan apart, ought to 
take part in the planning . . . and give us their input and be part of it 
instead of trying to tear the process apart," Ward said. "Let's get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to North County cities, other critics of the plan are lining 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, the League of United Latin American Citizens protested to the 
supervisors that Orange County's ethnic communities "are being excluded and 
barred" from the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Montez, president of the Santa Ana LULAC council, asked the supervisors 
to consider placing on the June primary ballot a referendum establishing a 
nine-member El Toro commission with commissioners elected by districts to serve 
four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors did not respond to Montez's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders who favor a new airport on the site also are considering a 
petition drive to place the El Toro issue on the November ballot, with a 
decision expected in a couple of weeks.

ILLEGAL WORKERS MAY COST BUSINESS; IMMIGRATION: UMBERG BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW 
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SEIZE EMPLOYER'S ASSETS PASSES KEY ASSEMBLY PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Saying illegal immigrants are lured to the United States by the promise of 
jobs, an Orange County lawmaker won approval Tuesday from a key Assembly panel 
for a bill that would allow local law enforcement agencies to seize the assets 
of California businesses that hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly's Public Safety Committee, long a graveyard for legislation 
deemed to be anti-immigrant, approved the measure authored by Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove) on a unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Umberg's proposal, businesses with five or more workers could be fined 
as much as $2,000 for each illegal immigrant employed, on the first violation. 
If a business was found guilty in court of a second violation, virtually any of 
the firm's assets could be seized. Subsequent violations would prompt criminal 
charges and prison time for business owners of as much as four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items that could be seized if a business violated the law would be 
real estate, raw materials and products, equipment, accounting books and 
documents, motor vehicles, boats and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an employer has built a business and is profiting on the backs of illegal 
aliens, then they should forfeit that profit," Umberg argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of Umberg's bill marked a new direction for the Assembly Public Safety 
Committee, which has been criticized for not being tough enough. Of late, 
however, the panel has approved a string of law-and-order measures, and that 
new attitude appears to be spreading to the issue of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Umberg's bill, the committee approved a measure by Assemblyman 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) authorizing a study of building a prison in Mexico for 
illegal immigrants convicted of crimes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal laws already exist that prohibit businesses from hiring 
illegal immigrants, those statutes are only occasionally enforced by the 
understaffed Immigration and Naturalization Service. Umberg contends his 
measure would draw California law enforcement agencies into the fray, providing 
personnel needed to better enforce the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a Bush Administration study that found more than 90% of all illegal 
immigrants are lured to the United States by the hope of jobs, Umberg suggested 
that enforcement of sanctions against employers would help lessen the incentive 
to seek work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But civil libertarians and agriculture industry representatives said the bill 
could do more harm than good. They said any state law would conflict with 
existing federal statutes. In addition, they raised the specter of 
discrimination against workers and suggested that well-meaning employers could 
be falsely accused if duped by a worker possessing phony documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a farmer doing everything he can to take a look at a worker's 
documents that look legitimate but aren't, that could pose problems," said 
Stanley O. Van Vleck, a lobbyist representing dairy and agricultural producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two Republicans on the Public Safety Committee sided with Umberg, the 
bill could later meet resistance from the GOP. Republican leaders say sanctions 
would only punish business while failing to recognize that government health 
and welfare programs are a potent magnet for illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 They also question where strapped police agencies will get the resources to 
begin enforcing immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg contends police would be able to recoup costs by cashing in on seized 
assets. He also said the measure, if made law, would have a solid deterrent 
effect once employers learned they faced losing a business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Umberg said, the onus would be on prosecutors to prove in court 
that a business knowingly hired an illegal immigrant before a firm's assets 
could be seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be plenty of opportunities to enforce this law without splitting 
hairs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Broad, legal counsel for the California Teamsters labor union, said the 
bill is needed to keep businesses from continuing to tap "a huge supply of 
exploitable labor." In the meantime, he said, the state is subsidizing health 
and welfare costs for illegal immigrants that otherwise would be borne by 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials estimate that illegal immigration costs the state about $4 
billion a year for health, welfare and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time we stop living this lie when it comes to our nation's 
immigration policy," Broad said. "Employers hire illegal aliens on a massive 
scale. . . . We need to take it seriously and stop providing lip service." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill has also received cautious support from the Legislature's Latino 
Caucus. The caucus leader, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), has 
signed on as a co-author and supports the sanctions against employers, but he 
has expressed some concern that the bill could fuel discrimination against 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill contains provisions calling for forfeited assets to go toward funding 
employment discrimination investigations as well as general law enforcement and 
county social service programs.

O.C. BLACK HISTORY PARADE TO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After two consecutive failed attempts, Orange County's most populous city will 
have a parade honoring Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Resuming a 12-year tradition, Santa Ana will play host to the Feb. 5 parade 
kicking off Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to community events supervisor Teresa Morgan, city officials 
approved a request by the nonprofit M.W.B. Foundation -- a community-based 
group that began raising money in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to once again host the Black History Parade in Santa Ana," 
Morgan said Monday after meeting with parade organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until 1991, the Black History Month parade was a 12-year-old tradition 
started by the Orange County Black Historical Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past three years, organizers have been forced to cancel their 
plans because they fell short of the mandatory $25,000 for permit fees and 
police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, a group of dedicated community organizers decided to take 
matters into their own hands. They formed the nonprofit M.W.B. Foundation, 
which stands for the three founders' last names, and hosted several 
fund-raising events to cover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 40 groups have submitted requests to march in the parade, 
said Ernesta Wright, one of the organizers. She said there is a Friday deadline 
for entries. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will run south along Broadway from 15th Street and end near the 
Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they are expecting more than 5,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mack, former head of the Prince Hall Masons, which co-sponsored the event 
in 1991, said fraternity members will walk in the parade behind a vintage Model 
A Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tradition. We should not have missed" those two years, he said. "Now 
hopefully it will be a continuous thing henceforth and forever." 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed concern, however, that parade organizers are "still running 
behind," pointing out that no celebrities have been lined up. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, actor Willard Pugh from "The Color Purple" was the grand marshal. 
Actors, rap groups and former world heavyweight boxing champion Ken Norton 
participated in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 James Colquitt, director of the Santa Ana chapter of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, expressed hope that the event would be a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 He said NAACP members had been asked to donate to the parade, and that they 
may participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are contacting various ethnic groups to organize food booths, 
gospel, jazz and reggae bands, and a cultural fair at the Santa Ana Civic 
Center.

DISTRICT, BIRDS FEATHER NESTS; HABITAT: THE ENDANGERED LEAST BELL'S VIREO WILL 
GET A WILLOW TREE PARCEL OF LAND; CONSUMERS WILL GET EXTRA WATER STORAGE AT 
PRADO DAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At first glance, the Prado Dam seems to have little connection with birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching behind the 566-foot-tall structure fronting the Riverside Freeway 
is a broad basin -- dry and brown this time of year -- that helps supply much 
of the water for about two million Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile away lies a 124-acre forest of willow trees gently swaying in the 
breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to this peaceful patch of forest near the border of Orange and Riverside 
counties that the least Bell's vireo -- a tiny songbird listed as endangered by 
both the nation and the state -- is expected to return to nest in March, after 
wintering in Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was atop this dam on the Santa Ana River that various county, state and 
federal officials gathered Tuesday to formally dedicate an agreement deemed by 
many as a triumph for bird and humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful," said Philip L. Anthony, president of the Orange County 
Water District, which provides water for much of Orange County. "It's one of 
the biggest and best water-conservation projects in years." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside): "This is truly a red-letter day." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement signed Tuesday is between the water district -- which owns 2,400 
acres behind Prado Dam -- and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages 
the facility. Its purpose: to significantly boost the amount of water available 
to Orange County residents in exchange for a preserve that could help save the 
endangered songbird. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is proof that man and wildlife can coexist," Rep. Ken Calvert 
(R-Riverside) told the crowd of dignitaries seated on folding chairs beneath a 
tent. "It shows that water management and environmental issues are not mutually 
exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement marked the culmination of years of negotiations between the two 
government agencies. Built in 1941 primarily to control flooding, the dam has 
for many generations also caught enough rainwater to supply about 75% of the 
water consumed by residents of north and central Orange County. The rest of 
their water, district officials say, generally comes from either the Colorado 
River or Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, political and environmental concerns have put the 
future of such "imported" water in doubt. So about six years ago, water 
district officials began negotiating with the Army Corps of Engineers for 
permission to increase the amount of water the county could store in the Prado 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1986 environmental impact statement indicated that use of the basin had 
seriously jeopardized the existence of the least Bell's vireo, a four-inch-high 
songbird that nests in the lower branches of the area's willow trees. 
</P>
<P>
 So in exchange for its permission to increase the amount of stored water, the 
Army Corps of Engineers -- working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- 
asked the Orange County Water District to set aside some acreage as natural 
songbird habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, the district has spent about $1.5 million to plant 
thousands of willow trees on 124 acres at the far end of the basin and to trap 
cowbirds, which prey on the vireo's young, said James A. Van Haun, executive 
assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, the number of known songbirds has increased from 19 
nesting pairs in 1986 to 123 last year. Eventually, Van Haun said, the district 
plans on setting aside 300 additional acres as future vireo habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new agreement, the level of rainwater allowed to be stored in the 
basin from March 1 to Sept. 1 will increase to 498 feet above sea level -- or 
enough extra water to meet the needs of about 120,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Van Haun said, the Army Corps of Engineers did not allow the 
water to exceed 494 feet above sea level, although that rule was waived on 
several occasions in recent years because of temporary emergencies. Eventually, 
he said, the water district hopes to raise the maximum allowable level to 505 
feet, an increase of about 29,000 acre feet, or enough to serve 150,000 people 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 One acre foot is 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a lot of water," Van Haun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Very little of the water -- or for that matter, the little songbird -- was 
evident on Tuesday, however, as participants listened to speeches, munched on 
chocolate chip cookies and watched fellow dignitaries sign an enlarged copy of 
the new agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water is the lifeblood of California," Packard, one of the signers, declared 
before affixing his signature to the document. "Without water we would live in 
a desert; this is a great water-conservation project." Water for the Birds In 
exchange for more water storage behind Prado Dam, the Orange County Water 
District has paid the Army Corps of Engineers $1 million and set aside 124 
acres as habitat for the least Bell's vireo. A look at the endangered songbird 
that nests in willows in the flood plain behind the dam. Least Bell's vireo: 
Vireo bellii pusillus . Status: State and federal endangered species. Habitat: 
Creeks and rivers, mainly found at Prado Dam and Camp Pendleton Marine Corps 
base. Diet: Mostly insects. Population: About 300 pairs. Brood: Three to five 
eggs in nests usually suspended from branches. Dangers: Besides rapidly losing 
habitat, the elusive vireo is a victim of brood parasitism by cowbirds. 
Cowbirds lay their eggs in the vireo's nest, and cowbird chicks often displace 
the smaller vireos. Source: Audubon Society Field Guide to North American

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUPLE ALTERS FATE OF 110-YEAR-OLD 
HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A historic cottage was saved from demolition this week when a local couple 
agreed to buy it and move it to an adjacent empty lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110-year-old Hankey/Rowse house, a crumbling, blue-gray Victorian just off 
Ortega Highway that is on the list of the city's historic landmarks, will be 
restored. The house, formerly the center of one of the area's earliest citrus 
farms, at one time was the home of a French priest who served at Mission San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expressed relief Tuesday that the house would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited the house will be preserved," Mayor Collene Campbell said. 
"It's a win-win situation all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as August, it appeared the deteriorating house would have to be 
demolished. After living in the home since the 1920s, the Hankey family had 
vacated the deteriorating structure and requested permission from the city to 
demolish it and subdivide their one-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, city officials attempting to preserve the city's history denied 
their request. But the Hankeys appealed to the City Council and won permission 
to demolish the home in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it was San Juan Capistrano residents Michael and Lisa Palmer who 
came to the home's rescue. The couple agreed to buy the home and restore it for 
Michael Palmer's parents, said Marjorie Le Gaye, the Hankeys' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The final hurdle in saving the home came this week, when the council 
unanimously voted to allow the Hankeys to subdivide their property. Under the 
proposed agreement, the Palmers will buy one of the lots and move the home just 
a short distance, Le Gaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the house will be turned around to face Via Cristal. The garage 
will sit on the Ortega Highway side, Le Gaye said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three lots will be eventually sold as sites for single-family homes 
similar to those in surrounding neighborhoods, Le Gaye said.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COLLEGE ENROLLMENT FIGURES TO STAY SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN BALLOU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enrollment at Orange County's community colleges this spring is expected to 
remain virtually unchanged from last spring when enrollment dipped to a 
five-year low, school officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the county's four community college districts, which include 
eight schools, say last spring's enrollment decline numbers, as much as 6% at 
some colleges, will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in enrollment coincides with a statewide tuition hike for students 
who already have a bachelor's degree. Those students, usually people who are 
retraining for a new job or are taking college courses to upgrade their skills, 
were hit with a $40 increase in per-unit tuition last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost about half of those students with degrees," said district 
spokeswoman Ann Garten. 
</P>
<P>
 At Coast Community College District's three schools, spring, 1992, enrollment 
rose higher than the previous three years, but last spring, those figures 
dropped to the lowest in half a decade to 56,465. 
</P>
<P>
 Garten said that Coastline, Golden West and Orange Coast colleges together 
will lose approximately half of the 6,000 students whose tuition went from $10 
to $50 in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For students without a degree, tuition went from $6 per credit hour, with a 
$60 ceiling or maximum cost, in 1991, to $13 per credit hour with no cap on 
total costs last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major concern for a lot of our students is figuring out a way to pay for 
the increases in tuition," Garten said. "Many are simply dropping out of school 
and getting a job to save money to pay for college." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Allison, a 20-year-old student at Orange Coast College, said he took 
the fall semester off in order to make money to pay for the increase in 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "These increases really put a strain on a student's budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When 2,000 students registered in the first two days of spring registration 
Jan. 3 and 4 at Orange Coast College, officials predicted that enrollment would 
match or exceed 25,000, the highest in five years. But the rush of students 
quickly dropped off and now enrollment is expected to be one percentage point 
below last year's 22,855. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the strangest registration we've had," said Sue Brown, administrative 
dean at Orange Coast College. "Usually after winter break very few students 
show up, but this time there were huge crowds. At first, we thought it meant 
enrollment would be up again, but it seems that students were just coming in 
early." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hike, all three colleges enjoyed a steady increase in enrollment 
and even had to keep waiting lists for many classes. Officials had been hoping 
that tuition hikes at four-year institutions in the county would translate into 
increased enrollment at community colleges, where tuition would appear to be an 
overwhelming bargain compared to thousand-dollar fees at schools such as UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Other community colleges such as Cypress, Rancho Santiago, Fullerton and 
Saddleback will not have estimates on enrollment until late January. BRIAN

purchasing the land beneath their coaches last month, their troubles with 
ballooning rents have not ended. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAnza Assets Corp. of Beverly Hills, which holds the lease on the land for 
another 19 years, issued eviction notices Saturday to several dozen residents 
who decided to ignore a rent increase that went into effect Jan. 1 and instead 
paid this month's rents at last month's rates. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 of the residents received about a 40% rent increase, while the 
overall rental rate went up about 20% in the park, said Barry McCabe, president 
of DeAnza. This increase went into effect just days after the residents closed 
a deal with the Irvine Co. to purchase their park and a nearby marina for $11 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though residents have purchased the seniors-only park, they must still 
pay rent to DeAnza because the company owns a lease on the property. Therefore, 
people living there have to both finance the land deal while also paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, whose rents currently range from $600 to $1,600, met with 
DeAnza on Saturday but were unable to persuade their landlord to cancel the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 McCabe has said his company will grant subsidies for residents who cannot 
afford the increase but will evict those who fail to ask for help or to pay the 
entire rent before the end of this week. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PARENTS URGE LOOK AT DRESS CODE 
POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of parents of Aliso Viejo Middle School students voiced their support 
of the school's principal in the wake of allegations that she has fostered a 
climate of prejudice and racial insensitivity at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the parents encouraged trustees of the Capistrano Unified 
School District on Monday to examine policies on dress codes and discipline 
that could be interpreted as unfair toward minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that district policies can be misunderstood . . . they need to 
be revised," said parent Patricia Ashley, who organized a petition drive among 
parents last month in support of the the school's principal, Cheryl Lampe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley and other parents said district dress codes and discipline policies 
intended to protect campuses from crime and gang influences may emphasize those 
concerns too specifically. A minority student told to change attire -- which 
although similar to those of gangs may also be fashionable or trendy -- may 
feel the order was a racially motivated accusation of gang affiliation, the 
parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The label of being a gang member that you hang around a child's neck . . . 
can become a self-fulfilling prophecy," said Fred T. Ashley, Patricia's 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations against the school's principal and her staff came to light 
last month when a group of African American and Latino parents appeared before 
trustees to complain that the new school's administrators and teachers were 
singling out minority students, particularly African Americans, for harsh 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the accusations leveled against the school and Lampe by the previous 
group of parents and relatives of African American and Latino students were 
that their children were unfairly accused of being gang members because of the 
clothes they wore and games they played with hand symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Viejo Middle School's enrollment is 87% white, 6% Latino, 4% Asian and 
3% black. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine parents who addressed trustees Monday said they did not intend to 
discredit the previous group's concerns, but they said they were firmly behind 
Lampe and her staff. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; LANDMARK TOWER BEING REFURBISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising 140 feet into the sky, the water tower off Seal Beach Boulevard is one 
of the city's most prominent landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 So when workers draped the entire structure in a white protective sheet about 
two months ago, many residents wondered what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it around Halloween, and I thought they had dressed it up like a 
ghost," said Louise Jefferies, a 13-year Seal Beach resident. "It looked so 
odd." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the sheet was needed as part of a repainting and reinforcement 
project expected to be completed in April, said Richard Williamson, spokesman 
for the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old tower, which holds 103,300 gallons of water, is part of the 
base. It is visible from Seal Beach Boulevard just east of the Marina Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers began removing old paint from the tower in November through a 
sandblasting process. Since environmental rules classify the bits of paint as 
hazardous waste, the sheet had to be installed to prevent any particles from 
becoming airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 The covering was pulled up the tower with ropes, Williamson said. "It was like 
a big skirt. They just took it from the bottom and wrenched it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the painting of the superstructure complete, the white sheet now covers 
just a portion of the top tower. 
</P>
<P>
 During the project, workers also plan to complete some seismic work to 
reinforce the structure. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; UNION OFFICIAL WARNS OF POLICE 'BLUE FLU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the same day that the city's new police chief was sworn into office, the 
president of the police union Tuesday confirmed that officers will hold a "blue 
flu" walkout to protest their stalled contract negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The sickout would be the first in Anaheim's history and underscores the 
growing rift between management and city employees. The police union as well as 
the city's three other employee unions are all working without contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bottolfson, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., said the timing of 
the job action, which will occur for a 24-hour period sometime within the next 
10 days, is not a protest against incoming Police Chief Randall Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he pointed out that Gaston "is walking into a quagmire." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson declined to say what day the protest will occur or how many 
officers plan to participate, adding that the officers are demonstrating "to 
convey our sense of urgency with the council to resolve this contract dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 The police association's contract with the city expired 18 months ago, and the 
officers have not had a raise since 1991. They have twice picketed City Hall in 
the past four months, demanding a 10% raise over two years. The city is 
offering a 6.5% raise over that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really tried to put a fair offer on the table," said City Manager James 
D. Ruth, "We're disappointed that they would do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said the union has notified the city that a blue flu was an option 
it was considering in the face of failed contract negotiations. He said the 
city's attorney had informed the union that no injunction will be sought 
against the sickout but said that none of the participating officers will 
receive sick pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-flu actions have been declared illegal forms of protest by state courts 
because they violate the state's ban on police strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's three other unions, the Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn., the 
Anaheim Firefighters Assn., and the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers say they may join the police union's protests in the future to show 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, who was unanimously approved Tuesday to become the city's new police 
chief, said he will meet with Bottolfson today to discuss the association's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens . . . we have a contingency plan," Gaston said. The plan 
includes using officers from neighboring cities and Anaheim's lieutenants to 
patrol the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective will be to ensure no interruption of emergency services will 
take place," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, 49, is a 28-year member of the Police Department who has been a 
captain since 1983. He replaces Joseph T. Molloy, who died of a heart attack in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, who will earn $98,254 annually, is taking over a department with many 
concerns. In addition to the labor issues, the city has experienced an increase 
in crime and calls for service.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past five years, homicides are up 84%, robberies up 35% and the 
number of gangs is up 700%. The population increased 16% during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, in responding to pressure from the department and residents, 
has promised to increase the number of sworn officers from 352 to 400 in the 
next few years, but has not decided how to come up with the $4 million 
necessary. The members hope the city will be chosen by March for a $2-million 
federal grant, but officials say the odds are against that. MATT LAIT and TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; HOUSE, GARAGE FIRE MAY HAVE BEEN SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A vacant house and detached garage suffered about $80,000 in damage during a 
fire Tuesday morning that may have been deliberately set, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire was spotted raging through a single-story, three-bedroom house in the 
1400 block of West Richland Avenue at 11:40 a.m., said Santa Ana Deputy Fire 
Chief Wayne Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The origin of the fire was suspicious," Bowman said. "We had some witnesses 
who said they saw people leaving the house right before the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 It took 16 firefighters about 28 minutes to put out the blaze, which did not 
damage any other homes on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said the house was basically empty except for some discarded clothing. 
He said a family that lived in the house had recently been evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The eviction and the fire do not appear to be related," Bowman said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; POLICE CUT ADVISED AS LAST-DITCH OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fiscal advisory committee has recommended eliminating the city's Police 
Department as a last-ditch budget cutting move, an option to be adopted if 
employee layoffs and reduced services fail to save the city enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress Fiscal Advisory Committee, formed by the City Council last June to 
provide recommendations on the city's $16-million budget, released the 
recommendations Monday. The council members are now considering the committee's 
report and will discuss it at a special meeting Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Though closing the Police Department and contracting for police services with 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department would save the city several million 
dollars, Mayor Richard Partin said "it is not a viable option. We are not in 
the position that we need to take such a drastic cut at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Daryl Wicker, who is reviewing the recommendations, said he does 
not favor the committee's recommendation to eliminate his department. "It 
certainly wouldn't be my choice," he said. "I don't think it's the best option 
for Cypress." 
</P>
<P>
 Partin agreed, saying that other cuts outlined in the report, however, will be 
given "serious consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Those cuts include laying off at least 20 employees; reducing the frequency of 
tree trimming, street cleaning, park cleaning and other maintenance services; 
and cutting employee fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city's population grew by 6.4%, to 45,630, between 1983 and 1993, 
city staff grew 21.4% and city expenditures grew 93%, the committee's report 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current city organization, number of employees and spending propensities 
will result in deficits from $1 million to $2.5 million a year for the next 
five years if the financial philosophy, strategy, goals and management methods 
are not changed," said Reynold Elkin, chairman of the fiscal advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city would save $2 million from its annual budget if it reduces 
police training costs, employee auto allowance payments, the number of 
management positions and maintenance workers, insurance premiums and services 
such as street sweeping and tree trimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Further savings could be achieved if the city privatizes some maintenance 
work, contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department for police 
services, stops televising council meetings, and reduces and controls overtime 
pay to city employees, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee vice chairman Robert A. Solheim said city employees average $56,000 
a year in salary and fringe benefits. "This is about $10,000 higher than the 
salary and fringe benefits earned by the average Cypress resident taxpayer who 
must pay for these city employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the current tight fiscal environment, the taxpayers of Cypress cannot 
afford to continue supporting this generous salary and fringe benefit package 
as it currently stands," Solheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed, saying they will give the report "serious 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do the best we can to try to implement as much as we can," Partin said 
about the committee's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bite the bullet sometimes," council member Gail H. Kerry said. 
"We're at the point where we have to make some real tough decisions." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; BOARD TO DECIDE DATE FOR VOTE ON WALL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors of the the Rossmoor Community Services District board will decide 
today when to hold a special election to determine if voters are willing to tax 
themselves to maintain the Rossmoor perimeter wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dates being proposed are June 7 and Nov. 8.The five-member board is likely 
to pick a November date because board members said voters as well as district 
employees must have ample time to prepare for the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is necessary because the community services district, which 
governs the unincorporated area, does not have the authority to maintain the 
37-year-old wall. The district provides such services as street lighting and 
sweeping, landscaping and trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. has been behind the effort to repair and 
maintain the wall after a 100-foot section of it collapsed during an earthquake 
in 1992. Residents have expressed fears that other sections weakened by the 
earthquake may topple and cause injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey last year sent to 3,748 homes, 63% of those who responded said 
they favor an election to determine if property owners should pay a special tax 
to repair and maintain the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the respondents said that the 1 1/2-mile-long wall, starting 
at Hedwig Road and extending south along Los Alamitos and Seal Beach 
boulevards, is a "community asset" and must be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sheldon, the services district's general manager, said that the election 
could cost from $9,000 to $14,000 if conducted by the county and about $10,000 
if a consultant is hired to conduct the election. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, owners of the community's 3,555 parcels would pay about $15 a 
year for 20 years to repair the wall and create a trust fund for its 
maintenance. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MEETING TO FOCUS ON 'SPACE SAVER' SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents are expected to attend an informational meeting tonight 
to discuss the controversial $43-million "space saver" school proposed by the 
Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Rudy Castruita will make a presentation about the project, and the 
audience will be invited to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, sponsored by several neighborhood associations, will be held at 
First Christian Church, 1720 W. 17th St., from 7 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Having received a state grant to pay for the entire project, district 
officials hope to build a 98,000-square-foot building at the rear of Bristol 
Market Place, at 17th and Bristol streets. The project would accommodate 1,300 
students from the sixth through eighth grades, said Mike Vail, senior director 
of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2000, local intermediate schools will house about 5,000 more 
students than they were designed for. Even with the addition of the planned 
Raymond A. Villa Intermediate School and the Bristol Street campus, the number 
of intermediate students would still exceed designed capacities by about 2,400 
students, Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the district's need to reduce crowding, state officials awarded 
the district $43 million for a space-saver school to be built at the Bristol 
Market Place site. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail said space-saver projects use available land to avoid the use of eminent 
domain, through which the district could force people or businesses to sell 
property. Space-saver also refers to the architecture: The school would be 
several stories and would use less ground space than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 While most residents agree that the district must build more schools, some say 
the site was poorly chosen because the heavily trafficked area may not be safe 
for children, and the school will add to the congestion. They also question 
whether businesses at the mall would be hurt by the influx of children. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will hold a special board meeting on Feb. 1 to describe the 
proposal in detail and get comments from the public. The meeting will be held 
at 6 p.m. at Phillips Hall on the Rancho Santiago College campus, at 17th and 
Bristol streets.JON NALICK

WIFE PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN DUAL SLAYING; COURTS: A WEEPING LISA PENG NEARLY 
COLLAPSES. SHE IS HELD WITHOUT BAIL IN DEATHS OF HER HUSBAND'S LOVER AND THEIR 
INFANT SON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A trembling Li-Yun (Lisa) Peng wept uncontrollably and nearly collapsed before 
pleading not guilty Tuesday in Municipal Court here to charges of murder in the 
deaths of her husband's lover and their infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in dark blue prison garb with a denim coat, Peng, 44, a Taiwanese 
national who maintains a home in Rancho Santa Margarita, was ordered held 
without bail in the grisly August slayings of 25-year-old Ranbing Jennifer Ji 
and her 5-month-old son, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bodies were discovered by Peng's husband, Tseng (Jim) Peng, on Aug. 18 
at the Vista del Lago apartments in Mission Viejo after he returned from a 
business trip to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's arraignment, Municipal Judge Pamela Iles set pretrial and bail 
hearings for Peng for Jan. 18. On grounds of double homicide, prosecutors filed 
additional charges of special circumstances in the case, which could carry the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peng, 50, a wealthy businessman and chief executive officer of San 
Diego-based Ranger Communications, attended the proceedings and insisted that 
his wife of 21 years is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking outside the courtroom to a horde of reporters, including television 
crews from Taiwan and China, Peng said his wife knew of his relationship with 
Ji, a former employee, but claimed his wife only learned of the child produced 
by their relationship after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife never knew she had a baby," said Peng. She was "shocked" when he 
telephoned her immediately after first calling police and told her of the 
killings, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claim to have a crucial piece of evidence -- a DNA sample from a 
bite mark on Ji's left arm -- that directly links Lisa Peng to the slayings. 
Investigators collected the DNA from saliva around the bite mark and, in a 
series of tests, matched it with Lisa Peng, according to Ronald Cafferty, a 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng was arrested Saturday, five months after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding of the DNA in this case is that it is her . . . or something 
like an identical twin," Cafferty said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Marshall M. Schulman, who is representing the defendant, said the 
reliability of the DNA testing will be at the center of the case. Schulman, who 
was retained by Jim Peng, said a DNA match would make Lisa Peng only one of 
millions of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it shows is that she can't be excluded, but so can millions of other 
people," Schulman said. "I'm not impressed by DNA as a reliable piece of 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the "slim" evidence, Schulman said, "she shouldn't have been 
arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that authorities found two buttons apparently belonging to 
Lisa Peng at the scene of the slayings in an apartment complex just off 
Marguerite Parkway near Lake Mission Viejo. According to a police report, Jim 
Peng was holding one of the buttons when he knocked on a neighbor's door to 
telephone police after discovering the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies found Ji just steps inside the doorway, 
slumped over on the couch with her back to the front door, her brown and white 
housedress covered with blood. She had been stabbed 18 times in the chest with 
a knife large enough to go all the way through her body, Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 No murder weapon has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was found suffocated in a crib in an adjoining bedroom, according to 
police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's death is another crucial piece of evidence against Lisa Peng, 
Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't kill a 5-month-old baby because it was a witness," Cafferty said, 
adding that there was no evidence of burglary or robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cafferty said there is evidence that Ji and her baby had chanced to meet 
Lisa Peng at a shopping center on the day of the killing. He also said Lisa 
Peng knew about the child and the 3-year-old affair between her husband and Ji, 
and in 1992 found some of Ji's clothes at their Rancho Santa Margarita home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She found them and cut them up," Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Lisa Peng arrived at Ji's apartment at least 12 hours 
before the bodies were discovered and immediately attacked Ji after she opened 
the door, driving her back across the family room to the couch, where she 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the frenzied attack that Lisa Peng allegedly tried to bite Ji, 
who managed to rip the buttons from Peng's clothing, Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peng, whose company is one of the world's largest manufacturers of 
citizens band radios with factories in Taiwan, Malaysia and China, said Tuesday 
that he hired Ji in 1990 to help start a new manufacturing company in China, 
where she was a citizen. He said his affair with Ji began in China and that she 
came to California on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that since Ji's arrival in Mission Viejo, he had seen her only once 
every three months or so and knew little of her life here. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged having a passion for Ji, but divorce from his wife and 
marriage to Ji was out of the question, he said, mainly because of the 
difference in their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved her and she loved me but there is a certain point (when one must) 
face the facts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim and Lisa Peng have two boys, ages 16 and 20, who are students in the 
United States. They are aware of the slayings and their mother's arrest, Jim 
Peng said.

WIEDER ENDS FINAL TERM AS BOARD LEADER; SUPERVISORS: THE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN TOOK 
CREDIT FOR RAISING AWARENESS IN SOCIAL ISSUES FROM HEALTH CARE TO GANG 
VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ending her third and last term as head of Orange County government, Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder Tuesday took credit for raising awareness in a myriad of 
social issues from shepherding a new health-care policy to addressing increased 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, the outgoing chairman who will retire from the Board of Supervisors 
this year, described her yearlong administration as a "great year," despite the 
county's unprecedented budget problems and the devastating fires that ravaged 
Laguna Beach in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenges that once polarized this county have become the motivators for 
unity for cities and the county to work together," Wieder said in an outgoing 
address. "What we have witnessed is the recognition that each and every 
community in Orange County faces similar social and economic challenges, 
whether we live in Santa Ana, San Clemente, Huntington Beach, Anaheim or 
Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-ranging talk was followed by an ovation from the crowded chamber as a 
teary-eyed Wieder clasped hands with political rival Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last action as chairman, Wieder turned over board leadership to 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, also serving his final year in county office. 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will serve as vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely a ceremonial title, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors serves as 
the county's chief spokesperson and conducts the board's weekly meetings. The 
title rotates annually among the five members. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the tradition in the annual transfer of power, the outgoing chairman 
highlighted the year's events which, Wieder said, emphasized a "demand for 
change" in how local government responds to the needs of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder cited November's countywide summit to address the alarming rise in gang 
violence as an example of how government attempted to answer the public's 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outrage of our communities over the increase in youth gang violence and 
the subsequent call for gang intervention . . . was a wake-up call for local 
government," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people attended the Nov. 30 summit in Anaheim where students, 
educators, law officers and parents called for help to deal with the staggering 
increases in local gang-related deaths and gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the summit, the board has approved a $2-million plan called TARGET to 
send special strike teams of police, prosecutors and probation officers to the 
county's most gang-plagued neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wieder said, the county also responded to the significant 
health-care needs of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the OPTIMA (Orange Prevention, Treatment and Intervention Medical 
Assistance) program approved last year, county officials hope to provide more 
efficient health care to the 225,000 county residents who are eligible for 
Medi-Cal benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA will attempt to attract a broader participation of physicians by 
streamlining paperwork necessary for treatment of Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1995, the state would provide OPTIMA with a set amount of money for each 
Medi-Cal-eligible patient and OPTIMA would contract with hospitals, community 
clinics and physicians to provide primary health-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's promise, Wieder said, is in a more efficient distribution of 
health services for indigent residents that could "save millions of dollars" in 
public funds. Currently, about $500 million a year is spent on Medi-Cal in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in Wieder's speech, however, were mention of some particularly 
controversial points in the Huntington Beach-based supervisor's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder has fended off criticism for receiving a $29,000 county car, especially 
in light of a record of costly vehicle mishaps that far exceeds that of any 
other supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Stanton had reportedly attempted to block Wieder's move to the 
chairmanship in an attempt to allow himself an additional year at the helm of 
county government. Stanton has denied such an action, but the unsuccessful move 
later prompted Wieder to compare Stanton's style of management to that of Adolf 
Hitler.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important policy decision facing Orange County -- the 
conversion of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station -- will be left for another 
administration's leadership, Wieder said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With communities still at odds over how the conversion process will be 
directed, Wieder promised that "Supervisor Riley's leadership and commitment to 
the residents of the county will ensure a productive and successful . . . 
outcome."

LIFE TERM URGED IN BLUDGEONING DEATH; COURTS: JURY RECOMMENDS THAT SHALEKE 
NASIR BE SPARED THE DEATH PENALTY IN MURDER OF HIS LOVER IN 1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury on Tuesday recommended sparing the life 
of a kick boxer from Orange who used a hammer to bludgeon his lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, jurors decided that Shaleke Nasir, 22, should spend the rest of his 
life in prison without any chance of parole. Nasir was convicted in November of 
first-degree murder, robbery and attempted rape in the August, 1991, death of 
Lena M. Forbes, 21, of Huntington Beach. Nasir told jurors he "snapped" and 
killed Forbes after she bragged about a sexual liaison with another man earlier 
that same day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, dear God, thank you," sighed Nasir's mother, Fowzia, as the clerk 
announced the jury's recommendation.  
</P>
<P>
 A few rows away, Forbes' relatives wept quietly before leaving the courtroom 
and declining to talk about the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they were divided 7-5 against a death sentence when they began 
deliberations late Monday, but they reached a unanimous decision Tuesday 
afternoon after reviewing the evidence presented during the trial's penalty 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he made a terrible mistake and should pay for it the rest of his 
life, but in this case we just felt that life was the right decision," said 
juror Bruchon Johnson, 33, of Orange who added that Nasir's lack of an 
extensive criminal record also influenced the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge David O. Carter will consider the jury's recommendation and attorneys 
said they expect him to uphold the jury's recommendation during Nasir's 
sentencing on Feb. 25. Prosecutors portrayed Nasir as a man with a history of 
preying on women. At the time of Forbes' murder, he was on probation stemming 
from a statutory rape case in which he was caught having sex with an 
11-year-old girl. On an earlier occasion, he was accused of fondling a 
2-year-old girl but was not convicted, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles 
Middleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, however, questioned the credibility of another woman who also 
testified that Nasir raped her after defense attorneys revealed her history of 
substance abuse, her arrest on a prior theft, and inconsistencies in her 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Fowzia Nasir's emotional testimony that seemed to convince jurors that 
Nasir did not deserve to die in the gas chamber for his crimes, jurors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense witnesses testified Nasir suffered brain damage that affected his 
ability to control himself, but friends and relatives said he never exhibited a 
violent streak. He was depicted in court as a polite man who cared about 
others, but was traumatized by his mother's abuse at the hands of men. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Fowzia Nasir broke down during her testimony and told jurors 
that no matter what their decision, they could not break the bond between 
mother and son. Defense attorneys Milton Grimes and Marne A. Glass said they 
believe her testimony made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a dry eye in the house after she testified," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's recommendation came as a surprise to many, including the defense 
team. Typically, it is a bad sign for the defense when a death penalty jury 
wraps up its deliberations so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here prepared for the worst," Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he respected the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did what they believed was right," Middleton said. Forbes' relatives, 
who wept during court, refused to comment after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony on his own behalf, Nasir told jurors he lost control of 
himself and attacked Forbes after she pressed him for money and then bragged 
about sex with another man.

BOARD DECLINES TO NEGOTIATE WITH BRANCH; SUPERVISORS: ANY DEAL FOR THE 
RECORDER'S RESIGNATION WOULD BE 'INAPPROPRIATE,' SAYS GADDI H. VASQUEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors said Tuesday that they will not negotiate with 
embattled Recorder Lee A. Branch in an attempt to seek his ouster from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a closed meeting of the Board of Supervisors, Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez said any deal in exchange for Branch's resignation would be 
"inappropriate" for the board to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no room for a negotiated settlement in this case," Vasquez said. 
"The public will pass ultimate judgment in June." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, the subject of sexual harassment and physical abuse allegations by 
employees within the office, is up for reelection this June. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Branch's attorney, Lloyd Charton, said the allegations against his 
client were "laughable" and he reaffirmed that Branch had no intention of 
resigning his office of 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Charton said Branch would address all of the misconduct charges in a news 
conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county ought to be ashamed of themselves for their treatment of a man who 
has served them so long," Charton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, county officials had been discussing settlement options as 
possible incentives for Branch to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
 One scenario under discussion would have allowed crediting Branch with an 
additional two years toward his retirement, about half the amount needed for 
him to leave government on a full-salaried pension. Branch earns about $75,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry Andrus acknowledged that "compromise scenarios" were 
presented to the board Tuesday, but all were rejected. Andrus declined to 
discuss the details of those settlement options. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors have expressed particular frustration in dealing with the Branch 
matter. Since the recorder popularly elected, the board has no authority to 
dismiss him. Two supervisors have called for him to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the board will place the Branch matter on its Jan. 25 agenda for 
public discussion. Among the possible actions available to them is a censure of 
Branch or a public reprimand, county officials said privately on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 A less likely option, officials said, would be to seek Branch's removal on 
misconduct allegations through a little-used legal provision available to the 
Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that provision, the Grand Jury would conduct its own misconduct 
investigation and present its findings to the district attorney's office for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury has questioned Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy about the 
technical workings of the office, but it was unclear whether the grand jury's 
inquiries extended to actual misconduct allegations involving Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Branch investigation was sparked by employee complaints about Branch's 
personal relationship with documents manager Nancy L. Smith. Some employees 
have complained that Branch showed favoritism to Smith within the office and 
made lewd remarks to another office worker. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate incidents, both Branch and Smith have been accused of physically 
abusing employees on the recorder's office staff. Branch has acknowledged his 
relationship with Smith, who is expected to be transferred from her position in 
the office. But both have denied the accusations made by employees.

ACTIVISTS SEEK UMBERG BACKING; LOBBYING: ABOUT 120 PEOPLE RALLY TO PRESSURE THE 
GARDEN GROVE ASSEMBLYMAN TO VOTE FOR AN ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Activists who favor a law to protect older teen-agers from being legally 
depicted in pornographic material rallied Tuesday to pressure Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to support the measure, only to find out that he had 
already decided to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sexually Exploited Children's Act would define child pornography as 
sexually explicit material showing anyone under 18, rather than 14 as state law 
now stands. Umberg voted in favor of the bill in Sacramento today, helping it 
pass through the Assembly Public Safety Committee 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, however, 120 people, some of whom represented Orange County 
civil and religious organizations, went to Umberg's office here carrying 
balloons and signs, unaware of his impending support. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign carried by 8-year-old William Silvey of Orange summed up the crowd's 
sentiment. The handmade placard, lettered in crayon, said: "Stop Nasty Pictures 
of Teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who went inside Umberg's office got a letter from him saying that he 
intended "to vote today in the Assembly Public Safety Committee" for the bill. 
The letter called it "probably the most comprehensive bill on the subject to be 
introduced this legislature session." 
</P>
<P>
 Many attendees were critical of Umberg, the only Democrat in Orange County, 
for abstaining when an earlier version was voted on in the committee in April. 
His change of mind came as news to many at the rally.  
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't gotten word that he had changed his mind" until the rally had 
begun, said Verna Seidlitz of Anaheim, who like other people felt his decision 
to support the bill was a result of their pressure. Umberg knew ahead of time 
there would be a rally, she said, which gave him time to consider the feelings 
of the community and alter his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Umberg's office insisted the rally did not influence his position. He had 
abstained in April because an earlier version of the bill made child 
pornography a felony; since then the language has been changed, keeping it a 
misdemeanor -- which carries a less serious penalty, said Umberg's chief of 
staff, George Urch. Umberg's decision to support the bill was based solely on 
that change, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some protesters questioned the motives of Umberg, who is an 
expected candidate for state attorney general and has been pushing several 
public safety bills to represent himself as one of the Democratic Party's key 
crime fighters. Rosemarie Avila, a speaker at the rally and a trustee of the 
Santa Ana Unified School District, wanted to know why it took a public outcry 
during an election year to influence his vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill goes next to the Ways and Means Committee for approval.

UCI TO GO AHEAD WITH CENTER PLANS; EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR REASSURES BOARD OF HER 
SUPPORT FOR HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY IN WAKE OF VICE CHANCELLOR'S RESIGNATION.

<P>
 Trustees of the UC Irvine College of Medicine on Tuesday declared their 
commitment to proceed without delay to develop a Center for Health Sciences 
despite the surprise resignation last month of Vice Chancellor and Dean Walter 
Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening, who met with the trustees for more than 
two hours in a closed-door session, reassured them of her support for the 
long-term plan of creating a $350-million medical research and clinical complex 
on 40 acres on the west side of campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees rejected the suggestion that the board should temporarily rescind 
its decision to loan $3 million for construction of the first phase of the 
center, a neuroscience research institute, because of Henry's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry resigned after a dispute with Wilkening over a proposed restructuring of 
the administration of the university's health sciences programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the trustees, Susan Meister, had predicted that the project would 
suffer a gap in leadership after the resignation of Henry, who had conceived 
the center as an interdisciplinary project that could be developed in 
partnership with the county's burgeoning biotechnology industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after Tuesday's meeting, Wilkening said she had told the 
trustees that she will hire someone to take charge of completing plans for the 
neuroscience institute in February. By the end of the year, she said, she 
expects to seek bids for construction of the institute, which may cost between 
$20 million and $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening also said she would appoint an interim dean of the medical school 
next month, although she added that "the search will take months for a 
permanent dean." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Segerstrom, co-chairman of the board of trustees, said after the meeting 
that Wilkening was convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a lot of discussion, the board has confidence in the (Center for Health 
Sciences) project and that it will move ahead. It is important for Orange 
County and its future." 
</P>
<P>
 Segerstrom said the board adopted a resolution of appreciation for Henry's 
"vision" in campaigning for the Center for Health Sciences and his 
contributions as "an individual and a professor in the field of medicine and a 
leader in Orange County."

DISNEY SETTLES SUIT OVER RESORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a settlement agreement with 
litigants in one of two remaining lawsuits opposing the proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement ends nearly seven months of negotiations among the city, Walt 
Disney Co. and the various property owners who sued over the impacts of the 
proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 The litigants, who include the owners of the Anaheim Plaza Resort Hotel and 
members of the Schlund family, who own property near Disneyland, agreed to drop 
the suit in exchange for undisclosed concessions from Disney and the city's 
pledge to eliminate one of two designs for a parking structure that was under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said he was pleased with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials declined to discuss details of the settlement. City officials 
said settlement is near in the final lawsuit brought by the owner of Tiffy's 
Family Restaurant.

PHONE CALLS TO SANTA ANA DISRUPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A glitch in a Pacific Bell timing device may be the reason why telephone 
service was disrupted for two hours Tuesday afternoon, affecting an unknown 
number of callers trying to get through to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The malfunction may have affected all of Santa Ana's 30 prefixes, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, which lasted from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m., may have been caused by a 
timing device in Pacific Bell's central office in Anaheim, said company 
spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen. She said the malfunction disrupted the service 
between Santa Ana and the outside intermittently, sometimes allowing callers to 
get through.

 Kind of like Whitey's old role with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the name plate said during his first 2 1/2 years on the Autry 
payroll, it never had it quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Senior Vice President, Player Personnel," was what they called him when he 
came aboard in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, it became: "General Manager." 
</P>
<P>
 And now: "Consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 So the gig is up. 
</P>
<P>
 After 2 1/2 years, Herzog and the Angels finally decided to come clean, sweep 
aside the pretense and call a spade a spade -- and a baseball consultant a 
baseball consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Angels, Herzog has never been more than a phone call away. That's a 
job description, not a location. Need to finalize a trade? Phone Whitey at the 
ski lodge. Closing in on a free agent? Leave a message on Whitey's answering 
machine, he's gone fishing. Think we should run a physical first on this Kelly 
Gruber person? Oops, line's busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some general managers end up being acclaimed as AL or NL executive of the 
year. With a little better luck, Herzog could have been MCI executive of the 
year. Herzog was baseball's first absentee GM -- he ran a ballclub based in 
Anaheim from his den in St. Louis -- and based on the evidence before us today, 
the best thing he generally managed from there was his leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest job in baseball today is being the general manager," Herzog said 
Tuesday, appropriately enough, on a conference call from Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "A manager, when his season is over, he can walk away from it. But a general 
manager's job is never done. It's a 24-hour-a-day job." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog and the Angels often tried to fake it, however, which is more the 
club's fault than it is his. The Angels were the ones who came crawling to 
Herzog in '91, throwing money at his reputation, as if it could buy them 
credibility. Herzog made a few demands, one of them being his business address. 
He wanted to stay in St. Louis, operating the show by fax and phone. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, the Angels told Herzog. Kick back, we'll keep you posted. Anything 
else? Move all our home games to St. Louis? Well, we already looked into that, 
Whitey. Seems that the Cardinals already have the place booked. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Angel President Richard Brown insisted that Herzog's long-distance 
relationship with the club was not a detriment. "I keep a beeper with me at all 
times," Brown said. "It has an 800 number. I was never out of contact with 
Whitey. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways, his living in St. Louis helped us. It saved us money on 
scouting trips to Chicago and the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains the Angels' recent additions of ex-St. Louis Cardinal Joe 
Magrane, ex-Kansas City Royal Kurt Stillwell, ex-Minnesota Twin Chili Davis and 
ex-Montreal Expo Spike Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who tried to keep tabs on the Angels' off-season maneuvering in the 
sports section, it also made for funnier reading than the comics page. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, Herzog traded Lee Stevens to Montreal for a pitcher named Jeff 
Tuss, unaware that Tuss had already left the Expos organization to play 
quarterback at Fresno State. Oh well, Whitey said, "he wasn't going to be 
Walter Johnson anyways." 
</P>
<P>
 Days before, Herzog had acquired Gruber from Toronto, only to learn later that 
Gruber had suffered a career-threatening shoulder injury in the previous World 
Series. Herzog learned this when a reporter tracked him down at a ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days passed between the Angels' signing of free-agent pitcher Scott 
Sanderson and Herzog's knowledge of it. Again, a reporter, phoning east, broke 
the news. Just last month, when the Angels had to decide whether or not to 
tender reliever Steve Frey a 1994 contract, the Dec. 20 deadline passed with 
assistant general manager Bill Bavasi failing to reach Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason: Malfunctioning answering machine at the Herzog residence. 
</P>
<P>
 On those occasions when the Angels were able to get ahold of Herzog, the news 
was seldom good. 
</P>
<P>
 Out the door, one by one, went Wally Joyner, Dave Winfield, Bryan Harvey, Jim 
Abbott, Mike Fetters, Mark Eichhorn, Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
 In came Von Hayes, Hubie Brooks, Alvin Davis, Chuck Crim, Russ Springer, 
Gruber and Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog's best trade for the Angels? Dick Schofield for Julio Valera. Valera 
went 8-11 in 1992, hurt his arm in camp last season, went 3-6 with a 6.62 ERA 
through June and underwent ligament reconstruction surgery in his right elbow 
on July 8. It's uncertain if, or when, he will pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog's best free-agent signing for the Angels? Chili Davis, even though it 
amounted to little more than righting an old wrong. Chili, who never should 
have been let out the door in the first place, returned to Anaheim in 1993 and 
drove in 112 runs. Not quite Barry Bonds, but, then, compare the size of the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, Herzog was acting primarily as executioner on the Autrys' payroll 
guillotine. It couldn't have been much fun, which probably explains why he 
stayed out of the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today in baseball . . . when you talk about a player, you talk about 
arbitration, if he has a guaranteed contract, when he's going to be a free 
agent," Herzog lamented. "We never really talk about whether he can run, hit 
and throw." 
</P>
<P>
 The game changed on Herzog. So did the rules. Long gone are the days when he 
made his name as a wheeler-dealer, when he traded 14 players for 11 during the 
1980 winter meetings. With the Angels, Herzog was left to pound his fist when 
$16 million was not enough to re-sign either Joyner or Abbott . . . or when 
free agents Bobby Bonilla and Danny Tartabull said maybe, only to leave him 
empty-handed . . . or when the local media dared to question his genius as a 
talent scout. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that threw Whitey when he came here," Brown said, "was the 
hostile press. He came in from Kansas City and St. Louis, where he was almost a 
deity. But the media here looked at him and said, 'OK, the guy's got a pretty 
good record, but what's he gonna do here?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitey's approach was, 'I don't have to show you anything. My track record 
speaks for itself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog had a point. With St. Louis, he was a good general manager, 
considerably more effective than he was in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But with St. Louis, he had two distinct advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 And a St. Louis address.

HERZOG RIDES INTO SUNSET, STUNS ANGELS; BASEBALL: THE GENERAL MANAGER, 62, 
GIVES UP CONTROL ONLY MONTHS AFTER WINNING A POWER STRUGGLE OVER KEY PERSONNEL 
DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whitey Herzog dramatically appeared 2 1/2 years ago at an Angel news 
conference and was hailed as the savior of the organization. He, in turn, vowed 
to win a World Series for the Cowboy, Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, Herzog's voice filtered over a speaker phone in a cramped 
Angel office as he announced his retirement as general manager. He had been no 
savior. There had been no World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, heavily criticized for being an absentee executive, simply said that 
the time had come for him to step aside. Bill Bavasi, who became assistant 
general manager in September, will replace Herzog on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of his decision surprised even his closest associates. If he had 
done this in September, when he was involved in a bitter power struggle with 
Dan O'Brien, no one would have raised an eyebrow. If he had resigned a year 
ago, when he was fed up with the budgetary constraints of owner Jackie Autry, 
Gene's wife, most would have understood. 
</P>
<P>
 But to resign now, only four months after having been given absolute authority 
in player-personnel decisions, and five weeks from the opening of spring 
training, was baffling. Herzog surrenders the final year of his $800,000 
contract and will be an unpaid consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that it's time for me to do some of the things I want to 
do," Herzog said from Springfield, Mo. "I don't really want to be traveling all 
over and going back and forth to California or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't think Bill Bavasi was so capable of doing the job for the next 25 
years, then I don't know if I would have done this at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, whose father, Buzzie, is a former general manager for the Angels, 
Dodgers and San Diego Padres, been with the organization the last 13 years. He 
had been the farm director before becoming the assistant general manager in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Whitey might retire at the end of the year, at the earliest," 
Bavasi said. "For him to do it now is a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable with it, but maybe that's because I'm too dumb to know that I 
shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite Herzog's insistence that there was no ulterior motive for his 
retirement, it sparked immediate rumors: The Boston Red Sox are interviewing 
candidates for general manager this week. The Kansas City Royals are expected 
to have a new owner this summer, David Glass, who is a close friend of 
Herzog's. Perhaps the negotiations with free-agent relief pitcher Gregg Olson 
caused yet another clash with Autry. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Whitey was determined that he accomplished what he could with the Angels," 
club President Richard Brown said. "If you read anything else into it, you're 
wrong. I thought he'd resign in spring training or after the season started, 
depending on what he could accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't fault a man who's 62 to do this now." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, who was talked out of quitting last September, appeared to be 
invigorated by his authoritative role after O'Brien's firing Sept. 20. He 
declared that the Angels would be aggressive in the marketplace and that there 
would be no reason for them not to contend in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems remained. Herzog was told that the Angels' budget would have 
to be slashed to about $19 million, and instead of acquiring players in the 
free-agent market, he couldn't even secure his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He alienated several of his players in negotiations with his brash, sometimes 
abusive style. He screamed at starter Mark Langston in a closed-door session. 
He slammed the phone in reliever Steve Frey's ear. He bullied agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great deal of respect and recognition among his peers, but the 
reality now is that this is a different era, and he hasn't crossed that 
bridge," said Steve Comte, Frey's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arn Tellem, Langston's agent: "Whitey just has a different style. 
Whitey's strengths were finding and evaluating players, but not in the art of 
diplomacy dealing with lawyers and agents." 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of other criticism. Although he came to the Angels with the 
reputation of being a genius, Herzog's tenure was pockmarked with blunders. He 
was unable to re-sign Wally Joyner and Dave Winfield, and signed free 
agent-bust Gary Gaetti. Joyner and Winfield continued as stars elsewhere and 
Gaetti flopped as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the decision not to protect Bryan Harvey in the expansion draft; 
Harvey saved 45 games last season for the Florida Marlins. There was the trade 
that sent Jim Abbott away, and the one that brought Kelly Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Whitey started to believe the accolades," one associate said. "He 
really believed that he'd bring a World Series to the Cowboy. But even his 
magnetism wasn't going to bring him a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog came and went without even his closest associates fully understanding 
what happened. It seemed odd to them that Herzog was in town all week, 
conducting scouting meetings and negotiating sessions, and didn't even hint at 
the possibility of leaving. It wasn't until Friday, shortly before leaving for 
a Colorado skiing trip, that he told Brown of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown told Herzog to reconsider during the weekend. Herzog called Monday and 
said his decision was final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as surprised as anyone by this," said Bob Harrison, Herzog's special 
assistant and close friend. "He never said a word about it. He was planning 
everything, had everything lined up, and was getting ready for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought he would go this whole year, and then say if the club is 
close, or if he gets a bigger budget, he'd be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no indication of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Buck Rodgers: "I think everyone knows that Whitey has been 
frustrated about some things over the years, but I thought he'd be here past 
the all-star break. But you know, the hardest part about this is going back to 
work after skiing and fishing. I think he just wanted to curtail the 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep," Herzog acknowledged, "Now, I don't have any."

TRAINER JEFF LUKAS PULLS OUT OF COMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas, recovering from injuries suffered when he was knocked down by a 
runaway horse in the barn area at Santa Anita on Dec. 15, is no longer in a 
coma and has been shifted from intensive care to a private hospital room, a 
spokeswoman for the Wayne Lukas Racing Stable said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff has been improving daily," Peggy Yost said. "He has been recognizing 
voices and there has been considerable movement of his hands. He is not 
talking. His condition was upgraded from serious to fair a week ago, and that's 
what it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Yost also said that Lukas' pneumonia is under control and is no longer 
considered a threat. His body temperature has been stabilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, 36, is the son of trainer Wayne Lukas and the stable's No. 1 assistant. 
Tabasco Cat, a stakes-winning colt, got away from his handlers and ran into the 
younger Lukas, who suffered multiple skull fractures as he tried to flag the 
horse down. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlifted from Santa Anita to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena shortly 
after the accident, Lukas was listed in critical condition for more than two 
weeks. There was an upgrade to serious before the further upgrade to fair last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They moved him out into a hallway last Saturday, and he wasn't used to the 
commotion," said trainer Randy Bradshaw, a former assistant to Wayne Lukas. 
"But when they asked Jeff if he wanted to go back to his room, he waved his arm 
to indicate no. So he's becoming aware of some things." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas has continued to train during his son's hospitalization. Bradshaw 
helped Lukas saddle a few horses during the closing days of the Hollywood Park 
meeting, shortly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've noticed the change in Wayne the last few days," Bradshaw said. "It's 
been amazing. He's been much more upbeat. You could tell that he's been 
encouraged by Jeff's progress. It's been great to see, because about a week 
ago, Wayne was about as depressed as I've ever seen him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas said during the weekend that one of the well-wishers inquiring 
about his son had been President Clinton's mother, Virginia Kelley, who died of 
complications from cancer last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was something," Wayne Lukas said. "She must have called only four days 
before she died." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lukases have frequently raced at Oaklawn Park, the track in Hot Springs, 
Ark., where Kelley was a regular visitor. They had back-to-back winners of the 
Arkansas Derby, with Althea in 1984 and Tank's Prospect in 1985.

BLACK GROUP MIGHT STAGE A WALKOUT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACHES WOULD PULL THEIR 
TEAMS TO PROTEST NCAA'S FAILURE TO INCREASE SCHOLARSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Black college basketball coaches might withhold their teams from competition 
as a means of showing their displeasure with NCAA convention delegates' failure 
to restore a scholarship in men's basketball, leaders of the Black Coaches 
Assn. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The BCA has definitely agreed that there will be some boycotts," USC Coach 
George Raveling said Tuesday night after a three-hour conference call with 
members of the association's executive committee. "There will be players 
involved. As to the when, where and how, we're mot going to make any public 
statements on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Washington, Drake University coach and executive director of the BCA, 
indicated in an interview with the Associated Press that white coaches might 
also participate and that the boycott might be open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are talking about the entire season, like the baseball strike," he told 
the AP. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Division I representatives to approve legislation increasing 
the scholarship limit in men's basketball from 13 to 14 has angered coaches and 
others who believe the decision will have a disproportionate effect on blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 College chief executive officers attending the convention fought the measure, 
saying it would signal a retreat on reform legislation initiated by the NCAA 
Presidents Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship limit in men's basketball has dropped from 15 in 1991 to 14 
last year and to 13 this year as a result of the presidents' cost-containment 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, Washington, Georgetown's John Thompson and Temple's John Chaney were 
among those who participated in the conference call to plan the BCA's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said talks among association members would be ongoing and that "all 
creative ideas" were being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Dempsey, NCAA executive director, declined to discuss the implications 
of such a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a boycott, what kind? How long?" he said. "We could play all 
kinds of speculative games, and I don't think that would be productive at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic administrators attending the NCAA convention were bracing, however, 
for a walkout on Saturday, Martin Luther King's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's real concern it could happen this weekend," said Dennis Farrell, 
commissioner of the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is scheduled to play at Washington State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson told the News-Tribune of Tacoma: 
"There's a possibility we'll play, and a possibility we won't. Something 
definitely will happen, but I don't have an answer for you (as to) what it will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, whose team is scheduled to play at Washington on 
Saturday, said he could not comment on a possible boycott because he had heard 
no details on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hansen, Pacific 10 Conference commissioner, said conference rules dictate 
that a team lose by forfeit if it fails to appear at tipoff. There is no rule 
to cover a situation in which both teams fail to show, Pac-10 officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say what we'd do (if both teams boycotted)," said David Price, 
Pac-10 associate commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrett, USC athletic director, said he was unsure how he would handle a 
walkout by Raveling and his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a question I'm asking myself, and I don't know the answer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett would not, however, support such action. He believes the convention 
sufficiently addressed the issue of blacks' access to higher education when 
Division I representatives approved a resolution calling for further study of 
tougher academic requirements due to take effect in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little patience would go a long way right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Harris, athletic director at Arizona State, offered a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significant issue here was the business of reviewing the academic issue," 
he said. "The question of one scholarship is a minor component (in the access 
issue)." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the BCA, NCAA and National Assn. of Basketball Coaches held 
discussions Tuesday in an effort to deal with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the convention Tuesday afternoon, NCAA President Joseph 
Crowley issued a statement expressing the NCAA's desire to continue working 
with the BCA to "address higher education's moral obligation to provide young 
people in economically disadvantaged communities some hope and opportunity to 
participate in the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference, Crowley, president of the University of Nevada, 
said he does not believe college presidents erred in branding a vote to add the 
basketball scholarship as a vote against reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't want to second-guess what the Presidents Commission decided 
to do," he said. "The problem is, the issue evolved into one with far greater 
symbolic significance than any of us could have predicted. It became a win-lose 
issue. . . . That became a fact of life. The issue had to be voted up or down 
based on points of view. And there was tremendous variance in those points of 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if NCAA leaders had presented coaches with a specific proposal that 
could stop a walkout, Crowley said: "We're not talking about a quid pro quo. We 
would hope that a boycott does not occur. But there is no package on the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A four-member "research group" set up to study the feasibility of a Division I 
football playoff held its first meeting during the convention. NCAA Executive 
Director Cedric Dempsey, a member of the panel, said the group hopes to 
complete its report this spring. . . . Delegates approved legislation that will 
allow college basketball players to enter the NBA draft without losing their 
eligibility as long as they announce plans to remain in school within 30 days 
after the draft. The rule goes into effect immediately.

MIKE DOWNEY: A GAME OF X'S, O'S AND OH WOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How will the Raiders defeat the Buffalo Bills in their playoff game Saturday 
at Buffalo? Let me count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Peat and repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Marcus Allen. When you need short yardage for a touchdown, you go with 
the NFL's fullest fullback, 305-pound Todd Peat, between the quarterback and 
tailback, as the Raiders successfully did against Denver. Here is how the play 
is diagramed: 09,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04 o o o o o o o o o O o Jeff 
Hostetler takes the snap. He gets out of Peat's way. Several Buffalo Bills try 
to get the license number of the recreational vehicle that just ran over them. 
Napoleon McCallum or Ty Montgomery takes handoff and follows OVERSIZED LOAD 
sign into end zone. Six points. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The old Trapp play. 
</P>
<P>
 An opponent is in your face. You want to break his concentration. Quick, you 
call on rookie cornerback James Trapp, who is standing on your sideline in his 
street clothes. Here is how the play is diagramed: 
12,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04 o o o o o o o o o o o Trapp is spread 
far right, standing out of bounds between Coach Art Shell and the portable 
heater. Some Buffalo dude tries to mess with Hostetler near the sideline. Out 
pops Trapp to pop the Buffalo dude in the chops. As at the Denver game, no 
penalty is called because referee figures Trapp must be some crazy fan who 
dropped in by parachute. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Throw long. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you really want to get under your opponent's skin. Thurman Thomas, say, is 
having a very good day. You assign defensive tackle Nolan Harrison to pick up 
Thurman's helmet and fling it like a discus, same as he did recently to a 
player from Tampa Bay. Thurman eventually will line up without his helmet, like 
so: 09,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 o As you recall, Thurman 
Thomas has been known to forget his helmet in big games. He once missed the 
first series of a Super Bowl for this reason. This led to another in a 
tradition of Super Bowl flops for Buffalo, as well as inspiring a new TV series 
on the Fox network, "Thurman's Head." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Rocket science. 
</P>
<P>
 Up near Niagara Falls, where this game will be played, they see so much 
Canadian football on TV that occasionally they forget the rules. Rocket Ismail 
played in the CFL before joining the Raiders. Canada uses a wider field. 
Therefore, you line up Rocket alongside James Trapp, out of bounds, like so: 
12,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04 o o o o o o oo o o o o At the snap, 
Ismail goes long. Buffalo Bills are distracted by Trapp, who threatens to go 
after more of their players. Rocket runs out of bounds, dodging photographers 
and guys carrying first-down chains. At the last minute, he cuts onto the 
field, catches a touchdown pass. Referees, accustomed to seeing Ismail on wider 
field, validate touchdown over Buffalo Coach Marv Levy's screams. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The Shell game. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell is anxious. He fears his players need more motivation. 
Suddenly, a light bulb goes on above Art's head. He huddles with his advisers. 
Quickly, they diagram a new play. It includes not only the players, but also 
the coaches, like so: 12,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,04,05 o o o o o o o x0x 
o o o o The big O is Shell. The X's are Gunther Cunningham, assistant coach in 
charge of defense, and Tom Walsh, assistant coach in charge of offense. At a 
key moment in the game, Cunningham and Walsh go after one another. One calls 
the other a high school coach. The other makes a lunge for his nose, same way 
Buddy Ryan recently did. This strategy has kept the Houston Oilers' blood 
boiling. Could work for the Raiders, too. 
</P>
<P>
 By executing these plays, I believe the Raiders will take Saturday's game, 
51-3, then pay several heavy NFL fines.

NFL PLAYOFFS; HE RUNS WITH FAST CROWD; BUT RAIDERS' JETT PROVES HE'S NOT ONLY A 
TRACK STAR, HE'S A BIG-GAME, BIG-PLAY RECEIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider rookie wide receiver James Jett just wanted to relax after the Raiders' 
playoff victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't want to stay home. So he decided to stop by a local dance club, 
where he ran into some old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, you made some great catches out there today," one of Jett's friends said 
about his three catches for 111 yards and a touchdown. "You can really play 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 The others agreed. What made the praise so special to Jett, though, was that 
it was coming from three of the fastest runners in the world -- Leroy Burrell, 
Dennis Mitchell and Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
 The three sprinters were Jett's Olympic track and field teammates in Barcelona 
in the summer of '92. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was funny to hear stuff like that come out of those guys' mouths," said 
Jett, who won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the U.S. 400-meter relay 
team. "To know that they watched the game and saw me play is a great feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, just to have guys who are above me at that level in track 
congratulate me felt good. It's special to know that I have respect from guys 
who I respect in track." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has the respect of his football peers. But getting it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinters who become NFL wide receivers have to face critics who question 
their pass catching and toughness. Jett was no exception. When he signed with 
the Raiders as a free agent, he heard all the comments. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard people say behind his back, "He may have run in the Olympics and may 
have 4.2 speed, but his hands are 4.8." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, once he started catching passes after blowing past defenders while 
wearing shorts during the Raiders' mini-camp last May, Jett heard doubters 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might look good now, but wait until the pads are on and the hitting really 
starts," was the conventional wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett said he didn't let those comments bother him because he was confident of 
his ability. He knew most of the critics didn't realize that he had been a 
football player all his life, a football player who happened to be a track star 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Jett was a three-year starter at quarterback and wide 
receiver. As a senior, he was an all-state selection who was considered so good 
that a news conference was held in his hometown of Shenandoah Junction, W.Va., 
when he announced his college choice.  
</P>
<P>
 At the University of West Virginia, Jett's four-year statistics were not 
anything to write home about, but they did say something about his big-play 
ability and toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught 67 passes for 1,384 yards and 11 touchdowns as a wide receiver and 
returned 72 punts for 522 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time for the 1993 NFL draft, Jett was seen as a track star. After 
all, he had recorded the fastest 200-meter time in the country in 1992, 19.91. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider owner Al Davis saw Jett as a football player, someone with young legs 
who could give his offense a deep threat.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a crowd at wide receiver, what with Tim Brown, Alexander Wright, 
Willie Gault, Sam Graddy, James Lofton, Daryl Hobbs and Charles Jordan there, 
and Rocket Ismail waiting in the wings, but Davis and the Raiders handled Jett 
with kid gloves.  
</P>
<P>
 Jett was impressive in training camp at Oxnard, but he heard critics again 
when he dropped two passes against Green Bay in the exhibition opener, the Hall 
of Fame game in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he was just a little nervous in that game,"' Coach Art Shell said. "But I 
knew he'd be all right because James never had a lack of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 And Jett did settle down, slowly working his way up the depth chart. By the 
time the regular season started, Jett was in the rotation as the third wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adjustment from college to pro was tough for me because everything 
happened so fast," Jett said. "I had to learn how to run routes, while reading 
defenses on the move. I had to do a lot of studying." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett had his moments in the Raiders' first five games, but the game that made 
him a fixture in their deep passing game was the Monday night game at Denver in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett made the big play when he caught a 12-yard pass and turned it into a 
crowd-quieting 74-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that was the first real big NFL catch for me this season," Jett 
said. "That catch was big because it helped us win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After that game, Jett became the leader in the AFC in yards per catch, causing 
sleepless nights for opposing defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 His fairy-tale rookie season hit a snag in the middle of the season when he 
suffered through an up-and-down three-game stretch in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 31-20 loss to Kansas City on Nov. 14, Jett dropped several key passes. 
The next week at San Diego, however, he caught seven for 138 yards. Then, on 
Nov. 28 at Cincinnati, he dropped a pass and had a costly fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "That stuff happens, but James has been a good receiver for us all season," 
Shell said. "He believes in his ability and I expect him to get better and 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 In helping the Raiders win five of their last six games, Jett has become their 
big-play man, with a 24.5-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Denver last Sunday, he made two big plays in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Raiders' second possession, he caught a 44-yard pass, setting up their 
first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the second quarter, he made a spectacular over-the-head catch for a 
touchdown on a play that was good for 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to really adjust for that ball," Jett said. "It's amazing that I made 
my two biggest catches against the Broncos because Denver was my favorite team 
growing up. It feels good to be making plays now, because I know that I've 
worked hard to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 But does he miss track? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I don't miss it," he said. "After what has happened for me this 
season, track is on the back burner."

COMMENTARY / BOB OATES; ONE OF RYAN'S PROBLEMS IS THAT HE KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT 
OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During what will probably be Buddy Ryan's last month in Houston, it might be 
well to consider one of his great failings: 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to offensive football, Ryan, the defensive coordinator of the 
Oilers, is a know-nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 His sideline fight earlier this month with a fellow assistant coach was simply 
another manifestation of that. 
</P>
<P>
 The other assistant is Kevin Gilbride, the offensive coordinator Ryan punched 
because he was upset by Gilbride calls.  
</P>
<P>
 As if Ryan could tell the difference between good and bad offensive calls. 
</P>
<P>
 His whole career is a demonstration of the truism that offensive inadequacies 
will eventually ruin any coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, for example, Ryan's simplistic notions of offense cost him a 
good job as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. And as recently as this 
week, he showed again that he hasn't learned a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Gilbride has) a third-down offense, not a pro offense," Ryan said, berating 
his team's offensive leader again in an interview with the Philadelphia 
Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbride's offense is based on throwing a lot of passes on first and second 
downs, most of them short. That is also the style of the Dallas Cowboys and the 
San Francisco 49ers, and it is no coincidence that those three teams are all 
strongly in the running for the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Theirs are the most effective offensive styles in modern football. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ryan still prefers smash-mouth football -- a smash run on first down, a 
smash run on second down, and then a prayer pass into the teeth of defenses 
that are prepared for third-down passing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ryan way was most noticeably on view at Philadelphia in 1988, '89 and '90. 
Three times his defense -- the league's best -- pushed the Eagles into the 
playoffs, where, all three times, his offense pushed them quickly out. 
</P>
<P>
 The year he had perhaps his best shot at the Super Bowl, he blew it when he 
impulsively benched his quarterback, Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of a still-undecided playoff game, he pulled Cunningham, even 
though the offensive team's problems were Ryan's, clearly, not Cunningham's.  
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier era in Chicago, where Ryan was the Bears' defensive coordinator, 
he criticized the Coach Mike Ditka's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 As a strategist, Ditka may never be confused with Bill Walsh, but he was an 
offensive player in his time who played tight end so well that he's in the Hall 
of Fame. And as a coach, he once led the Bears into the Super Bowl, where the 
Chicago offense was overwhelmingly superior, scoring touchdowns in bunches and 
needing little help from Ryan's defense to win a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditka's big play that day was an Al Davis-like long pass to Willie Gault, now 
a Raider. An aging advocate of old-fashioned football, Ryan didn't think much 
of that call. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy of Ryan is that a role as the best defensive coach of his time 
doesn't make him happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does his role as one of the best talent scouts since Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan is a master of two of the only three things that matter in football: 
offense, defense, and personnel evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 His judgment on young offensive candidates is, ironically, excellent. He just 
can't coach them, lacking the knowledge of the nuances of offense that he shows 
on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for one of the few times in his career, Ryan is on a team with a 
superb offense, Gilbride's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this good: 
</P>
<P>
 In its last game last January, in the playoffs, it held a 35-3 lead -- in the 
third quarter, on a cold day in Buffalo -- over a Super Bowl-bound team that 
pulled it out to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' defense, in other words, lost a game that their run-and-shoot 
offense had seemingly safely won with a four-wide receiver attack that made the 
Bills ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even though Ryan owes his job with the Oilers to the fact that their 
defense couldn't hold a 32-point lead in a big game, he still maintains that 
the run-and-shoot lost the day in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 When immediately after that game the Oilers hired him, it seemed probable that 
they would finally reach the Super Bowl this winter. Their repaired team would 
be unstoppable with Ryan's defense and the same explosive offense -- or so it 
appeared then. 
</P>
<P>
 And it appeared so this season for much of the year -- even when the Oilers 
started 1-4 last September. It simply took them awhile to learn Ryan's complex 
defense. Since they learned it, his players and Houston's run-and-shoot players 
have combined to win 11 in a row -- the league's longest streak this year -- 
pretty much as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ryan can't stand it. He is still miserable. His offensive admonitions, 
flawed as they are, aren't being followed -- and he can't take it. 
</P>
<P>
 All season, he has criticized the AFC team that has the best chance to win the 
Super Bowl in a decade -- his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 It has that chance because of Ryan -- who has given the Oilers the tough-guy 
NFC-style defense that no other AFC contender has fielded lately -- and also 
because it still has Gilbride's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ryan's tirades have ended that chance, he has thrown away his future as 
well. No NFL owner is likely to trust him again. 
</P>
<P>
 What it means, finally, is that at ease on his farm, he will have plenty of 
time to read up on offense.

BUYUKUNCU'S SWIM GOALS BROUGHT HIM HERE FROM TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before he shattered a national high school swimming record, Derya Buyukuncu 
was just a difficult name to pronounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, it has rolled off college coaches' tongues easily and often. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu, a native of Istanbul, Turkey, came to the United States in the 
summer of 1991 to become a top-notch swimmer, something he felt he couldn't do 
against sub-par competition in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 13 and defeating second-place finishers by 10 seconds, it dawned 
on Buyukuncu that he would have to leave Turkey to realize his potential. His 
club coaches initially balked at their prize pupil leaving, but they eventually 
warmed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "They supported it, because they knew if I stayed in Turkey, I wouldn't reach 
my goals," Buyukuncu said. "But it's kind of sad, you have to leave your whole 
life behind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge High senior figured that with many of the nation's finest 
swimmers training in Southern California, he would be just another fast face in 
the crowd. He never dreamed he would establish a national standard in the 
100-yard backstroke, which he did at the 1993 Southern Section meet, or place 
first in the 100- and 200-meter back events against a tough field at the U.S. 
Open late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. swimmers, they are the best," he said. "I'm just a Turkish guy. I 
thought I'd be 20th or 25th, because (Americans are) that good." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Buyukuncu, who also swims for the Irvine-based Novaquatics, is good 
enough to have college recruiters desperately seeking his services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd get any attention," he said. "But after the national 
record, everybody called." 
</P>
<P>
 And he means everybody. So many, that he and his mother decided to change 
their telephone number -- it is now unlisted -- when recruiters' calls became 
bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd call and talk and talk and talk," said Buyukuncu, who has narrowed his 
choices to Michigan, Stanford and California.  
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu, an eight-year veteran of the Turkish national team, represented his 
country in the 1992 Olympics and hopes to compete in the 1994 World 
Championships and make a more successful bid in the 1996 Summer Olympics in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a foreign athlete in the United States has been a mixed blessing. While 
Buyukuncu has improved as he never could have in Turkey, his success hasn't 
been without cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss my family," said Buyukuncu, who left his father and an older sister in 
Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
 It also hit Buyukuncu hard when he was told he would have to sit out the 1992 
high school season because he didn't meet the state's residency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked when they told me about the rule," he said. "I didn't expect 
it. It's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has had to deal with a cool reception from many opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some think because I'm not American, I shouldn't be here," Buyukuncu said. 
"It's nothing they say, it's the looks I get. They don't want me to beat them. 
If I was finishing fifth or sixth, I don't think they'd mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't mind, as long as he keeps lowering his times. Besides, there 
are other advantages to living here. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyukuncu has found that leaving his country to train here has given him a new 
appreciation for his native land. "I think I do have more pride now," he said. 
"When I go home, I get a lot of attention. It's kind of like I'm a national 
hero."

CHAMPIONSHIP ADDS SPICE TO PINCIROLI'S U.S. EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enrolling at El Toro High began as a language thing for Brazilian Bill 
Pinciroli. 
</P>
<P>
 It later turned out to be a water polo thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Water polo is as traditional as empanadas in the Pinciroli family. His father 
played on two Olympic teams and his older sister is playing professionally in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pinciroli's first objective in coming to the United States two years ago 
was to learn English, then to play water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do both, but I would have come anyway," Pinciroli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Southern Section residency rules, Pinciroli, who is from Sao Paulo, 
Brazil's capital, was forced to sit out the 1992 varsity season, playing on the 
Chargers' practice team his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff wasn't disruptive. Pinciroli helped lead El Toro to a 
come-from-behind victory in the Division I Southern Section championship game, 
and was named the division's player of the year. He had a team-high 89 goals, 
an impressive 61.4% shooting percentage and contributed 52 assists and 58 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pinciroli isn't the only talented Brazilian water polo player at El Toro. 
According to Charger Coach Don Stoll, had senior Marco Avanzi been eligible -- 
he practiced with El Toro and was one of the team's most ardent supporters -- 
he would have threatened his fellow countryman's chances for player of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Pinciroli) was our best defensive and offensive player," Stoll said. "But 
Marco was very good, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Avanzi also came to California to improve his English and was disappointed he 
was unable to play. But he believes his presence in practices contributed to El 
Toro's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I helped the team to improve a lot," Avanzi said. "I wish I could 
have played, but my main goal here was to learn English." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinciroli was a Brazilian junior national team member for two years, but said 
the section championship was unlike any victory he has experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget that game," he said. "It was more exciting because I wasn't 
going to see the team together again." 
</P>
<P>
 And he won't soon forget winning the MVP award. "I wasn't expecting that," he 
said. "This is working very good for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Things could continue to work well for him here because college recruiters 
have shown interest. But unlike some foreign athletes who come to the United 
States, he doesn't plan to stay for college, not immediately anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to return to Brazil in March and try out for the national team -- as 
will Avanzi -- for a chance to compete at this summer's Pan American Games. 
Come September, he will enroll in a Brazilian university. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big deal for me to be on the national team," Pinciroli said. "I want 
to try for the Pan Am Games and possibly the Olympic Games. I'll start college 
in Brazil, then maybe I'll come back here or go to Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, his time here has been time well spent, in and out of the 
pool. His English is much improved, as is his water polo game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, water polo is played only at the club level. Here, where quality 
high school and college teams abound, Pinciroli has been able to test himself 
more regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (water polo) style here is different," he said. "It's more physical in 
Brazil; it's more technical here. I've improved a lot here. I've learned a lot. 
It's been great."

 Jenny Gonzalez and Roberto Intriago came to the United States from Paraguay 
and Ecuador for different reasons. Gonzalez was mainly interested in improving 
her tennis game, while Intriago wanted to work on his English. 
</P>
<P>
 But after spending some time away from home, Gonzalez and Intriago might 
eventually leave this country with many of the same things: a wealth of 
American friends, a better understanding of the English language and American 
culture and, quite possibly, a college education. 
</P>
<P>
 They were top junior tennis players in their homelands, but Gonzalez and 
Intriago grew tired of the pressure to succeed. Like other foreign athletes 
before them, they decided to come to the United States for an education -- or a 
change of pace. Once here, they learned a valuable lesson: Athletic skills can 
help transcend cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intriago, 18, tried out for the soccer team at Corona del Mar and quickly 
became one of its best and most well-liked players. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was nothing more than a casual soccer player in Ecuador -- it's 
the country's national sport, so everybody played -- Intriago quickly caught 
the eye of Corona del Mar's Jason Boyce, a four-year starter and a Times' 
all-county selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he first came here, he was unbelievable," Boyce said. "He was just 
toying with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Boyce barely knew anything about Intriago's culture, he realized they 
spoke the same language on a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He runs off the ball really well and does a lot of give-and-goes," Boyce 
said. "That's the way I like playing, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jed Weinstein said he was more impressed with Intriago's social 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected him not to speak a word of English, but he knows the jokes and 
everything," Weinstein said. "He's mixing in with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar boys' tennis Coach Tim Mang, who has coached several foreign 
players, said most foreign athletes assimilate rather well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very coachable and they seem to be sharper and less emotional than 
the typical American kid," Mang said. "They're very mature and they're very 
popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Intriago, who arrived in August as an exchange student who knew some English 
but little else about the United States, has been surprised by the way soccer 
has helped him fit in with his new peers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was very interested in sports, but I didn't come specifically for that," he 
said. "I figured if I could play soccer for the high school team, that would be 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez wasn't sure what to expect when she arrived nearly two years ago to 
live with her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never like you think it's going to be," Gonzalez said. "I thought it was 
going to be something special -- like you see in the movies. It wasn't that 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's first year was especially difficult. She didn't know the language 
and she had few friends at Valencia. But when she became eligible to play on 
the tennis team this year, things began falling into place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The social groups are so closed here," Gonzalez said. "It's hard breaking 
into them at first. My friend from Paraguay is finding that out now. She 
doesn't play sports and she speaks little English. She's having a tough time 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Intriago said he had no idea how many doors would open for him through sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put more emphasis on sports here, which I think is really good," 
Intriago said. "It gives some kids who wouldn't have a chance at a college 
education a chance to get a scholarship. I'm really considering trying to get 
one myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Intriago, who scored six goals in his first 10 games for Corona del Mar, is 
convinced an athletic scholarship is a realistic goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked with my coach (Ray Hales) and he said it could happen," Intriago 
said. "I have the skills. I just need to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he isn't seen by enough college soccer coaches, Intriago said he will 
put his tennis skills on display for coaches this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Intriago was a nationally ranked junior player until he suddenly retired from 
the sport three years ago, saying he was burned out. Although he has barely 
picked up a racket since, he said he'll attempt to regain his passion for the 
game if it means earning a free education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to see if it comes back," Intriago said. "My dad said he would like 
it if I could go to college over here. If I go back to Ecuador with a college 
degree from the United States, it would be more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have good universities in Ecuador, but (employers) will probably take you 
first with an American degree. If I could get a scholarship over here, it would 
make me so happy. It would make my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a 17-year-old junior, never considered attending a college in the 
United States until recently. She was too busy worrying about her tennis career 
and learning how to speak the language.  
</P>
<P>
 But now that she has begun to attract the attention of college tennis coaches, 
her priorities have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just really tired of tennis right now," she said. "I'll still play in 
weekend tournaments to keep sharp, but my concern now is playing tennis in 
college. The only reason I'm playing now is to get a college scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who went undefeated during the regular season at Valencia and 
advanced to the Southern Section individual singles quarterfinals, said she 
hasn't touched a racket in three weeks. She spent the last month in Paraguay, 
visiting her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending nearly two years here, Gonzalez said she's seeing a future 
outside of tennis for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my dad I want to go to college here and major in business," she said. 
"Now that I know two languages, I think I want to be a diplomat." 
</P>
<P>
 Had she stayed in Paraguay, Gonzalez said her life would be a lot easier and a 
lot less complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was spoiled at home," she said. "I have everything I want there. I realize 
that now. Over here, nothing comes easy. You have to work hard for everything. 
But that is not all bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually though, Gonzalez said she will probably return to Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'd go back after college," Gonzalez said. "But if I fall in love 
over here, you never know."

MOVE OVER, ANNIE OAKLEY; AT 14, ARROYO HIGH'S KIMBERLY RHODE ALREADY COMMANDS 
RESPECT FROM ADULT SKEET SHOOTERS -- DESPITE HER PATRIOTICALLY PAINTED BRACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tiny girl. Blond hair. Cute smile. Braces on her teeth. Kimberly Rhode is so 
. . . so disarming. 
</P>
<P>
 In another era, with fewer principles, she and her father, Richard, would have 
done well traveling the Wild West and playing the suckers for whatever they 
were worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late now. At 14 and only a freshman at Arroyo High School in El Monte, she 
has been a cover girl for Skeet magazine and is so well known among U.S. 
competitive shooters that whenever she shows up, all of the women -- and most 
of the men -- know they will be shooting for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, skeet shooting is not about hunting an endangered species but 
rather shooting orange clay discs thrown by man or machine to simulate birds in 
flight, or Kimberly Rhode (pronounced RO-dee) would have wiped out most of the 
endangered population by now. As it is, she keeps the production lines rolling 
by blasting several thousand "birds," as skeet shooters call their targets, out 
of the skies each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, she won her most important title: high overall women's champion 
in the World Skeet Championships at San Antonio. The men's winner, Wayne Mays, 
shot 548 of 550 birds. Kim shot 544 -- then beat Mays in a shootout for a gun. 
The only thing bigger is the Olympic Games, her target for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she intimidated by competing against grown-ups? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I never feel intimidated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them," she said. "I don't really know how to put this: I surprise a 
lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 No resentment? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm friends with everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In photos from various competitions, Kim is in her usual place among the 
winners. Everybody is smiling. She's the small one. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the time she shot doves from her dad's lap, Kim has been a natural. But 
she has practiced a lot, too. She can be found at the Pachmayr shooting range 
in El Monte two or three late afternoons a week, as soon as she gets out of 
school and her dad, a marine biologist, gets off work. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Kim shoots, except when she goes to the Olympic Training Center in 
Colorado Springs to train, Richard is usually there. But he says he is more of 
a chauffeur and caddie than a stage dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that I actually do for her is help her with her training," 
Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "He's my coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "But I don't push her." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "He doesn't force me to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "But I was a competitor myself in college, in wrestling, so I know 
what it takes to be a winner. The only thing I really do is help her with her 
reloading shells, to keep things together. When you're a kid, you're a kid, so 
I make sure she has her (shooting) glasses, her bag. Basically, I'm a cheap 
manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "No, you're not a manager, you're just a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with sponsors to provide shells and a $7,000 20-gauge shotgun, travel and 
entry fees cost Kim's parents about $500 a week. For that, Richard gets to 
stand behind the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they say, 'Kimberly Rhode,' and she and four other people go out to the 
field, she's on her own," Richard said. "I can't go on the field. I can't give 
her any coaching. I can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Except, he added, "bite my fingernails to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "He does all the worrying for me. We almost need to give him Valium to 
calm down. He just goes crazy behind the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 At San Antonio, Richard said: "The competition was extremely fierce. Several 
women were one bird behind her. Kim missed one bird of 250 in the 12-gauge. One 
lady ran them (shot all 250), and three other ladies shot the same as Kim." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "Pressure doesn't bother me. There is no pressure. I'm just having a good 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "People say she has ice in her veins. She has so many meets under her 
belt that she doesn't have butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said that she doesn't even get excited, adding, "I'm just the same, just 
like I was out here tonight (practicing) . . . maybe a little more serious." 
</P>
<P>
 She slipped only in the .410 competition, her favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was rainy and windy on that one," she said, adding that it was a bit of a 
slip for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually a better shooter in the rain and the wind. Some of the (top men) 
only shoot the good shoots, so their scores are really high. When it rains or 
snows, their scores go for a dive." 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Open at Boston last year was well named. The few 
competitors who didn't back out had sleet blowing into their faces and caking 
their goggles. The birds were difficult to pick up. Kim was high woman and the 
top sub-junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands were so cold I couldn't feel when I was pulling the trigger," she 
said. "I can block out anything I want. I've been in my classroom reading a 
book (with) the teacher calling my name, and I don't even hear him." 
</P>
<P>
 She did best in the 12- and 20-gauge classes at San Antonio, breaking 249 of 
250 and 100 of 100, respectively. She doesn't actually shoot a 12-gauge -- its 
kick is too strong for her -- but uses her smaller 20-gauge in that class, 
giving her only about half the firepower of her rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "To her it isn't a disadvantage, because the recoil would be a disadvantage," 
Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I weighed 99 pounds this morning," Kim said. "Let's say a hundred pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 And how tall is she? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, 5-2 or something, 5-3, 5-1, I don't know," Kim said. "I just now started 
to grow. In eighth grade, I could go under one of those 4 1/2-foot bars (in the 
theme parks). I couldn't make it on any of the rides. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) I don't think I'm handicapped," she said. "I'm used to doing it. I've 
never shot a 12-gauge." 
</P>
<P>
 And she isn't lifting weights so she can. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need to," she said. "Why change when you're doing so well? I've 
never had a slump." 
</P>
<P>
 And she knows what she's doing all the way around the skeet arc's eight 
shooting stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first station, (bird released from the) high house, you aim six inches 
below," she said. "Low house, you aim a foot ahead of it. Doubles (two at a 
time), same thing. Station 2, you aim two feet ahead for the high, two feet 
ahead for the low. Station 3, you go three feet ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've shot so much I don't have to go through that (thought) process. It's 
like walking. It's just automatic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Muscle memory," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said: "You can't think, 'Oh, I should be pulling the trigger now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the Olympics, she is working to improve her skill in the international 
style, in which the shooter isn't allowed to raise the gun to the shoulder 
until the bird is released and, unlike American skeet, the bird is not 
necessarily released immediately on the shooter's command of "pull." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim will figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She keeps her grades very high," Richard said, noting that his daughter was 
on the honor roll in junior high last year, and added that a room at home is 
devoted to her trophies, medals, ribbons and other awards -- 48 medals from San 
Antonio alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "(She also won) athlete of the month or year or something at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "I did?" 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "You've got that certificate in the scrapbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "Oh, that's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "You win so much stuff, you just kind of lose track of it. It's hard 
to keep things straight. Medals and trophies really mean very little to her . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "They mean a lot to my dad!" 
</P>
<P>
 Richard: "She likes the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim: "No, it's not that. I like to travel. I like meeting a lot of new people. 
I like having fun . . . missing school -- no, just kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 But when she paints her braces red, white and blue for competitions, it is 
difficult to take her seriously. At least until the shooting starts.

HIS ANGUISH LINGERS LONG AFTER THE KICK; NOTRE DAME'S HERRERA HAS RECOVERED 
SLOWLY FROM A SOCCER ASSAULT THAT RECEIVED NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sight last fall of Harvard-Westlake's soccer field jolted Ryan Herrera, 
nine months after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Notre Dame High player had not seen his field of bad dreams since 
February, when he was kicked in the head during a match by Harvard-Westlake 
player Dwight Angelini. That kick triggered a legal and emotional maelstrom for 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelini was arrested and charged with felony assault -- apparently the first 
time in state history that criminal charges were filed against an athlete for 
violence on the playing field -- and the case drew widespread media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, meanwhile, missed the remainder of the season and quietly endured 
months of pain, uncertainty and the aftereffects of the head trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 As Herrera's gaze fell on the green grass and empty goals at Harvard-Westlake, 
a sense of dread he had tried to forget came rushing to his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit me," he said. "It was pretty scary." 
</P>
<P>
 And today, the senior forward returns again to Harvard-Westlake as the Knights 
and Wolverines meet for the first time since that fateful Feb. 3 match. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and coaches on both teams downplayed the emotional significance of the 
match, saying the incident is buried well in the past -- especially because 
Angelini has graduated and plays for Yale. His brother, Brian, is a junior 
playing for Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not just another match for Herrera, who summed up his experience 
since being kicked: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Herrera is generally pain-free while playing soccer, his road to 
recovery has been long and slow, and the journey is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered intense headaches and neck pain for months after the kick, which 
he said knocked him unconscious. Physical exertion exacerbated the problem and 
he was unable to resume playing soccer until the spring. A torn muscle in his 
neck healed crookedly, doctors told him. He underwent physical therapy and did 
exercises to rehabilitate the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other effects, subtler and more troubling. Since the kick 
Herrera, by his own admission, is uncharacteristically irritable and easily 
frustrated and sometimes has difficulty concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework he used to complete in an hour now sometimes takes nearly twice as 
long, his mother Gloria said. His grades have dropped slightly. He tires easily 
and requires much more sleep, and still takes regular naps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to a doctor recently and he said that all this is part of (what can 
occur after a head injury)," Herrera said. "He said it could last for another 
year and prescribed lots of rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Herreras have filed a civil lawsuit against Harvard-Westlake, alleging 
negligence. The Herreras' attorney, Russell Nordstrom, said the private school 
in Studio City has filed cross-complaints against both Angelini and Herrera 
claiming that the fault in the matter lies with them. Nordstrom estimated that 
it will take roughly a year for the case to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal precedents and lawsuits are only some of the lingering reminders for 
Herrera. Last spring, he was interviewed by several television news programs, 
including "Hard Copy" (the interview was never aired), and the story was 
covered by several newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like to talk about it," he said. "But I did so hopefully this 
won't ever happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, though, media attention was focused on Angelini. For example, neither 
Herrera nor his family were contacted or interviewed for a long feature story 
about the incident recently published in Los Angeles magazine. The story 
portrayed Angelini as the victim of the incident and downplayed Herrera's 
plight. Numerous people who witnessed the kick disputed the accuracy of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The article frustrated Herrera and his family. Not only had their son been 
kicked in the head, it seemed from the outset that they constantly had to 
defend him. They were forced to explain the unusual situation to people who 
thought the family was overreacting to a "boys will be boys" type of incident. 
Herrera heard painful reminders from friends who knew Angelini and said many 
were not told the truth about the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person said that Angelini said, 'I was just turning around and meant to 
kick the air out of frustration,' and he happened to kick my head," Herrera 
said. "Or that he barely kicked me, and I'm just a big baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Coach Colm McFeeley also was dismayed about the portrayal of 
Herrera and the rest of the team as rough, dirty players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harvard side of it was well told," he said. "But we were made to look as 
if we approached the game looking to do damage to people. I felt that was 
mis-portrayed and I think that hurt the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But the theme for this match is that time, hopefully, heals all wounds -- even 
a kick to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the past," Brian Angelini said of the incident. "It had nothing to 
do with me. In my mind, there will be a lot of emotions, but the whole thing 
with my brother has nothing to do with it. I just get pumped up for big games." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an important match. The Wolverines (9-0-3) have been the class of the 
Mission League this season, and have won all four of their league matches. 
Notre Dame (9-4, 2-2) was a playoff team last season but has been inconsistent 
and needs an upset. Coaches from both schools said no special precautions would 
be needed for the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "In regards to there being any animosity from last year, no, I don't see it," 
McFeeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wolverine Coach Rick Commons: "I'll remind our guys to keep our behavior 
above reproach. But most of our players have put the incident well behind them. 
Time passes. It seems like it was a long, long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 It is understandably less removed from Herrera's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tries not to think about what happened, but sometimes he fears there's 
going to be someone crazy out there," Gloria Herrera said. "But he loves 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bryan Herrera: "I think about it every time before I go on the field. But 
once I start playing, I can usually forget about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it isn't easy. Herrera played midfield and defense last year, but is 
less aggressive in rough contact situations, according to McFeeley and some 
teammates. But Herrera has scored two goals this season as a striker and 
continues to improve and regain his pre-kick form, McFeeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 All concerned seem confident that the memories and consequences of the kick 
and its aftermath will continue to fade into the past. This time, everyone 
contends, nothing will mar the match for Herrera or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he'll have thoughts go through his mind, but he's not a vindictive 
kid," McFeeley said. "I know he'll go out and give 100% again and I know the 
rest of them will, too. And, God willing, we'll have come away doing soccer a 
service, because it was done a disservice last time."

ANALYSIS; ALL TALK, NO SUBSTANCE AT NCAA CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As debate among Division I representatives at the NCAA convention droned on 
over -- stop the presses -- travel squad limits, Roy Kramer, commissioner of 
the Southeastern Conference, stomped to an open microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most powerful men in college sports -- and also one of the 
crustiest -- Kramer bellowed: "This should not be managed by the NCAA! This 
should be managed by the conferences!" 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's frustration was shared by many who attended this year's convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates haggled over whether eight or 10 tennis players should be allowed to 
go on trips, but delayed voting on whether student-athletes should have five 
years of eligibility instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the 1994 NCAA convention did little more than pump dollars 
into the San Antonio tourist economy and draw the wrath of black basketball 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the NCAA's finest hour. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the meeting, which ended Tuesday, reinforced the point, espoused 
by Kramer and others, that the NCAA legislative process is in need of an 
overhaul that would allow the Alabamas and USCs of the world more say in 
shaping their destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole restructuring plan is coming from frustration," said Dennis 
Farrell, commissioner of the Big West Conference. "People see we have this 
cumbersome process -- 174 proposals. A lot of issues are so tedious. (The 
process) takes so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is concern about representatives from Division II and III (being) 
involved in all (decision-making) bodies. Even though the NCAA has made some 
advancement the last four, five years toward federation, there's still some 
frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure to be debated in coming months is a plan, developed by the commissioners 
from the eight major Division I-A conferences, that would give the big-time 
football schools more autonomy within the NCAA. Participation in the voting 
bloc would be limited to schools with annual athletic budgets of $9 million or 
more as well as other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the eight conferences' "equity position within the NCAA," Kramer said 
the commissioners' restructuring plan deserves serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about streamlining governance (of the NCAA)," Kramer said, 
"perhaps significantly reducing bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, don't expect substantive action on restructuring any time soon -- 
convention delegates approved a resolution setting up a committee to study the 
issue. The committee's deadline: 1996.

COACH QUITS AFTER DISMAL TENURE; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: KNIGHT GIVES UP AFTER 
GOING 1-29 IN THREE SEASONS AT HUENEME HIGH, CLAIMS LACK OF SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Citing lack of support for the football program from the Hueneme High 
administration, Coach Ed Knight resigned Tuesday after three dismal seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a horrible time commitment," Knight said."There was only one 
other coach besides myself who was also on the teaching staff and there was no 
change in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't feel I could do a good enough job in so many different areas 
without more help." 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators confirmed Knight's resignation but would not comment on 
his reasons for leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, 54, said he will remain a teacher at Hueneme. He would not comment on 
whether he is pursuing another coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings were 1-29 in three years under Knight, including 0-21 in Channel 
League play. Hueneme's only victory during the Knight regime was over Channel 
Islands early this season, which snapped a 21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem for Knight throughout his tenure was his inability to attract 
players to the program. The Vikings had only 28 players on the team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to Knight's decision was mixed. Some players said Knight was 
uncommunicative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had problems with him," junior offensive lineman Joe Moreno said. "He never 
really had good communication with his players. I'm not going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, praised Knight for his effort under difficult circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was a pretty good coach," sophomore defensive lineman Orlando 
Carrillo said. "I always thought he tried to bring out the best in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said he has no regrets about how he handled his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "All coaches have problems communicating with their players at times," Knight 
said. "I don't think I had a lot of those problems, but everybody has their own 
interpretation."

PITCHER FROM SOUTH KOREA SIGNS DEAL WITH DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a news conference Tuesday attended by Korean community leaders, the Dodgers 
announced the signing of pitcher Park Chan Ho, the first Korean to sign with a 
major league club in 15 years and the second in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, long a supporter of international baseball, was 
elated at the positive impact the signing brings to the local Korean community, 
but the price he paid for Park indicates this was not merely a goodwill 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, a 20-year-old right-hander whose fastball has been clocked at 99 m.p.h., 
will receive a signing bonus of $1.2 million. He signed a minor-league 
contract, but will attend major league spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely a major league prospect, although the timing is uncertain," 
O'Malley said. "He could start next season anywhere from double A to triple A 
to the majors." 
</P>
<P>
 If Park makes it, he will be the first Korean to play in the majors. Park Chul 
Soon signed with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1979, but made it only to double A. 
Park Chan Ho is from Kong Ju City, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger scout Bobby Darwin and scouting director Terry Reynolds first saw Park 
pitch in 1991 during a tournament at Dodger Stadium that included teams from 
the United States, Japan and Korea. "These were 17- and 18-year-olds, and in 
comparison to the other kids, his performance was eye-popping," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, speaking through an interpreter, said it was during that tournament that 
he first dreamed of playing for the Dodgers. "I promise to Dodger fans that I 
will work hard to show you the greatest performance possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park's signing bonus, which was negotiated by his uncle, Steve Kim, compares 
to the $1.3 million the Dodgers paid Darren Dreifort, their No. 1 pick in last 
June's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who does not speak English, is attending a language center in Santa 
Monica. He will have a full-time interpreter this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be fine, he's a pitcher, " Orel Hershiser said. "If he were a middle 
infielder, it may be more difficult. But Fernando (Valenzuela) did it. He 
didn't speak English at first and Mike Scioscia did all the interpreting on the 
field."

UCI'S BAKER SAYS, 'WE'RE HEADED TOWARD A STRIKE'

 UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker, among those who consider Monday's vote by NCAA 
Division I representatives rejecting a proposal to increase men's basketball 
scholarships a slap in the face of black athletes, said Tuesday that "we're 
headed toward a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who talked with other Black Coaches Assn. members Tuesday, said no 
timetable for a strike is in place, although Saturday has been mentioned in a 
number of media reports.Irvine is scheduled to play at Nevada Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do something," Baker said. "I'm not of the belief that 
Saturday is necessarily the day, but something has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, in San Antonio for the NCAA convention, 
said he talked with Baker on Tuesday but had not made any contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it just a case of the coach not going to coach? Or will a game not be 
played?" Guerrero said. "I think it's premature to discuss strategy at this 
point." JOHN WEYLER

NINE PRINCIPLES FOR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Coalition of Essential Schools agree to uphold "nine common 
principles" outlined by Theodore R. Sizer in his "Horace" books. 
</P>
<P>
 Sizer says the principles are flexible and are adaptable to a variety of 
secondary school environments. Here is a summary. 
</P>
<P>
 * All students can learn. A school should focus on helping them to use their 
minds well. 
</P>
<P>
 * The school's goals should be simple: that each student master a limited 
number of essential skills and areas of knowledge. The axiom "less is more" 
should dominate, meaning that students should master a few subjects thoroughly 
rather than skim through the content of many. 
</P>
<P>
 * The school's goals should apply to all students, while the means to these 
goals will vary as those students themselves vary. School practice should be 
tailor-made to meet the needs of every group or class of adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teaching and learning should be personalized to the maximum feasible extent. 
Efforts should be directed toward a goal that no teacher have direct 
responsibility for more than 80 students. 
</P>
<P>
 * The governing image of the school should be student-as-worker rather than 
the more familiar concept of teacher-as-deliverer-of-instructional-services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Students entering secondary school studies are those who can show competence 
in language and elementary mathematics. Students of traditional high school age 
who have not yet reached appropriate levels of competence will receive 
intensive remedial help. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tone of the school should explicitly and self-consciously stress values 
of unanxious expectation ("I won't threaten you, but I expect much of you"), of 
trust (until abused) and of decency (the values of fairness, generosity and 
tolerance). 
</P>
<P>
 * The principal and teachers should perceive themselves as generalists first 
and specialists second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ultimate administrative and budget targets should include, in addition to 
total student loads per teacher of 80 or fewer pupils, substantial time for 
collective planning by teachers, competitive salaries for staff and an ultimate 
per-pupil cost not to exceed that at traditional schools by more than 10%.
