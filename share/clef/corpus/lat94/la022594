TRANSIT AGENCY, MCA COMPROMISE ON FINAL PLAN FOR SUBWAY STATION; METRO RAIL: 
AGREEMENT ENDS FIVE-MONTH CONTROVERSY. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WILL BE LINKED TO THE 
STOP THROUGH PEOPLE-MOVER SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
 Ending months of haggling with entertainment giant MCA, the county 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved an agreement Wednesday to link a 
planned subway stop with MCA's sprawling Universal Studios complex through a 
people-mover system. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal ends a lobbying campaign by MCA to relocate the station from 
Lankershim Boulevard to a site nearer MCA'S CityWalk attraction -- a move 
transit planners consider too expensive and time-consuming. MCA and the county 
agreed on a city-brokered compromise to keep the station on Lankershim but 
connect it to a shuttle bound for Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that it's over," said Larry Spungin, president of MCA 
development. "Just as MTA can embark on what it has to do, we can embark on 
what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For MCA, the next step is to consider its options for a people-mover system, 
which would be at least 1,000 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment company has agreed to fund the system. Although technically 
not bound to provide a shuttle service, MCA is committed to trying to make the 
concept work, representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 City transit officials have suggested a monorail-type system that could cost 
as much as $20 million. However, MCA executives say no particular technology 
has been selected or maximum price established. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not knowledgeable enough of the problems," Spungin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county transit agency, Wednesday's agreement means that the Universal 
City Metro Rail project can proceed as planned, without the costly delays of 
further studies or scrapping the current plan. Under the terms of the 
compromise, the county will pay for two entrances on the east side of the 
Lankershim station, in addition to the pair planned for the west side. 
Passengers will be able to exit through the eastern portals via an underground 
walkway beneath Lankershim. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit analyst Judith Wilson said the $2 million required for the tunnel and 
extra entrances can be covered through various project reserve funds and will 
not cause any cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency is also responsible for various roadway improvements to 
ease traffic, such as widening Lankershim by 22 feet and adding new ramps to 
the Hollywood Freeway. Those expenses, estimated at between $4 million and $5 
million, also are to be incorporated into the current budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement lays to rest a controversy that involved MCA and the county for 
five months. Last fall, MCA threatened to withhold millions of dollars in 
benefit-assessment fees unless the transit authority moved the subway stop half 
a mile southeast from the current site to one beneath the Hollywood Freeway, 
near Cahuenga Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 County planners said such a change in plans would cost $42 million and delay 
the scheduled opening in July, 2000, by nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prompting of Mayor Richard Riordan -- who was on hand Wednesday to vote 
on the agreement as a transit authority member -- city officials crafted a 
compromise blueprint that satisfied planners' demands to stay on schedule and 
MCA's request that the station better serve its theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners near the planned Red Line stop expressed relief that the station 
site had finally been agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled it's over," said Ronni Rice, who owns a nearby condominium 
that will be razed by the county to make way for the traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and others will have to move, Rice said she and her neighbors are 
happy to know the fate of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been held hostage for two years," she said.

 A real tension-getter: Some Granada Hills residents who escaped quake damage 
were shaken up several weeks later to find their houses suddenly plastered with 
red tags. They feared that the city had unaccountably declared their homes 
unsafe for occupancy. "UNSAFE" was, in fact, the only word visible from several 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 But a closer look revealed that the notices were merely ads by a company 
offering to perform quake repairs "in case" a resident's house had been 
declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view, they weren't illegal but they were unethical, at the 
very least," said Dave Keim of the city's Department of Building and Safety. 
"They caused some confusion among homeowners but their purpose was to get 
attention, and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Keim's office attempted unsuccessfully to reach the entrepreneur by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "A day or so after we phoned, his line was disconnected," Keim said.

 There was only one judge for this performance: The tension was building in 
L.A. Superior Court as a defense witness offered what was supposed to be 
explosive "new evidence" in a Mafia kidnaping and robbery case. But the 
stirring in the courtroom late Wednesday afternoon had nothing to do with his 
testimony, which proved rather lame -- and was dragging on. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Superior Court Judge Nancy Brown put to rest the fears of those in 
attendance. "I promise," Brown said, "all of you will be able to get home in 
time to see Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding skate." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's attorney, Stanley Berg, said: "Your honor, I'm so tired of 
Tonya Harding."

<P>
 His objection was overruled. miscelLAny:

 After a litany of critical articles in national publications, L.A. finally 
found a friend despite its seemingly endless cycles of disasters. Spy magazine, 
in its February cover story, published a paean ("L.A. O.K.!") to the City of 
Angels. A few weeks later, the magazine announced it had gone out of business. 
Just our luck.

ASBESTOS REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We agree with your Feb. 13 headline, "Asbestos Contamination Adds to Risks 
and Costs of Cleanup." Abundant evidence indicates that inhalation of airborne 
asbestos fibers can cause cancer.However, the article suggests that regulators 
may be overreacting to this threat. For instance, disposal of all furnishings, 
carpets and clothes that may have been exposed to fallen asbestos debris shaken 
loose by a quake is not always necessary. This is because asbestos fibers 
typically do not penetrate into fabric or solids. Instead, asbestos debris 
could be vacuumed from the surface of exposed items using time-tested 
remediation techniques. In short, the presence of asbestos is a manageable 
risk. It is better public policy to allocate scarce earthquake relief and 
personal funds to more urgent problems.

IS MOSCOW STILL A GOOD BET?; DUMA THROWS RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION IN YELTSIN'S FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin has appealed to Russia's lawmakers for a new spirit 
of cooperation in addressing the great and growing problems facing their 
country. But from the looks of things he's more likely in for a period of 
bitter confrontation instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The new popularly elected Duma, as the lower house of Parliament is known, 
seems ready to pick up where its predecessor, which was dissolved by Yeltsin 
last fall, left off. Shaping up is a renewed struggle over power and a time of 
deepening political conflict, one whose outcome is anything but certain. 
President Clinton's necessary effort to maintain stable relations with Russia 
and keep open the lines to its reformers -- a policy already greatly 
complicated by the disclosure that Russia had a paid spy within the ranks of 
the CIA -- will inevitably be made harder by the political turbulence brewing 
in Moscow. In the long course of things, Russia's internal political 
developments seem sure to have a much greater impact on U.S.-Russia relations 
than the Aldrich Ames spy case. 
</P>
<P>
 Yelstin's plaintive plea for cooperation followed by just a day the Duma's 
lopsided vote to grant amnesty to some of the most conspicuous enemies of the 
president, and of reform. With extremists taking the lead but with support from 
some centrist politicians as well, the Duma ordered freedom for the dozen men 
who are standing trial for attempting to overthrow President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev in August, 1991, and for those who led the rebellion that tried to 
oust Yeltsin last October. Among the latter are former Vice President Alexander 
Rutskoi and former Parliament Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma vote, perfectly legal under the new Yeltsin-supported constitution, 
was explained by one centrist deputy as an effort to leave the past behind. In 
fact, it simply assures that the worst of the recent past will gain new 
influence over the present. Restoring the political rights of putschists even 
while former communists and neo-fascists ride high in the Parliament is a sure 
prescription not for reconciliation but for disorder. Yeltsin's government may 
try to fight or delay the amnesty. That action itself could trigger an early 
political crisis, perhaps forcing Clinton's Russian policy back to the drawing 
board.

SARAJEVO CEASE-FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It appears that in return for Sarajevo being spared a few days of heavy 
bombardment, the Bosnian government is being manipulated into handing over its 
heavy weapons and being "realistic" about the need to sign away its rights. The 
Russians have now maneuvered themselves into a better position to prevent any 
further ultimatums against the Serbs from being effective and to undermine 
completely NATO's feeble effort to re-establish any credibility as a power in 
European affairs. The U.S. has now been maneuvered into giving open support for 
the unjust and probably unworkable plan to divide Bosnia into ethnic 
Bantustans, two of which will be governed by genocidal maniacs. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the Bosnian government is not doing what it should to protest this 
set of outrageous manipulations. Even if "realistically" Bosnia may finally be 
forced to surrender much of its territory and sovereignty, there is no reason 
for Bosnia's friends in America and the West to pretend that this is just or 
reasonable.

 * Charles A. Kupchan (Opinion, Feb. 20) characterized President Clinton's 
threat to use NATO air power in Bosnia as the most significant leadership 
decision since World War II. Either he is not aware or has forgotten that other 
presidents, in that time frame, implemented the Berlin airlift, defused the 
Cuban missile crisis and most importantly -- prevented an atomic holocaust. And 
there were the matters of wars in Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Kupchan misinterpreted Clinton's clearly enunciated justifications for the air 
strikes -- to end the siege. What the airstrike threat accomplished was to 
lessen the body count temporarily and redeploy Serbian ordnance to other 
besieged areas of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs continue to control all water and gas supplies and delivery of 
humanitarian aid to Sarajevo. The Serbs continue to receive over half of the 
aid as tribute for allowing it to enter the city. The citizens of Sarajevo 
still cannot leave the city freely.

 * Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on shaky ground, while President Clinton is 
trying to find the Muslim "bottom line" making it acceptable for them to sign 
the peace agreement, while disregarding that the "bottom line" for Serbs in 
Bosnia, and Yugoslavia, has already been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent massacre staged in the Sarajevo marketplace, which actually 
triggered the ultimatum against the Bosnian Serbs, is less and less mentioned 
by the Western media and politicians. This is in direct proportion with rapidly 
increasing odds that a U.N. special investigation will clear Serbian guns from 
responsibility for this senseless killing, and point an accusatory finger at 
the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The established pattern of diversions previously staged by Muslims (as found 
by earlier U.N. investigators, including the "bread-line massacre," May 27, 
1992; "shelling" of Douglas Hurd's visit, July 17, 1992; "orphan's funeral," 
Aug. 4, 1992; killing of ABC producer David Kaplan, Aug. 13, 1992; "water queue 
shelling," Feb. 7, 1993), their motives (to provoke the world's sympathy and 
push the U.N. and NATO into a military intervention against Serbs), and 
ballistic expertise (an Israeli expert, reported in French and Italian news), 
all indicate undeniably that it was yet another atrocity masterminded and 
executed by the Muslim government. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible that the U.S. will continue to support the Bosnian Muslim 
government if ongoing investigations reveal that it is guilty of one more cruel 
and barbaric hoax?

HEALTH CARE

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) is another one of those Old Boy Republicans who just 
doesn't get it (" 'Choice' Belongs to Government," Commentary, Feb. 14). I 
concede that his health care plan may very well be the best available in the 
world. (Although he seems unwilling to concede that taxpayers are probably 
paying for it.) Still, his horror that under Clinton's plan things will be 
worse applies only to some Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 If he were to get out of the Beltway and talk to people who right now are 
"insured" under the formularies established by Blue Cross, he would discover 
his terrifying future is already here! 
</P>
<P>
 If the medications your doctor prescribes are not on the list, Blue Cross 
won't pay for them. If a treatment your doctor says you need is not approved, 
you can't get it. And it took effect Jan. 1, 1994, Mr. Gramm. Not in some 
future the President has maliciously planned for us. 
</P>

enlighten him and your readers that his statement, "Or suppose a drug that you 
desperately need is not, according to the board, 'reasonably priced'? They 
won't pay for it," applies equally to Blue Cross of California, a private 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 A prescription of mine was rejected on Jan. 22 based on a prescription drug 
"formulary" policy beginning with January, 1994, but not even made known to 
their insured. Under my insurance policy, this particular prescription was 
previously available to me for $8. It would now have cost me approximately $50. 
</P>
<P>
 They refused to furnish me a "formulary" list. They said only doctors have it. 
My doctor did not have it either.

ATTACK ON TEACHER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * So physical education teacher Pamela Altea "placed herself in jeopardy" of 
the vicious beating she received by male gang members because she left her 
school's gate open due to a faulty lock, heh (Feb. 17)? 
</P>
<P>
 That any thinking, responsible person -- much less Altea's colleagues -- would 
take such a ludicrous attitude is precisely the reason her criminal attackers 
could assault her in open daylight on school property. 
</P>

 This country, this state, this county, this city, and Washington Middle School 
in Pasadena need to clean house, take out the garbage and hire a new maid 
service. We can start with people like School Board President George Van 
Astine, Supt. Vera Vignes, and chief of the district's police force, Jarado 
Blue, who blame Altea for this reprehensible physical violation on a female 
educator.

NOT INSANE -- BUT VERY UNBALANCED; DON'T BE FOOLED BY BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again Congress is splashing around with the issue of amending the U.S. 
Constitution to require a balanced federal budget. Sounds nice, eh? No more 
deficit spending. The idea is certainly appealing, especially for its political 
capital in an election year. The message is simple and makes a nice TV sound 
bite: Don't spend more than you earn. However, such an amendment would be 
irresponsible, deceptive and bad public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 HERE WE GO: Hearings began this week on a bill introduced by Sen. Paul Simon 
(D-Ill.). The House soon will take up its version, introduced by Rep. Charles 
W. Stenholm (D-Tex.). Passage requires a two-thirds vote in each house and 
ratification by 38 states. That's quite an obstacle course, fortunately. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would limit total outlays in each fiscal year to receipts for 
that same year. A balanced budget would be required regardless of the 
prevailing economic climate or unavoidable special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a recession and lower tax receipts, too bad, spending programs 
would have to be cut. A balanced budget could worsen and prolong economic 
downturns, putting a straitjacket on the federal government. The amendment 
would also require that exceptions to a balanced budget be approved by 
three-fifths of both the House and Senate. Whatever happened to democratic, 
simple majority rule? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the balanced-budget formula, cutting spending would be easier than 
raising taxes, even if higher taxes were needed. The amendment would alter 
longstanding congressional voting procedures by requiring more votes to raise 
taxes than to cut programs. That would favor large corporations and the wealthy 
over low- and middle-income households that benefit from many government 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 DOWN WE GO: One can argue that many states, including California, already 
require balanced budgets. True, but much of that balancing act (which is more 
often achieved on paper than in actuality) depends on federal grants to finance 
state programs. That's certainly the case in California: Bear in mind that Gov. 
Pete Wilson (rightly in our view) is seeking billions in federal reimbursement 
for California's costs for illegal immigrants to balance next year's state 
budget. The Clinton Administration has not responded, but an amendment for a 
balanced budget would severely limit its flexibility in considering such 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and Congress have the power to put together a balanced budget 
now. For years, both have ignored that responsibility. Ironically, Congress is 
taking up the balanced-budget amendment with new enthusiasm just when 
Washington has managed to reduce deficit spending significantly. Surely 
Congress has the confidence and discipline to continue that deficit-cutting 
mission. Passing a balanced-budget amendment would be a dereliction of duty.

IS PARTITION THE ONLY WAY?; WHY CHRISTOPHER SEEKS TO HELP CREATE A BINATIONAL

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bosnian peace plan urged by the European Union and the United Nations has 
functioned for months as a self-fulfilling prophecy. What the great powers 
seemed to regard as inevitable -- namely the tripartite, ethnic division of the 
Bosnian state -- Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, whose relations had initially 
been peaceful, also began to regard as inevitable. The two groups turned on 
each other, determined to acquire as much territory as possible going into the 
partition negotiations.

 The Clinton Administration, while continuing to pay lip service to the 
partition plan, is now clearly trying to make the prevailing wind blow in the 
other direction. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is pushing Bosnia's 
Muslim-dominated government and its Croatian minority to form a unified 
binational Bosnian state within still-to-be-determined though surely reduced 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim siege of Croatian Vitez in central Bosnia and the Croatian siege of 
the Muslim district of Mostar in southwestern Bosnia seem to mock Christopher's 
new approach, but a Croatian-Muslim cease-fire has been announced for noon 
today, and unification talks begin in Washington this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A binational rather than tri-national Bosnia in federation with Croatia would 
give Bosnia the outlet to the sea it needs while providing Croatia with inland 
protection for its slender but lucrative Dalmatian coast. The newly proclaimed 
cease-fire is not backed by the threat of NATO reprisals for cease-fire 
violations, but some observers see a continuing spillover from the Sarajevo 
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has some leverage on both sides in the coming negotiations. The 
threat of U.N. economic sanctions worries the Croats. The Muslims know that it 
would probably fall to the Americans in any future peacekeeping force to 
protect them. Whatever this leverage yields this weekend, the Administration 
deserves credit for finding its way, however haltingly and belatedly, to a 
Bosnian intervention that honors ethnic mixing and the secular state.

DIVERSITY WATCH; WORD IMPERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges could use is a good editor. The 
private association, which accredits 145 institutions of higher education in 
California, Hawaii and Guam, worked for years on a statement on diversity; 
Wednesday, after much controversy, it was approved.The statement is 20 pages 
long -- and therein lies the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement says, several times and in several ways, that colleges and 
universities will not be required to meet quotas as a criterion for 
accreditation. Rather, the statement -- which points to an undeniable link 
between quality education and learning about a wide range of ideas and 
experiences -- calls for "thoughtful engagement" about diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem? Several administrators read into the statement an 
attempt to squelch academic freedom or impose "political correctness." Some 
opponents of the statement may have been using the political-correctness 
argument merely to obscure the fact that they have feeble records of hiring 
minority and female faculty members; other opponents no doubt legitimately had 
concerns about the document's language and implications.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee-speak nature of the statement made it much too wordy and opened 
the door to misinterpretation by those already uneasy with change, however 
gently suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 We agree with John Brooks Slaughter, president of Occidental College, who 
fully endorsed the diversity statement but added, "It would have been more 
powerful had it been made more concise."

A TOOL TO FORCE OFFICIALS TO DO THE RIGHT THING; BALANCED BUDGET: AN AMENDMENT 
WOULD END AN $800-MILLION-A-DAY 'WELFARE' PROGRAM OF INTEREST PAYMENTS.; "WE 
HAVE A BALANCE OF $84.32 IN THE BANK . . . WHICH MAKES US $4.5 TRILLION RICHER 
THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL SIMON, Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) is chief Senate sponsor of the 
balanced-budget constitutional amendment. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few question the economic assumption that the United States has a deficit 
problem of major proportion, a problem that will continue to harm our economy 
until corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 What is at question is whether a constitutional amendment is the proper 
vehicle for dealing with the deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 Can the deficit be handled without a constitutional amendment? 
</P>
<P>
 In theory it can. President Clinton made significant but modest steps, but 
that came only in his "honeymoon period" and with a Congress of his own party. 
But even this limited measure was greeted by the financial markets with drops 
in interest rates that stimulated the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That unusual confluence of factors will not often be repeated. Attempts to 
deal with the problem with laws have had only limited success. The most 
dramatic example was the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act, which would have moved us 
gradually toward a balanced budget. But the problem with this approach is that 
such laws can be amended. In 1991, the year when we were to have a balanced 
budget under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we had a deficit of $270 billion. On a 
subsequent plan, we ended up $357 billion short.  
</P>
<P>
 As the total debt mounts, the deficit becomes more difficult for public 
officials to deal with. Public officials faced with the choice of pleasing the 
public or serving the public too often decide to please the public. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an old joke that there were so many heroes at the Alamo because there 
was no back door. Congress needs such a situation , where there is no easy way 
to escape. We need the constraint of a constitutional amendment to force us to 
do what we know is in the national interest. A constitutional amendment gives 
office-holders political cover for doing our unpleasant and unpopular duty. 
</P>
<P>
 How serious is the deficit problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Extremely serious. First, the deficit is sharply retarding economic growth. 
The New York Federal Reserve Board study shows that the lack of savings in our 
nation, almost entirely because of the deficit, resulted in a loss of 5% growth 
in our national income during the 1980s. The Congressional Budget Office 
calculates 1% loss means 650,000 jobs. Then 5% is roughly 3.25 million jobs 
lost, many in the highly paid manufacturing sector. Unless we signal to the 
financial markets that we are serious about the deficit, the loss during the 
coming decade will be at least as great, if not greater. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 General Accounting Office study suggests that if we continue to simply 
"muddle through" on our present course, the nation will experience either no 
growth or small growth by the year 2020. But if we balance the budget by 2001, 
by 2020 there should be an increase in inflation-adjusted income per capita of 
approximately 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the deficit alters fiscal policy in an unreasonable way. Neither 
conservatives nor liberals would intentionally adopt a policy of spending a 
larger portion of our tax dollars on interest and a decreasing portion on goods 
and services. Yet that is what we have stumbled into. In inflation-adjusted 
dollars, for example, education expenditures dropped 1% while gross interest 
spending went up 97% from 1981 to 1993. The federal government now spends eight 
times as much on interest as on education, twice as much as all the poverty 
programs combined. Interest is an $800-million-a-day "welfare" program that 
takes from people of modest means and gives to the more fortunate and, 
increasingly, the more fortunate beyond our borders.  
</P>
<P>
 Third, continuation on the present course will lead to monetizing the debt -- 
that is, printing more money to "solve" our problems. The GAO forecast simply 
says that an "economic and fiscal catastrophe" awaits us if our policies are 
not changed. but does not spell out the catastrophe. But except for strenuous 
steps taken as a result of a major war, no industrial nation has faced the 
economic debt burden that we are expected to face without debasing currency, 
that is, simply putting the printing presses to work printing more and more 
dollars, which are worth less and less. That would devastate Social Security, 
retirement trust funds, people's savings and the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 How would the balanced-budget amendment work? 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the last of 38 states required to ratify it acts, or in 1999 
(and that may be changed to 2001), whichever is later, income must match 
outlays by the federal government unless there is a 60% vote of both the House 
and Senate to agree to a deficit. That gives us greater flexibility than Thomas 
Jefferson wanted, but makes it difficult to have a deficit. To make sure that 
Congress and an administration do not play games, it also takes a three-fifths 
majority to authorize an increase in the national debt. That precludes any 
"off-budget" manipulation.  
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment is not a cure-all. It is simply a procedure for 
forcing us to take the difficult steps our popularity-prone public officials 
now duck.

THE FEDS, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CAMP SISTER SPIRIT; GAY RIGHTS: THE MISSISSIPPI CASE 
SHOWS THE NEED FOR A LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT DAWIDOFF, Robert Dawidoff is a professor of history at the Claremont 
Graduate School. He is the author, with Michael Nava, of Created Equal: Why Gay 
Rights Matter to America, to be published in April by St. Martin's Press. 
</P>

<P>
 Feds in Mississippi, sent there to protect beleaguered citizens from 
intimidation based on prejudice and an escalating climate of threats and 
potential violence. Wait -- didn't we solve this problem in the 1960s? So 
what's with Attorney General Janet Reno sending federal mediators to respond to 
harassment of a local couple? 
</P>
<P>
 The Hensons live in Ovett, a hamlet of 1,200. They run a women's camp there 
called Sister Spirit, which they have dedicated to the training of feminists 
and civil-rights activists. Nobody has accused the Hensons of anything 
criminal. But they have been subjected to anonymous phone calls, threatening 
letters, jeers and random gunfire from their neighbors. A bomb has been 
exploded in front of their gate and a dead dog found draped over their mailbox. 
The climate of intimidation has intensified with two meetings led by Baptists 
ministers to raise money toward forcing the Hensons out of their former pig 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The clue to what has some of their neighbors so riled up may be that their 
locked and guarded gate is painted lavender. The Hensons are lesbians, married 
in their own eyes and presumably in the sight of whatever higher power they 
cherish, but not in the eyes of the law or their neighbors. Brenda and Wanda 
Henson have committed no offense, but their neighbors fear that Sister Spirit 
will become a regional center of gay activism.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Walley, a lawyer advising the groups attempting to purge Ovett of the 
Hensons, explained that "the area is a conservative religious community that 
has a standard based on biblical morality. Residents of Camp Sister Spirit 
reject that standard and have a radical agenda that would seek to change our 
way of life." Their biblical moral precedent is apparently not the injunction 
of Jesus of Nazareth to love thy neighbor as thyself. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Justice Department. Federal mediators commonly respond to threats 
against racial and ethnic minorities, but this is apparently the first response 
to a sexual-orientation hate crime. Mediators have met with the two sides in 
hopes of easing tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones County Sheriff Maurice Hooks welcomed the mediators and defended his own 
record: "We're trying to protect their rights." The difficulty is that lesbians 
and gay men have no firmly established rights.  
</P>
<P>
 It is heartening to have the Justice Department send mediators to Mississippi 
to protect citizens' rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But 
the case reminds us all of the pressing need for a national gay civil-rights 
bill.

PERSPECTIVE ON ARMENIA; CHARTING A COURSE FOR PEACE; WASHINGTON HAS NOT GIVEN 
THIS KEY BUFFER STATE THE CONSIDERATION BOTH IT AND LONG-TERM U.S. INTERESTS 
DESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAFFI K. HOVANNISIAN, Raffi K. Hovannisian, formerly minister of foreign 
affairs for Armenia, directs the Armenian Center for National and International 
Studies in Yerevan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, if it is to avoid the failures of its 
predecessors, must step beyond the temporal confines of its own four-year 
tenure and begin assessing U.S. policy through the prism of long-range 
strategic interests. Such a vital readjustment requires not only political 
courage but a fundamental departure from now-standard American prejudices and 
predilections. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia and its political neighborhood are a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union's smallest republic has discovered during the past two years 
that independence is indeed an equation of benefits and burdens that are easier 
to fathom in the abstract than to exact in reality. Despite its people's 
sufferings and sacrifices and their political maturity in refusing civil war as 
a means to express disillusionment with inept government, Armenia finds itself 
in the throes of dangerous domestic and foreign crisis. Economic collapse, 
hyperinflation, growing poverty, continued influxes of refugees, rail and road 
blockades imposed by neighboring Azerbaijan and assisted by Turkey, and the 
escalation of conflict in Nagorno (Mountainous) Karabakh combine with harsh 
winter conditions and the lasting effects of the great 1988 earthquake to paint 
a picture of pain and potential explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, for its part, has not given Armenia, this key buffer state located 
at a critical intersection of so many competing political and economic 
interests, the consideration both it and long-term American policy deserve. 
Instead of charting a course to enhance peace, security and geopolitical 
balance in the area, the United States has opted for impulsive, situational 
initiatives that reflect neither Armenia's importance to achievement of these 
aims nor a basic understanding of the pitfalls and ultimate disaster of such a 
myopic approach. 
</P>
<P>
 As difficult as it may be, policy-makers who want the best for America in the 
21st Century should be divesting themselves of old, worn stereotypes and 
thinking in new patterns that respond to a dramatically rearranged global 
environment. They may want to build a balanced American strategy for the 
region, along these lines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Armenia, its domestic difficulties notwithstanding, is a strategically 
significant country at the crossroads of conflicting but potentially 
cooperative spheres of influence, between Iran and Turkey, Moscow and 
Washington, the East and the West and the great religions of the world. Still 
at the beginning of its road to full democratic values, real political 
pluralism and effective economic reforms, Armenia is worth more than occasional 
comforters of humanitarian assistance, however generous. If the United States 
is serious about stability in the region, its commitment to Armenia must be a 
political -- and permanent -- one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mountainous Karabakh, the world must come to understand, is not a religious 
or territorial feud between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is a legitimate quest 
for self-determination and sovereignty by that entity's Armenian majority and 
constitutes the last stage of the decolonization process inspired by the Soviet 
Union's dissolution. International rejection of Azerbaijan's military "final 
solution" to this question, appreciation of the juridical grounds for 
Karabakh's self-government and the compelled nature of its self-defense, and 
the architecture of a peace process that invites Karabakh participation will 
together serve to measure the degree of success in disengaging from Stalin's 
bloody legacy of "divide and conquer" politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Russia, regardless of its political orientations and domestic choices, 
should be viewed as an equal partner in the affairs of the region and 
encouraged to maintain its constructive role there. A new formula must find the 
delicate equilibrium between reliance on Russia's stabilizing strength and 
defiance of return to an imperial past. Until the United States deepens its 
political and economic commitment to Armenia and other nations similarly 
situated, it can expect nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turkey, an American ally whose strategic importance has waned with the 
winding down of the Cold War, can continue to play a productive part in the 
post-Soviet world if it advances in two important ways. First, official Ankara 
must categorically reject, not only by word but in deed, the increasingly loud 
voices within Turkey calling for a re-creation of the Ottoman Empire, 
stretching from the Adriatic to the Chinese frontier. Such a development would 
not only compromise the sovereignty of the newly independent states of the 
former Soviet Union in a contemporary reincarnation of a brutal history, but 
would also entail a markedly altered geopolitical reality in the region -- with 
grave implications, first and foremost, for Washington. Second, if Turkey is 
ever to become a regional superpower, it must be able to demonstrate its 
responsible leadership by coming to terms with the ghosts in its closet and 
making peace with all its neighbors, including Armenia. Just as Germany has 
taken the road to redemption by confronting the crimes of its predecessor 
regime, so too should a new and improved Turkey be able to find within itself 
the moral fortitude to recognize the 1915 Armenian genocide and to sit at the 
table with Armenian authorities to hammer out a comprehensive resolution of the 
Armenian question. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey's self-cleansing is essential for true normalization with Armenia, and 
is a precondition for Turkey's assumption of a higher mission in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, for its part, stands to gain from urging Turkey in these 
directions and away from continued military and blockade-related involvement in 
Azerbaijan's war against Karabakh and Armenia. Washington should also seek to 
diversify its political and economic investments in the area. A strategy of 
placing all American eggs in the basket of one regional proxy is no strategy at 
all, and is as wrong today as it was in the days of the Iranian Shah. 
</P>
<P>
 * Iran is an Islamic republic that enjoys good neighborly relations with 
Christian Armenia and co-religionist Azerbaijan. It has remained neutral on the 
Karabakh issue and has, to its credit, resisted certain attempts to draw it 
into the confrontation. Iran increasingly must be looked upon not only as a 
force to be checked and balanced in regional and world affairs, but also as a 
possible participant in bilateral and multilateral initiatives for the creation 
of a peaceful, prosperous and secure political environment.  
</P>
<P>
 Those concerned about the long-term advancement of American strategic 
interests should find creative ways to support the many conciliation-minded 
moderates in Tehran, foster mutual communication and information-sharing, 
develop and gradually implement confidence-building measures and allow Iran to 
play a more responsible international role. Here as well, balance, 
diversification and cooperation are the keys to real geopolitical success. 
</P>
<P>
 American policy today is in retreat and out of tune. It is not too late, 
however, to begin adopting new ways for new times. Narrow political ambitions 
and superficial quick-fix analyses must give way to a broad and far-reaching 
vision that seeks to correlate national and international interests. 
</P>
<P>
 World peace is at issue, and Armenia is a good place to start.

FRIED GREEN WRITERS AT THE VIACOM CAFE; MEDIA MERGERS: SERIOUS BOOKS ARE THE 
FIRST CASUALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a Pulitzer-winning journalist in San 
Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viacom's victory in the merger battle over Paramount is being touted as good 
news for business because it links entertainment "product" and distribution in 
a vertical chain -- a veritable banquet of publishing, broadcasting, networks, 
cable, movie theaters, sports franchises, programming and theme parks.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a letter from the bottom of the food chain. I am a rare, if not 
endangered, species of worm: writerus nonfictionist socialissuem. In 1990, I 
set out to write a book about poverty in America -- not a popular subject, 
granted, but an important one. I found a hook for the book and dangled it in 
the murky waters of New York publishing. Atheneum nibbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1959, Atheneum established itself as a quality house with the 
publication of Theodore H. White's "The Making of the President, 1960," which 
won a Pulitzer Prize and revolutionized American political reporting. Among the 
other major writers published by Atheneum: Nobel laureate William Goldman and 
novelist Isabel Allende. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, small publishers like Atheneum have had increasing difficulty 
competing with the big houses. To survive, Atheneum merged with Scribners, 
whose backlist included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. 
Then Atheneum and Scribners were swallowed by Macmillan, surviving as 
"imprints." In 1989, Macmillan was bought by the British publishing magnate 
Robert Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 While I traveled across America talking with people who'd overcome poverty, 
Maxwell was siphoning millions from British pension funds to feed his 
acquisitions. In 1991, his body was found floating near his yacht off the 
Canary Islands (foul play was rumored but never proved). Soon after my book, 
"From Cradle to Grave," was published last fall, Macmillan was swallowed by a 
bigger fish, Simon & Schuster. Not long before, Simon & Schuster itself had 
been swallowed by a bigger fish from Hollywood, Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Paramount has been swallowed by the killer whale of them all, Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 And the publisher of Atheneum has been told that the spring list would be its 
last. Progress is not a victimless crime. In 1962, Atheneum published Reynolds 
Price's first novel, "A Long and Happy Life." Now Atheneum was publishing 
Price's latest work, "A Whole New Life," an account of his battle with cancer 
which left him paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 A publishing house's lifelong loyalty is a rare and precious gift; the 
commitment enables an author to endure and strive for excellence. When an 
imprint dies, a creative relationship is severed. The same week that Atheneum 
was terminated, two other major houses closed their editorial offices in New 
York. There are fewer publishers than ever, and editors (chronically underpaid 
and overworked) are looking for jobs that no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
 What does all this tell me?  
</P>
<P>
 Great authors like Hemingway and Fitzgerald (whose rights, acquired through 
the Macmillan-Paramount merger, go to Viacom) are now valued less for their 
ability to move readers than for their stories to be repackaged as product. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation of book publishing, movie, television and communication 
industries in the hands of a few mega-corporations supposedly will make 
American business a more competitive vehicle for the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot help but fear that writers will become road kill. Megamergers 
impoverish American culture and thwart the search for truth. The billions of 
dollars invested in acquisition, debt service and technology reduce the money 
available to introduce new writers and subsidize provocative, if not wildly 
popular, nonfiction books. The demand for entertainment puts dollars above 
sense; diversity is sacrificed to the vast bland middle market. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolution is inevitable. Americans are changing from people of the book to 
screen people; I see it in my own children. But from the bottom of the food 
chain, watching corporations consuming institutions consuming people, I feel a 
hunger for meaning. Meaning gives shape to suffering and enables people to 
survive hard times without sacrificing their humanity. It gives voice to values 
that resist the tyranny of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing our culture is not whether Viacom, Time Warner, Sony and 
the like will cannibalize the creations of the past; that is a fait accompli. 
The test is whether the communication leviathans will sponsor difficult, 
creative people to write inspired stories that offer meaning in a world 
consumed by consumption.

 SHORE REMEMBERED: Golfers at Las Posas Country Club in Camarillo mourned the 
death of fellow member Dinah Shore, who filmed a television program at the club 
just a few months ago and sang there after a tournament last year (A1). . . 
"She put on a great show," said club member Pat Stimming, 81, a former actress 
who appeared with Shore in several movies in the 1940s. "I played with her a

who had a home in Malibu, joined Las Posas in 1981 and played there when her 
busy schedule allowed.

 NO MORE BARKING: An Oxnard woman ordered to have her dog's vocal cords cut to 
stop it from barking is suing Ventura County and Oxnard police (B1). . . . But 
when it comes to making yapping dogs quiet down, de-barking should be a last 
resort, some animal workers and health officials said. . . . Talk to the 
animal, bring it indoors and consult your veterinarian or an animal trainer. .

Humane Society for Ventura County.

 SOARING EAGLES: The Oak Park High School Eagles are flying high after winning

a surging interest in youth basketball in Oak Park -- and Coach Rob Hall, an

"They've worked very, very hard," Hall said.

 QUAKE FEVER: Cases of Valley fever in Ventura County may be on the rise since 
the Jan. 17 earthquake (B1). . . . And some doctors say they are seeing 
patients with other ill effects from the quake including colds and flu, 
possibly brought on by quake-related stress. . . . "It's hard to make a direct 
connection," said George Yu of the American Lung Assn. of Ventura County, a 
pulmonary specialist in Camarillo. "But we're seeing people who say they 
started getting sick in the middle of January."

FEAR SHROUDS AUTOPSY IN FUMES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What are you afraid of?" a reporter shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unknown . . . the fear of the unknown," answered Dan Cupido, chief deputy 
coroner in Riverside County, where pathologists, paramedics, fire crews and 
hazardous-materials squads were gathered Thursday for a most unusual autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime Thursday night, a team cloaked in heavy -- duty safety suits -- in a 
building sealed off by police tape -- planned to open the body of Gloria 
Ramirez hoping to determine why the 31-year-old cancer patient apparently began 
emitting toxic fumes while she lay dying in a hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Ramirez, who died of a heart attack Saturday night, has perplexed 
health officials despite nearly a week of investigation. The ammonia-like fumes 
were so severe that six emergency room attendants at Riverside General Hospital 
had to be rushed to other emergency rooms after suffering breathing 
difficulties and muscle spasms, and two of them remained hospitalized Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials were evasive about what they found during laboratory tests 
of Ramirez's blood, they told reporters at a crowded pre-autopsy news 
conference that the investigation is still at Square 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we absolutely know about this case is that very little is 
known," Tom DeSantis, a Riverside County spokesman, told at least 50 reporters 
and photographers who filled a basement conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Supervisor Bob Buster, who called the episode 
"unprecedented," added: "The hunger for a thorough (explanation) of this 
strange event . . . has certainly overrun our medical and scientific 
abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the autopsy, scheduled when the building would be mostly 
empty, would begin to unravel the mystery. But county health officials 
acknowledged that the incident might never be fully understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Humberto Ochoa, who stood next to the most seriously afflicted nurse 
throughout the incident, said he suffered no problems and did not notice the 
noxious fumes. He did, however, notice what appeared to be white crystals in 
blood drawn from Ramirez just before his colleagues began collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen anything like that," said Ochoa, chairman of the hospital's 
Emergency Medicine Department. "I have no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, authorities said it seemed likely that the fumes were caused by 
organophosphates, a highly reactive group of chemicals used in pesticides and 
nerve gas. But tests conducted at Loma Linda University Medical Center 
uncovered no evidence of organophosphates in the blood of Dr. Julie Gorchinski, 
one of the attendants who remain hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupido, who said investigators were "still dealing with an unknown," seemed 
reluctant to say whether anything unusual had turned up in the initial tests on 
Ramirez's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you saying they're normal?" one journalist called out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hesitating, Cupido answered, "I did not say that," but he termed it premature 
to disclose exactly what the blood analysis showed. "We have reason to believe 
it was not a natural death," the deputy coroner added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who was in the advanced stages of cervical cancer, had been 
undergoing consultation at the Loma Linda Medical Center, but authorities 
expressed doubt that any therapy she was undergoing elsewhere could have caused 
the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is even possible, investigators acknowledged, that the fumes might have 
come from elsewhere, including a rinse basin located inside the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy was to be conducted in a specially built airtight room by two 
pathologists in protective suits used for handling cleanup of hazardous waste. 
They were going to be connected to oxygen tanks. wear oxygen tanks and work in 
30-minute shifts to guard against exposure. Afterward, they were scheduled to 
be admitted to a hospital for 12 hours of precautionary observation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain state regulation they have to follow to ensure that 
employees aren't exposed to any airborne contaminants," said Rick Rice of 
Cal/OSHA "Our only interest is with employee safety. we don't think we've 
caused anyone to go to any extreme measures."

CIA CHIEF SEES RISK OF WIDER SPY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first extensive public comments on the scandal rocking his agency, CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey acknowledged Thursday that discovery of what 
officials say is a Kremlin "mole" in the agency represents a "very serious" 
internal security breach and said a special commission is examining possible 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, facing sometimes sharp questions from the House Intelligence 
Committee, said he shares lawmakers' concerns that the spying controversy 
surrounding veteran CIA officer Aldrich H. Ames might be an example of a 
breakdown that others with sensitive access could be exploiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this is a very serious problem and it's one that we take 
seriously and it's one that, frankly, I fully admit," Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not specifically address the question of whether there might be more 
than one mole operating in the agency, but others in Congress and around the 
intelligence community debated the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions of an accomplice were fueled by classified documents found in Ames' 
CIA office that had nothing to do with his assignment in the agency's 
counternarcotics center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't necessarily mean there was a second mole in the agency, but it 
may suggest that Ames had a friend or an accomplice who obtained the documents 
for him," said one congressional source familiar with intelligence briefings on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency has very strict procedures . . , information is very 
compartmentalized, and it seems unlikely that he could have gotten the later 
documents by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But a law enforcement source close to the investigation insisted that no 
Americans other than Ames and his wife are suspected of taking part in the 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 An intelligence officer with Ames' 31 years of seniority would have been able 
to acquire documents on assorted subjects without great difficulty, regardless 
of technical security restrictions, said a source familiar with CIA practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger and suspicion were pervasive in official Washington as officials both 
inside and outside the intelligence community tried to gauge the full extent of 
damage caused by spying activities that allegedly funneled sensitive 
information to the former Soviet Union and, later, to Russian intelligence 
services for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirmed that a delegation of U.S. national security officials, 
including a high-ranking CIA official, has been dispatched to Moscow to confer 
with their Russian counterparts. It is understood that the U.S. delegation 
wants to underscore common intelligence interests that the two countries share 
rather than seeking cooperation in the Ames investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators' hopes that the suspects themselves would help in the damage 
assessment were dashed when attorneys for Ames, 52, a middle-level intelligence 
officer who had specialized in Soviet counterintelligence, and his wife, Maria 
del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, indicated that they would fight the charges. The 
accused CIA agent is refusing to answer questions about his alleged espionage 
for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, he's going to plead not guilty and fight the charges," said 
Plato Cacheris, Ames' court-appointed lawyer. "We're keeping our options open." 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Washington defense attorney declined to elaborate, but a 
government source familiar with the case said Cacheris may have qualified his 
statement because of the strength of the evidence contained in an unusually 
detailed FBI affidavit filed in connection with searches and arrest of the 
couple Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ames, who worked briefly as a paid CIA source in Mexico City, attacked 
the accuracy of quotations in the FBI affidavit -- drawn from wiretaps -- that 
depicted her as an active participant in the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, William Cummings, said the part-time student at Georgetown 
University, "has been devastated by the distortions, out-of-context selected 
statements and alleged quotations in the government's affidavit, along with the 
subsequent press coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 When arrested Monday, she gave FBI agents a "very damaging statement," a 
source familiar with the investigation said Thursday. An aide to Cummings 
declined comment on her interview by FBI agents and whether it signaled that 
she is cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 But another source said there has been no further cooperation after the 
initial interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Woolsey faced questions heavily laced with 
disbelief that an intelligence officer with access to such extremely sensitive 
information -- including the code names of Russians spying for the United 
States -- could have escaped notice while living far beyond his means and 
making unauthorized travel overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may not have been alone in recognizing that the system may not have been 
operating, that discovery is not certain, that procedures were not working," 
said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House panel, said the Ames case 
"raises disturbing questions about the internal controls and management of 
counterintelligence activities at the CIA." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said a joint CIA-Defense Department commission appointed last year is 
currently studying security-related issues and would be making its 
recommendations shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This commission, among other things, has looked carefully into such matters 
as reliance on the polygraph, focusing on the financial status of individuals 
in the government by way of keeping track of security matters and the rest," 
Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid reports that Ames passed CIA polygraph tests in 1986 and 1991, Woolsey 
said: "There are important changes that need to be made in . . . security 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about the possibility of another mole or an Ames confederate 
remaining in the CIA were heightened by a government affidavit on a June 25, 
1993, search of Ames' office by the FBI. It turned up many restricted documents 
that had "no relationship to Ames' current duties as an operations officer in 
the Counternarcotics Center," said the document, which was made public Tuesday.

 The Justice Department is considering a temporary waiver of a ban forbidding 
HIV-infected people to enter the United States, officials and gay activists 
said.The waiver would allow visitors infected with HIV, which causes the AIDS 
virus, to participate in the Gay Games, scheduled to take place in New York in 
June. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a communique 
on the waiver had been prepared in anticipation of approval by Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno. He said the communique had been mistakenly sent to embassies.

 The government was accused of deliberately contaminating hundreds of people 
with radiation 40 years ago by exploding a hydrogen bomb near the Marshall 
Islands. U.S. officials had acknowledged that the fallout from the 1954 
explosion had exposed some islanders to radiation, but they claimed it was only 
because of sudden changes in wind. However, documents presented at a 
congressional hearing showed that the government knew 12 hours in advance that 
the wind was changing. "The (bomb) shot was deliberately set off despite the 
fact that (Atomic Energy Commission) officials knew exactly which way the winds 
were headed," Jonathan Weisgall, an attorney for the inhabitants of Bikini 
Island, told the House Natural Resources subcommittee.

<P>
 An American was arrested Thursday on charges of attempting to smuggle 27 
Haitians into the United States, including four who drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury returned the indictment charging Richard Bennett Barker 
with conspiracy to smuggle illegal aliens and 27 separate counts of alien 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker, 43, was arrested in West Palm Beach, the FBI said. He was scheduled to 
appear before a magistrate today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians arrived Feb. 8 aboard a 31-foot vessel from Freeport, Bahamas, 
and were dropped in the surf off Hutchinson Island. Two of the four who drowned 
were children. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23 others were caught by police and U.S. Border Patrol agents before being 
released to church organizations. Most were expected to resettle with relatives 
in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker faces a maximum of 140 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on each 
count if convicted, Coffey said.

BRUCE VOELLER, 59; SCIENTIST, GAY ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Voeller, a research scientist and gay rights activist who campaigned for 
the use of condoms to combat AIDS, has died of the disease. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller died Feb. 13 at his home in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequent witness before Congress on homosexuality and the gay rights 
movement, Voeller had helped found the National Gay Task Force in 1973. He 
served as executive director of the influential lobbying group from 1973 to 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Voeller established the Mariposa Education & Research Foundation to 
conduct research in human sexuality and find ways to reduce the risk of 
sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The group commissioned sculptures by George Segal that are now in place in 
Stanford University's sculpture garden and in New York City's Greenwich 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller focused his research on condoms and spermicides. He persuaded the 
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control to join him in testing nonoxynol-9, 
the chief ingredient in popular spermicides, for inactivating HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Reed College, Voeller earned his doctorate in developmental 
biology, biochemistry and developmental genetics at New York's Rockefeller 
University. During his tenure as associate professor at Rockefeller, he wrote 
four books, including "Basic Biology" and "Three Centuries of Botany in North 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 29, although he was married with three children, Voeller acknowledged 
his homosexuality, having vowed to do so before his 30th birthday. He said he 
had to "be true to himself in order to be true to others." His child custody 
battle after his divorce went to the Supreme Court and became a test case for 
child visitation rights of gay parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller is survived by his companion and associate at Mariposa Foundation, 
Richard Lucik; three children, Jan Voeller of Boulder, Colo., Christopher 
Voeller of Toledo, Ohio, and Suzanne Sundheim of Philadelphia; and two sisters, 
Nancy Petron of Sacramento and Ginger Ferguson of British Columbia.

PLEA BY MANURE-POWERED PLANT REJECTED; ENERGY: PANEL DENIES WAIVER FOR 
EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY. EDISON OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING REPAYMENT SCHEDULE THAT 
WILL KEEP COMPANY OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To the chagrin of cattle owners in Imperial County, a federal energy 
commission has turned down an appeal from the world's only plant that makes 
electricity from manure. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection could spell bankruptcy for the Imperial plant, which burned 1 
million tons of manure from 1988 to early 1993 before torrential rains caused 
it to grind to a sticky halt. The plant had offered a solution to the perennial 
problem of the cattle industry: what to do with all that dung. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very bad news for us," said Ross Jenkins, general manager of Phillips 
Cattle Co. in El Centro and chairman of the feedlot council of the California 
Cattlemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision Wednesday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
came without discussion at a meeting in Washington. Plant owners are studying 
whether to appeal to federal court. At issue is whether the Mesquite Lake plant 
deserves a waiver from a requirement that it use no more than 25% natural gas 
to operate its generators. 
</P>
<P>
 When last year's rains turned the cattle manure soupy, the facility was forced 
to switch almost entirely to natural gas to keep operating and sought a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison, which buys power from the manure plant, opposed 
the waiver and demanded that its owners repay $6 million to $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an arrangement in which utilities are required to buy power from 
independent producers who use alternative sources, Edison pays 10 cents per 
kilowatt for manure power. But it can buy natural gas-generated power for a 
third of that amount on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the waiver has been denied, Edison official Tom Gibbs said the 
company wants to "try to work out a repayment schedule that will keep (the 
plant) in business." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed that Edison customers should not be stuck with paying 
extra for electricity produced by natural gas. The amount of any repayment, and 
the repayment schedule, will be subject to negotiations between Edison and the 
manure plant owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that the problems caused by last year's rains were not an 
anomaly but were symptomatic of technical flaws in the manure plant, flaws that 
led to a lawsuit between the original investors and the engineers who built the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission, in urging the federal commission 
to reject the appeal, had called the manure plant a technological failure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, plant engineers hope to have the facility back on-line next month, 
burning manure once again. Still, they worry that if they are required to make 
the repayment in a lump sum, it would dry up investment money still needed for 
the experimental plant. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plant folds, the cattle owners are unsure what they will do with the 
mountains of manure produced by 450,000 cattle that pass through the valley's 
feedlots each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good Lord will just have to find a place to put all this manure," said 
Edward (Jiggs) Johnson, one of the owners of El Toro Land & Cattle Co. in 
Heber.

DOW'S PLUNGE TRIGGERED BY RATE FEARS; WALL STREET: 'CIRCUIT BREAKERS' KICK IN 
TO HELP SLOW THE FALL. COLLAPSE OF THE TCI/BELL ATLANTIC MERGER ALSO A FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investor fears fed by a surge in long-term interest rates sent stock prices 
plummeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of a multibillion-dollar merger and weakness in stocks abroad 
added to the gloom on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average 
dropped enough in the final half-hour of trading to trip a New York Stock 
Exchange "circuit breaker" aimed at coping with extreme conditions and 
preserving investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue chip indicator lost 51.78, closing at 3,839.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures also posted steep declines. The NYSE composite index 
fell 3.38 to 257.75 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 6.43 to 464.26. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, selling waves washed over smaller stocks as well. The Nasdaq 
Stock Market composite index shed 9.67 to 779.44. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers swamped gainers on the NYSE by about 4 to 1 on heavy Big Board volume 
totaling 342.94 million shares, up from 309.91 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the disconcerting factors for the stock market was the announcement late 
Wednesday that Bell Atlantic's planned acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. 
had been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was a blow for cable and communications companies in particular 
because their stocks had been bid up in recent months due to takeover 
speculation as investors bet that the industries would consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a bearish sentiment rampant in the bond market overshadowed 
a decent showing at the Treasury's five-year note auction, and the closely 
watched 30-year Treasury bond ended the day down more than a full point, 
driving up its yield to 6.73% from 6.65% on Wednesday. The long bond's price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, slumped 1 1/16 points, or $10.63 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders began bailing out of bonds from the opening in response to a 
government report of unexpectedly robust economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that orders to U.S. factories for durable 
goods jumped a surprising 3.7% in January. Many economists expected a 1% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the bond market's bearishness, the Treasury auction of $11 
billion in five-year notes met decent demand but failed to quell an afternoon 
selling spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on the five-year notes rose to their highest level in more than a year. 
The high yield was 5.61%, up from 5.10% at the last auction Jan. 26. It was the 
highest rate since five-year notes sold for 5.66% on Jan. 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid-to-cover ratio, a measure of auction demand comparing bids offered to 
those accepted, was 2.85 to 1. That was up from 2.69 to 1 in the previous 12 
auctions of five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors who blamed the stock market's slide mainly on the bond 
market's performance noted that attitudes have turned against stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's real concern here about the rise in interest rates. The fear now is 
that this rise in interest rates will reduce the flow of money into mutual 
funds. If it does, then the market has real problems," said Michael Metz, a 
vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Metz said portfolio managers have been culling holdings to raise cash in case 
of mutual fund redemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cable television stocks were hammered by the news of the canceled TCI/Bell 
Atlantic deal. TCI dropped 1 7/8 to 22 3/8, Comcast lost 1 to 19 1/2 and 
CableVision Systems plunged 5 1/4 to 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * The shares of cable equipment makers, which are seen as having been set to 
benefit from the merger, also lost ground. General Instrument shrank 6 1/8 to 
44 5/8, DSC Communications fell 2 1/2 to 52 3/4 and Tellabs lost 1 to 51 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bell Atlantic, which had drifted lower in the weeks after the merger deal's 
announcement in October, ended up 1 3/4 to 54 1/2 as analysts raised their 
rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Novell rose 1 to 24 5/8 after the software company reported strong earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stac Electronics surged 2 1/8 to 6 1/2. On Wednesday, a federal jury awarded 
Stac $120 million from Microsoft for patent infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 Most foreign stock markets suffered setbacks, except Tokyo's, with the 
225-issue Nikkei average rising 423.65 points, or 1.84%, to end the day at 
19,765.48. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, London and Paris, stocks moved sharply lower amid worries about 
the implications of Russia's political uncertainty, speculation about rising 
British interest rates and disappointment over a small rate cut by Bank of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index rebounded from early losses to close up rose 19.98 
points at 2,592.33. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dropped sharply, hurt by Wall Street's decline, more signs of 
inflation and fresh indications that the Clinton Administration wants the U.S. 
currency to weaken against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar ended at 104.85 Japanese yen, down from 105.55 on 
Wednesday. The U.S. currency also fell to 1.717 German marks from 1.729. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, gold prices ended lower on the New York Comex. Gold lost 
$1.20 an ounce to close at $376.50. Silver fetched $5.172 an ounce, off 5.7 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil futures prices posted their strongest one-day gain in nearly a month 
after industry and government reports showed lower U.S. supplies of gasoline 
and other refined products than traders expected. Light, sweet crude oil for 
April delivery rose 36 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange to $14.77 a 
barrel. It was the market's biggest gain since Feb. 1.

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; THE RATIONALIST BY WARWICK COLLINS ; SIMON & SCHUSTER; 
$21, 251 PAGES; SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LOGIC AND EMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Silas Grange, according to his friend and mentor Dr. Hargood, is a "damned 
wise fool"; Grange has "a mind as cold as winter," "harbors 'a terrible 
detachment,' " gives in to no vices whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargood is a well-known rake, keeping a mistress in London even at his 
relatively advanced age, but the elder doctor's voluptuous lifestyle -- he's a 
libertine at the dinner table, too -- hasn't clouded his ability to judge 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 Grange is indeed diffident, leery not only of appetite but also of simple 
feeling, and counters Hargood's friendly charges by pointing out that the 
madness of Britain's reigning king, George III, could be attributed to "an 
excess of emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargood isn't convinced, and goes on to warn Grange that his faith in reason 
-- itself a contradiction, as Grange at some level acknowledges -- may lead to 
trouble. Hargood even has a source of trouble in mind: Mrs. Celia Quill, a 
widow in the doctors' rainy coastal village whom Grange, uncharacteristically, 
will admit to noticing. 
</P>
<P>
 In three short years, Quill has become a respected presence in Lymington, 
Hampshire, and Hargood admires her greatly, but fears her charm and 
intelligence will precipitate the ruin of his sensually innocent colleague. "I 
believe your curiosity will lead you to Hell, sir," Hargood informs Grange, 
speaking -- so author Warwick Collins tell us -- "as though Hell were merely a 
district, like Cheapside, which a gentleman should attempt to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rationalist" is a Gothic novel of sorts, with its portentous tone, bleak 
locale and early 19th-Century setting. But Collins, for whom this work is not 
only a U.S. debut but a major fictional departure -- his three previous books 
having been thrillers set in the yacht-racing world -- has written with modern 
sensibilities in mind, for at bottom Quill is a woman seeking equal 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming the field in which she plays the presumptively male role would give the 
book away: Suffice it to say that Grange does fall prey to her seductive 
intellect and is later stunned to discover that he has served not some larger 
philosophical goal, as he had been led to believe, but Quill alone. Or are 
things even more complicated than that -- has Quill, in the final analysis, 
been honorable all along? 
</P>
<P>
 That question lies unanswered at the close of "The Rationalist," Collins 
(improbably, also a professional yacht designer, the inventor of the tandem 
keel used in America's Cup racing) interested not in rightness or wrongness, 
but in the vast expanses of the head and heart in which humans routinely delude 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rationalist" is at times quite fascinating, as we watch Grange attempt to 
incorporate sensuality and tenderness into his world view. He is a man of 
medicine, after all: In the book's opening pages, Grange amputates a seaman's 
gangrened arm, with rum the only anesthetic, and is well aware that the 
doctor's skills rely on the ability to detach oneself from the pains and 
pleasures of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Grange's detachment is forced, however, for unlike Hargood -- who says, "A 
doctor cannot afford sympathy. . . . Sympathy is a mechanism for making two 
people unhappy where only one was unhappy before" -- he is introspective, 
unwilling to let contradictions lie. That's why he studies David Hume's "A 
Treatise of Human Nature" -- because Hume, he tells Hargood, is "my Lucifer, my 
devil," arguing that reason is no more than dressed-up rationalization and 
subverting every proposition Grange takes for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting that Grange describes Hume in satanic terms, because the 
ominous, melancholic quality of "The Rationalist" in general, and Quill in 
particular, lead the reader to expect a bloody, demonic or otherwise darkly 
romantic conclusion. And in some ways it is bloody: Grange is devastated when 
Hargood uncovers Quill's incriminating past, and is bled by his friend, 
according to contemporary medical practice, "to keep him to his bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the book, which stakes high and original ground, seems attenuated 
nonetheless, lacking a strong and compelling finale: We're left feeling 
ambivalence toward Grange's relationship with Quill, unable to condone it or 
condemn it. "The Rationalist" stands tall on its own merits, but one hopes 
Collins will reread Mary Shelley before his next venture into this genre.

 NO LICKING: Forget about the cellular phone or the automated teller machine. 
Technology has finally come up with an important breakthrough -- the 
self-adhesive stamp (B1). . . . In the Valley alone, 4 million self-adhesive 
Christmas stamps were sold last year, and the new designs are "selling like 
crazy," said a Postal Service spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 WATCH THE TRAYS: When Barndance started six years ago at the Little Nashville, 
musicians had more to worry about than striking the right chords. "We had to 
put a few of them on the floor because the place was so small," host Ronnie 
Mack recalled. "Waitresses would run into them with their trays.". . . 
Barndance, a weekly haven for original country music, keeps going strong at the 
Palomino in North Hollywood. See Valley Life! Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE TRAFFIC: The Valley used to be the boondocks. Don't believe us? Just 
ask Barry Wolfe, who originated a weekly bicycle ride during the early 1960s. 
"You could go from one end of the Valley to the other," said Wolfe, 62, "and 
hit maybe two stop signals. It was fantastic.". . . Traffic or not, biking in 
the Valley is big these days. See Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 ALL-AMERICAN: Jagos Medenica, a College of the Canyons hoopster from 
Yugoslavia, certainly owns some pretty good credentials -- he was born on July 
4, 1972. "They had fireworks in America for my birthday," he joked. . . . They 
almost had fireworks at his school earlier in the year when, against orders, he 
attempted a three-point shot. His job is to go for rebounds, which he does very 
well (C12). 
</P>
<P>
 EXTRA ESCAPE: In reel life, Corky Parks plays the role of bum, wino, suspect, 
perpetrator. But instead of making $65 a day as a Hollywood extra, that could 
easily be his real life. In fact, it once was. . . . Twenty years ago, Parks, 
44, slept in Skid Row alleys, watching scavenging rats. Today, he belongs to 
the Screen Actors Guild (B1). Michael Arkush

 The contest between the "L.A. Heat" and the "Orange County Fire" will be at 6 
p.m. on the Saddleback College football field, 28000 Marguerite Parkway in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Prado, an Orange County Fire Department reservist who plays quarterback,

UCLA RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST CAL; BRUINS: THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN AFTER 
TRAILING BY 15 WITH THREE MINUTES TO PLAY, BUT BEARS HANG ON, 92-88.

 Another game, another defeat for the UCLA Bruins, who followed up a 24-point 
loss at Arizona by getting nudged Thursday night at Pauley Pavilion by 
California, which looked like a team going somewhere fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Bruins also looked like a team going somewhere swiftly, only 
not in the right direction. As soon as UCLA fell, 92-88, the Pacific 10 
Conference race fell into a virtual three-way tie between the fading Bruins and 
surging Arizona and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA didn't go easily. Down 86-71 and with Ed O'Bannon having fouled out, 
the Bruins outscored Cal, 15-1, and got to within 87-86 with 1:04 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had a chance to go ahead, but turned the ball over when the shot 
clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Five free throws in the last 18 seconds -- four by Jason Kidd, ended it for 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, 18-4, is 11-3 in the Pac-10, the same as Arizona, while the Bears are a 
half-game back at 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After back-to-back losses and four defeats in eight games, it's not a pretty 
picture at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame? This time, it was easy. Lamond Murray, a shooting star if 
there ever was one, scored 36 points and Kidd inspired the Bears to a sweep of 
their series against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly had a chance to win," Coach Jim Harrick said. "We just didn't 
play well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver's career-high 30 points, 21 in the second half, nearly rescued the 
game for UCLA, but the shot-clock violation was a critical error. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball wound up in Tyus Edney's hands, but he was double-teamed, so he 
passed to Charles O'Bannon and the shot clock ran to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyus probably wishes he got the ball to Shon Tarver," said Harrick, who said 
he did not call a time out because he did not want to stop UCLA's momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we should have called a timeout there," he said. "What happened there 
was not a good thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd was not a good thing for UCLA. He had 23 points, sank two free throws for 
a 89-86 lead with 19 seconds left and Edney's three-pointer missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd completed his night's work with 11 assists, only four fewer than the UCLA 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bruins needed any extra incentive Thursday, all they needed to do was 
think about last season's 104-82 wipeout at the hands of Kidd and Murray, their 
worst loss ever at Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there was the matter of the timely critique, becoming almost 
routine around Westwood these day. This one was slightly different, though, 
because it came from Bill Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on ESPN's 'Up Close," Walton delivered a withering blast that seemed 
sure to bruise Bruin psyches, since it came from one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this Bruin team does not know how to play big games," Walton 
said. "Like a number of UCLA teams with Jim Harrick, they start to go downhill 
as the season goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting last year's blowout, Cal had been 2-32 at UCLA since the 1959-60 
season coming into Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of that was before the Kidd Era at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the Bruins probably are going to close their eyes until its 
over. The first half was a Kidd production, almost in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 At the half, Kidd had 12 points, eight assists, three steals and California 
owned a 53-41 lead. It took only 10 minutes for UCLA to fall behind by 10 
points at 26-16. Murray was a main culprit with 15 of his 20 first-half points 
as well as four dunks of the highlight variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney scored on a breakaway to get UCLA within 31-24, but then Kidd took over. 
</P>
<P>
 He started it on defense when he stole the ball from Cameron Dollar and scored 
on layup. Then Murray rejected Charles O'Bannon. At the other end, Kidd batted 
a mid-air rebound to Akili Jones and he knocked in a short jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time down, Kidd finished another fast break with another layup. At 
37-24, the rout was on, or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the tipoff, game faces were already being worn, even by 
non-combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was ever a must game on the schedule for UCLA, it's this one," 
ESPN's Dick Vitale said. "They really need it psychologically, to beat somebody 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 They almost did.

LAKERS DON'T HAVE ANSWERS FOR KINGS; PRO BASKETBALL: LINEUP CHANGE ISN'T ENOUGH 
AS THEY LOSE TO SACRAMENTO FOR FOURTH TIME THIS SEASON, 102-90. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers did some dealing Thursday, just not the kind that would give them a 
new hand to play against the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 That would take much more than the acquisition of veteran center Danny Schayes 
from the Milwaukee Bucks at the cost of a conditional second-round draft 
choice. That would also, the Lakers found out, take more than Sedale Threatt 
replacing Tony Smith in the starting lineup and scoring 28 points or the 18 
points and 16 rebounds from Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take something the Lakers haven't been able to figure out, at least 
not in 1993-94. The latest example came before 17,317 at Arco Arena, where the 
Kings claimed a 102-90 victory to win four games in the season series for the 
first time since 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
 While appearing to go for strength and a power position, the Lakers actually 
made the move to finesse the salary cap. With a $1.75 million contract for this 
season, the 34-year-old Schayes fits into the salary slot vacated when A.C. 
Green signed with Phoenix last summer. That would have expired June 30 had the 
Lakers not used it, but now they can let Schayes become an unrestricted free 
agent after this season and keep the same room under the cap until July 1, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Schayes, who is expected to join the Lakers for Sunday's game against Boston 
at the Forum, was originally drafted in the first round in 1981 by Utah. He 
spent a season and a half with the Jazz before going on to Denver and then, for 
the last 3 1/2 years, Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes had only played in 23 games with the 
Bucks this season, starting six times and averaging 10 minutes, 2.1 points and 
two rebounds. There doesn't figure to be a much greater opportunity with the 
Lakers, where he becomes the fourth center, along with Vlade Divac, Sam Bowie 
and James Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny Schayes is obviously an experienced, veteran guy," Laker Coach Randy 
Pfund said. "And I don't mind at all that he has the ability to come in and 
bang around inside." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the one deal the Lakers made as the league trading deadline passed at 
6 p.m. PST, though they discussed others. One was with Indiana regarding Malik 
Sealy, who has fallen from sixth man at the start of the season to third-string 
small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the change with the team he had Thursday, Pfund had been contemplating 
a move at shooting guard for some time, even as he stayed with Smith for 
defense while Threatt played a major role in wins with offense off the bench. 
Ultimately -- even with Mitch Richmond, the league's top-scoring guard, to 
worry about -- the switch was made to boost the Lakers' 99.7-point scoring 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt scored a team-high 28 points in his second start of the season, but 
the rest of the Lakers didn't follow. Smith couldn't have. He went from the 
starting lineup the previous 14 games, averaging 27.2 minutes, to not even 
getting in the game.

MORNING BRIEFING: RED SOX FLIRTING WITH TITLE? WAIT A MINUTE, IT'S A DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring training is beautiful. Spring training is art. Red Sox spring training 
is a water-color study in still life, Dan Shaughnessy wrote in the Boston Globe 
on the first day in camp at Ft. Myers, Fla. He went on: 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching 2 1/2 hours of grueling drills, there can be only one 
conclusion: It looks like the pennant will be Boston's. The Sox are bound to 
grab the gonfalon. It's the Impossible Dream Redux. Your baseball team is a 
team of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the above is true, but we thought you'd enjoy reading it anyway. It's 
been a long, awful winter, and the New England mind deserves a flirtation with 
the prospect of the Red Sox winning it all for the first time in 76 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Other than UCLA, how many Pacific 10 teams have won the NCAA 
basketball championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Ready or not: Mark Soltau of the San Francisco Examiner questioned whether 
John Daly will be ready to return to the PGA Tour in the tournament at Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., March 10-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Soltau: "While there's no denying his long, aggressive swing is 
entertaining, he has yet to prove it will hold up on a weekly basis. Likewise 
for his concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "A recovering alcoholic, Daly became frustrated and impatient with himself 
last year when his game didn't measure up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A healthy, happy Daly is a real asset to the PGA Tour. Hopefully, he has 
learned another painful lesson and has his life and career in order. Golf needs 
Daly, but not at his own expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Guilty conscience: Coastal Carolina basketball Coach Russ Bergman saw the 
movie, "Blue Chips," and it moved him to confess to violating NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman said he bought plane tickets for star forwards Mohammed Acha and 
Dennis Pierre. Bergman said Acha was stranded in New York when he received a 
ticket, and Pierre's ticket allowed him to travel home for Christmas. Bergman 
was reimbursed by Pierre's high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the confession, the school suspended Bergman for recruiting violations. 
Bergman told the Myrtle Beach (S.C.) Sun News that he decided to admit the 
violations after seeing the movie, which tells the story of a college coach 
struggling to follow the NCAA rules and still produce a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was a violation," Bergman said. "But it was only the humane thing 
to do. I take full responsibility for all I've done and I'll accept whatever 
penalties they choose to give me." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Three -- Oregon (1939), Stanford (1942) and California (1959).

GOLF / PGA AT SAN DIEGO; NOT MANY SEE THREE SHOOT 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps half of the gallery at Torrey Pines for the first round of the Buick 
Invitational Thursday attached itself to a group that included defending 
champion Phil Mickelson, the local kid, and Payne Stewart, Mr. Knickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, noting the gathering crowd before he teed off, issued a disclaimer of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the gallery to think we're the only players in the field," he 
said. "Some of these names might not be the ones they're accustomed to seeing, 
but it doesn't mean they aren't great golfers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the multitudes were chasing Mickelson, Stewart and Keith Clearwater, the 
following occurred: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doug Martin played to virtually no gallery and shot a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 -- David Toms played to virtually no gallery and shot a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ronnie Black got the crowd's attention with a 29 on his first nine holes 
and played to a growing gallery en route to his 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the leaders after the first round. They have a total of two PGA 
Tour victories among them, both by Black -- the Southern Open in 1983 and the 
Anheuser-Busch tournament in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most celebrated threesome, Mickelson and Clearwater both shot 68, 
Stewart a 70. They were off the pace, but not far off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's "true" leader was probably the best on the tougher South Course, 
Toms, followed by Ed Dougherty, whose 66 tied him with three others for fourth 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most spectacular round belonged to the 35-year-old Black, who had to 
scramble at the end of last year to finish 125th on the money list and gain an 
exemption for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on the North's back nine, he birdied the 10th and 11th holes but fell 
back when he missed a three-footer for par on the 13th. The best way to 
describe that start was unremarkable. Suddenly, however, Black birdied the 
15th, eagled the par-four 16th, birdied the 17th and eagled the par-five 18th. 
He picked up six strokes in four holes and finished the back nine at 29, lowest 
for that stretch in the tournament's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best shot all day was the wedge on 16," Black said. "It was my most solid 
shot. That green was really elevated, so I couldn't even see it go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, the gallery must have tipped him off? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there were five or six people up there," he said. "They clapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, Black was pleased with his score but not with his round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a round like I've never had before," he mused. "I hit two horrible tee 
balls on 10 and 11 and I'm two under. I scattered bad shots through the whole 
round. I hit lousy drives all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 While Black was shooting his 65, Martin, a 27-year-old graduate of the Nike 
Tour, was almost blase about his round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a straight-forward and basic seven-under," he said. "I was just 
trying to keep myself in the fairways and give myself a chance."

NBA ROUNDUP; MASHBURN'S 37 POINTS ADD TO PROBLEMS IN CHARLOTTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With illness, injuries and Mike Gminski en route to new employment, the 
Hornets were nine-strong for their game against the Dallas Mavericks at 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the missing were Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that nine-weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte lost for the 12th time in its last 13 games, 115-110, to Dallas, 
which shot 64% in winning its second in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jamal Mashburn scored 37 points to lead six Mavericks in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a team shoots 64%, it's difficult to win," Hornet Coach Allan Bristow 
said. "Our presence inside is not what we want it to be. We've got to play 
better defense. Right now we're struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Frank Brickowski, acquired in the Gminski deal that was a 
trade of 34-year-old players, is expected to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 93, New York 73 -- Hakeem Olajuwon had 29 points and 20 rebounds, and 
made four consecutive baskets in a fourth-quarter run that carried the Rockets, 
who held the Knicks to 29 points in the second half, at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 120, Minnesota 101 -- The Suns won for the fifth time in their last 
six games and remained unbeaten in 19 games against the Timberwolves behind 26 
points from Cedric Ceballos at Minneapolis.

NHL ROUNDUP; CONFIDENT SAN JOSE LOSES, 5-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To demonstrate how far the San Jose Sharks have come in their fourth NHL 
season, consider their attitude in traveling to Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could come in and win this game," said Shark center Jamie 
Baker, a former Senator. "I mean, look at Ottawa's record!" 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? The Senators were 0-9-3 in their last 12 games, had won only nine of 
61 and hadn't scored in their last 137 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sylvain Turgeon scored two power-play goals and rookie Alexei Yashin had 
three assists for Ottawa in a 5-4 victory over the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Rumble ended Ottawa's scoreless string when he snapped Yashin's pass 
behind Sharks goalie Arturs Irbe 2:17 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Winnipeg 3 -- Jeremy Roenick scored four times and reached the 
30-goal plateau for the fourth consecutive season as the Blackhawks survived 
the loss of Steve Smith with a possible broken leg at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roenick Helped extend Winnipeg's winless streak to 17 games (0-15-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Smith tumbled to the ice at 12:45 of the first period after being struck by a 
left uppercut from Tie Domi. Smith's leg buckled under him, and Domi continued 
to pummel him with left jabs as he fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 4, Calgary 0 -- Lightning goaltender Daren Puppa stopped 18 shots at 
Calgary for his fourth shutout and the Flames scored in each of the first two 
periods in cruising to their seventh road victory in the last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Hartford 0 -- Sergei Fedorov assisted on all three Red Wing goals 
at Richfield, Ohio, and Chris Osgood got the first shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory pulled Detroit into a first-place tie with Toronto in the Central 
Division at 77 points each. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, New York Islanders 4 -- Rod Brind'Amour scored his second goal 
of the game 1:25 into overtime at Philadelphia as the Flyers won their third in 
a row and fourth in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec 6, St. Louis 0 -- Stephane Fiset recorded his second shutout in three 
games, stopping 24 shots at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 3, New Jersey 1 -- Mark Messier became the 11th NHL player to 
collect 1,300 career points by setting up Adam Graves' go-ahead goal in the 
second period at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 2, Florida 1 -- Randy Burridge and Michal Pivonka each scored as 
the Capitals won at Miami in the first of a home-and-home series that continues 
Saturday in Washington.

SHTALENKOV HELPS DUCKS TIE PENGUINS; HOCKEY: NEW GOALIE STIFFENS AFTER GIVING 
UP AN EARLY GOAL, AND DUCKS RALLY FOR A POINT, 2-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Penguins can make a goalie shake in his skates, even on a night 
when Mario Lemieux and Rick Tocchet aren't playing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still Jaromir Jagr, the hulking wing with the long black hair who 
handles the puck with such supreme skill. There's still Ron Francis, Kevin 
Stevens, Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, and the two newest Penguins, former Kings 
Tomas Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks sent their new backup goalie, Mikhail Shtalenkov, into the 
fray Thursday, and he helped them leave Civic Arena with a 2-2 tie and a 
hard-earned point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game, I had a good warm-up," Shtalenkov said. "I said to myself, 
'If you want to play in the NHL, you must try to play good. You have a chance 
now,' " 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes into the game, he had already given up a power-play goal 
on a shot by Mullen. But Shtalenkov sharpened, and he stopped Pittsburgh's 
attack the rest of the period, turning away McEachern on a breakaway, thwarting 
other Penguins with deft poke-checks, and snagging a hard shot by Jagr with his 
glove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of faith in Mike (Shtalenkov)," Coach Ron Wilson said, even 
though Shtalenkov had played in only two previous NHL games, and in his last 
had to be pulled after giving up three goals on five shots in the first period 
of a Nov. 17 loss to Toronto. "It was good for Mike to be able to make the 
saves he made for himself. He played well in the first period and after that 
they hardly had a sniff. They only had four shots in the third period." 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov, 28, is new to the NHL, but he is not raw. He played for Dynamo 
Moscow for six years before the Ducks drafted him in the fifth round in June, 
and he has extensive international experience -- enough that Wilson says he 
might be the best Russian goalie in the world right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov has been in the minors most of the season until Sunday morning, 
when his arrival served as Ron Tugnutt's first omen that he had been traded to 
Montreal. Now Shtalenkov is Guy Hebert's backup, and the success of the trade 
that brought center Stephan Lebeau to the Ducks also depends on how well the 
goaltending holds up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a little bit nervous and that's OK," Shtalenkov said. "We're 
playing against Pittsburgh and that's a big game to me. . . . I'm just glad 
today I did good. But one game is not enough. Ducks want now to play in 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 McEachern's second-period goal on a long-range slap shot -- his second since 
returning to the Penguins in the trade that brought McSorley back to Los 
Angeles -- made the score 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Duck defense, which had been on a bit of a vacation lately, turned 
physical again, and the Ducks came back to tie the score on Tim Sweeney's 
power-play rebound at 4:50 of the second and Joe Sacco's breakaway goal at 
17:16 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov and Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso fended off the rest of the 
scoring attempts, with Barrasso stopping 17 shots over the final 25 minutes and 
Shtalenkov called on for only five. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we got a point was because of Barrasso," Pittsburgh Coach Ed 
Johnston said. Duck Notes

 The Ducks have 51 points, four behind San Jose for the eighth and final 
Western Conference playoff spot. . . . Mario Lemieux, who resumed playing this 
month after a three-month layoff because of soreness in his back, had not 
played the past two games and took a cortisone shot Thursday morning. Teammate 
Rick Tocchet also was out with a sore back.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: CBS' NUMBERS AS GOOD AS KERRIGAN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan got some impressive numbers Wednesday night, but the numbers 
CBS got are even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to come out Thursday were a 49.7 overnight rating and a 64 share for 
the nation's 30 largest markets. Later came the national numbers -- a 48.5 
rating and a 64 share. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that Wednesday night's Winter Olympics prime-time coverage on CBS 
was watched in 48.5% of all television households in the country and in 64% of 
the homes where televisions were on. Each rating point represents 1% of the 
nation's 94.2 million television households. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 49.7 had held up, that would have been a record for sports events. 
Super Bowl XVI, in which San Francisco beat Cincinnati on Jan. 24, 1982, got a 
49.1. The 49.7 would also have been the fourth-highest rating of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the 48.5 ranks No. 6, with two Super Bowls, including the one in 
1983, still ahead of Wednesday night's Games. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS estimated that Wednesday night's Olympic program was watched by 
110,530,000, ranking it No. 8 in audience size. No. 1 was this year's Super 
Bowl, which drew an estimated 134,840,000 viewers. The rating was a 45.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Bowl audiences correlate higher because of parties and gatherings in one 
household. Six Super Bowl audiences were larger than the one CBS drew Wednesday 
night, as was the the total of 121,624,000 for the last episode of "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
 Through 12 nights of the Olympics, CBS has averaged a 27.6 rating and a 41 
share in prime time. At this juncture two years ago at Albertville, CBS was 
averaging a 19.2 and a 30 share. 
</P>
<P>
 The record for a Winter Olympics is a 23.9 rating and a 37 share in 1980. The 
record for any Olympics is a 24.4 rating and a 44 share for the Summer Games in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan is going for the gold tonight, but with Tonya Harding virtually out 
of the running for a medal it's doubtful that the rating will top 48.5. But you 
never know. Suddenly, figure skating is big, very big. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain price: CBS paid $295 million for the rights to the Lillehammer Games 
and last month agreed to pay $375 million for the 1998 Winter Olympics at 
Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out that is a bargain. The record ratings CBS is getting at Lillehammer 
means it will be able to increase ad rates for Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS charged $325,000 for 30-second spots before the Games. It is charging 
$430,000 for the few spots it held back for "make-goods" in case of lower 
ratings than had been guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors for the '98 Games might not be willing to pay much more than that 
-- unless there's another Harding-Kerrigan type of incident. And there may 
never again be anything like that, at least nothing that would get the same 
kind of media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add ratings: Even though TNT didn't show Harding, Kerrigan or any of the other 
top competitors Wednesday on its daytime coverage, which also included the 
U.S.-Finland hockey game, the cable network still got a 4.1 rating and drew 2.5 
million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's TNT's highest Olympic rating, and four times higher than TNT's normal 
daytime rating. TNT also had weekday coverage from Albertville two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, TNT will again offer figure skating, minus the top names, plus the 
Canada-Finland hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of warning to viewers not wanting to know results before the prime-time 
show on CBS: TNT will air periodic updates throughout its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Radio coverage: KNX will again carry CBS Radio's live coverage of Harding and 
Kerrigan today. Harding will skate 14th at 11:55 a.m., PST, and Kerrigan 20th 
at 12:35 p.m. The first broadcast will be 10 minutes, the second 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating on radio isn't too thrilling, but radio commentator Paul Wylie, 
working with Mark Champion, was quicker to point out Harding's mistakes 
Wednesday than was television commentator Scott Hamilton that night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complaint Dept.: CBS may be drawing huge audiences, but the network is also 
drawing complaints in record numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The delayed, edited telecasts are a pet peeve. "They come across as phony, as 
more theater than sports," one reader complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant teasing is another big complaint. "Bonnie Blair (or whoever) 
coming up" usually means coming up sometime in the next hour or two. More 
honesty and a better format are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, people complain about all the commercials. Blame the International 
Olympic Committee and the high rights fees for this one. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people also believe there are an excessive number of features and 
off-beat reports. CBS seems determined to use all of the 150 or so features it 
prepared for the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some features should have been left on the shelf, others have been 
excellent. Two of the best were the one Wednesday night on figure skater Oksana 
Baiul of the Ukraine and the one Tuesday night with Charles Kuralt on the 
destruction of a Nazi heavy-water plant in occupied Norway 50 years ago. The 
plant was essential to Hitler's plans for an atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Kuralt, CBS should be using him more. 
</P>
<P>
 As for prime-time host Greg Gumbel, there have been few complaints, which 
indicates he is doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, give CBS' coverage a B-minus. Televising an Olympics and keeping 
everybody happy is difficult, if not impossible. TV-Radio Notes

 ESPN's second ESPY award ceremony will be televised Monday at 6 p.m. Dennis 
Miller is the host, and nominees include Mike Piazza, Wayne Gretzky, and Troy 
Aikman. This show will be hard-pressed to top last year's, when the late Jim 
Valvano, helped to the podium by Dick Vitale and Mike Krzyzewski, delivered an 
impassioned speech. Vitale, in Los Angeles this week for Thursday night's 
UCLA-California game, said the amazing thing was that Valvano could barely 
speak either the day before or the day after, and wasn't even planning to 
attend the ceremony. "He got up there and must have gotten a real adrenaline 
rush," Vitale said. "We didn't think he could even get to the podium. They were 
going to mike him at his seat, but he asked Coach K and I to help him up 
there." Proceeds from the ESPYs go to the V Foundation, established in the 
honor of Valvano to further cancer research.

 The winter Arbitron trends came out this week, and the news was semi-good for 
KMPC. The station's overall share for all people 12 and over went from a 0.7 to 
a 0.8, and all-day parts showed slight increases. But KMPC, still recovering 
from the days of a 0.1 share in the morning, is getting beat across the board 
by XTRA in Los Angeles, 1.6-1.4, with men 18-plus. In San Diego, XTRA got a 5.7 
share with men 18-plus. . . . The proposed sale of KMPC to Cap Cities still 
hasn't been finalized, but when it is, the staff at KMPC will move to a 
building owned by Gene and Jackie Autry near Universal City until Cap Cities 
takes control. The eventual plan is to base the new KMPC at the revamped KABC 
studios on La Cienega Boulevard. Cap Cities apparently will change the format 
from all-sports to "smart talk," but officials will not confirm that until the 
sale goes through.

LONG BEACH ST. REGROUPS, EASES PAST N. MEXICO ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach State overcame a miserable start and the loss of a key starter 
Thursday night to defeat New Mexico State, 84-83, in a Big West Conference 
basketball game before 1,823 fans in the campus gym. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of free throws from Rod Hannibal put Long Beach ahead for good with 10 
seconds left.Darrin Jackson of New Mexico missed the final shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (15-8, 9-6) was playing without starting guard Jeff Rogers, who 
quit the team for personal reasons before the game. He is the fourth player to 
quit or be suspended from the team this season. Two have been reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State (19-4, 11-3) started with a flurry, baffling the 
cold-shooting 49ers on numerous possessions. The Aggies made five of their 
first seven field-goal attempts and led 11-0 with 3:35 gone. Eight of those 
points followed turnovers by the 49ers, who also missed their first six field 
goal tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach got its first basket on a lay-in by Brian Camper with 13:59 left in 
the half, but the Aggies extended their lead to 16-5 a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the 49ers woke up. Mike Atkinson started the rally with a lay-in with 
13:24 to go and over the next three minutes Long Beach outscored New Mexico 
State, 18-4, for a 23-20 lead. PAUL McLEOD

FULLERTON BEATS IRVINE, 101-95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton guard Greg Vernon is the only player remaining from last 
season's team and maybe the only Titan who puts any special significance on the 
Fullerton-UC Irvine rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the only thing at stake during Thursday night's battle in the Bren 
Center was pride.The winner would move into next-to-last place in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vernon seemed energized down the stretch. He scored on a reverse layup, an 
18-foot jumper, a driving bank shot, another layup, three free throws and a 
dunk for the final points of the game as Fullerton, 7-17 overall and 5-11 in 
conference, hung on for a 101-95 victory before 1,729. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon, who had four points in the first half, finished with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (6-17, 3-12) lost an 11-point lead in the second half. JOHN WEYLER

MISSED SHOTS COSTLY FOR NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge couldn't buy a basket when it needed one and Southern 
Utah held on for a 68-61 victory in a nonconference game Thursday night at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors were within a point, 62-61, when Ryan Martin made two free throws 
with 2:07 left to play, but they failed to score again. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn McLinn missed a chance to give Northridge the lead when he missed two 
free throws with 1:47 to go. The Matadors' final four possessions ended on 
three missed layups and a three-point attempt as Southern Utah (14-10) clinched 
only its second road victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Ingram scored 14 points for the Thunderbirds, pacing a balanced scoring 
attack in which all five starters scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (7-17) lost its final home game despite a game-high 23 points by 
guard Andre Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, a senior, also had six steals, a team-high six rebounds and seven 
assists, the last of which was his 130th of the season, setting a school season 
record. MIKE HISERMAN

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; STANFORD STOPS LESLIE AND TEACHES USC A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to Stanford women's basketball, Cheryl. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed like the message Stanford's women's basketball team tried to 
impart to USC and its coach, Cheryl Miller, Thursday night at Maples Pavilion, 
routing the sixth-ranked Trojans, 80-50. 
</P>
<P>
 With four games left in the Pacific 10 Conference race, USC's lead was reduced 
to one game in the loss column. The Trojans are 12-2, followed by Stanford and 
Oregon at 10-3, and UCLA at 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, bounced back aggressively from only her third defeat (USC is 
19-3). She shocked everyone in the interview room by predicting, in effect, 
that her team would go from here to the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this night on," she said, "we are not going to lose again and I'm not 
just talking about the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Was she actually predicting an NCAA championship. . . . after this ? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take that statement and make that into anything you want," she 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer was asked for a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we just play 'em one at a time," she said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, before 5,595, Stanford denied USC All-American Lisa Leslie the 
ball -- she had just 8 points and 10 rebounds -- and Anita Kaplan stepped up 
and had a career game, scoring 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 17 for 26 from the floor, but in one key second half stretch, 
virtually every shot she attempted rolled, bounced or tumbled in. 
</P>
<P>
 After she scored 20 in the first half, leading the Cardinal to a 40-27 lead, 
Kaplan made six consecutive shots to help extend Stanford's lead from 49-34 to 
71-42 with 6:22 left. Twice, the Cardinal (16-5) had a 33-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie had a career game the last time they met, scoring 34 points in an 81-73 
Trojan victory Jan. 30 at USC. Now, it was Kaplan's turn. Leslie didn't take a 
shot Thursday until seven minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan was to deny Lisa the ball, not let her dominate us inside like she 
did the last time," VanDerveer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We tried tonight to show them that what they saw last time was not Stanford 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA 90, California 85 -- Natalie Williams scored 43 points at Berkeley to 
lead the Bruins to their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43 points are the second highest in school history. Denise Curry, now a 
Cal assistant, once scored 47 points for the Bruins. Williams, who made all 12 
of her shots in the second half, also had 15 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (15-8, 10-4) trailed, 74-62, with six minutes left, then outscored the 
Golden Bears, 28-11. Kim Robinson led Cal (8-15, 2-11) with 23 points.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; WILLIAMS KEEPS UP HABIT AGAINST OWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he did on Feb. 13 in Amherst, Mass., Mike Williams hit a shot in the 
closing moments to beat Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Massachusetts-Temple II was completely different. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Owl Coach John Chaney shook UMass Coach John Calipari's hand 
after the Minutemen beat Temple, 51-50, Thursday at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time, Chaney threatened to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the past," Chaney said of the tirade that got him suspended by the 
school for one game. "I don't carry things like that around. I'm an old 
dinosaur. I have a lot of problems in my old age. Of course I shook his hand, 
but I did think for a second maybe I should have had a rose with thorns in my 
hand. No, then I should have shaken Mike Williams' hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior guard, who scored 15 points, all on three-pointers, banked in a 
25-foot three-pointer with eight seconds to play to give the 11th-ranked 
Minutemen their third consecutive Atlantic-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been screaming my lungs out if he went in for a layup, but he 
hit a 23-, 24-footer off the glass," Chaney said. "When a shot like that goes 
in, it just wasn't meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Minutemen (23-5, 13-1) had never won in 12 games at McGonigle Hall and 
have now beaten the Owls (20-5, 12-4) four times in a row and five of six after 
losing the first 21 meetings between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Indiana 81, Northwestern 74 -- Damon Bailey scored 33 points and Alan 
Henderson added 24 at Evanston, Ill., spoiling Wildcat Coach Ricky Byrdsong's 
return after a four-game leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Indiana's 13th consecutive victory over the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers (17-5, 10-3 Big Ten) built a 41-28 halftime advantage as 
Northwestern (11-10, 2-11) made only 33% of its field goals and didn't get to 
the foul line. OTHER GAMES Lipscomb's John Pierce became college basketball's 
all-time leading scorer with 33 points in his regular-season finale, a 119-102 
victory over Cumberland at Nashville, Tenn. Pierce's 4,110 points broke former 
roommate Phil Hutcheson's record of 4,106 in the category in which Pete 
Maravich, who scored 3,667 points at Louisiana State, is the only Division I 
player in the top 10. Pierce, a 6-foot-7 senior center, broke the record with a 
basket underneath with 4:54 to go that gave him 31 points against Cumberland. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Fox scored 28 points, including 13 in overtime, as Rhode Island (10-14, 
6-8 Atlantic 10) won, 105-102, in three overtimes against West Virginia (15-9, 
7-7) at Kingston, R.I. . . . Carter Long and Robert Shannon each scored 23 
points to lead Alabama Birmingham (19-6) to an 83-61 victory over Southern 
(14-1) at Birmingham. . . . Marlow White's season-high 35 points and New 
Mexico's proficiency at the free throw line carried the Lobos (20-5, 12-3 WAC) 
to a 90-71 victory over Air Force, which scored only six points in the final 
nine minutes at Albuquerque, N.M. . . . Ryan Yoder scored a career-high 30 
points to pace Colorado State (14-10, 7-8 WAC) to a 98-83 victory over San 
Diego State (10-13, 5-11) at Ft. Collins, Colo. . . . Jermaine Smith made two 
free throws with 1:41 to play to give Nevada Las Vegas (12-11, 8-7 Big West) a 
64-63 victory at UC Santa Barbara (11-15, 7-8).

 Trace Worthington lay down on the job for only an instant Thursday but they 
docked him for it, big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington, the best aerial skier in the United States and one of the best in 
the world, couldn't stick the landing on the first of his two jumps in the 
freestyle finals and finished out of the medals. Not far out, but out 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas Schoenbaechler of Switzerland and two-thirds of the "Quebec Air 
Force," Canadians Philippe LaRoche and Lloyd Langlois, finished 1-2-3. 
Worthington settled for fifth, only 4.25 points behind Langlois and less than a 
point behind Andrew Capicik, the third member of the Quebec Air Force that 
ranks first through third in World Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin between third and fifth was less than the margin between first and 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our sport, that's like the Italian cross-country skier winning by a ski 
length (in the men's 40-kilometer relay Tuesday)," Worthington said. "I lost by 
a ski length, is the way I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lina Tcherjazova of Uzbekistan, who had barely qualified for the finals after 
falling on her first jump in Tuesday's eliminations, came back with an 
impressive opening jump and won the women's competition. Marie Lindgren of 
Sweden was second and Hilde Synnove Lid of Norway was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial skiing, which made its debut here as a medal sport, requires the skier 
to launch off a snow ramp and execute somersaults, flips and twists while in 
the air. Seven judges consider the takeoff, height, distance, execution and 
landing in giving scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington's landing was his downfall, so to speak, Thursday. He chose to do 
his harder jump -- a triple flip with four twists -- first and nearly pulled it 
off. He got plenty of height off the ramp and performed his tricks well. But on 
touchdown, he leaned back onto his skis, his back grazing the snow before he 
stood up. There's no telling how he would have scored with a solid landing, but 
it probably would have put him in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing a medal, though, didn't bother him as much as missing the jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always disappointing when you don't put down your best jump," he said. 
"(It) could obviously have been better with a better landing. I just simply 
made a mistake on the landing. That's disappointing, but by no means am I 
disappointed that I didn't win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was right on the money as I came into my landing, and all it takes 
is a little bit of off balance. Everything is pretty precise in this sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington's second jump -- a double flip with three twists -- earned him the 
third-highest score of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no pressure on me, nothing to lose," he said. "It was a fun jump and I 
had a good time, but I knew before I left the jump that I couldn't get a medal, 
much less win. So I was just having fun on that jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington, the Canadians and top-qualifying Alexei Parfenkov of Belarus had 
been viewed as the medal contenders going into the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying marks do not carry over, however, and Schoenbaechler made the most 
of that. He jumped into the lead with his first effort -- a triple flip with 
three twists -- then watched as nine other skiers failed to put up a better 
score. And he did the same in the second round, when he executed an even more 
difficult triple with four twists, earning 121.48 points, most of the day. He 
finished with 234.67. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRoche wound up with 228.64, Langlois with 222.44. 
</P>
<P>
 Parfenkov, who had led after the eliminations, botched the landing on his 
first jump, scored poorly on his second and finished last. Americans Eric 
Bergoust and Kris Fedderson were seventh and 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherjazova's performance in the women's competition made her the first Olympic 
medalist for her country since the breakup of the Soviet Union. She impressed 
the judges with her triple flips, while the rest of the field was doing 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 She pretty much settled things with the first jump of the day, a back layout 
with three flips, scoring 92.92 points, most of the day. She missed the landing 
on her second jump, but her two-jump total of 166.84 held up anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindgren finished with 165.88 points, Lid with 164.13. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Evans, the only U.S. entrant, had qualified out of the B group and 
finished seventh.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; FOR THIS ITALIAN STAR, IT'S NO CONTEST; 
SKIING: ONE DAY AFTER TOMBA STUMBLES, COMPAGNONI EASILY WINS WOMEN'S GIANT 
SLALOM.

<P>
 Ten minutes after winning the gold medal in Thursday's giant slalom, Italy's 
Deborah Compagnoni took the customary phone call of congratulations from a 
dignitary. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, the President usually handles the task. Bill Clinton phoned Tommy 
Moe after his downhill victory last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Compagnoni picked up Line 1 in the finish-area corral after dominating both 
runs and defeating runner-up Martina Ertl of Germany by 1.22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Compagnoni's two-run time of 2:30.97 was two seconds faster than Switzerland's 
Vreni Schneider, who took the bronze. Eva Twardokens, sixth, was the top 
American finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomba here," Alberto Tomba said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation between the king and queen of Italian skiing was brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very happy," Compagnoni said. "Yes, we will celebrate together. But I 
said we would also celebrate the medal you will make." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, has struck out once here, in 
Wednesday's giant slalom, but will be among the favorites in Sunday's slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Though reportedly not romantically involved, the link-up between Tomba and 
Compagnoni, even if it was only through the magic of fiber-optics, rekindled 
memories of Feb. 18, 1992, the date both skiers won gold. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so momentous an occasion that, for the first time in anyone's 
recollection, soccer was bumped to the inside pages of Italian sports sections. 
</P>
<P>
 At face value, the 23-year-old Compagnoni's return to the Olympic podium two 
years after winning the Albertville super-G would seem a natural progression, 
the superstar expanding her skiing horizons. Yet, this was not merely a matter 
of connecting the Olympic dots. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after her gold-medal run at Albertville, Compagnoni crashed in the 
giant slalom and tore left knee ligaments. It took a year for her to recover, 
another year to reclaim Olympic form. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe to say, she's back. 
</P>
<P>
 In boxing vernacular, Compagnoni scored a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 She recorded the fastest time on the morning course: a tight, technical 
gate-set that bounced Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, the defending Olympic 
champion, out of the race and prompted American Heidi Voelker, a reputed medal 
contender, to ski timidly. Voelker stood 18th after the first run, a whopping 
2.71 seconds off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Compagnoni, with a 0.63-second first-run cushion over her nearest challenger, 
oversaw the second run with understandable confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I would win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Ertl, skiing 11th, took the lead and held it through three more 
racers, but she knew Compagnoni had nearly a full-second advantage on her 
before she stepped out of the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if she had no mistakes in her second run, that I cannot win," Ertl 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Hilde Gerg, with the second fastest first-run time, had a fast 
second run going before she crashed, four gates from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Up next, Compagnoni didn't ski like someone trying to protect a lead. In fact, 
she nearly lost everything when she lost her balance in a troublesome area near 
the bottom as Italian fans gasped. But she recovered in time.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. medal hopes were dashed early and often with poor first runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Twardokens, 13th in the morning, welcomed a straighter second-run course that 
allowed her to take advantage of her speed. She moved up seven spots and took 
home a credible Olympic finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I broke 20 clicks (kilometers per hour)," she said of her first 
run. "The second run, I had nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has placed at least one skier in the top 10 in each Olympic 
Alpine event. Yet, after winning four medals last week, Americans have 
developed a craving for the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came up to me and said, 'You're next,' " Twardokens said. "And I'd 
say, 'It's not that easy.' I thought maybe it could happen to me. But sometimes 
you can get unrealistic. I think I lost some focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Twardokens, 28, added a sixth to her seventh- and eighth-place finishes at 
Albertville two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Diann Roffe-Steinrotter -- a surprise gold-medal winner in super-G last week 
and the defending Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom -- could barely 
get out of the gate because of flu. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 27th after her first run and was too ill to compete in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Voelker followed up her miserable first run by crashing head-first into the 
snow on her second, an embarrassment referred to in skier talk as "a face 
plant." 
</P>
<P>
 The warm support Voelker received from relatives in attendance did not soothe 
her disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes hugs make it all the worse," Voelker said. 
</P>
<P>
 She began the Games red-hot, with top-10 finishes in her last five World Cup 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 "She choked," Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, said. "She knew it. She 
felt that way too. But she's also had the best season of her career."

 Canada and Russia have traditions to uphold, but Finland and Sweden have 
reputations they would like to shake today in the semifinals of the Olympic 
hockey tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada (4-1-1) gave hockey to the world and has never given up its claim to 
supremacy.That claim will be tested by Finland, at 6-0 the tournament's only 
unbeaten team but still considered a question mark because of its history of 
Olympic failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, successor of the Soviet and Unified teams that won eight of 10 Olympic 
gold medals from 1956-92, had a mediocre start that included losses to Finland 
and Germany in the preliminary round. But when it mattered, Russia found a way 
to win. Alexander Vinogradov's overtime goal against Slovakia propelled the 
Russians (4-2) into the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight they play Sweden (4-1-1), three-time world champion, but never an 
Olympic gold medalist. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Speaking of most-decorated athletes, cross-country skier Manuela Di Centa of 
Italy claimed that title for these Games when she won her fifth medal, the gold 
in the women's 30-kilometer classical race.  
</P>
<P>
 Di Centa, 31, who had won the first gold medal of the Games on Feb. 13, led 
all the way, beating Marit Wold of Norway by 16.2 seconds.She finished with two 
golds, two silvers and a bronze, having won a medal in every race she skied in. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyubov Egorova of Russia, who was trying to win an unprecedented seventh 
Olympic gold medal, finished fifth in the women's longest race, breaking her 
Olympic streak. She had earned medals in nine consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Centa skied the race in 1 hour 25 minutes 41.6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi of Finland, competing in her sixth Olympics, took the 
bronze in 1:26.13.6. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Japan put its big ski-jumping lead to good use and beat Norway easily in the 
cross-country portion of the team Nordic combined, earning the country's first 
gold medal here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gold is the beginning of our challenge for the Nagano Olympics," team 
coordinator Yushiro Yagi said. Nagano, Japan, will be the host city for the 
Winter Games in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's three-man team started the 30-kilometer relay 5 minutes 7 seconds 
ahead of Norway, thanks to Wednesday's jumping points, and won by 4:49.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland was third and the U.S. team -- John Jarrett, Todd Lodwick and Ryan 
Heckman -- had its best finish in Olympic history, seventh. MIKE KUPPER

 In the true Canadian tradition of "Tape an aspirin to it and get back out 
there," Canadian center Greg Johnson proved his toughness the other night. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was hit in the face by a shot from teammate Brian Savage 1:45 into 
overtime and had to be helped off the ice for treatment.He needed stitches to 
close the cut and stop the bleeding, and was ready to take his next shift, but 
he never made it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy put in two stitches and then we scored the (game-winning) goal, and 
he said, 'Oh, we're done,' " Johnson said. "I had to go back inside so he could 
finish it later." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson ended up with six stitches and a new bend in his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my first broken nose," he said. "But I'm sure it won't be my last." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Finland is a 3-2 favorite over Canada in today's hockey semifinal, but Finnish 
Coach Curt Lindstrom, who owns a betting parlor, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be more even, maybe 2-2," he said. "I think it's 50-50. Canada has 
now beaten Sweden and Czechoslovakia and they have a strong team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. goaltender Mike Dunham, who started in Thursday's 5-3 loss to the Czech 
Republic, criticized Coach Tim Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wasn't given the chance to become what I could have been," said 
Dunham, who played in the tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France and the team's 
6-4 loss to Sweden. "I'm a little down. I wanted to come out and show I could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it mattered who was in there (Wednesday) night (in a 6-1 loss 
to Finland). But it was tough watching, tough coming back for another Olympics 
and not being able to do what I wanted to do. I don't feel like I reached my 
potential." HELENE ELLIOTT

 In the stands at Canada's overtime hockey game the other night sat 
silver-medal figure skater Elvis Stojko, cheering for his fellow Canadians. One 
period, two periods, three periods, overtime . . . there he sat. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about four minutes into the overtime period, Stojko, eager not to miss a 
minute of the women's figure skating, left his seat to go watch, missing the

TENNIS / WOMEN AT INDIAN WELLS; IT TAKES LONGER, BUT RESULT IS THE SAME FOR 
FERNANDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 She is the defending champion, but Mary Joe Fernandez has been all but 
eclipsed by Steffi Graf at the Evert Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK by me," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although shunning the spotlight, Fernandez called attention to herself 
Thursday when she needed almost two hours to defeat Anne Mall, 6-4, 7-6 (11-9), 
in the second round at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was pointed out, of course, that she'd worked a lot harder than Graf, whose 
second-round match Wednesday lasted only 43 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure did," Fernandez said. "It was a very long match." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the 1-hour 53-minute match was the longest of the day. Third-seeded 
Lindsay Davenport defeated Elna Reinach, 6-2, 6-1, in 53 minutes, and 
sixth-seeded Amanda Coetzer defeated Robin White, 6-2, 6-1, in 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, seeded second, survived a mini-Mall rally after the 191st-ranked 
player on the WTA Tour suddenly came to life after falling behind, 5-2, in the 
second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "She played really well from behind, went for more shots," said Fernandez, who 
is ranked seventh. "She really was reading, I guess, where I was going and hit 
some good passing shots on big points. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, when lower-ranked players play top-ranked players, they have 
nothing to lose. I remember, coming up, I played my best matches against people 
who were in the top 10. You have to expect that (lower-ranked players) are 
going to be looser and go for more shots. You've got to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mall, who won the Southern Section 4-A championship as a senior at Dana 
Hills High and played one injury-marred season at UCLA before turning 
professional in 1992, seemed to catch Fernandez by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall, 19, broke Fernandez in the eighth and 10th games of the second set and 
led, 0-30, in the 12th before Fernandez won four consecutive points to hold 
serve and force a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second set, I kind of wavered and let her get on top," said Mall, who 
won three qualifying matches last weekend. "And then, at 5-2, I just said, 
'This is a good opportunity to do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She survived match point once each in the ninth and 10th games, then twice 
more in the tiebreaker. Eventually, though, Mall's serve started to desert her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little nervous," she said. "And my arm was a little bit tired from 
playing all the qualifying matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall hit backhands wide and long on the last two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little pleased," she said. "I thought I could have had the second set. 
I'm a little disappointed, but overall I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was relieved. "I thought I kept pretty well concentrated," she said. 
"It gets frustrating when the match is pretty much over and then all of a 
sudden you're down. I tried to keep my composure and just play each point." 
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport and Lisa Raymond, playing in only their fourth tournament 
together, upset the top-ranked doubles team of Gigi Fernandez and Natalia 
Zvereva, 6-4, 6-4, in a quarterfinal match.

HE SAID, SHE SAID / PATRICK MOTT AND ANN CONWAY: GRACEFUL OLYMPIANS WEATHER THE 
WINTER GAMES IN STYLISH COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I f you were a designer of cold-weather fashions, you could hardly hope for a 
better showcase for your stuff than the Winter Olympics. Think of it: hundreds 
of international bodies in absolutely peak shape with nothing to do all day 
except train and compete in great-looking duds in front of a few thousand 
cameras.  
</P>
<P>
 From the ethnic outfits in the opening ceremonies to the spectacular suits on 
the figure skaters and ice dancers, the Winter Olympics offer a lot of fashion 
sense and, occasionally, nonsense.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: I always get a boot out of the outfits that are worn during the parade at 
the opening ceremonies. During the Summer Olympics, it's easier to show off 
ethnicity, but at the Winter Games the Jamaican bobsled team can't exactly 
slide into the stadium in Caribbean print cotton shirts and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Headgear seems to solve the problem for a lot of the teams, since just about 
any country you can think of has some kind of trademark head covering. The 
low-crowned cowboy hat the U.S. team went for this year looks sharp. And I like 
the parka design too: colorful and obviously Yankee, but not screamingly 
nationalistic. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I've been amazed at how style-conscious the competitors are. Even during 
practice sessions, Nancy Kerrigan dresses like a swan, ice-white gossamer skirt 
flying over white bodysuit. Tonya Harding looked pretty chic the other day in 
an all-black ensemble paired with the same kind of flirty skirt worn by 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday night's competition, Kerrigan took the prize in a Chanel-inspired 
black and white silhouette accented with pearls. She made me think of Princess 
Caroline of Monaco. Harding, on the other hand, looked like Alexis in her passe 
peekaboo glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I spent quite a bit of last weekend watching the Games with several 
friends who had plenty to say, all of it good, about the bodysuits that the 
speed-skaters and the skiers wore. The effect was enhanced by CBS showing old 
black-and-white film of skiers and speed-skaters back in the days when their 
outfits were bulky and monochromatic and the only adornment was the name of 
their country in block letters across the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, any competitors in those two sports -- Alpine skiing particularly -- 
who don't look like they survived an explosion down at the Sherwin-Williams 
plant look just plain dull. Zebra stripes, spider web designs, iridescent 
colors washing around. Even the technical gear -- the skis, poles and skates -- 
look like they were designed by David Hockney by way of Peter Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you have to have a body by Michelangelo to wear any of that stuff. 
And the ice skaters' outfits aren't much more forgiving, are they? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: All they take is no waistline or hips and Gable gams. Watching those 
svelte women skate with their partners, ballroom-dance style, made me feel like 
a plump Cinderella aching to go to the ball. Suddenly, I was whipping out my 
tape measure, measuring my waist and hips and vowing to fast until Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscars has nothing on the Olympics for a parade of pure, show-biz panache. 
I confess I sometimes get so involved with what the competitors are wearing I 
forget to watch what they're doing . 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I'll admit to a great bias here, but it seemed to me that while nearly all 
the other ice dancers tried -- and failed -- to impress with costume gimmicks 
(the dorky pseudo juke joint outfits Gritschuk and Platov wore for their 
frenetic rock-and-roll routine, for instance), Torvill and Dean had class to 
burn. Christopher Dean in formal black and white, Jane Torvill in silver 
sequins and a white skirt. So elegant it was almost painful. Sartorially as 
well as artistically, they were royalty skating with a bunch of hormonal brats. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Which brings us back to the less-is-more axiom. Over-dressing -- looking 
terminally cute -- always distracts, diminishes. Under-dressing forces the 
observer to notice us, our persona, or in the case of the Olympics, our talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you go so far as to bet that a poorly outfitted skater might influence a 
judge's score? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Looks like a pretty bad bet. Gritschuk and Platov won the gold medal, and 
Torvill and Dean got hammered by the judges and got the bronze (the audience, 
by the by, whistled and hooted and booed when their scores were posted). 
</P>
<P>
 One feature of the Olympic threads that I think we can be happy about, though, 
is the incredibly wide palette that the designers are using. The colors of the 
outfits in every sport have been among the most striking I've seen. Not really 
gaudy, since we're talking about sporting clothes, but truly arresting. 
Everything from Johann Olav Koss' candy apple red bodysuit to the Swiss 
bobsledders' turquoise. These are fun colors, and I think we can count on 
seeing them in sporting goods stores pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even you, with your penchant for basic black, might want to get a little 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Yeah, I can just see us out there representing the U.S.A. -- you in 
purple tights and one of your ubiquitous aloha shirts, me in my omnipresent 
black pants suit. "There they are ladies and gentlemen, Mott and Conway, the 
skating fashion plates. Judges, close your eyes!"

SCREEN STYLE / BETTY GOODWIN: THEY WEAR IT WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Sugar Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Brothers Roemello (Wesley Snipes, pictured at left) and Raynathan 
(Michael Wright, pictured with Snipes) Skuggs seem destined to become Harlem 
drug lords, but Roemello seeks another life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Eduardo Castro, whose previous credits include the 
series "Miami Vice" and the movie "Bird on a Wire." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Coolly crafted images of modern guys who make big bucks, not fashion 
cliches of Harlem's underworld. Bankrolled with their illicit torrents of cash, 
no doubt, the brothers favor the unusual shapes and produce-section colors 
characteristic of Italian and Japanese tailoring. Some looks work better than 
others, and the most seductive are the inky black leather coats and jackets 
worn by virtually every principal character, male and female. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: High-testosterone types should consider looking for a new emblem 
-- there's not a pierced earlobe in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: It's not visible on camera, but Snipes chose to wear an African 
bracelet of silver and amber to "help him with his performance," Castro said. 
"In Harlem, now and then you see people wearing touches of African culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: Roemello's suit of preference is a dark and conservative Armani that 
goes overboard in the name of refined fashion sensibility. Even worse, he wears 
these lawyerly looking threads with a silk shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I was kind of tired of the baseball hat going backward, the hooded 
shirts, the baggy pants and the big vulgar jewelry. I saw the script as a 
classic Greek tragedy about a bad and good brother, so I wanted to make a more 
baroque statement," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Visits to Harlem, men's fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Roemello's and Raynathan's jacket labels include Versace, Issey 
Miyake and Yohji Yamamoto. Leather coats are from Claude Montana, among others. 
Roemello's overcoats are Hugo Boss and New York's Charivari boutique private 
label. Castro designed Roemello's suede jacket.

FAUX PAS REPORT: IN THE LONG RUN, A MAN'S BELT SHOULD NOT BE KNOTTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some men have a great casual wardrobe, but the details escape them. To go with 
hot jeans, they have a woven leather belt. But after a short time, whether 
through a reduction in the waistline or a natural stretching of the leather, 
the belt has lengthened and they have to weave it back through the pant loops 
or (gasp!) knot it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looping a belt back through because of length just isn't a neat look," says 
Matt Blanchard of Polo Ralph Lauren in Costa Mesa. "If a belt's too long, you 
should probably have it replaced or shortened." 
</P>
<P>
 A leather repair shop can shorten the belt so it fits correctly. However, some 
guys don't mind a belt that flops over (perhaps it simulates the process of 
losing weight). Looping a couple of inches back in isn't too bad, but make sure 
you avoid the big no-no -- knotting the end. This is a practice common in 
women's fashion but still taboo on the men's side. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sweat chic: For years we've known and accepted that the athletic club is a 
place where people are still aware of fashion. If that weren't the case, why 
wouldn't everyone just wear utilitarian gray sweats? 
</P>
<P>
 Many women who have been gym fiends for years parade past the free weights 
wearing the latest spandex outfits in the hottest colors, while others who may 
be fulfilling a New Year's resolution are sticking to those baggy gray pants 
and sweat shirts or extra-large T's. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a mistake or it's intentional, several novices have been spotted 
in local gyms wearing shoulder pads while panting through the stair climber or 
bopping up and down in aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be a sign on the door of gyms, 'No Shoulder Pads Inside,' " says 
fashion designer Carol Steele of Newport Beach. "Pads work for you when you're 
standing or walking, not while you're working the leg press." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to look good at the gym without wearing anything too revealing, 
try going with a hot colored T-shirt and coordinating shorts or gym pants. And 
of course, if you feel more comfortable in those gray sweats, go for it. The 
natural look is always acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lazy, hazy days of winter: Here we are in the depths of winter. You've been 
wearing your heavyweight wool slacks. On weekends you've got your jacket on as 
soon as you leave the front door. You've even been known to layer yourself in 
those fuzzy wool sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is Southern California. On some of those 80-degree winter afternoons, 
do you ever look jealously at those guys in linen pants? 
</P>
<P>
 "In our climate, there are almost no seasonal rules for what should and 
shouldn't be worn," says John Shaw of Alex Sebastian in Costa Mesa. "If it's 
warm enough to wear a tan linen suit in February, go ahead. People back East 
would love to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's warm enough to pull out the summer wardrobe, is it too warm for 
the woollies? Unless your metabolism runs cold and you need those warm clothes 
all the time, you may want to "layer." Wear a light jacket over a light sweater 
over a short-sleeved Polo shirt to make sure you're covered if the weather 
should suddenly take a dip, which can happen during our winter evenings.

BEHIND THE SCENES; PACIFIC SYMPHONY SUPPORTERS PUT ON RED, GOLD AT RITZ TO AID 
YOUNG MUSICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the tradition of Chinese New Year celebrations, 110 supporters of the 
Pacific Symphony Orchestra wore red- and gold-colored cocktail attire to the 
Ritz in Newport Beach Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Red and gold symbolize prosperity and good luck, which is what everyone wishes 
for in a new year, said Arlene Cheng, president of the Chinese-American League 
of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra.She added that unmarried people in China 
parade under the moon in their finest clothing to lure a spouse during the 
lunar festival. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ritz, the rich colors were combined in a custom caftan worn by Margaret 
Quon and sported on George Schopick's tasseled hat, which he found in Xi'an, 
China, two years ago. Tradition states that the hat's bamboo print represents 
"life everlasting."  
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser benefits the annual Showcase of Young Musicians at the Irvine 
Barclay April 24, which honors performers age 14 to 21.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: PLAYING IT TOTALLY COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the rest of you were home watching the Winter Olympics, some of us had 
to work. Don't think it isn't exhausting, separating the totally cool from the 
just plain cool. Especially at what had to be the ne plus ultra of fashion 
events -- Tuesday night's Vogue magazine-Neiman Marcus party for Anne Klein 
designer Richard Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress code for women was complicated, but we narrowed it to four looks: 
the pantsuit, the slip dress (short and long), the cocktail dress and the 
leather look. 
</P>
<P>
 Even women with great bodies, we noticed, are putting a demure spin on those 
scanty slip dresses by wearing undershirts. This being L.A., though, the 
undershirt of choice Tuesday night was Azzedine Alaia's black mesh body 
stocking. There was nothing demure about Vogue Editor Anna Wintour's leather 
mini with silver buckles or Cher's skintight leather pants. Both ladies were 
surrounded by circles of adoring men. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the men got off easy. A turtleneck, preferably black, with baggy 
trousers, a rumpled jacket and dark, moisture-rich hair hanging dangerously 
close to one eye was the look to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the $100-a-ticket party, which benefited DARE (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education), a short anti-drug film directed by actor Johnny Depp was 
shown. But the crowd at Culver City's Smashbox photo studio wasn't terribly 
attentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they were distracted by the likes of Heather Locklear, Linda 
Evangelista, Tatiana Patitz and Jeanne Tripplehorn. 
</P>
<P>
 For us, the apex of the evening was meeting three Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're not sure what exactly distracted Depp and sweetheart Kate Moss. They 
stayed out of sight most of the night. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Speaking of true love, we just might have found it. Is 
it sick to love your rollers? 
</P>
<P>
 After several bad-hair years, we broke down and bought a bag of old-fashioned 
brush rollers complete with pink plastic torture devices to anchor them to our 
scalp. Just let your hair dry about halfway, then wrap around the things -- but 
no more than 1 1/2 times, cautions Joseph Kendall, owner of JosephMartin in 
Beverly Hills. Otherwise you'll get "tight, over-curly hair." Trust us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not used to seeing your hair so fluffy on top," Mr. Inside Out said 
the other night. We're just a little too tightly wound, we explained. He 
understood. 
</P>

 Unreality Bites: There are really two films in the documentary "Christy 
Turlington Backstage," on Lifetime Television on Sunday at 10 p.m. The dominant 
one focuses on the collections presented last fall in Milan, Paris and New 
York. The shows are mostly boring, as is Turlington's PR-ish sounding 
narration. 
</P>
<P>
 But an interview with a tired and introspective Turlington, shot in black and 
white, offers glimpses of the not-so-pretty side of modeling. "After weeks of 
being touched and poked at, I just want to stay in one place for a very long 
time and not see anyone," said the model renowned for her niceness. 
</P>
<P>
 If only director Robert Leacock, son of cinema verite pioneer Richard Leacock, 
hadn't chopped up the interview -- MTV-style -- to intersperse among the 
fashion shows, Turlington might have come across as a real-life, complicated 
woman and not just a vehicle for sound bites. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 He Likes Red -- a Lot: It's a busy time for Beverly Hills shopkeeper Fred 
Hayman, who serves as official fashion police for the Oscars. Dozens of 
glamorous designer gowns have arrived at his store from around the world. Soon 
too shall dozens of nominees and presenters -- in search of the sufficiently 
dazzling ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stars shouldn't just wear anything they want to," said Hayman, a sentiment he 
spells out in a letter detailing everyone's obligation to look glamorous. "They 
should not let the fans down." 
</P>
<P>
 And who needs to when every designer in the world is vying for exposure on the 
March 21 show watched by more than a billion people? Some designers begin 
soliciting actresses even before the nominations are announced. But Hayman is 
prepared for those who may procrastinate. "We are open the Sunday before for 
last-minute details."

 You're Not Getting Older, You're Getting Better: At the Women in Film luncheon 
this week at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, one woman said to another: "That 
looks like Raquel Welch's younger sister, doesn't it?" Close. It was Raquel. . 
. . With smooth skin and long, glamorous hair, she looked marvelous.

 The Family Jewels: British Prime Minister John Major says it's for him to 
decide who gets to wear official jewelry, according to Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 His statement comes on the heels of reports that his predecessor, Margaret 
Thatcher, was annoyed at seeing Mrs. Major wearing one of Thatcher's favorite 
necklaces. Thatcher was given the $150,000 necklace by a Middle East head of 
state when she was prime minister. Asked by an opposition politician how gifts 
made to the prime minister were to be used, and in the case of jewelry, who was 
entitled to wear it, Major replied: "These are matters for the prime minister's 
discretion."

<P>
 You remember them: Portland's finest, the Olympic "Scheme Team." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Tonya Harding, who spent Wednesday earning unimpressive short-program 
scores in Lillehammer; Jolly Jeff Gillooly, last seen peddling topless video 
footage of his beloved ex-wife; and Shawn Eckardt (the bulging bodyguard) and 
Shane Stant -- both charged with conspiracy in the Jan. 6 attack on Nancy 
Kerrigan in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this lovable bunch is reunited on the pages of "WHACKED! -- The Adventures 
of Tonya Harding and Her Pals," a 32-page, full-color parody comic book to be 
published in March by The River Group of Westport, Conn. It will sell for 
$2.50, with the edition limited to "as many people who want to spend that much 
to buy it," according to Alan Katz, who has written the text for this morality 
play commemorative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "scoops" you'll find in "WHACKED!" is Tonya's Family Scrapbook, 
featuring pictures of baby Tonya, right up to her first cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an "Ask Tonya" feature, where the U.S. National Figure Skating 
champion offers "true glimpses" of her innermost feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who has also written for Disney's "Goof Troop" as well as a collection 
of trading cards, said "WHACKED!" avoids tramping into total tastelessness 
because "there's nothing here that you haven't seen or heard on 'A Current 
Affair' or the evening news." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, too, that "WHACKED!" ends with a brief, but relatively sober 
discourse on winning and losing. ELIZABETH MEHREN

POLITICAL BRIEFING: GUN OWNERS MAY DRAW GOP INTO SHOWDOWN WITH ROBERTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT and JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE GOP TAKES AIM: As if state Sen. David A. Roberti didn't already face a 
large enough coalition of gun owners, conservatives and government reform 
advocates in his effort to battle a recall election, now comes the Grand Old 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 California Republican Party Communications Director John Peschong said the GOP 
will cast votes at this weekend's state convention on whether to adopt a 
resolution endorsing the recall of Roberti from his 20th District Van Nuys 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Resolution No. 37, as it is politely referred to, has been submitted by John 
E. Stoos, the executive director of Gun Owners of California Inc., which 
opposes the senator because of his gun-control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of "whereas-es," the resolution labels Roberti "the godfather of 
political crime in California," a tax-and-spend liberal, an imprudent fiscal 
manager and a soft-on-crime supporter of "the ACLU's criminal cuddling 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the delicate overtones of aligning itself with gun proponents at a 
time when curbing violence tops the public agenda, the Republican Party is 
likely to adopt the resolution, Peschong predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it's going to pass," he said. "We see it as an overall issue of 
incumbent arrogance. There are many different groups that support Republicans. 
Gun owners just happen to be one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the GOP is not wandering blindly into the bullring. First, it helped pay 
for a poll that, according to recall backers, showed that Roberti is vulnerable 
-- even though his favorable-to-unfavorable ratio is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SALVOS FIRED: Now that former GOP Assemblyman Pat Nolan has released his 
15-year hold on the 43rd District seat by pleading guilty to racketeering, it's 
anybody's guess who will emerge to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Nolan entered his plea, however, his close ally Assembly 
Republican Leader Jim Brulte had fired off a letter of complaint about one of 
Nolan's Democratic challengers, former Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing to no less than U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Brulte said: "It troubles 
me that Mr. Schiff began his campaign against a member of the California 
Legislature while your office was conducting a prosecution of that legislator." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte asserts that Schiff launched his campaign before resigning from his 
post in the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office in mid-December. He urged Reno 
to look into whether Schiff, of Burbank, used government phones, fax machines 
or copiers to communicate with his campaign consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff maintains his innocence and claims that the letter was actually 
co-authored by Nolan. "You have to consider the source, a man now convicted on 
corruption and deceit," he said. "It's nothing more than a piece of political 
posturing by Pat." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he sees the whole Nolan episode as a boost to law-and-order candidates 
like himself: "I think by virtue of the fact that the district was represented 
by a man who has admitted selling his vote means there is now a strong interest 
in a departure from that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 KNOWING THE SCORE: It's the season in Sacramento for score cards, and a number 
of San Fernando Valley area legislators got rated this week -- first by the 
California Journal and then by the advocacy group Children Now. 
</P>
<P>
 Every two years, the California Journal, the news source for political 
junkies, tallies up the results of surveys it passes out to journalists, 
legislators and staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 The admittedly unscientific results fluctuated somewhat according to the 
skills being measured. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. David A. Roberti ranked No. 1 out of 37 in the Senate in 
effectiveness, No. 3 in problem solving, No. 4 in intelligence, No. 8 in 
energy, No. 9 in potential and No. 12 in integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other area senator making the top 10 was Newton R. Russell 
(R-Glendale), besting Roberti in the area of integrity by ranking No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lower house, only three of the Valley area's delegation made it to the 
top 10. Two assemblymen -- Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) and Burt Margolin 
(D-Los Angeles) -- were listed as the sixth and ninth most intelligent, 
respectively. Then, Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) ranked No. 8 in effectiveness and 
No. 10 in the area of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Children Now was not so generous, giving every single lawmaker a grade 
of incomplete when it came to supporting legislation that favors California's 
next generation of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, only one Valley legislator was recognized for her efforts at 
authoring and pushing a proposed law -- Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North 
Hollywood), who last year successfully ushered a bill through both houses of 
the Legislature to improve access to health care for children on Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vetoed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 AND MORE SCORES: Environmental report cards were sent out Thursday, and Valley 
Democrats got straight A's. Their Republican colleagues flunked. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland Hills, Howard L. Berman of Panorama 
City and Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles received marks in the 90s for their 
voting records during the first year of the 103rd Congress. But Reps. Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon of Santa Clarita and Glendale's Carlos Moorhead scored only 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rhetoric of the Washington-based League of Conservation Voters, the 
Democrats were "heroes" and the Republicans were -- what rhymes with heroes? -- 
zeros? The league examined 20 issues -- ranging from mining law reform and coal 
subsidies to hazardous waste cleanup and the California Desert Protection Act 
-- to arrive at their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 As a class, members of Congress were underachievers, at least in the league's 
eyes. Its score card showed that a majority of Congress got failing grades -- 
below 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters tell us they want environmental protection, and they think they've 
already voted for it," said league President Jim Maddy. "But Congress is 
failing to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who has spearheaded the continuing federal land acquisition program 
for the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, was deemed the most 
environmentally conscious of the Valley delegation with a 95% score. Berman and 
Waxman logged in with 90% ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman McKeon's 20% grade was his first mark, but Moorhead actually has 
shown slight improvement in the league's estimation. In two earlier grading 
periods, he eked out scores of only 14% and 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, Moorhead and McKeon lined up on the right side of four issues 
that the league viewed as environmentally friendly -- slowing down 
clear-cutting of timber on public lands, reducing coal subsidies, killing 
funding for the advanced solid rocket motor and rejecting a plan to give the 
attorney general more regulatory authority over property rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CASHING IN: Speaking of Beilenson, the Woodland Hills congressman has the 
dubious distinction of attracting opponents who put their money where their 
mouths are. Their own money, that is, not the stuff candidates get from other 
sources, such as individual contributors and PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a compilation of year-end Federal Election Commission reports by 
Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, Republican Richard Sybert became the 
biggest spender after he loaned his campaign $430,000 hoping to unseat the 
nine-term Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's generosity to himself outstrips the No. 2-ranked candidate in the 
Roll Call list, Republican Irwin Savodnik, who has invested $286,400 into his 
challenge of Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina Del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert is one of 74 House candidates who have spent at least $10,000 of their 
own money, according to the newspaper's computer-aided review of filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Republican challengers of Beilenson also made the list of candidates 
dipping into their personal wealth. Robert Hammer spent $51,945, ranking 17th; 
Mark Boos Benhard came in 69th, one of six candidates who spent $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's FEC report shows that he raised $54,610 during the last half of 
1993, bringing his yearly total to $102,228. Less expenses, he had $68,390 in 
his war chest at year's end, the FEC report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Kahn, a Democrat who is trying again to retire Rep. Carlos Moorhead 
(R-Glendale), showed up as No. 32 on the list, spending $25,292.

VENTURA FALLS IN DIVISION I DUAL MEET FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura High's hopes of winning the Southern Section Division I dual meet 
wrestling title Thursday night might have ended before the first wrestler 
stepped on the mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Coach Paul Clementi held out Ryan Atherton, one of the best 103-pound 
wrestlers in Southern California, from the final against host El Modena. The 
Cougars lost the opening match and any possible momentum as the Vanguards 
easily defeated Ventura, 36-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Clementi said Atherton, the second-place finisher in last weekend's Southern 
Section individual championships, suffered what Clementi described as an upper 
body injury and is questionable for Saturday's Southern Section Master's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In his place was sophomore Ricardo Cardona, who was 26-1 in junior varsity 
matches this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordona stayed with Bao Nguyen, leading, 5-3, after two periods before being 
out-pointed, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with El Modena's Milo Ventimiglia's 17-8 decision over David Johnson 
at 112 pounds, the Vanguards took an early 7-0 lead and controlled the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our win at 112 was a huge boost for us," El Modena Coach Paul Clinton said. 
"We'd expected to give something up early." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (18-2) made a brief comeback with a strong performance by Nate Tafoya 
at 119. Tafoya beat Joshua Wagner, 15-2, to give Ventura its first points. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Modena was just getting to the strength of its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Section champions Teak Sato (130) and Juan Alvarez (135) both dominated their 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato (43-1) had eight takedowns over Jesus Solis before gaining a technical 
fall eight seconds into the final period. "Sometimes I just get into a rhythm 
and feel like I can take my opponent down no matter what," Sato said. "Tonight 
I felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez scored the first pin of the match by defeating Justin Boynton at 3 
minutes 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, desperate for points, moved Chris Karlowsky, a Master's qualifier, up 
from 140 pounds to 145 to avoid former Section champion David Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy backfired when Wells (45-5) pinned replacement Bryan Doss at 
3:11, and Karlowsky was outpointed, 6-1, by Christopher Jaime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any one weight mattered," Karlowsky said. "We just didn't 
wrestle well tonight."

CLU HANDLES LA VERNE, GRABS SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>

 One down. One to go. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the feeling among Cal Lutheran players and coaches after the Kingsmen 
defeated La Verne, 103-90, in a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference men's basketball game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the third in a row for Cal Lutheran (23-2, 12-2 in conference 
play) and gave the Kingsmen a share of their third consecutive SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
 It also set up a playoff game against co-champion Pomona Pitzer on Saturday 
night at Occidental to determine which team will gain the SCIAC's automatic 
entry in the NCAA Division III playoffs beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second year in a row that Cal Lutheran will play in a SCIAC playoff 
game. The Kingsmen lost to co-champion La Verne last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have a chance to decide it on the court," Cal Lutheran Coach Mike 
Dunlap said. "And I'm really looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert Sapwell, who scored 25 points to go along with his eight rebounds, 
echoed Dunlap's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a real big game for us, but we want Pomona as bad as anyone," he 
said. "That will be a rumble on Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen and Sagehens split their two meetings this season. Cal Lutheran 
won, 96-77, on Jan. 22, and Pomona scored an 85-76 victory in overtime last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are definitely looking forward to playing them again, but we knew we 
had to win this game tonight if we wanted a (conference title) banner," Dunlap 
said. "If we wanted a three-peat, we had to win tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran appeared to have the victory wrapped up with 6 1/2 minutes left 
when Dave Ulloa hit a pair of free throws to give the Kingsmen an 83-61 lead, 
but La Verne (12-12, 8-6) countered with a 14-3 run to trim the deficit to 
86-75. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapwell ended the Leopards' streak with a pair of free throws with 3:45 left 
and Cal Lutheran went on a 12-6 run of its own to take a 98-81 lead with 1:48 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't going to let us enjoy the win until after the game, that's for 
sure," Dunlap said. "We weren't playing badly on defense, but they were just on 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Aaron Courseault (26 points) and Mark King (12), La Verne hit nine 
three-point shots in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 During one stretch in which La Verne cut a 68-43 deficit to 76-61, all 18 of 
the Leopards' points came on three-point baskets by either Courseault or King. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ridley had 23 points, six rebounds and seven assists for Cal Lutheran 
and Derrick Clark added 17 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul LaMott added 15 points and seven rebounds for the Kingsmen.

DIGEST: HARTMAN TO PLAY IN MCDONALD'S ALL-STAR GAME

 Jason Hartman of Thousand Oaks High was informed Thursday that he has been 
selected to play in the McDonald's All-American all-star game April 3 in New 
York, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, a senior forward, was called out of class and given the news by 
Athletic Director Barbara Safe, who received a phone call from a McDonald's 
official. The annual game features the top 20 high school players in the nation 
and is played on Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really overwhelming that I was picked," Hartman said. "I mean, there 
are so many good players in the nation. I really didn't think I'd get picked. I 
can't believe I am going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, who committed during the early signing period to attend Washington, 
led Thousand Oaks to a 21-7 record and its fourth consecutive Marmonte League 
championship. Hartman averaged 18.7 points and 11.3 rebounds a game. Football  
</P>
<P>
 St. Bonaventure High senior Brad Burnett has accepted an appointment to the 
United States Naval Academy. Burnett, a three-sport standout for the Seraphs, 
was sought by the Midshipmen to play quarterback on the football team and pitch 
for the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've wanted to go to the academy since my freshman year," said Burnett, 6 
feet 3, 180 pounds, who committed last week during a visit by Navy assistant 
football coach Mike Drake. "Navy was my first choice, but they weren't 
recruiting me until I called them. They didn't know about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran and Claremont also sought Burnett, and Army and Pennsylvania 
expressed interest. Burnett completed 89 of 168 passes for 1,146 yards and six 
touchdowns last season and expects to be the top pitcher on the St. Bonaventure 
baseball team this spring. He carries a 4.0 cumulative grade-point average 
while taking advance-placement and college-preparatory classes. DANA HADDAD

 Roberto Perez scored the winning goal with 17 minutes remaining in a 
quarterfinal match of the Southern Section Division III playoffs Thursday as 
Burroughs upset Palmdale, 3-2, at Burroughs.

 Perez, a senior forward who also scored the Indians' first goal, kicked in the 
winner on the rebound of a shot by forward Eddie Melgar, vaulting the Indians

 The season appeared over for the San Fernando High boys' soccer team when it 
lost to South Gate, 3-2, last Friday in the first round of the City Section 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But after inquiries by Tiger officials, South Gate was discovered to have used 
an ineligible player and had to forfeit its victory. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando (4-3-1) will play Garfield in a second-round match today. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate forward Carlos Osorio -- who scored a goal against the Tigers -- 
has been academically ineligible since December. Tiger coaches made inquiries 
about Osorio after being suspicious that he was too old to play. Baseball

 Van Nuys High will hold an alumni baseball game Saturday at 10 a.m. at Van

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: DESPITE INJURED KNEE, GIORDANO HOBBLES FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buena's all-state center Michelle Giordano still feels the effects of sprained 
knee ligaments she suffered a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 6-foot-1 senior returned to action two weeks ago and has been very 
effective, making a crucial contribution to the Bulldogs' effort to defend 
their Division I-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season in the final against Thousand Oaks, Giordano made two free throws 
with no time remaining to give Buena a one-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano, who has signed with Arizona, wears a bulky brace on her right knee 
that she said slows her considerably and limits her mobility near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 So she relies on her medium-range set shot, which is almost automatic when she 
is left open. 
</P>
<P>
 "She killed us," Capistrano Valley Coach Pete Belanto said after Giordano 
scored 21 points against the Cougars in Wednesday night's quarterfinal victory. 
"She shot the ball extremely well." TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's Hope 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't particularly inspired by playing in the Southern Section Division 
IV-A playoffs. And he wasn't trying to carry the load with the team's best 
player sidelined. Ryan Garth turned in the best performance of his high school 
career simply because he was mad. Mad at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth, a 6-2 senior, scored 37 points and added seven rebounds, five steals 
and three blocked shots in Oak Park's 84-70 victory over St. Joseph last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of built-up anger," Garth said. "Things haven't been going too 
right, but that was one of the best places to get it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Garth confessed to having trouble with an economics class, which Coach Rob 
Hall said was introduced as a new requirement for graduation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he gets mad again this week," said Hall, who will need another strong 
performance from Garth against Crossroads tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth said he was so high-strung all week, Hall had to harness him during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going all out in practice and Coach was telling me to take it easy a 
little," Garth said. "During the game there were times where I knew there was 
no way they could stop me." MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Winning Suits Him 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake Coach Greg Hilliard is lucky his team is winning. He can give 
his wardrobe a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 A superstition of Hilliard's is that if the team loses while he is wearing one 
of the Italian suits that are his trademark at home games, he can't wear that 
suit again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That hasn't been a problem this season. The Wolverines are 24-2 and play in 
the Southern Section Division III-A semifinals tonight. But last season, the 
Wolverines were 5-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have that many suits, so I had to try different combinations," 
Hilliard said. PACIFIC LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 As He Saw It 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Coach Bob Davidson had his road to the playoff semifinals well 
mapped. After the Dynamiters beat Long Beach Jordan, an at-large entry in the 
Division I-AA playoffs, they had a realistic chance of beating Santa Ana Valley 
and Ayala and, presto, the team would be in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters lost to Jordan by two points last Friday night. And it ranks as 
one of the tougher losses for Davidson to swallow. Glendale, normally an 
excellent shooting team, made one of 15 shots in the first quarter. After 
battling back, the Dynamiters tied the score in the final seconds, only to 
watch the game end in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Manny Gonzalez was fouled in the act of shooting with four seconds 
to play, Davidson thought. The officials called for a one-and-one. Gonzalez, 
the team's best free-throw shooter, stepped to the line and missed the first 
free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson had told his players beforehand: Try to get the rebound of a missed 
free throw, but whatever you do, don't foul. James Fuller went straight up for 
the rebound, as Davidson saw it. After hearing the whistle, Fuller was 
clapping, thinking the call was on a Jordan player. The foul was on Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's Chris Sykes then made both free throws at the other end of the court 
to win the game. "It was a heartbreaking loss," Davidson said. "I feel like we 
would have beaten them nine out of 10 times." DEL REY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 The Best Defense? 
</P>
<P>
 They say defense wins titles. They are not entirely correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure keeps you in a lot of games, but what wins you games is you shoot the 
ball and make it," St. Francis Coach John Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit A: St. Francis loses, 41-37, to San Marino in the first round of the 
Division III-A playoffs last Friday night. The Golden Knights, whose defense 
carried them all season, allowed no points in the third quarter and only three 
baskets in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the St. Francis defense was superb, San Marino's was better. Or at 
least, smarter. Knowing the Golden Knights' offense depended on getting the 
ball inside to 6-foot-8 Braden Weber and 6-11 Chris Ott, the Titans played a 
zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis made two of 16 three-point shots. CAMINO REAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Ahead 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Genevieve basketball team has no choice but to look forward to next 
season. After all, this season was a 2-17 nightmare, and one of those victories 
came by forfeit because Calabasas used an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Dan Donovan learned recently that, despite the earthquake, plans 
remain to build a gym at the school. It should be completed by next February, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan said he has no plans for his "dream gym." 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as it has a wooden floor, two baskets, a ceiling and four walls, I'm 
happy," he said. "Anything right now would be a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the prospect of an actual gym for a team that has been forced for 
years to practice at parks all over the Valley, the Valiants also can 
anticipate having a better basketball team. Ten players will return. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan, by the way, would like to go on record saying Village Christian is 
going to beat Serra in the Division IV-A playoffs tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra, the Camino Real League champion, advanced to the state Division IV 
championship game last year and is led by Duke-bound Ricky Price. MID-VALLEY 
LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Jump Start 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham senior James Lincoln is hesitant to reveal his goals in the high 
jump for the upcoming season, but the fifth-place finisher in last year's state 
championships expects to clear 7 feet before the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can go higher than that, but I don't want to say what my goal is," 
he said. "Sometimes, if you reach your goal early in the season, you have a 
tendency to back off. I don't want that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln cleared a personal best of 6-10 to win the high school competition in 
the high jump of the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena on Saturday night 
before missing three attempts at 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of psyched myself out at 7 feet," Lincoln said of his first 
competitive attempts at the barrier. "I figured I'd make it, but the bar looked 
a lot higher than I thought it would when I got underneath it." Around the 
Leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Tough day: Eight of 10 Valley area girls' basketball teams in the City 
Section playoffs -- including all six competing in Division 4-A -- were beaten 
Wednesday in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft and Sylmar, both in the 3-A Division, were the only winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, three area teams -- North Hollywood, Kennedy and Monroe -- 
advanced to the semifinal round. All three lost Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two of the area's most successful girls' teams, Bell-Jeff and Village 
Christian, meet Saturday in a Division IV-A semifinal at Pasadena Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill moved to fourth on the all-time region list in 
the boys' triple jump when he went 49 feet 3 inches to win the event in the 
Sunkist Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, whose brother Brock cleared 6-10 in the high jump for Antelope Valley 
High in 1991, trails Russell White of Crespi (50-6 in 1989), Ty Gaines of 
Palmdale (50-1 3/4 in '93) and Lawrence Miller of Palmdale (49-6 in '87). 
</P>
<P>
 * Quartz Hill freshman center Jackie Johnson had 50 points and 30 rebounds in 
the Rebels' two Division I-A girls' playoff victories last week. But Johnson 
managed only eight points in Wednesday night's 70-50 quarterfinal loss to Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Baptist's Landon LaPack made 52% (33 of 63) of his three-point shots 
and averaged 16.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the second consecutive year, North Hollywood's Darvena Merritt and Anna 
Celaya were named co-most valuable players of the Mid-Valley League.

 L.A. SOUTH? Ever confuse tranquil San Clemente with bustling Los Angeles? A 
Japanese movie company arrives in San Clemente today to begin shooting "Super 
Eccentric Legend," a movie about Zsa Zsa Gabor. . . . Why Zsa Zsa? A company 
spokesman says the Japanese find her "interesting." Why San Clemente? His 
answer: It's a good stand-in for "a small Los Angeles." Says Mimi Collier of 
the city's Chamber of Commerce, "It's very bizarre they're filming here, but 
we're happy." She's helping find extras.

 DOG DAY AFTERNOON: Tustin has decided to do something about its Catch-22 for 
residents who like to walk their dogs in the local parks. The city code says a 
dog in the park is OK, as long as it's on a leash. But all nine city parks have 
signs posted saying "Dogs Not Allowed." . . . The City Council has decided to 
end the confusion. The signs will come down. Dogs are welcome -- if they stay 
off the playground and any activity courts.

 FAT CHANCE: For research on his new movie about obesity, Hollywood director 
Ron Howard sent a team of writers to Cynthia Graff, president of the Lindora 
Medical Center in Costa Mesa. She had them meet four clients who had peaked at 
450 to 570 pounds. The writers asked for problems they could show visually. 
They got them: Trying to pass through grocery turnstiles, finding auto seat 
belts that fit. . . . Adds Graff, who was present: "And seeing everyone's eyes 
on a crowded elevator go to the pound-limit sign when you step on." 
</P>
<P>
 DO THEY CARE? Who finished poorly in that Capital Journal magazine ranking of 
the best California legislators? Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) was second from 
the bottom for Assembly members, and John R. Lewis (R-Orange) was third from 
last among senators. . . . It was based in part on a survey of legislative 
staffers. But Lewis spokesman Matt Cunningham scoffs: "Conservative Republicans 
are always at the bottom. It's a liberal magazine and who cares what they say 
anyway?"

VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK REPORTED, TIED TO QUAKE; HEALTH: FORTY-FIVE CASES -- MOST 
OF THEM IN THE EAST COUNTY -- HAVE BEEN RECORDED SINCE JAN. 26. OFFICIALS BLAME 
DUST, DIRT STIRRED UP BY TEMBLOR.

 Ventura County health officials and physicians Thursday reported a dramatic 
increase in valley fever -- particularly in the Simi Valley area -- that they 
attribute to dust and dirt stirred up by last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is an outbreak," said Marilyn Billimek, an epidemiologist with 
the county Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Billimek said 45 blood samples taken from Ventura County residents have tested 
positive for the airborne disease since Jan. 26, many more than normal for this 
time of year. All but five samples came from east county residents, Billimek 
said, with one sample from Oxnard, one from Ventura and three from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1992, no more than 10 cases of valley fever were reported in the county 
in an entire year, she said. In 1992, there were 60 cases, and 53 were reported 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attributed the increase in recent years to unusually windy 
conditions and other weather-related factors that caused the valley fever 
fungus to grow more actively than normal, dry out and then become airborne in 
the form of spores, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said the rash of cases in recent weeks is probably due to the 
earthquake, which stirred up the top layer of dust and soil that contains the 
fungus. 
</P>
<P>
 While 65% of those who inhale the spores that cause valley fever fight off the 
illness without showing any symptoms, others require anti-fungal medication to 
rid themselves of the chest pains, fever and other complications it causes. 
Valley fever is rarely fatal, health officials say, and spreads beyond the 
lungs in only 1% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley pulmonary specialist Gurdip Flora said he has never seen such a 
high concentration of infected patients come through his office as he has in 
the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora said he is treating five or six confirmed sufferers of valley fever and 
another three or four he suspects have the disease. Four of the confirmed cases 
were diagnosed Feb. 14, the most he has ever seen on a single day. "That was 
really overwhelming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the numbers mounted quickly, Flora said the cases have begun to 
taper off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I think we may be seeing a plateau in the cases," Flora said, 
"because the incubation period is two to three weeks, and most of the patients 
should have manifested the symptoms and presented it to their private physician 
by now." 
</P>
<P>
 The last significant outbreak that he treated, Flora said, came during 
construction of the connector of the Moorpark and Simi Valley freeways, when 
road crews kicked up the top layer of dirt and dust where the spores are. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, health officials reported fewer cases than normal since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a cluster there in Simi Valley and parts of Los Angeles 
County are contiguous with that, so we may see some increase in that area, but 
it hasn't been reported to us yet," said Dr. Roshan Reporter, an epidemiologist 
with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that a few doctors saw a cluster of cases and got pretty excited 
about it, and the media ran with it," Reporter said. "It's a disease that we've 
always had. It's nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she said only three confirmed cases of valley fever have been reported 
in Los Angeles County this year, but she stressed that only the most serious 
cases -- usually involving hospitalization -- are ever reported to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 92 cases reported in Los Angeles County in 1992 and 63 last year, 
Reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Media coverage of the post-earthquake increase in cases may add to the number 
reported, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's calling us now because they're hearing about it," she said. "If 
every patient that came in with a cough got tested for valley fever, we're 
going to see a large number of cases, because we know it's out there."

MUFFLING MISSY; OXNARD: WOMAN SUES AFTER BEING ORDERED TO 'DEBARK' TERRIER THAT 
HAS DISTURBED NEIGHBORS. SHE SAYS SURGERY WOULD BE CRUEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard woman is suing county animal control officials for ordering her to 
permanently muffle Missy, a 10-pound terrier that neighbors say barks too much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dog's owner, Ann Perez, said she filed the lawsuit in Ventura County 
Superior Court on Thursday to block an order that Missy be silenced through a 
surgical procedure known as "debarking." The suit describes such an operation 
as criminal cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it will inflict more fear on her and pain," Perez said. "She will not 
be able to be our means of protection." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kathy Jenks, director of the Ventura County Animal Regulation Department, 
refuted that charge, saying the surgery is a humane and accepted last option 
for dogs that won't stop barking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dog on the dog show circuit is debarked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Missy was formally declared a nuisance by Jenks in October during a hearing at 
which several neighbors testified about the dog's relentless barking. Perez was 
ordered to keep the 11-month-old mixed-breed terrier inside and have the canine 
evaluated by an animal expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenks issued the "debarking" order Feb. 8 after Missy continued to annoy 
neighbors and a dog trainer recommended surgery or an electronic collar as 
permanent solutions to the problem. The surgery would involve cutting the dog's 
vocal cords; the collar would zap the dog with a small electrical charge to 
discourage barking. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog trainer wrote that Missy's barking arose from a combination of fear 
and protectiveness that "causes her a great deal of stress, which apparently 
she releases by barking." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which names Jenks, Ventura County and the Oxnard Police 
Department, also contends that Perez and Missy did not receive a fair trial 
before the terrier was ordered silenced. And it says Perez was never notified 
that the surgery was an option. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Jenks said: "She had a hearing. She had all the opportunities. As 
far as I'm concerned, she's filing a nuisance suit." 
</P>
<P>
 A court hearing is scheduled Monday on Perez's request for a temporary 
restraining order against the abatement order issued by Jenks. The abatement 
order said that if the surgery was not performed by Feb. 11, Missy could be 
impounded and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said nothing will happen until the 
lawsuit is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand someone's love for their pets and animals. At the same time, 
people . . . should have some respect and understanding of the peace and quiet 
of the neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who live near Perez on West Robert Avenue in north Oxnard said 
they've suffered enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've attempted to talk with Ann Perez reasonably," said Justin Du Pont, 44, 
who lives next door. "She has refused any responsibility for controlling her 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Du Pont and others say Missy's high-pitched yapping has caused them to lose 
sleep and peace of mind for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog would bark relentlessly day and night," said Steven Lee, a teacher 
who lives next door to Perez and does paperwork at home in the afternoon. "It 
has a very penetrating, piercing bark." 
</P>
<P>
 Du Pont, a plant operator who worked a hospital graveyard shift in the fall, 
said the barking even caused strife in his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife didn't get sleep at night. I didn't get sleep, so we would fight," he 
said. "When you don't get sleep, life is hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, 38, sees it differently. She believes that the complaints against Missy 
are exaggerated, and that her dog's barking is no worse than the other pooches 
on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's a two-way street," Perez said. "I feel they have not been 
sensitive to my being here also. I moved in in September and a week later, 
they're writing me letters and notes."

LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLAN PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal funding for a proposed low-income apartment house in downtown Oxnard 
has been held up by protests from residents and business owners, who fear that 
the development will boost crime, sink property values and endanger children 
living in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-unit project, which is at the forefront of a citywide push to build 
low-income housing in Oxnard, is planned for a 1.5-acre site at Donlon Avenue 
and Driffill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the project is incompatible with the neighborhood, area residents and 
business owners are calling for it to be scaled back or moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not low-income housing that we are against," said Louis Kanter, manager 
of the nearby Regal Lodge. "But they are trying to put too many people into 
that small area. They want to cram them in like sardines." 
</P>
<P>
 But the housing developer, Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., 
says the three-story project is a good one and much needed in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we are going to be an attractive addition and have a positive impact 
on your community," project manager Karen Flock told Kanter and a dozen other 
opponents at a meeting this week. "Our experience is that we make good 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Planning Commission has approved the project. It is scheduled for 
City Council review March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter and others say their primary concern is that children who live in the 
new apartment complex will have to cross Oxnard Boulevard to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, based on a letter from the Regal Lodge, the U. S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development has temporarily refused to release $263,000 in 
grant money requested by the city to help build the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be withheld until the city can ensure that the busy boulevard 
poses no threat to children in the complex, according to HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 But city housing officials and Cabrillo representatives say that they are 
confident that the issue can be resolved and that the federal money will be 
made available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are concerns that have been raised and those are being addressed," said 
Ernie Whitaker, manager of the city's housing and rehabilitation program. 
"That's all part of the review process." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 13 years, Cabrillo, a nonprofit developer of affordable housing, has 
produced about 650 units throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, the agency was chosen to lead a push to develop low-income 
housing in Oxnard. The city's blueprint for future housing construction 
outlined a goal of building 1,450 low- and moderate-income housing units by 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But between 1980 and 1989, the city helped to build only 46 low- and 
moderate-income units. Since then, another 22 affordable single-family units 
have been built or are under construction, housing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo was chosen primarily to replace low-income units wiped out over the 
years by downtown redevelopment efforts. The 66,000-square-foot apartment house 
that Cabrillo has designed for the downtown site will be known as Villa 
Solimar. 
</P>
<P>
 The units will be available to families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a 
year, Flock said. Monthly rent for the three-bedroom units will be about $700. 
Cabrillo will oversee construction and management of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good project and it will be an asset to the neighborhood," 
Flock said. "But it's hard to tell that to people when they are frightened 
about things." 
</P>
<P>
 At this week's community meeting at the Regal Lodge, those fears became 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the nearby Royal Palms Mobile Home Park said they worry that the 
complex will be noisy, and attract gangs and graffiti. More than 200 senior 
citizens live in the park, and most have signed a petition opposing the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody moved into this park because they wanted peace, quiet and comfort," 
park resident Arnie Adkison told Flock. "I really want the City Council to 
explain how they justify moving a bunch of kids into our park." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents asked that the project be limited to 16 units. Others asked 
that it be built elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think you have a great plan to begin with," park resident Patricia Brown 
said. "But this is not the location for it."

HOMEOWNERS HAVE YET TO GET REPAIR LOANS; RECOVERY: DESPITE THE EARLY RELEASE OF 
$2.8 MILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS, COUNTY OFFICIALS NOW SAY THE FUNDS SHOULD BE 
HELD IN RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A month after Ventura County officials gained early release of $2.8 million in 
federal grants, saying the money was needed for emergency repair of 
quake-damaged homes, officials have yet to make a single loan to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The early release was considered a political coup when the federal grants were 
doled out a week after the Jan. 17 earthquake. But officials now say the money 
should be held in reserve and eventually used to fill gaps in state and federal 
home-repair loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.8-million Community Development Block Grant was earmarked for the 
unincorporated portions of the county and six cities -- Fillmore, Santa Paula, 
Ojai, Moorpark, Camarillo and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Simi Valley received a separate $738,000 block grant, most of 
which was earmarked by the City Council for damaged roads and public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials administering the $2.8-million grant have spent about 
$200,000 for temporary business shelters in Fillmore and Piru. But a program to 
distribute the remaining $2.6 million is still being worked out, said Marty 
Robinson, the county's deputy chief administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the county still hopes to develop the kind of program originally 
planned, which could include loans of up to $25,000 for quake victims to repair 
their homes. But she said the county is still determining what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know yet who is in need," Robinson said. "I can say these funds will 
definitely be used for earthquake repairs. I would be amazed if these funds 
weren't necessary. Some money will go to housing, but some might go for 
infrastructure work. First we have to analyze where it's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Vicky Howard worked strenuously 
after the disaster to secure release of the funds from the federal Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. Both buttonholed HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros 
when he toured Fillmore a few days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the more than 600 homes that were damaged in the small community, 
the supervisors told Cisneros that the grants were needed immediately to help 
make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard drove to Pasadena to pick up the money, presented in a HUD letter of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that initial urgency, Kildee said she is not upset that the county has 
not solicited applications from homeowners in need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the important thing is that the money is there," she said. "But we 
want to spend the money carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster aid officials who are working with quake victims say they have heard 
nothing about the possible county home-loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking to a knowledgeable aid officer and, if this money's out there, 
I don't know about it," said Diane Brady, spokeswoman for the federal Small 
Business Administration, which administers the federal home-repair loan 
programs at disaster centers in Fillmore and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Dorado Senior Estates mobile-home park in Fillmore, where more than 200 
of the park's 300 homes suffered serious damage, residents are still making 
expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Garbanati, the president of the park's homeowners association, said 
federal aid officials have done a good job of providing loans for repairs. He 
said he doubts that a county program with more loans will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have had to apply for loans and grants," he said. "This is a 
senior park with people on fixed incomes in their 70s, 80s and even some in 
their 90s. The problem isn't the availability of loans but how to pay for 
them."

EAST VENTURA : THOUSAND OAKS; LATER START ORDERED FOR NOISY BUILDERS 
</P>

<P>
 Besieged by pre-dawn calls from irate Newbury Park residents, Thousand Oaks 
officials will require that construction crews building a debris catch basin 
off Reino Road keep their trucks quiet before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The debris basin, which will sink about three stories deep along the South 
Branch Arroyo Conejo stream, is designed to catch silt, sand and rock that may 
wash off nearby hillsides stripped bare of vegetation by last fall's wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the basin will not be ready for at least three weeks -- until the 
tail end of this year's rainy season -- it will protect Newbury Park homes for 
the next few years, until the hillside plants regenerate, said Alex Sheydayi, 
the county's deputy director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the contractors building the basin must haul out 70,000 cubic yards of 
dirt, about two dozen trucks have been working Monday through Saturday, 
rumbling down Reino Road and through a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is not supposed to start until 7 a.m., but some truckers line up an hour 
or two earlier to get a jump on the day and squeeze in an extra load. City 
Council members Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar both said they had received calls 
before 5:45 a.m. from residents furious about the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy -- the trucks are gathering there and making a lot of noise at 
5:30 a.m. on a Saturday," Schillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 In response, City Manager Grant Brimhall and Sheydayi said they would work 
with the contractor and require all trucks to remain off-site, away from the 
residential area, until 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incumbent on the contractor not to bother the neighborhood with that 
kind of noise at that time of day," Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering other council concerns, Sheydayi promised that the debris basin, 
when completed, would be surrounded by a fence to prevent children from falling 
in. He also said the county would landscape the site, planting 10 oak trees for 
every one removed during construction. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIREFIGHTERS GIVEN TRAINING IN RIVER RESCUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to prepare themselves before tragedy strikes, about 300 Ventura County 
firefighters have trained over the past 10 days in techniques used to rescue 
victims from flood-control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 The training, part of a new initiative approved by Fire Chief George Lund, is 
aimed at better preparing firefighters for calls they are already receiving and 
responding to, Capt. Tom Law said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fielding these 911 calls and we're performing these rescues," Law said. 
"The fire chief wants to make sure that we know how to perform them properly." 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the department has gone through one of the morning or afternoon 
sessions, Law said. The final session was conducted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The training involves about an hour of classroom instruction, followed by more 
than two hours of practical experience conducted west of Moorpark where Hitch 
Boulevard crosses over the Arroyo Simi flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the classroom sessions really teach you to respect the power and 
velocity of even a small amount of water," Law said. "As little as two feet of 
water can float a car and take it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Once outdoors, firefighters are shown three rescue techniques used to pull a 
victim from the flowing waters without themselves having to enter the 
unpredictable currents. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategies include throwing a bag containing a 70-foot rope to a victim, or 
stringing a 300-foot tension line diagonally across the water or lowering an 
air-filled fire hose into the water -- both aimed at snagging anyone being 
pulled along against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are systems that we set up with a minimum of equipment," Law said. 
"It's not anything exotic, it's not overly expensive, just basic, common-sense 
rescue tools." 
</P>
<P>
 Law said all fire engine and truck companies will be issued the equipment used 
in the training so that they can use what they have learned when responding to 
calls that can turn deadly without the proper rescue techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the taxpayers call 911," he said, "they're expecting that the person on 
the other end of the phone is going to take some action." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VENTURA : THOUSAND OAKS; STEPS TO CURB YOUTH VIOLENCE DISCUSSED 
</P>

<P>
 Police, school and city officials on Thursday assured the Thousand Oaks Crime 
Prevention Task Force they are doing everything possible to prevent violence 
among the region's teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Cmdr.Kathy Kemp told the group that deputies maintain a "zero 
tolerance" policy toward gang members by rousting them from public parks and 
keeping close tabs on their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park High School Principal Charles Eklund said his school district 
expels students for assault and possession of weapons. He also told the group 
that district schools work to keep non-students off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every student and staff member has a right to work . . . where they are free 
of the threat of physical harm," Eklund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since three Westlake High School students were shot in a Feb. 3 brawl, the 
task force has pushed teen-age violence to the top of its agenda, said group 
member and Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is an assembly of Conejo Valley government officials, business 
people and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Zukowski, panel members include Kemp, Eklund, Karen Lindsey, 
the recreation manager of the Conejo Recreation and Park District; David 
Davidson, an Episcopal pastor; youth counselor Jean Ferguson, and Ronald D. 
Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA : SIMI VALLEY; PLANS TO TURN CHURCH INTO ARTS CENTER OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to transform a 71-year-old Simi Valley church into the city's Cultural 
Arts Center were unanimously approved by the Simi Valley Planning Commission 
despite neighbors' reservations about potential parking woes. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval Wednesday of the proposal means that the arts center could open 
as early as January, city staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this project definitely needs to move forward," said Planning 
Commissioner Sherida Simmons. "But I also want to feel comfortable that this 
isn't going to create a problem for the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors had expressed concerns about the center's potential parking 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Designs for parking at the center met city code, but neighbors have argued 
that 73 parking spaces for the proposed 300-seat theater and 140-seat banquet 
facility would be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that there's not enough parking for the proposed 
project," said Russell Barnard, who lives on School Street, next to the church. 
"The city staff has as much as admitted that already." 
</P>
<P>
 In reviewing the project, city planners recommended that the city make a 
parking agreement with a nearby school and office that would allow for about 60 
extra spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 After debating that suggestion, commissioners decided that they would urge the 
city to arrange for a parking agreement but not require it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if they have met our code, than that should be enough for us," said 
Planning Commissioner Robert Swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has been designed to include the theater and banquet facilities, 
stained glass windows, a rose garden and improvements to allow for wheelchair 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project is expected to cost $2.8 million, according to city 
officials. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA : MOORPARK; RUSTED PIPE BOMB FOUND NEXT TO HOME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies are investigating a pipe bomb found next to 
a Moorpark home that they believe was knocked off the roof while the house was 
being fumigated. 
</P>
<P>
 The device was found about 5 p.m. Wednesday between a house and detached 
garage in the 4200 block of Hitch Boulevard in Moorpark.It was retrieved by a 
member of the county bomb squad and disposed of at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Joe Braga said it appeared that the bomb fizzled out after someone 
lit the fuse months ago, although it was still capable of exploding. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the rust on the pipe, Braga said he believed that the device sat on 
the roof for several months before it was knocked off by a tent placed atop the 
house for fumigation. Investigators have no suspects and no motive. JULIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WORKER SAYS CHARGES TOO VAGUE TO DEFEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first person charged in Ventura County with workers' compensation fraud 
told a judge Thursday that the complaint against him is too vague for him to 
defend himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark postponed the arraignment of Alan 
Griffis of Camarillo and ordered a hearing to determine the sufficiency of the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffis, 41, a sales manager at a Camarillo computer firm, was charged Jan. 27 
with three counts of workers' compensation fraud and one count of theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Griffis were brought by a year-old district attorney's 
unit designed to investigate suspicious claims of workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit did not charge anyone in its first year, but has brought charges 
against Griffis and two other men in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rhonda Schmidt denied that the complaint against Griffis is 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
 She said prosecutors have provided Griffis' attorney with specific details on 
the charges against the man, including an affidavit used to obtain a search 
warrant for his residence. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, she said Griffis injured his shoulder on the job but continued to 
collect benefits after the injury had healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, authorities arrested 22-year-old Miguel Gamez of Oxnard on two 
charges of workers' compensation fraud on Thursday, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Gamez broke his finger off the job but collected an undisclosed 
amount of benefits by claiming the injury occurred at work. He is scheduled to 
be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, 27-year-old Ronald Lopez of Oxnard was charged with two counts of 
workers' compensation fraud. Lopez, a truck driver, has pleaded not guilty to 
lying to collect benefits. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARY'S REOPENING DELAYED FOR REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials said Thursday that the earthquake-damaged Simi Valley 
Library, which they had initially hoped to reopen Monday, will remain closed 
for at least two more weeks while repair work continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Thousand Oaks Library is also expected to reopen in mid-March, 
and the Fillmore Library is scheduled to reopen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley reopening is being delayed because interior work on the 
facility is taking longer than expected and damage to columns that support a 
canopy over the library walkway is more severe than originally thought, said 
Dixie Adeniran, director of the Ventura County Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary bookmobile parked outside the library will remain in use, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work in Fillmore was limited to cleaning up and shoring up shelves inside the 
facility, Adeniran said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, where the quake shook loose the metal ceiling, ruptured 
water pipes and sent thousands of books tumbling off shelves, the facility is 
scheduled to reopen March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 However, new carpeting will not arrive until about six weeks after the 
reopening, and officials do not know when the library's inner ceiling will be 
replaced. The library will probably close for three to five days when the 
carpet is laid, Library Director Marvin Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the metal ceiling contributed about 60% of the library's light -- by 
reflecting beams off its shiny surface -- the reading areas and bookshelves 
will be somewhat dark, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dim light will curtail library hours. If the City Council approves, he 
said, the library will be open from 10 or 11 a.m. until about 5:30 p.m. JAMES 
MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HELP SOUGHT TO FIND DEAD WOMAN'S KIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County coroner's officials are asking for the public's help in trying 
to locate relatives of Katie Kitchens, a 41-year-old transient found dead near 
the mouth of the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that Kitchens, who went by the last name of Farrish, died of 
a head injury.Authorities believe that she fell and struck her head several 
days before she collapsed at her campsite Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens' boyfriend, Rafael Newman, ran to the nearest phone at Emma Woods 
State Beach near Ventura and called for help. But she was dead when paramedics 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said Kitchens is believed to have relatives in 
Santa Barbara and possibly in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to notify the next of kin so they can take care of the body and 
be aware of the situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens, who had blue eyes and medium-length brown hair, was identified by 
Newman and through fingerprints in a national criminal justice computer. She 
had been arrested previously for alcohol-related offenses in Santa Barbara 
County, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair had been living at a tidy campsite in an area known as Hobo Jungle 
since Jan. 2. At the time of her death, Kitchens had a severe head cold, but 
had refused to seek treatment at a hospital where doctors might have discovered 
her head wound, Wingate said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FUND-RAISING BINGO GAMES AT SCHOOL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai officials have granted the Ojai Unified School District permission to 
hold bingo games at Nordhoff High School to raise money for programs officials 
worry might not be funded in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an existing city ordinance, the school district requires a permit from 
the City Council to run the games, which are tentatively planned Wednesday 
nights beginning April 20 in the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved the permit request as a consent agenda item, meaning 
that there was no public discussion before the vote, which was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the plan could generate up to $100,000 a year for 
computer, art, athletic and other programs that are perennially jeopardized by 
state funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out that over 12 high schools in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties 
use bingo as a fund-raiser," said Craig Walker, a Nordhoff High computer 
education instructor who helped propose the plan. "If you do it right, you 
might be able to make between $75,000 and $100,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 School district trustees have already granted tentative approval for the 
weekly games, which would have a maximum payout of $250. The board will 
consider final approval next month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said there is an existing market for bingo games, and that weekly games 
in Oak View typically draw as many as 200 people. He said there were no mixed 
messages being sent to students who reap the benefits of a game of chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a little different from gambling because there is a fixed payout," he 
said. "It isn't exactly the same as setting up a card room or a roulette wheel. 
We rely on lottery money on a statewide level right now." JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL APPROVES CHILD-CARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An audience of dozens of parents cheered loudly after the Ojai City Council 
approved participating in a joint program with the local school district that 
would provide before- and after-school child care to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, approved by council members sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, 
would offer day care to up to 35 schoolchildren inside a portable classroom 
that would be located on the Topa Topa Elementary School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement approved by the City Council late Tuesday, the city would 
use up to $28,000 in redevelopment funds to help get the project started. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district would provide the space for the classroom for $550 a 
month, but the operation of the facility would be administered by a local 
nonprofit group called Smart Start. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker after speaker urged the council to approve the joint operating 
agreement, which had come under fire at previous public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 No one spoke against the plan Tuesday night. But some day-care providers and 
others argued at earlier discussions that public agencies should not be 
supporting private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to create a relaxed, trusting atmosphere," said Dana Huffman of Smart 
Start. "We want to provide affordable care during those times when children are 
not at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Child care would cost between $175 and $223 a month under the plan submitted 
by Huffman. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY DECIDES TO BUY DIESEL-POWER TROLLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite being awarded a $200,000 federal clean-air grant last year to buy an 
alternative-fuel streetcar, the Ojai City Council decided to purchase a 
diesel-powered trolley that could later be converted to natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The city initially had planned to purchase a combination fuel system that 
would run off diesel or compressed natural gas as a replacement for the olive 
green trolley that winds through 7 1/2 miles of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But after more study, staff members determined that compressed natural gas is 
not a feasible fuel alternative because existing technology has not been 
perfected. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members told the council in November that either the diesel-natural gas 
trolley could be purchased or an electric streetcar could replace the existing 
car, which has more than 160,000 miles on its engine. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members at that time, however, rejected the electric-car alternative 
because the cars also must be air-conditioned. They hoped to buy two diesel 
trolleys for the price of one dual-fueled or electric car. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, the council accepted a bid not to exceed $130,000 for one diesel 
trolley, which will be significantly larger than the existing vehicle. City 
officials said the proposal still meets the requirements of the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also is looking into the possibility of financing an extension of 
the trolley's route into Meiners Oaks or other nearby communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission has scheduled a March 16 public 
hearing in Meiners Oaks to gauge the interest of residents on extending service 
to their neighborhoods. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; JUDGE FINDS SLAYING SUSPECT COMPETENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge has found a 24-year-old Santa Paula slaying suspect 
competent to stand trial, although two psychiatrists described the defendant as 
schizophrenic and said the man believes he is turning into John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch on Wednesday ordered court officials to 
set a preliminary hearing for Jose Luis Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder in connection with the 
shooting death of Santa Paula ranch foreman Rosario De La Cruz last May. 
Moments before he died, De La Cruz told his wife that he had been shot by 
Gonzalez, who was a longtime acquaintance. Authorities say Gonzalez stole 
jewelry and a rifle from the man before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's competency hearing came after two psychiatrists disagreed on the 
defendant's ability to assist in his legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
 One doctor, Donald A. Patterson of Ventura, told the judge that Gonzalez 
suffers from a "paranoid-schizophrenia type disorder" and is not competent to 
stand trial. Patterson has examined Gonzalez twice since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A second psychiatrist, Patrick C. Barker, agreed that Gonzales is 
schizophrenic. But Barker, who also has examined the defendant twice, said 
Gonzalez is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Barker told the judge of one statement Gonzalez made to him in 
December. "I think I'm going to turn into a different person, and that will be 
John Lennon," Gonzalez said, according to Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gonzalez sat silently through the hearing, rocking back and forth in his 
chair at the defense table on occasion, Judge Storch ruled that the defense had 
not proved he is incompetent. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL BACKS PLAN TO BOOST SERVICE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fees for services provided by the city of Ojai could more than double under a 
consultant's proposal to recoup diminishing revenues by increasing the cost of 
various services. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing escalating costs and an ever-shrinking budget, the City Council on 
Tuesday gave preliminary approval to the fee-increase plan, which would, for 
example, raise the cost of a zone change from $750 to $2,268 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Bragdon of Ralph Andersen & Associates said many cities in California 
have been re-examining their user fees because of continuing budget cuts made 
by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (cities) don't identify ways to recoup some of those costs, then you're 
looking at service reductions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 115 services provided by the city will be affected by the change, 
which seeks to establish a fee equal to the cost of processing the application. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to subsidize user fees," said Mayor Steve Olsen. "People will 
pay actual costs for services." 
</P>
<P>
 But several key service costs would be lowered under the plan, including some 
use permits, maps and variances. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, however, the bulk of the services would be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, sign permits would increase from $50 to $123; home occupation 
permits would rise from $30 to $63; environmental impact reports would increase 
from $100 to between $1,325 and $3,839; and general plan amendments would be 
raised from $1,500 to between $2,899 and $4,085. 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid the consultant $19,000 for the study, which concluded that Ojai 
revenues would increase by $206,000 if the fee schedule is fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for March 8 at the Ojai City 
Hall. JEFF McDONALD

 Administrators in the Ventura Unified School District have won awards in five 
out of 16 categories in an annual contest by the Assn. of California School 
Administrators' Region 13, which encompasses Ventura, Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators who belong to the association give awards annually to peers who 
are considered to be the best in their jobs as principals or assistant 
principals or in other non-teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, six winners were from Ventura County and five of the six were from 
the Ventura district. 
</P>

ARTS PLAZA 'SURPLUS' IS TOPIC OF DEBATE; THOUSAND OAKS: CONSTRUCTION IS 
EXPECTED TO BE $1 MILLION UNDER BUDGET, BUT SOME CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THE 
PRICE TAG IS MISLEADING. 
</P>

<P>
 Construction of the Civic Arts Plaza will wind up this fall roughly $1 million 
under budget -- but Thousand Oaks council members have already begun arguing 
about whether they have a genuine surplus on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the City Council awarded the final construction contracts on the 
performing arts and civic center, hiring crews to build curbs, gutters and 
retaining walls, and to landscape the outdoor park. 
</P>
<P>
 A few small items, mainly City Hall furniture, remain to be purchased. But the 
actual construction is "100% bid out," said Ed Johnduff, the city's project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Even accounting for the unexpected glitches and cost overruns that inevitably 
crop up, the budget should have a healthy $1 million remaining in the 
contingency fund by the time the 1,800-seat theater opens with a splashy 
black-tie festival in October, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any owner would be proud to be in this position," said Denis Carter, who 
oversees the project for the construction management firm Lehrer McGovern 
Bovis. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Thousand Oaks City Hall, the milestone caused consternation as well as 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, both longtime opponents of 
the Civic Arts Plaza's size and cost, have repeatedly questioned the accounting 
practices that show a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The construction budget does not include millions spent on acquiring land for 
the Civic Arts Plaza, so Zeanah and Zukowski have argued that the $63.8-million 
price tag is misleading. In recent public meetings, Zeanah has accused other 
council members of diverting attention from substantial land costs by boasting 
about the lower-than-expected construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thursday, Zukowski agreed, saying: "To fully assess this, we should look 
at both budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Robert Biery has promised to present the council with brief 
summaries of all construction and land costs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city's most recent land acquisition, the narrow Heggen property along 
Oakwood Drive, the council authorized spending more than $600,000 in gas-tax 
funds. The Civic Arts Plaza's architects plan to widen Oakwood by paving over 
part of the Heggen property to create a grand entrance into the five-story 
parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, City Atty. Mark Sellers is negotiating to purchase another property 
near the Civic Arts Plaza, at the southwest corner of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
and Oakwood Drive. The 2.3 acres would be used for a regional transportation 
center linking various bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said he hopes to wrap up the acquisition within the next month, but 
declined to estimate a price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with no firm cost figures, however, Zukowski warned that the city's land 
acquisition plan has been expensive, driving up the overall price of completing 
the Civic Arts Plaza. Operating and maintaining the high-tech auditorium will 
be costly as well, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, despite the apparent construction budget surplus, "it's not as though we 
have $1 million to play with," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those council members who do consider the $1 million to be genuine surplus 
also cautioned against thinking of the leftover funds as a windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he would not support an Arts Commission 
suggestion that at least some of the money go toward purchasing a sculpture for 
the park. Instead, he said, the funds should be kept in reserve for structural 
or acoustic enhancements deemed necessary after several test runs in the new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 And Councilman Alex Fiore recommended whittling the city's debt on the 
government portion of the Civic Arts Plaza by transferring the budget surplus 
to the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the Redevelopment Agency is funding the performing arts side of 
the building, while the city's general fund is putting up cash for the new 
government offices. But the council has had to lend millions from the general 
fund to the penny-pinched Redevelopment Agency for construction of the 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the general fund's resources for building the City Hall 
section have been crimped because the city has been unable to sell its former 
civic center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive. To cover a $13-million shortfall until 
the Hillcrest Drive property is sold, the city will have to take out short-term 
loans or issue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 By applying the budget surplus to the general fund, Fiore said, the city would 
be able to reduce the amount of debt financing needed to complete the project. 
The city would normally get half of any surplus, but the Redevelopment Agency 
could transfer its half to the general fund as partial repayment on the loans, 
he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first thing that should be done," Fiore said. "I'd rather see it 
go to repay the debt than anything else."

GROUP TO RAISE MONEY FOR CIVIC ARTS PLAZA'S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A well-known entrepreneur and a retired professional actor have teamed up with 
a pledge to raise money for children's programming and student internships at 
the new Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Janss and Harry Selvin, both members of the theater commission that sets 
policy for the Civic Arts Plaza, announced this week that they have formed a 
nonprofit group dedicated to raising an endowment for educational programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the senior citizens and the kids, who have not been 
addressed at all so far," said Selvin, who spent two decades tap-dancing, 
acting and playing drums in a bevy of Hollywood movies. "We want to give them 
an opportunity to take advantage of our community and get involved here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have not yet established a fund-raising target, Janss and Selvin 
have set forth a detailed vision of their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Primarily, their all-volunteer Gold Coast Performing Arts Assn. will subsidize 
children's shows, from theater to symphony to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Troupes performing for kids during the school day will pay reduced rates to 
rent the Civic Arts Plaza's 1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat theater. The 
Gold Coast group will make up the difference, in an effort to keep the center's 
operating budget balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the bottom line steady, Selvin and Janss will likely have to raise a 
hefty endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking for $10,000 -- we're looking for substantial figures," 
Selvin said. "We're not looking to fund-raise and say, 'Wow, we've got X amount 
of dollars now.' We're hoping to get continual support over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 The theaters' executive director, Tom Mitze, warned the commissioners at a 
Wednesday night meeting that every show requires some subsidy, through parking 
fees, concession sales or other means. Children's programming, which generally 
commands lower ticket prices, may need even more of a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we charged enough rent to really cover our annual overhead, no one would 
be able to afford to use the theater," Mitze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the programming endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for the Arts has already collected nearly $2.5 million for a 
separate operations endowment to fund the day-to-day costs of running the Civic 
Arts Plaza. But Janss and Selvin hope to attract a different group of donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alliance endowment is buying paper clips and toilet paper," Janss said. 
"It's hard to raise money for that, because there's no sizzle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the alliance's makeshift office across the street from the Civic Arts Plaza 
construction site, campaign director Richard Johnson agreed. Several alliance 
members have agreed to join Gold Coast's board of trustees, and Johnson said he 
expects the two fund-raising drives to complement one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll find ways so that no one will be in conflict," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with subsidizing children's shows, Janss and Selvin hope to organize 
field trips to the Civic Arts Plaza for teen-age students and senior citizens. 
Their association, they said, could offer free or cut-rate tickets to 
full-dress rehearsals when professional troupes come to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the commissioners plan to establish internship programs allowing high 
school and college students to trail theater professionals through the Civic 
Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids really interested in theater could do high-level gofering, pulling the 
ropes, setting the lights up and so on," Janss said. "They would tag along with 
a director on a soup-to-nuts production, from the first read-through to the 
final curtain call."

SIMI SCHOOL BOARD CUTS 16 MORE TEACHING JOBS AMID FISCAL CRUNCH; EDUCATION: 
ACTION WILL REDUCE NEXT YEAR'S DEFICIT BY $800,000. EIGHT POSITIONS WERE 
ELIMINATED EARLIER. 
</P>

<P>
 The Simi Valley school board has cut 16 junior high and high school teaching 
jobs from next year's budget but decided against moving sixth-period varsity 
sports to after school. 
</P>
<P>
 In one swoop, the decision to eliminate 16 of the district's 310 secondary 
teachers slashed $800,000 of an expected $2.5-million deficit from next year's 
$77.1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier round of cuts Feb. 1, the board of the Simi Valley Unified 
School District trimmed $702,000 from the budget. More than half that savings 
-- about $400,000 -- came from cutting eight teaching jobs, including 
elementary teachers. So far, 24 of the district's 640 teaching jobs have been 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Debbie Sandland opposed the reductions in a 4-1 vote late 
Wednesday. But her colleagues on the board said months of review showed they 
had little choice since more than half the budget is made up of salaries and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't make this $800,000 cut, I don't know where we're going to find 
that kind of money," board President Carla Kurachi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Member Judy Barry agreed. "I don't know how else to address it. We've turned 
over every rock I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they will not know until April or May how many of the 
teaching cuts can be made by not replacing teachers who retire or leave 
voluntarily, and how many will be made by layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Guzel, a mathematics teacher at Royal High School, said that as a new 
teacher she expects to be a target of the budget ax. The board was balancing 
the budget at the expense of students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other places to cut," Guzel said. "The cuts should hit the 
classroom last." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandland agreed that with fewer teachers, students will be forced into more 
crowded classes. For that reason, she said, all district employees -- including 
administrators -- should consider accepting a 2% pay cut to keep some of the 
teaching positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to save programs and you want to save jobs, that's where the 
money is," Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggie Noisette, president of the Simi Educators Assn., said the teachers 
union would oppose a pay cut. She said the board already hopes to persuade 
teachers to patrol campuses for free so that the district can save $100,000, 
about 20% of the budget for campus supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing, they're going to ask us to drive the buses to school since 
it's on our way," Noisette said. 
</P>
<P>
 A teachers' pay cut and unpaid supervision duties will both be discussed when 
the two sides sit down to negotiate a new contract, she said. The current 
three-year pact expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as our obligation as teachers to subsidize the education of 
children in this community," Noisette said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the board kept athletics as part of the school day when 
coaches offered to find other ways to cut $100,000 from their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had discussed moving sports to after school because the district 
then could legally charge athletes fees. As long as varsity sports are part of 
the school day, the district must provide it free, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Dobbins, athletic director at Royal High, said after the vote that 
losing sixth-period athletics would have made Simi Valley's teams less 
competitive because league rules bar after-school teams from practicing 
together in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a compromise, parents will be asked to pay fees. Coaches will also be more 
creative in scheduling games closer to home and getting parents to help drive 
team members, Dobbins said. Students who could not afford to pay the fees would 
not be barred from participating, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the bad options, this was one that we could work with," Dobbins said. 
"Every one of us would consider it a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 The board also voted Wednesday to trim special education by 5%, or $100,000; 
reduce operational budgets by 8%, or $150,000, excluding money for classroom 
materials, including textbooks, and cut three clerical positions to save 
$68,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the board agreed to start charging parents for 
home-to-school transportation to save about $190,000. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the board has cut a total of about $2.1 million.

JURORS AWARD ANEURYSM VICTIM'S KIN $1.67 MILLION; COURTS: THEY RULE THAT KAREN 
DONALDSON RECEIVED NEGLIGENT CARE FROM SIMI VALLEY HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN AFTER SHE 
COMPLAINED OF SEIZURES IN 1990. 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura County jury Thursday found that a 36-year-old woman who died of an 
aneurysm had received negligent care from a doctor at Simi Valley Hospital and 
awarded $1.67 million to her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Donaldson, a preschool teacher, had gone to the hospital in the middle 
of the night on Nov. 11, 1990, with complaints that she was experiencing 
seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Richard Wagner, an emergency room physician on duty, sent her home 
without performing any tests on her condition, an attorney for the woman's 
family said. 
</P>
<P>
 She died 33 days later of the aneurysm, said attorney Jim Pagliuso of 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just busy that night and instead of attending to the lady, he just 
recommended that she see a private medical doctor the next day," Pagliuso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wagner nor his attorney, Robert D. Wilkinson of Fresno, could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagliuso argued to the jury that Wagner should have performed a CAT scan on 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor Donaldson visited the next day was a family practitioner and was 
unable to detect her problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical malpractice lawsuit against the doctor was filed by Donaldson's 
husband, Terry, and her sons, Brent, 17, and Matthew, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-week trial was presided over by retired Judge Albert T. Blanford, a 
former Ventura County Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donaldson sobbed as the verdicts were read Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that Donaldson received negligent care from Wagner, which 
contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the jury awarded the family $1,665,616. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said the verdict included $700,000 for loss of future domestic 
services and $391,000 for loss of future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night Donaldson had the seizure, neither she nor Terry Donaldson had 
medical insurance. She had recently begun her job as a teacher at Woodland 
Village School in Agoura. Her husband had just begun a job as a clerk with a 
shipping company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were each in new positions and their insurance hadn't kicked in," 
Pagliuso said. He did not say if he thought that that contributed to the 
decision not to perform tests on Donaldson the night she had the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, a pathologist at the hospital who performed the autopsy 
ruled that Donaldson died from a blood-vessel deformity -- and not an aneurysm, 
according to Pagliuso. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury believed that the pathologist came up with a diagnosis that was off 
the wall," Pagliuso said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer urged people to demand that the county coroner's office perform 
autopsies on loved ones who die in hospitals, rather than the hospital's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ever have a relative die in a hospital, have the county coroner do the 
autopsy so that the person doing it isn't a member of the same medical staff as 
the doctor you hold accountable for the death," he said.

MANNING FINALLY EXITS, DOMINIQUE ARRIVING; PRO BASKETBALL: CLIPPERS GIVE UP 
TEAM LEADER AND TOP SCORER FOR HIGH-SCORING HAWK ALL-STAR AND CONDITIONAL NO. 
DRAFT PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks and Los Angeles Clippers traded star forwards Thursday 
night, with Dominique Wilkins and a No. 1 draft pick going to the Clippers for 
disgruntled Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was announced at the NBA trade deadline of 6 p.m. PST and ended weeks 
of discussions about where Manning would end up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been exhaustive in our efforts," Clippers Vice President Elgin Baylor 
said. "We are excited to bring such a charismatic and electrifying player to 
the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Manning and Wilkins are to become unrestricted free agents after the 
season, meaning they could sign with any NBA team with no compensation going to 
their former clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta gave Los Angeles its No. 1 pick in 1994 or 1995. Manning also was 
sought by Houston, Portland and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, 34, is a 12-year veteran and eight-time All-Star who has spent his 
whole career with Atlanta. He is ninth on the NBA's career scoring list with 
23,292 points. 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging at least 25.9 points a game over the last nine seasons and 
29.9 in 1992-93, Wilkins' average dropped to 24.4 points in 49 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 forward was one of the most flamboyant players in the league 
during the late 1980s, earning him the nickname "The Human Highlight Film." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his point production fell this season, he remained Atlanta's prime 
offensive weapon and led the team to a 36-16 record, tied for first with New 
York and Chicago for best in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He now goes to the Clippers, who are last in the Pacific Division with a 17-34 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, a versatile 6-foot-10 forward, told the Clippers he would not re-sign 
with them after his original six-year deal expired after this season. Faced 
with this, the Clippers chose to get what they could. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, 27, is having perhaps his best season, averaging 23.7 points, 7.0 
rebounds and 4.2 assists in 38 minutes a game this year.

NEW BACKUP GOALTENDER HELPS DUCKS TIE PENGUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Pittsburgh Penguins can make a goalie shake in his skates, even on a night 
when Mario Lemieux and Rick Tocchet aren't playing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still Jaromir Jagr, the hulking wing with the long black hair who 
handles the puck as if there's a magnet on his stick. There's still Ron 
Francis, Kevin Stevens, Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy and the two newest Penguins, 
ex-Kings Tomas Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks sent their new backup goalie, Mikhail Shtalenkov, into the 
fray Thursday, and he helped them leave Civic Arena with a 2-2 tie and a prized 
point in the other guys' building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game, I had a good warmup. I said to myself, 'If you want to play 
in the NHL, you must try to play good. You have a chance now,' " Shtalenkov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes into the game, he had allowed a power-play goal on a 
shot by Mullen. But Shtalenkov's resistance sharpened, and he stopped 
Pittsburgh's powerful attack the rest of the period. He turned away McEachern 
on a breakaway by stacking his pads and sliding, thwarted other Penguins with 
deft poke-checks, and finally made a fine snag to glove a hard shot by Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of faith in Mike (Shtalenkov)," Coach Ron Wilson said, even 
though Shtalenkov had played in only two NHL games, and in his last had to be 
pulled after giving up three goals on five shots in the first period of a Nov. 
17 loss to Toronto. "It was good for Mike to be able to make the saves he made 
for himself. He played well in the first period and after that they hardly had 
a sniff. They only had four shots in the third period." 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov, 28, is new to the NHL, but he is not raw. He played for Dynamo 
Moscow for six years before the Ducks drafted him in the fifth round in June, 
and has extensive international experience -- enough that Wilson ventured that 
he might be the best Russian goalie in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov had been in the minors most of the season until Sunday morning, 
when his arrival served as Ron Tugnutt's first omen that he had been traded to 
Montreal. Now Shtalenkov is Guy Hebert's backup, and the success of the trade 
that brought center Stephan Lebeau to the Ducks also depends on how well the 
goaltending holds up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a little bit nervous and that's OK," said Shtalenkov, who used to 
face Sergei Fedorov and Pavel Bure when his Dynamo team played the Central Red 
Army in the former Soviet Elite League. He also remembers playing for his 
country in a Super Series game at Civic Arena three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing against Pittsburgh and that's a big game to me. . . . I'm just 
glad today I did good," he said. "But one game is not enough. Ducks want now to 
play in playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson talked his players into stepping up their game after the first 
intermission, and with the help of a revived and more physical defense, they 
ended their four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appealed to the guys' pride and asked them what's our foundation for 
success, it's playing sound defense," Wilson said. "Our hearts were in it and 
our bodies were in it, but our minds weren't. We were mesmerized a couple of 
times by the puck, particularly with Jagr, where two or three guys went to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 McEachern's second-period goal on a long-range shot -- his second goal since 
returning to the Penguins in the trade that brought Marty McSorley back to Los 
Angeles -- made the lead 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks came back to tie the score on Tim Sweeney's power-play rebound 
at 4:50 of the second and Joe Sacco's well-executed short-handed breakaway at 
17:16 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov and Pittsburgh goalie Tom Barrasso fended off the rest of the 
scoring attempts, with Barrasso stopping 17 shots over the final 25 minutes and 
Shtalenkov called on for only five. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we got a point was because of Barrasso," Pittsburgh Coach Ed 
Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other point belongs to the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very big point for us, especially with the way we've played 
the last three or four games," Sweeney said. "It's a good confidence-builder 
for us." 
</P>

VICTORY IS VERNON'S PERSONAL CRUSADE; BASKETBALL: TITAN GUARD TAKES RIVALRY 
SERIOUSLY, SCORES 20 POINTS IN 101-95 TRIUMPH OVER IRVINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton senior guard Greg Vernon is the only player remaining from 
last season's team and maybe the only Titan who puts any special significance 
on the Fullerton-UC Irvine rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the only thing at stake during Thursday night's battle in the Bren 
Center was pride. The winner's "prize" was definitely in the booby category: 
second-to-last place in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vernon seemed energized down the stretch. He scored on a reverse layup, an 
18-foot jumper, a driving bank shot, another layup, three free throws and an 
exclamation-point dunk for the final points of the game as Fullerton (7-17 and 
5-11 in conference) hung on for a 101-95 victory in front of 1,729. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like this was a must game for us to prove to ourselves and the rest 
of the conference that we aren't a last-place team," Titan Coach Brad Holland 
said. "We've had a lot of battles with Irvine and this was another good one. I 
felt like we needed to win this one to solidify our finish and get ready for 
the conference tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon, who had four points in the first half, finished with 20 points. He has 
scored 16, 20 and 16 points in the second halves of Fullerton's last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to step up when I see that we need it, being a senior and all," 
Vernon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (6-17, 3-12) saw a nine-point first-half lead evaporate and then lost 
an 11-point advantage in the second half as the Titans erupted for 62 points 
after the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't get enough stops to make a difference," Irvine Coach Rod Baker 
said. "I mean they almost had their (scoring) average in the second half. I 
felt like we had no defensive integrity at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who have now won three seasons in a row in the Bren Center, got 
career scoring highs from Winston Peterson (26) and Josh King (20). They 
combined to make 18 of 25 shots from the floor as Fullerton shot 55% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater center DeForrest Boyer made eight of 10 field-goal attempts to score 
20 points and guard Chris Brown made nine of 15 three-pointers to score 30, but 
Irvine's lack of defense -- especially in the second half -- was disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters seemed intent on working the ball inside in the early going and 
Baker started junior Zuri Williams at point guard in favor of senior Lloyd 
Mumford, who has a habit of free-lancing out of the game plan sometimes. 
Mumford didn't enter the game until more than six minutes had elapsed, but he 
immediately scored on a driving layup -- Irvine's sixth inside shot of the 
early going -- to give the Anteaters a 17-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine put together an 8-0 run midway through the first half and led by nine 
(31-22) when Brown drilled a three-pointer. Holland, incensed because he felt 
Irvine's Joe Hannon had been in the key too long, picked up a technical foul 
with 4:18 left before the intermission. Mumford made both free throws to give 
the Anteaters a 35-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Titans, relying on the work underneath of Peterson and the outside 
shooting of freshman King, whittled away at the Irvine advantage. Peterson and 
King scored 16 of the Titans' final 19 points in the first half and Irvine led 
by only two (41-39) at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine shot 65% from the floor in the first half, but the Titans made seven of 
nine free throws to stay close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters took another tack at the outset of the second half. Brown made 
two three-pointers and Mark Odsather hit one during the first two minutes of 
play and Irvine jumped ahead, 52-41, with 18:11 to play. But the Anteaters, who 
saw most of their nine-point early first-half lead evaporate in a hurry, were 
clinging to a 57-56 margin less than three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 When Darren Little scored on a fast-break dunk with 10:47 to play, the Titans 
had their first lead (64-62) since midway through the first half.

HAUGEN BEATS GARCIA WHEN BOUT IS STOPPED IN SIXTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior welterweight Greg Haugen didn't look ready to step into the ring 
against Julio Cesar Chavez again, but he didn't look ready for the scrap heap 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugen, a former three-time world champion, pounded a stubborn Ray Garcia of 
Caldwell, Ida., for almost six rounds before referee Larry Rozadilla stopped 
the contest with 49 seconds left in the sixth Thursday night in front of 1,208 
at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugen (36-5 with 18 knockouts) fought for only the second time since being 
knocked out by Chavez 14 months ago. He weighed in Thursday morning at 151, 11 
pounds over his normal junior lightweight weight, and had to drop 1 1/2 pounds 
before the fight. Garcia, who weighed 144, fell to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to work my way back into shape and contention," Haugen said. 
"The rust is there. I can feel it. There were times I wanted to land the right 
hand, but I just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't appear Haugen's rust would matter much as he came out hitting Garcia 
with everything he threw. With a glaring look on his face, Haugen, 33, 
approached Garcia with his hands down, almost daring Garcia to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Garcia's punches began to find the range in the third 
round. Although he didn't come close to taking a round, Garcia did open a cut 
over Haugen's left eye in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's game," Haugen said. "I've never seen a Mexican fighter that quit, never. 
This is what I need, a tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the sixth, Haugen stunned Garcia with a left-right combination, 
only to have Garcia come back with a left. But seconds later, Haugen hammered 
Garcia with right hand flush on jaw. Before he could throw another punch, 
Rozadilla stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next for Haugen? 
</P>
<P>
 "A beer," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Haugen said he would like get another title fight soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking for a title shot right away," he said. "I know I have to earn 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the undercard, bantamweight Joe Manzano of San Pedro won a five-round 
unanimous decision over Manoru Fuyumura (1-2-3) of Long Beach. Heavyweight Earl 
Butler (14-3, six knockouts) of St. Martinsville, La., came back from a flash 
first-round knockdown to stop Cleo Taylor (2-3) of Long Beach at 2:14 of the 
second round. Butler, despite being outweighed by 50 pounds, dominated the 
232-pound Taylor, who wasn't defending himself when referee Burt Gilliam 
stopped the fight.

GOLF / PGA AT SAN DIEGO; NOT MANY SEE MARTIN, TOMS AND BLACK SHOOT 65 IN FIRST 
ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Perhaps half of the gallery at Torrey Pines for the first round of the Buick 
Invitational Thursday attached itself to a group that included defending 
champion Phil Mickelson, the local kid, and Payne Stewart, Mr. Knickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, noting the gathering crowd before he teed off, issued a disclaimer of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the gallery to think we're the only players in the field," he 
said. "Some of these names might not be the ones they're accustomed to seeing, 
but it doesn't mean they aren't great golfers." 
</P>
<P>
 While the multitudes were chasing Mickelson, Stewart and Keith Clearwater, the 
following occurred: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doug Martin played to virtually no gallery and shot a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 -- David Toms played to virtually no gallery and shot a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ronnie Black got the crowd's attention with a 29 on his first nine holes 
and played to a growing gallery en route to his 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the leaders after the first round. They have a total of two PGA 
Tour victories among them, both by Black -- the Southern Open in 1983 and the 
Anheuser-Busch tournament in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most celebrated threesome, Mickelson and Clearwater both shot 68, 
Stewart a 70. They were off the pace, but not far off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's "true" leader was probably the best on the tougher South Course, 
Toms, followed by Ed Dougherty, whose 66 tied him with three others for fourth 
place. The others with Dougherty at 66, all on the North Course, were Lennie 
Clements, Scott Verplank and Roger Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most spectacular round belonged to the 35-year-old Black, who had to 
scramble at the end of last year to finish 125th on the money list and gain an 
exemption for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on the North's back nine, he birdied the 10th and 11th holes but fell 
back when he missed a three-footer for par on the 13th. The best way to 
describe that start was unremarkable. Suddenly, however, Black birdied the 
15th, eagled the par-four 16th, birdied the 17th and eagled the par-five 18th. 
He picked up six strokes in four holes and finished the back nine at 29, lowest 
for that stretch in the tournament's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best shot all day was the wedge on 16," Black said. "It was my most solid 
shot. That green was really elevated, so I couldn't even see it go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, the gallery must have tipped him off? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there were five or six people up there," he said. "They clapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, Black was pleased with his score but not with his round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a round like I've never had before," he mused. "I hit two horrible tee 
balls on 10 and 11 and I'm two under. I scattered bad shots through the whole 
round. I hit lousy drives all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 While Black was shooting his 65, Martin, a 27-year-old graduate of the Nike 
Tour, was almost blase about his round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a straight-forward and basic seven-under," he said. "I was just 
trying to keep myself in the fairways and give myself a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin played in 25 tournaments in 1993, 20 on the Nike Tour and five on the 
PGA Tour. The only cut he missed was here. 
</P>
<P>
 Toms gets an opportunity to take a shot at the North Course today. He had 
seven birdies without a bogey on the South Course, where his most important 
critical shot may have been a six-foot putt to save par on No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ronnie Black, Toms he was in danger of missing the top 125 near the end 
of '93, but played in virtually every late-season event and finished 123rd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to play so I'd have a job this year," he said. "I have to believe I'm a 
better player than I've been. I have to believe I can do it."

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; CHAPMAN SMOOTHLY SHIFTS GEARS TO

 Entering the season, Chapman men's basketball Coach Mike Bokosky wasn't sure 
how his team would fare against mostly unfamiliar competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be a transitional year, the Panthers' first season away from the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. and their first without any players on 
athletic scholarship, so Bokosky set the modest goal of a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought in 11 new players -- only two remained from the team that went 7-19 
in 1992-93 -- and . . . they surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 With one game remaining -- homecoming Saturday against Dominican -- the 
Panthers are 16-8. With a victory over Dominican, the Panthers would have more 
victories than any Chapman team since the 1988-89 squad that went 17-12 and 
reached the CCAA championship game. Regardless of Saturday's result, Chapman is 
guaranteed of its best winning percentage since 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the competition isn't nearly as strong -- the CCAA is one of the 
strongest NCAA Division II conferences in the nation -- but Chapman is holding 
its own at the school's level of choice, Division III, and doing well against 
NAIA competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect us to be this good," Bokosky said. "I think we are this good 
because our players are better than I thought they'd be, in a lot of ways not 
just in terms of shooting, rebounding and skills but in terms of their 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 Four newcomers -- Stefan Mumaw (15.7 points), Greg Reynolds (12.7), Umahl 
Anderson (9.8) and Brian Wood (8.2) -- are leading the team in scoring. Cornell 
is right behind at 8.1. Anthony Gonzales (7.6) and Toby Curto (6.9), a freshman 
from Liberty Christian High, are also big contributors.

 Golden State Athletic Conference update: The Concordia men's basketball team 
stopped a five-game losing streak by beating Westmont, 89-81, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like we were going to circle the wagons and call it a year," 
Concordia Coach Greg Marshall said. "But I guess our guys decided there was a 
little life in them yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (16-13, 4-7 in GSAC) will finish the regular season today at 
Southern California College. If the Eagles win, they would probably move into a 
three-way tie for fourth place. Depending on the tie-breaker, Concordia could 
play host to a first-round playoff game March 1. A loss to the Vanguards -- and 
Concordia is 1-14 against SCC -- and the teams tie for sixth, and last, place. 
Azusa Pacific (26-3, 10-1) has clinched its second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's race, Fresno Pacific (8-1 in conference play) has wrapped up 
the title and Azusa Pacific (7-3) has clinched second. Defending champion 
Concordia (15-11, 5-4) and SCC (22-7, 5-4) will play for third today at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will get the opportunity to play host to last-place Cal Baptist in 
the first round March 2. The loser will play host to Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ila update: Ila Borders is scheduled to make her second start for the SCC 
baseball team at 2:30 p.m. today at home against Concordia. It will be the 
Vanguards' final game in the round-robin portion of the Southern California 
College tournament. The championship and consolation games will be Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz from Borders' history-making 12-1 victory over Claremont-Mudd has not 
died down. SCC Coach Charlie Phillips said the New York Times and New York 
Daily News are planning stories and Japanese media outlets are also making 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going all over the world," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders has also agreed to throw out the ceremonial first pitch before the 
April 3 Freeway Series game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Don't have a . . . Lisa Simpson, who plays third base for the Chapman softball 
team, started the season slowly, going 1 for 10 in the Panthers' first six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit was a home run. Since the poor start, Simpson is 5 for 8 with a home 
run and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 As befitting a power hitter, Simpson also has struck out a team-high nine 
times and now has a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Said assistant coach Janet Lloyd: "I said, 'Oh my, Homer Simpson's here,' and 
it just kind of stuck."

<P>
 Four of the nation's top college baseball players and two of the nation's top 
teams will be featured in this weekend's Anaheim Hilton & Towers tournament, 
which begins today at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, ranked third by Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball Magazine 
and second by USA Today, will face San Diego at 3 p.m. today.Georgia Tech, 
ranked No. 1 by Baseball America and USA Today and No. 2 by Collegiate 
Baseball, will play Oklahoma at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (8-3) plays Georgia Tech (5-0) at 2 p.m. and Fullerton (12-2) plays 
Oklahoma (5-0) at 6 p.m. Saturday, and San Diego plays Oklahoma at noon Sunday. 
Georgia Tech will face Fullerton in the tournament's featured game at 4 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets have three players who were rated among the nation's top-25 
college prospects by Baseball America: catcher Jason Varitek (No. 5), shortstop 
Nomar Garciaparra (No. 8) and pitcher Brad Rigby (No. 16). Titan center fielder 
Dante Powell was rated the 11th-best college player in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Varitek, a starter on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team and a first-round pick (21st 
overall) of the Minnesota Twins last June, is batting .611 with a home run and 
seven runs batted in. Garciaparra, a former La Puente Bishop Amat High standout 
who also started on the 1992 Olympic team, is batting .524 with two triples and 
four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigby is 2-0 with an 0.69 earned-run average but is tentatively scheduled to 
pitch against Oklahoma, not Fullerton. Powell is batting .299 with four homers 
and 16 RBIs. Oklahoma, ranked 22nd by USA Today and coached by former Fullerton 
Coach Larry Cochell, is led by junior shortstop Rich Hills, a former Esperanza 
High standout. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

BOYS' TENNIS / 1994 PREVIEW; SIX TEAMS TO WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: John Stephens (sixth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 14-8, 7-3 in the South Coast League; lost to University in the second 
round of Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: David Bailey, Jr., could play No. 2 or 3 singles or No. 1 
doubles; Mike Baxi, Jr., could play singles or No. 1 or No. 2 doubles; Carlos 
Betancourt, Jr., will play No. 2 or No. 3 doubles; Hanley Ernst, Jr., 
ineligible last year, will play doubles this year; Erik Lundblad, Jr., should 
play No. 1 or No. 2 singles; Justin Rimel, Jr., will play doubles; Christian 
Spaulding, Sr., will play singles or No. 1 or No. 2 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Brandon Fallon, Fr., ranked 15th in Southern California 14s, 
could battle Lundblad for No. 1 singles spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Stephens' lineup is fairly uncertain heading into the season. But the 
upside is that his team is blessed with plenty of talent. Stephens is 
especially excited about Fallon. "He's coming in with the most talent as a 
freshman that I've had in a number of years," Stephens said. It shouldn't take 
Stephens long to find out about his team. University, Corona del Mar, Newport 
Harbor, Woodbridge and Punahou (top-ranked Hawaiian team) are on the nonleague 
schedule.

 Woodbridge 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: Joan Willett (eighth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 14-5, 10-4 in the Sea View League; lost to Division I finalist Palos 
Verdes Peninsula in Southern Section quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Jonathan Blum, Sr., will play No. 1 doubles; Adam Call, Sr., 
will battle for No. 1 singles spot; Henry Chiang, Jr., will play No. 1 or No. 2 
doubles; Yoshi Suzuki, Jr., will play singles; A.J. Thoryk, Sr., will play No. 
1 or No. 2 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: John Biorkman, Fr., ranked in top 50 in Southern California 
14s, could play singles or doubles; Reza Farokhpay, Fr., will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The new CIF rule that puts more emphasis on doubles sets than singles 
(12 points to 9) should help Woodbridge, which, like last year, is long on 
depth and short on superstars. "I don't have any top-ranked players in Southern 
Cal, but again, I've got three solid singles players and Jonathan (Blum) is 
solid in doubles," Willett said. "(The new rule) changes things. I didn't even 
know about it. It will be a big advantage for the teams that have depth, and 
that is our strength."

 Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: Tim Mang (second year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 22-2, 14-0 in the Sea View League, lost in Division I semifinals to 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Paul Fruchbom, Sr., will play No. 1 doubles; Doug Smith, Sr., 
will play doubles; Jed Weinstein, Sr., will play No. 1 or No. 2 singles, 
advanced to individual doubles semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Greg Coleman, Fr., will play doubles; Mike Feyka, Jr., will 
play No. 2 doubles with Raj Shukla, So.; Tyler Stonebreaker, So., a transfer 
from Mater Dei, will play No. 1 or No. 2 singles; Roberto Intriago, Sr., 
Ecuador; had been nationally ranked in Ecuador before he stopped playing for 
three years, will probably play doubles; James Stauffer, Fr., will play No. 3 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Sea Kings lost nearly everyone from last year, but Mang always 
seems to come up with a few surprise additions every season. This year, he 
found Intriago and Stonebreaker on his door step. "Nothing's going to be better 
than the two doubles teams I had last year, but I'm looking for Jed and Tyler 
to replace Trenton (Rhodes) and Bryan (Walden) at singles," he said.

 Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: Dennis Claus (third year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 13-8, 8-2 in the Century League; lost in the first round of Southern 
Section Division I playoffs to Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Rob Claus, Jr., will play No. 2 doubles or No. 3 singles; Nate 
Griset, Sr., will play No. 1 or No. 2 doubles; Jack Huang, Sr., will play No. 2 
singles; Thomas Lin, Jr., will play No. 1 or 2 doubles, was co-team MVP with 
Huang; Mike Penn, Sr., will play No. 1 or No. 2 doubles; Lance Stern, Jr., will 
probably play No. 3 singles; Ryan Thompson, Jr., will play No. 1 singles, 
ranked nationally in doubles and top 15 in Southern California 16s singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: John Yeh, Jr., will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Foothill returns everyone from a team that tied for the Century 
League title. Thompson, who was injured during the playoffs, had an excellent 
summer and should be one of the county's top players. But doubles might 
actually be Foothill's strength. "Our doubles carried us last year and I expect 
them to be pretty strong this year," Claus said. "I expect to win league. But 
after that, I don't know. It's amazing how many good teams there are in Orange 
County now."

 Sunny Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: Steve White (24th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 22-0, 10-0 in the Freeway League; won Southern Section Division II 
title, losing only one set in the first three rounds before beating North 
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, 11-7, in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Hiran Bhavsar, Sr., will play with Joey Springer, Sr., at No. 1 
doubles; Joseph Gilbert, So., No. 4-ranked 16-year old in Southland will play 
No. 2 singles; Jeff Hartel, Jr., will play No. 2 doubles; Kevin Kim, So., No. 
1-ranked 16-year-old in Southern California, will play No. 1 singles; Juno 
Kwan, Sr., will play singles or doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: John Han, So., a transfer from the Huntington Beach area, 
ranked 18th in Southern California boys' 16 will probably play No. 3 singles; 
Shawn Harris, So., will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: White said he'll miss the leadership of Dave Robbins and Jason 
Nevadomsky, but you probably won't find many coaches feeling sorry for him. 
Kim, Gilbert and Han match up against any team in the Southern Section -- even 
Diamond Bar, Newport Harbor and Peninsula, who coincidentally play the Lancers 
early.

<P>
 Coach: Josh Davis (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: 19-4, 12-2 in the Sea View League, lost in Southern Section Division I 
semifinals to eventual champion Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: David Chang, Jr., will play No. 1 or No. 2 doubles; Raja 
Kapadia, Jr., will battle Chang for No. 3 singles spot; Jason Meyers, Sr., lost 
in third round of Southern Section Individuals, has already signed to play 
tennis at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; Seth Turbow, Sr., will play No. 1 doubles; 
Robert Wilkins, Sr., will play behind Meyers at No. 2 singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Felix Ling, So., will battle for No. 3 singles and play 
doubles; Chris Seid, So., should play doubles and singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Meyers, one of the county's best players, and Wilkins give Davis a 
solid one-two punch at singles, but strength at doubles will depend on how well 
junior varsity players such as Ling and Seid perform on the varsity level. "My 
team is an unknown quantity because I have so many young kids," Davis said. "We 
need the young kids to step up. We'll definitely fight for the league title, 
and how well we do (in the playoffs) depends on how fast we mature."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II GIRLS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; EL MODENA DOMINATES GAME, 
BUT ESPERANZA TRIUMPHS, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Modena Coach Tino Ray Younger stood near midfield consoling one player 
after another, perplexed at how his team could dominate a game and still lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't meant to be," he said several times. 
</P>
<P>
 A season during which El Modena won its first league title in girls' soccer 
ended Thursday when Esperanza defeated the Vanguards, 1-0, in a Southern 
Section Division II quarterfinal game at El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (18-5-4) will meet Ventura Buena in the semifinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been indicative of our youth to go into peaks and valleys," Younger 
said. "And today we were in a valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Vanguards (20-6) pressured the Aztecs' goal, but it was 
Esperanza's last line of defense that turned away each El Modena attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior fullbacks Joy Lindsay and Brooke Atwell threw aside finesse and boomed 
the ball each time it trickled their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had trouble with teams that play kickball, all season," Younger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza scored 16 minutes into the game, when Jenny Parkison muscled her way 
inside the penalty box and centered the ball to teammate Tina Brescini. 
</P>
<P>
 Brescini threw her body at the ball in traffic and got enough to get it by 
goalkeeper Amy Moreno. It was Brescini's fourth goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the first goal was the key," Esperanza Coach Phyllis Scarborough 
said. "After the first 20 minutes of the second half, they began to press." 
</P>
<P>
 However, El Modena had two golden opportunities to score in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came when Kaylee Whitfield's shot hit the bottom of the crossbar and 
the rebound caromed too high for a charging Stephanie Esparza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vanguards' best chance came with 10 minutes left, when an El Modena 
free kick got behind Aztec goalkeeper Suzanne Benet. Several players scrambled 
after the ball, but Esperanza cleared it safely. DAN ARRITT

DIVISION I GIRLS' SOCCER; MATER DEI CAPITALIZES ON ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEATHER STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judgmental and tactical errors by Edison helped give Mater Dei a 2-0 victory 
over the Chargers in a Southern Section Division I girls' soccer quarterfinal 
Thursday at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 With the sun in their eyes and the wind in their faces for the first half, the 
Chargers dribbled the ball when they should have cleared it, turned their backs 
on balls that needed to be headed and seemed to be waiting for someone to step 
in and take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison missed nine shots that were one-on-one situations with goalkeeper 
Amanda Fox or facing an open net. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's two goals were scored by sophomore forward Trisha Steiner. Four 
minutes into the game, defender Corinne Di Luigi's kick bounced off goalkeeper 
Jocelyn Polen's fingertips, and Steiner made the ball go in more quickly with a 
tap. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 minutes left in the half, Steiner took a long pass from Chrissy Whalen 
and curved the ball just out of Polen's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (22-5-3) took 14 second-half shots on Fox, but could not find the 
goal. They kicked the ball behind, over and around the net, and headed the ball 
over the goal four times. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mater Dei's field, which some call the "cow pasture," was no help. It is 
lumpy, bumpy, uneven and patchy. But the Monarchs (20-5-1) like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost one game in the last two years on our home field," Monarch Coach 
Michelle Myers said. "We knew if we got (Edison) here we could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Coach Kerry McGrath was frustrated. "We figured the field would play a 
big part -- we're a big passing team, but this field really (stinks). 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get our passing game down -- not for lack of trying, but you 
can't do it if the ball won't stay on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei faces Marina on Tuesday in a semifinal. Myers said the team's job 
will not be easy. "We're going to have to mark their big guns, but like Edison, 
they have a lot of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 But the field, which will be determined by coin flip, will not be a problem, 
at least for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be interesting to see where we play, but we like their field," Myers 
said. "It's short, like ours, and a short field is more to our style." HEATHER

DIVISION I BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; SANTA MONICA WINS IN OVERTIME AFTER EDISON 
GOALS DISALLOWED 
</P>

<P>
 The Edison boys' soccer season ended Thursday in a 1-0 overtime loss to Santa 
Monica in a Southern Section Division I quarterfinal. But it did not end 
without plenty of controversy and bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica forward Saif Mansour scored the game-winning goal with three 
minutes left in the second 10-minute overtime period, but no one on Edison's 
side wanted to talk about that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about the two goals the ref took away," Edison Coach Mike 
DiGiovanni said. "I'm thinking about how we dominate the game and lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (20-6-1) outshot Santa Monica, 22-8, but the Chargers lost when 
referees' whistles blew away their hopes of advancing to Tuesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The first apparent goal came in the second half when Brett Jorgenson headed in 
a corner kick, but it was nullified when the referee ruled that Santa Monica 
goalkeeper Ovidio Martinez was interfered with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first one was a 50-50 call," DiGiovanni said. "The second one, I had no 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Edison's Jay Anderson, who was called for a foul as he was heading 
the ball to Jorgenson, who subsequently headed the ball past Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I pushed off, I guess," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jorgenson: "The refs just took it away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 DiGiovanni said he couldn't understand why Martinez was so heavily protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time the keeper came out for the ball, (the referee) blew the whistle," 
DiGiovanni said. "We should have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After crawling into the playoffs as the third-place team in the Sunset League, 
Edison routed Redondo Beach Redondo Union, 8-1, upset top-seeded Simi Valley 
Royal, 1-0, and outplayed Santa Monica for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disappointing," DiGiovanni said. "We took our knocks in league, in 
a tough league, and we were really playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration of losing and the game's physical play almost resulted in a 
scuffle after the game. As the two teams shook hands, several players pushed 
each other before the referees stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of trash talking out there," DiGiovanni said. "Our guys are 
no saints, but they should have just taken the win and walked away. What they 
did afterward was classless." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica (14-5-1) will play Claremont in Tuesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I game: 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont 3, Marina 2 (OT) -- The loss ended the season for Marina (17-6-1), 
the fourth-seeded team in the bracket.

DIVISION I WRESTLING DUAL MEET CHAMPIONSHIPS; MOMENTUM HELPS EL MODENA TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 El Modena won the Southern Section Division I dual meet wrestling title, 
defeating Ventura, 36-20, Thursday night at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Section champions Teak Sato (130) and Juan Alvarez (135) of El Modena 
dominated their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato (43-1) had eight takedowns over Jesus Solis before gaining a technical 
fall eight seconds into the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I just get into a rhythm and feel like I can take my opponent down 
no matter what," Sato said. "Tonight I felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez scored the first pin of the night by defeating Justin Boynton at 3 
minutes 37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with El Modena's Milo Ventimiglia's 17-8 decision over David Johnson 
at 112-pounds, the Vanguards took an early 7-0 lead and controlled the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our win at 112 was a huge boost for us," El Modena Coach Alan Clinton said. 
"We'd expected to give something up early." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Coach Paul Clementi held out Ryan Atherton, the runner-up in last 
weekend's Southern Section individual championships at 103 pounds. He suffered 
an upper body injury and is questionable for Saturday's Southern Section 
Masters meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In his place, sophomore Ricardo Cardona wrestled. Cardona was 26-1 going into 
the meet, but all his matches were at the junior varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardona stayed with Bao Nguyen, leading, 5-3, after two periods before being 
out-pointed, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (18-2) made a brief comeback with a strong performance by Nate Tafoya 
at 119. Tafoya beat Josh Wagner, 15-2, to give Ventura its first team points. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's Colin Burns defeated Ventura's Chris Advani, 4-0, at 125 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, desperate for points, moved Chris Karlowsky, a Masters qualifier, 
up from 140 pounds to 145 to avoid former section champion David Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy backfired when Wells (45-5) pinned replacement Bryan Doss at 
3:11, and Karlowsky was outpointed, 6-1, by Chris Jaime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any one weight mattered," Karlowsky said. "We just didn't 
wrestle well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Cougars heaviest wrestlers performed well. Jason Sims (27-8) 
broke El Modena's six-match streak at 160 pounds with an 11-3 victory over Matt 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 At 189 pounds, Ryan Burdick (33-9) recorded Ventura's first pin, defeating 
Zane Koss in 52 seconds. Heavyweight Sean Burdick pinned Dan Kingman in 3:37.

DIVISION III WRESTLING DUAL MEET CHAMPIONSHIPS; CALVARY CHAPEL ROUTS LUCKLESS 
LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When going head-to-head with a team of this caliber, you welcome any advantage 
that comes your way. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Laguna Hills, the breaks were going in the opposite 
direction when the Hawks met Calvary Chapel for the Southern Section Division 
III dual-meet wrestling championship Thursday night at Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 When twins Jeff and Mike Greco and Orlando Rangel caught the flu earlier in 
the week, a most difficult task took on impossible proportions for Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been a real good week," Hawk Coach Cliff Jarmie said. 
</P>
<P>
 It got tougher. Defending State champion Calvary Chapel did a number on the 
Hawks with a resounding 42-16 victory. The Eagles, who have qualified eight 
wrestlers for Saturday's Masters meet and hope all eight advance to the State 
meet March 4-5, won 10 of 13 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' forfeited at 103 pounds, giving Laguna Hills a 6-0 lead before 
Calvary Chapel ran off with the next 10 victories and a 42-6 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those matches, the closest was at 140, where section individual runner-up 
Danny Robinson took a 5-3 overtime victory over Casey Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott took a 3-2 lead in the third period before Robinson tied it with a 
late escape. Elliott tried a single-leg takedown, but ran out of time, and 
Robinson got the takedown in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to take this (victory) into Masters, then hopefully to State," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills partially redeemed itself in the final two classes, where Jack 
Fearing (189) pinned Mike Pawasarat at 1 minute 16 seconds, and Masters 
qualifier Mark Zolikoff (heavyweight) won an 11-0 decision over Paul Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said don't worry about the score, just focus on what you have to do," 
Fearing said. "It's a thrill to win my last match as a senior." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarmie believes Calvary Chapel is destined to win its second consecutive State 
championship and said the Hawks' could learn from the Eagles' pluck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calvary Chapel gets to this point and their season is just beginning," Jarmie 
said. "We need to take a lesson from them in finishing, that when you get to 
this point, you don't whine about the long season or having to cut weight one 
more week." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Eagles' chances at the State meet? 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt (they'll win) unless there's some kind of accident," he said. "They 
won last year, they have everyone back and they're that much better."

DIVISION III BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; BREA-OLINDA ADVANCES BY BEATING POMONA GAREY 
IN OVERTIME

<P>
 Fourth-seeded Brea-Olinda controlled the ball against Pomona Garey in the 
Southern Section Division III boys' soccer quarterfinals, but had to go to 
overtime to win, 3-2, Thursday at Brea-Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda will meet Burbank Burroughs in the semifinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (19-4-2), who shut out their first two playoff opponents, outshot 
the Vikings, 10-2, in the first half, but trailed, 1-0, at halftime on a goal 
by Alberto Contreras 23 minutes into the game. Contreras came up with a loose 
ball after a throw-in and from five yards, kicked it just beyond the reach of 
goalkeeper Justin Breazeale. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first half, first-year Coach Matt Swindle told his team he wanted 
stronger shots at the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Garey's) defense is suspect, put the pressure on," Swindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute into the second half, Ozzy Sanchez got a header to bounce off a 
defenseman and into the Vikings' goal to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The game got physical after that. Garey (17-5-4) had two players ejected on 
red cards and three others received yellow-card warnings. Brea-Olinda was cited 
with one red card and three yellows. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very physical game," Swindle said. "We just wanted to get in and 
out with the win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats had three opportunities to put the game away with less than five 
minutes remaining, but the shots went wide left, wide right and over the top. 
Regulation ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes into overtime, Brea-Olinda's offense finally got some breaks 
when Brian Yezarsky recovered a throw-in from the corner and drilled the ball 
into the right corner out of the reach of Osvaldo Guzman. The Wildcats led, 
3-1, one minute later when Andy Wirz passed to Todd Deck, who squeezed it past 
a diving Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings made it interesting in the final two minutes, when a shot by 
Francisco Perez from 40 yards sailed over Breazeale. MELANIE NEFF

OPERA REVIEW; AN EARTHBOUND 'BUTTERFLY'; RUSSIAN DIVA BRINGS MORE FLAP THAN 
FLUTTER TO PUCCINI TEAR-JERKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If all had gone as planned, the picturesque production of "Madama Butterfly" 
that opened Wednesday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion would have looked 
and sounded pretty much like the version first presented by the Music Center 
Opera in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Judge's staging scheme, a streamlined if essentially conservative 
perspective of Puccini's immortal tear-jerker, was to be revived, after a 
fashion, within John Gunter's faintly stylized, crimson-framed set. 
</P>
<P>
 This, you may recall, is the "Butterfly" in which the let's-pretend natives of 
turn-of-the-century Nagasaki are allowed hardly any rituals of japonaiserie as 
they go about their quaint business on a distant ramp and precariously tilted 
terrace atop the exotic sand dunes of Laurel Canyon. The central image, not 
incidentally, leaves the local viewer worrying as much about mud slides as 
about tragic sacrifice in the culture clash between innocent East and wicked 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, this "Butterfly" was created as an anti-type casting 
vehicle for Maria Ewing, who played the title role as if she were constantly 
teetering on the brink of dazed dementia. Ever original, sometimes eccentric 
and deliciously unpredictable, Ewing was supposed to return to the heroine's 
many agonies and few ecstasies on this occasion. She withdrew, however, when 
more pressing duties called her elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In her place, the management drafted Galina Gorchakova, leading soprano of the 
beleaguered Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg. All Butterflies, she emphatically 
proved, are not created equal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the libretto, Cio-Cio-San is a fragile teen-ager -- intrinsically 
delicate, instantly adorable, automatically pathetic and ultimately heroic. 
According to Gorchakova, she is heroic. Period. The sound at her command is 
dark yet steely, and sometimes edgy. The top notes cause her no problems, 
though it should be noted that she chose Puccini's lower option at what would 
have been the crest of the entrance aria. (Through an interpreter, she had 
promised a high D-flat in a Times interview; perhaps something got lost in 
translation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchakova tries, occasionally, to sing softly. She is most imposing, however, 
when she can open up, and she rises with ease to the rigors of renunciation in 
the final scene. As an actress, she settles for textual generalities and goes 
conscientiously through the basic motions dictated by tradition. Diva to the 
end, she remains bigger than life. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, poor Butterfly should be smaller. For optimum impact, the 
soprano attempting this grateful challenge must caress the line with tenderness 
and shade it with sensuality. She must convey passion as well as trepidation, 
fear as well as faith. She doesn't have to be vulnerable, but she must seem 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The illusion isn't a matter of physical size. It is a matter of focus. We have 
seen some convincing Cio-Cio-Sans in the past who tended toward the hefty -- 
Victoria de los Angeles, Renata Tebaldi and Antonietta Stella spring to mind. 
Nor should one pretend that an idiomatic Butterfly cannot emanate from Russia. 
The feverish Galina Vishnevskaya certainly made her mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchakova is a formidable presence. She knows how to command center-stage. 
Tough and cool, she makes a mighty noise. It would be interesting to see her in 
the Slavic repertory. She might be terrific as the glacial Princess Turandot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the verismo geisha is another matter. A Butterfly who would rather flap 
than flutter is a Butterfly in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Music Center authorities surrounded their heavyweight 
protagonist with a lightweight cast. This was the sort of lineup we used to 
expect from the New York City Opera -- which did not charge $105 for a good 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An obscure but promising American tenor named Marcus Haddock introduced an 
impetuous, handsome, properly caddish Pinkerton equipped with a slim figure and 
voice to match. One hopes he resists the temptation to force for impact. 
</P>
<P>
 John Atkins, definitely a junior-diplomat Sharpless, repeated the 
sympathetically nerdy and nervous portrait admired here in '91. Paula Rasmussen 
graduated with honor from the minor duties of Kate Pinkerton to the slightly 
less minor duties of Suzuki, now the heroine's hara-kiri accomplice as well as 
faithful servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallory Walker was the restrained, well-sung Goro, Michael Gallup the 
huffy-and-puffy Bonze. The others tended to fade into the canvas woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Harlan, the director-on-duty, did what he could to press the 
action forward on Gunter's awkward set, and he motivated the movement deftly. 
Too bad he couldn't have spared us the Grand Guignol theatrics inherited from 
Ian Judge in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Behr, maestro for all seasons if not all reasons at the Music Center 
Opera, conducted like a man in a hurry. The singers and the expanded Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra often kept pace with him. Loudness, in any case, 
triumphed over finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 This, not incidentally, was the third time the Music Center has staged 
"Butterfly" since 1986. The company has mustered two different "Boheme" 
productions, and "Tosca" on two occasions (three if we include a Berlin 
import). "Turandot" was seen during the Olympic Arts Festival, and "Fanciulla 
del West" turned up in 1991. So much for Puccini. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, we have had one -- repeat, one -- Wagner production. That was a 
"Tristan" seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Balance, anyone?

MOVIE REVIEW; KING OF 'SUGAR HILL': ACTING OR VIOLENCE?; THE DRAMA SET IN 
HARLEM ABOUT A DRUG LORD WHO WANTS OUT HAS A STRONG CAST, BUT ITS SENSITIVE 
SCENES ARE LOST IN THE BLOODSHED.

 Though Roemello Skuggs (Wesley Snipes) "serves up more heroin in Harlem than 
McDonald's does hamburgers," don't think he's a typical urban drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smart enough to have been offered a full academic scholarship to Georgetown 
(he didn't go, but that's another story), Roemello is an introspective kind of 
guy who reads the New York Times, plays a fine game of chess and has an eye for 
art and design. A drug lord who wants out and the hero of "Sugar Hill" 
(citywide), he is presented as the exemplar of a lost generation, an individual 
who could have made something of his life if he hadn't been trapped by the 
familiar socio-economic dynamics of the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet watching "Sugar Hill" does not particularly arouse concern for Roemello, 
whose weary desire to quit his infernal business parallels the action in 
"Carlito's Way" and innumerable other genre vehicles. Rather it is the gifted 
personnel who made this film who seem more trapped than anyone they portray on 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For until it sinks under the weight of excessive violence and a welter of 
overwrought plot contrivances, "Sugar Hill," named for a once-vibrant Harlem 
neighborhood, has much going for it. Writer Barry Michael Cooper ("New Jack 
City") and Cuban-born director Leon Ichaso ("Crossover Dreams") know how to 
make this kind of material watchable and they've also managed to sprinkle 
thoughtful moments amid the general bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 These scenes showcase the acting styles of a cast that is deep in ability. 
Snipes' authoritative performance is no surprise; his status as a preeminent 
screen actor grows with every picture. But at various moments "Sugar Hill" also 
gets fine work from Michael Wright as Raynathan, the hot-headed brother; from 
Theresa Randall as Melissa, the straight girlfriend; from Clarence Williams 
III, ex of "The Mod Squad," as the addicted father, and a number of other 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 But if African American actors can claim a talent pool that is as impressive 
in its own way as Britain's, why do they invariably have to perform in a 
repetitive cycle of exploitative dramas about drugs in the cities and crime in 
the streets? It's as pointless and exasperating as if Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony 
Hopkins, Emma Thompson and all the lesser Brits had to make film after film 
about Robin Hood and his Merry Men in order to get any time on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 And whenever the "Sugar Hill" filmmakers do manage to shoehorn in a sensitive, 
affecting scene, like Roemello feeding noodles to his ailing father, it is 
doubly frustrating to find it in a film whose off-putting violence will place 
it out of bounds to many serious filmgoers. What a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 With its jazzy score and discreetly muted color cinematography (by Bojan 
Bazelli, who did fine work on Abel Ferrara's "Body Snatchers"), "Sugar Hill" 
certainly makes an attempt to be taken seriously. But the careful line it walks 
between the epic-heroic and the pretentious blurs as its story unfolds, and 
finally its flimsy narrative can't support the serious notions everyone wants 
to hang on it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is typical of "Sugar Hill's" style that it opens with Roemello enmeshed in 
one of his bouts of high-flown introspection while simultaneously reliving, in 
wrenching flashback, the scene of his mother dying of an overdose. "Dear 
mother, it seems like an eternity since you've been gone, so much has happened, 
so many dreams have turned into nightmares," he muses in voice-over. "The boy 
you love has become the man you feared." 
</P>
<P>
 In plainer English, that means that Roemello and his brother now traffic in 
the substances that ruined both his parents' lives, even working with Gus (Abe 
Vigoda), the very mob figure who destroyed his family. No wonder he's having 
second thoughts about his career choice. 
</P>
<P>
 More than psychological factors, however, cause Roemello to wonder if he's 
doing the right thing. The mob is bringing in Lolly ("The Hand That Rocked the 
Cradle's" Ernie Hudson), a dealer from Brooklyn who specializes in crack 
cocaine, to share the neighborhood trade, and Roemello has met Melissa, an 
aspiring actress who might be the best reason of all to pack up and get away. 
</P>
<P>
 This story line is terribly familiar, but that doesn't mean it can't be 
energized, and for a while director Ichaso and company do an effective job of 
alternating flash with the film's more deliberate moments. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally Roemello talks once too often of being "consumed by chaos, guilt, 
grief," and the intensity of the violence becomes such that anyone intrigued by 
the film's softer moments will tune out. Wading through blood is too much of a 
price to pay for "Sugar Hill's" pluses, and it's a shame the movie business has 
made it difficult for them to be experienced any other way.

 Pasadena Theater College Revived: Theatre Corp. of America, which operates the 
Pasadena Playhouse, is reviving the playhouse's former training wing in 
conjunction with the Musical Theatre Works Conservatory of New York. A 
bi-coastal College of Theatre Arts will open next fall, at both the playhouse 
and the conservatory. Theatre Corp. will manage the new academy, and it will be 
headed by Anthony Stimac, the conservatory's founder. The conservatory is 
affiliated with Musical Theatre Works, which produces readings and workshop 
productions of new shows in Manhattan. Classes are expected to begin in 
September, with an eventual goal of as many as 200 students on each campus, 
working in a two-year training program. TELEVISION

 Return Set: "Cagney & Lacey," the critically acclaimed cop show that won 14 
Emmys during its run on CBS from 1982-88, is returning to the airwaves. 
Producer Barney Rosenzweig and Orion Pictures Corp., which syndicated the 
series after its CBS run, will begin production in April on the first of 
several planned two-hour movies. Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly will reprise their 
roles as New York policewomen Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey, with the 
first installment picking up several years later with the two women meeting 
again at a reunion of their old 14th Precinct. John Karlen is expected to 
return in his Emmy Award-winning role of Mary Beth's husband, Harvey, and 
conversations are currently underway with other original cast members. Terry 
Louise Fisher and Steve Brown, who wrote many of the series' original 127 
episodes, will write the first movie. Rosenzweig is planning the movies for a 
network run, although no deals are set.

 * Roseanne Speaks Again: Roseanne Arnold took a few more bites of the hands 
that feed her during her appearance Thursday on NBC's "The Tonight Show." 
Arnold told host Jay Leno that she had not signed a new agreement with ABC or 
the show's producers, the Carsey-Werner Co., for the renewal of her top-rated 
"Roseanne" series for three more seasons, despite an announcement last week by 
ABC and Carsey-Werner. "I'm still on the market," she said. When Leno asked her 
if she would stay with ABC, Arnold replied, "Oh, I hope not," adding that CBS 
Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer was sending her gifts and wooing her 
professionally. Carsey-Werner officials responded Thursday that the deal "was 
closed." ABC had no comment.

 * Jacksons Barely Dent Olympics Ratings: NBC's broadcast of the "Jackson 
Family Honors" Tuesday night suffered the same Nielsen fate as other programs 
attempting to compete against CBS' Olympics coverage these last two weeks. From 
9 to 11 p.m., when the "Jackson Family Honors" aired, the Olympics claimed more 
than 37% of the TV viewing audience (an estimated 23.9 million homes), compared 
to the Jackson's 17% (about 10.7 million homes). The Jacksons did a bit better, 
however, than NBC did all of last week when it averaged only 14% of the 
audience to CBS' 40%.

 * Rush Watch: Although he was the inspiration for "Monty," Rush Limbaugh shed 
no tears Thursday for the Fox sitcom, which was canceled the day before. He 
told listeners that the 6-week-old series, which starred Henry Winkler as a 
conservative talk-show host, could have been successful had the producers 
accurately reflected conservative viewpoints instead of making fun of them. 
Limbaugh is in Los Angeles to make a guest appearance as himself on CBS' 
"Hearts Afire," for broadcast later this spring. He's also due to visit "The 
Tonight Show" tonight. MOVIES

 'For the Boys' Suit Dropped: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Wednesday 
dismissed a breach of contract lawsuit filed by comedian Martha Raye against 
Bette Midler, 20th Century Fox, director Mark Rydell and others involving the 
film "For the Boys." Raye had claimed the film was based on a screen treatment 
of her own life story that she co-wrote and offered to Midler for $1 million. 
But at the end of the plaintiff's presentation of its case, Superior Court 
Judge Jerry Fields granted the defendants' motion for "nonsuit," ruling that 
Raye's attorneys had failed to show similarities between the film and Raye's 
life story. After the dismissal, Midler, who had testified in the trial last 
week, said she was "delighted" that "this frivolous lawsuit" was over, but also 
"extremely angry at the tremendous waste of time and taxpayers' money resulting 
from this baseless action." Raye, who was recently hospitalized for pneumonia, 
did not attend any portion of the trial. QUICK TAKES

 Michael Moriarty, who recently left his starring role on TV's "Law and Order,"

Famed opera star Kathleen Battle, recently fired from the Metropolitan Opera 
for her "unprofessional actions" offstage, performs with Grammy-winning jazz 
singer Al Jarreau on tonight's "ABC in Concert." The duo will sing the Broadway 
classic "My Favorite Things" from "The Sound of Music". . . . Singer, 
songwriter and producer Curtis Mayfield will be honored as "a musical standard 
bearer for the civil rights movement" whose "creative genius and business 
acumen set numerous precedents within the recording industry" when he receives 
a Grammy Legend Award at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards on CBS Tuesday. Among 
those paying homage to Mayfield will be B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt and Bruce

MOVIE REVIEW; AN ACTION-PACKED 'CRIME STORY'; MARTIAL ARTS SUPERSTAR JACKIE 
CHAN CUTS THE CLOWNING WHEN HE SETS OUT TO RESCUE A KIDNAPED HONG KONG TYCOON.

<P>
 "Crime Story" (at the Monica 4-Plex), which is as fast and furious as action 
pictures get, provides a shrewd change of pace for martial arts superstar 
Jackie Chan. As skilled at comedy as he is at kung fu, Chan this time plays it 
straight as an inspector in the Royal Hong Kong Police. His seriousness proves 
to be an effective foil to this exceedingly sleek movie's spectacular stunt 
work and its visual panache. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by a 1991 incident, the film gets under way when a real estate tycoon 
(Law Ka-Ying), a past kidnap victim, senses that history is about to repeat 
itself. Sure enough, Law and his wife (Au Yeung Pui-Shan) are nabbed as they're 
driving on Hong Kong's convoluted Peak Road; it's the first of the film's many 
action set-pieces. Soon released, Law's wife receives a ransom demand of $60 
million for her husband's return. Chan is assigned to the case, partnered with 
a portly veteran cop (capable Kent Cheng). 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kirk Wong (plus an uncredited Chan) and a raft of writers and 
cameramen, plus crack editor Peter Cheung, combine all the details of an astute 
police procedural with one exciting sequence after another. There are chases 
galore, including one over Taipei roof tops and the rafters of a burlesque 
theater interspersed with contrasting images of Hong Kong's skyscraper canyons 
and congested back alleys. There's a terrific episode aboard a flooded ship, a 
classic rescue of a child from a burning tenement and a climactic scene set in 
a 7-Eleven on busy Waterloo Road. Movies don't get much more kinetic than 
"Crime Story," which is fun all the way.

MOVIE REVIEW; '8 SECONDS': THIS TRUE RODEO STORY LACKS TRUE GRIT; 'ROCKY' 
DIRECTOR JOHN AVILDSEN BRINGS TO THE SCREEN THE LIFE OF CHAMPION BULL-RIDER 
LANE FROST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If only the filmmakers responsible for "8 Seconds" (general release) were half 
as good at riding the bull as their rodeo hero Lane Frost. It's an 
inspirational bio-pic without a trace of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost -- played here by Luke Perry -- was the youngest world champion 
bull-rider ever, before he died in a rodeo accident in 1989. (The end credits 
feature clips from his career.) He had worked his way up the small-town 
circuits, married a stand-by-your-man sweetheart, Kellie Kyle (Cynthia Geary), 
endured an on-the-road life of cheap-jack motels and finally made it to the top 
at the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost must have been a cracker-jack character, but the movie turns him into a 
cardboard good guy. He's squeaky clean even when he's straying with a groupie 
or having a honky-tonk snit. The hellbent passion that would keep a man 
retrofitted atop a bounding 2,000-pound bull for the competitive minimum of at 
least eight very long seconds is nowhere in evidence in Perry's aw-shucks 
posturing. Neither is the effects of the commercialization of the sport. That's 
been purified too. The inspirationalism goes down easier that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Director John Avildsen, who directed "Rocky" and "The Karate Kid," knows 
something about inspirational movies -- and he appears to have forgotten most 
of it here. Frost never sinks low enough to make his rise exciting; his ordeals 
-- wife problems, father problems, etc. -- are standard. The screenwriter, 
Monte Merrick, must have recognized this -- at one point he has one of the 
characters remark on how much their lives resemble a country-Western song. 
Actually, their lives resemble a bad country song. The good ones don't indulge 
in all this processed heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Baldwin, as Lane's bull-riding buddy "Tuff" Hedeman, has a few 
swaggering good moments and James Rebhorn, playing Lane's father Clyde, has an 
acrid edge that de-sudses his scenes. (The filmmakers intend Clyde's 
competitiveness with his son to be his way of showing love, but that's not how 
it plays.) 
</P>
<P>
 The most solid presence in the film, though, is the great bull Red Rock, 
Lance's perpetual nemesis. He has a gravity lacking in the rest of the movie. 
He should have bucked a few more of its honchos.

MOVIE REVIEW; SHEPARD'S 'TONGUE' A SUPERNATURAL WESTERN TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Silent Tongue" (Beverly Center Cineplex), directed by actor-playwright Sam 
Shepard, is an alternately infuriating and exhilarating example of the Western 
as an art film. A stylized allegory of the white man's brutalization of Native 
Americans, it's the kind of picture easily dismissed as pretentious. Richard 
Harris and Alan Bates, however, are absolutely splendid, indeed possessed of 
Shakespearean grandeur, as two seemingly very different Irishmen who have 
sought their fortunes on the American frontier. But their considerable impact 
is fatally undermined by Shepard's altogether too theatrical and literal 
treatment of the supernatural. 
</P>
<P>
 A grief-stricken Harris travels over vast expanses in tracking down Bates, the 
boozy but surprisingly sharp proprietor of a traveling medicine show who's 
become hooked on his own product. In the past Harris had purchased from Bates 
one of his two daughters by the long-departed Kiowa (Tantoo Cardinal) known as 
Silent Tongue, who had been rendered speechless when her tongue was cut out -- 
a victim of Bates' rape. 
</P>
<P>
 This daughter, Awbonnie (Sheila Tousey), had brought happiness and calm to 
Harris' highly -- but mysteriously -- disturbed son (River Phoenix, in his 
small next-to-last screen role that asks only that he seem profoundly 
agitated), but she has died in childbirth, leaving the son so distraught that 
he cannot bear to bury her corpse, despite the imprecations of her ghost to do 
so. Harris, beside himself with worry, will pay Bates any amount to sell him 
his other daughter (Jere Arredondo), although her older half-brother (Dermot 
Mulrooney) is none too happy about seeing yet another half-sister sold off. 
Gradually, a drama of revenge against Harris and Bates is set in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Shepard sticks with the tragic Harris and the wily Bates, 
contrasting examples of the kind of men who exploited Native Americans, "Silent 
Tongue" is fairly engrossing, although scarcely fresh or original in its 
anti-white man, pro-Native American stance. The trouble is a great deal of the 
movie is taken up with the nonstop harangues of Awbonnie's ghost, who for some 
reason has had one side of her face disfigured by paralysis and whose 
deep-voice rage recalls Judith Anderson's Medea. Tousey might possibly be fine 
if this were a play instead of a film, but she's way over the top for the 
screen. Shepard might better have either presented Awbonnie's ghost as a 
silent, accusing figure or let us hear her voice without showing her beyond a 
wispy, fleeting apparition. In any case, the combination of Awbonnie's bizarre 
physical presence and her ceaseless declaiming is too much not to stop the 
movie dead in its tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 This is unfortunate for Shepard, who seems closer in spirit to Leone and 
Jodorowsky than to Ford. The contributions of cinematographer Jack Conroy, 
production designer Cary White, costume designer Van Ramsey and composer 
Patrick O'Hearn couldn't be more appropriately moody and atmospheric. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silent Tongue" has a sophisticated concern for textures and authentic 
details; this is one Western set in 1873 that doesn't have 1910 props. In its 
best moments, Bates' seedy caravan recalls in its mix of period quaintness and 
frank sensuality Ingmar Bergman's tiny traveling circus in "Sawdust and 
Tinsel." Ultimately, however, the title of "Silent Tongue" becomes ironic for a 
movie that talks too much.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SEASONS' FAILS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMAX FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exposition Park's California Museum of Science and Industry IMAX Theater's 
latest offering, Ben Shedd's 33-minute "Seasons" (premiering today at 11 a.m.), 
is most kindly viewed as ideal for children, thrilling them with outsize images 
while making them aware of the solar system and the weather's eternal cycles. 
It will also most likely delight all those who accept all IMAX offerings 
uncritically -- those who are automatically captivated by the novelty of the 
awesome proportions of the IMAX screen and its camera's unique capacity for 
depth and capturing towering close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 A mishmash, "Seasons," however, is all technique and no style. It's best when 
it sticks to nature, showing us rapturously beautiful images of raccoons 
preparing to hibernate and birds gathering to migrate for the winter. Abrupt 
cuts to human activity are jolting, and Shedd's choices are banal: an amusement 
park for summer -- this allows for some Cinerama-like rides on a Ferris wheel 
-- a raucous Oktoberfest celebration for fall, a sleigh ride for winter. Shedd 
and writer George Casey are on to something when they suggest that the eternal 
cycle of the seasons is what prompted mankind to try to make sense of the 
universe, but they don't stick with this point of view very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Shedd balances the building of an immense sand castle, a veritable Mont St. 
Michel re-created on a San Diego beach, with the similar construction of an ice 
castle. They're innocent, pleasure-giving examples of kitsch, having nothing to 
do with natural beauty, yet he and Casey get carried away, declaring via 
William Shatner's soundtrack narration that the completed, lighted ice castle 
represents nothing less than "a celebration of the triumph of life."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet they're capable of following such a silly remark with a worthy 
consideration of the importance of comprehending that the sun, rather than the 
Earth, is at the center of our universe, which represents "the need to see 
ourselves as a part of a larger universe." 
</P>
<P>
 When a film is as uneven, at odds with itself, as "Seasons," which is 
accompanied by Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons," it calls into question its choice 
of medium. If an IMAX film is to seem more than a museum exhibit then there has 
to be some point as to why it's been made in that format in the first place -- 
some sense that its unique resources have been explored for some purpose. 
(Ironically, the program's curtain-raiser, Ron Fricke's dazzling eight-minute 
"Sacred Site," a glorious tracking of Halley's Comet from Australia's Ayer's 
Mound, a huge breadloaf-like mountain in a desert landscape, shows just what 
can only be accomplished in IMAX.)  
</P>
<P>
 The lack of imagination in "Seasons" makes you appreciate the rigor of the 
best experimental filmmakers; Stan Brakhage, for example, has celebrated nature 
and its cycles for decades in rich, flowing images created with much the same 
equipment others use to take home movies. There's lots more point to them than 
a close-up of a pansy that's 40 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing at the IMAX, along with "Seasons," through April 28 are a reprise 
of "Beavers," plus "The Discoverers," "Grand Canyon" and "Chronos."

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; LACK OF FOCUS CLIPS WINGS OF ONE DOVE 
</P>

<P>
 When the Scottish group One Dove closed its show at the Whisky on Wednesday 
with its most captivating song, "White Love," it pulled a trick straight out of 
its dance-music background -- offering two alternative "mixes," as it were. 
</P>
<P>
 As a preliminary to the full-blown, synthesizer-powered version, singer Dot 
Allison was flanked by two guitarists, whose acoustic blend of chunky rhythm 
and bottleneck lead sounded like a bluesy outtake from the Stones' "Beggars' 
Banquet." In the least-confining setting she was given all evening, Allison 
showed that she could sing with nuance and invention as well as the power she 
was called on to deliver for most of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dove's debut album late last year announced the arrival of a potential 
standard-bearer for the long-anticipated federation of dance-music pulse and 
rock 'n' roll emotion. Against those expectations, Wednesday's L.A. debut by 
the Glasgow-based group was a bit of a letdown -- a display of imaginative, 
often-stirring music that somehow never gathered the force to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 As it does on the "Morning Dove White" album, the group tried to reach beyond 
the limitations of a synthesizer-bound approach, supplementing its core of 
Allison, keyboardist Ian Carmichael and bassist-keyboardist Jim McKinven with 
hired hands: guitarist Colin McIlrow and percussionist Edward Higgins. This 
lineup staked out a territory where both the technological and the human 
impulses got their due. 
</P>
<P>
 The synth side -- driving pulse, crunching beats, swirling textures -- was 
balanced by the live players, notably McIlrow, whose lively rhythm playing and 
feedback outbursts were central to the music's variety and impact. Still, the 
show didn't quite capture the enveloping moods of One Dove's record and didn't 
come up with a compensating energy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the onstage focal point, Allison was up and down. In her jeans, fuzzy pink 
sweater and black-framed eyeglasses, she looked like an actress dressed down 
for a day of preliminary rehearsals. This created a suggestion of glamour 
deferred, which might have been a miscalculation. The show needed a strong 
focus, and while Allison's voice was unfailingly strong and evocative, her 
inexperience or inclination left her an uncharismatic figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Lennox, another Scot who started out by singing soulfully in front of 
synthesizers, is an obvious but pertinent comparison. One Dove is creative and 
ambitious, unafraid to tailor its tempos and sounds in the service of mood and 
emotion, to invoke ghosts, pursue elusive love and float into ecstasy in 
cathedral-like sonic chambers. Music this dramatic demands a convincing 
embodiment on stage, and Allison needs to take things up another level.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; RHOADS TRUST BENEFIT A 6-HOUR MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 60 hard-rock musicians lent their talents -- some considerable, 
others not so -- to benefit the Randy Rhoads Charitable Trust Fund at the 
Palace on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-hours-plus show honoring Rhoads -- the late Ozzy Osbourne guitarist -- 
was, as in years past, a melange of real bands and loosely organized 
jams.Whatever musical possibilities may have existed in the various 
combinations, too often it proved an exercise in stamina for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-school metal that enjoyed 15 minutes of fame in the '80s hasn't aged well, 
and the slick, melodramatic work by many Wednesday was greeted lukewarmly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a more progressive musical entry, Black Market Flowers, was met with 
virtual silence from the audience. One highlight was Rhoads' mother, Delores, a 
bespectacled former music teacher, offering heartfelt thanks and reading a 
letter from Osbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who made it to 1 a.m. were finally rewarded, if momentarily. Ugly Kid 
Joe singer Whitfield Crane, backed by former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright and 
benefit organizer and ex-Osbourne bassist Rudy Sarzo, delivered two Osbourne 
classics with a passion and humor sorely lacking in most of the evening's other 
performances.KATHERINE TURMAN

JAZZ NOTES: PLAYBOY FESTIVAL SMORGASBORD OF STYLES AND ERAS PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the years, producer George Wein has selected the performers for the 
Playboy Jazz Festival with a single idea in mind: Make sure there's a little 
something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's festival, the 16th annual event, which will be held June 18-19 at 
the Hollywood Bowl, follows this predictable formula. Saxophonist Joshua 
Redman, trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and drummer Elvin Jones are among those who 
should please mainstream fans, while Spyro Gyra and saxophonist David Sanborn 
will likely draw the ears of younger, contemporary jazz listeners. On the 
traditional jazz end, there's clarinetist Pete Fountain, while King Sunny Ade 
and vibist-timbalero Tito Puente should excite the ears of World Beat and Latin 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 This smorgasbord approach irks some, who say such programming waters down 
lineups by including non-jazz performers like Ade or bands that are less than 
critical favorites, like Spyro Gyra. Nonetheless, Wein stands solidly behind 
his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the mixing of styles and eras on festivals has prolonged the 
longevity of jazz festivals in general, by exposing people to different 
groups," he says. "People who like David Sanborn may like Elvin Jones. Or they 
may not. But more than exposure to groups, this diversity is public relations 
for the word jazz . When 17,000 people come each day for two days, then jazz is 
still an important element in society. And by keeping the word alive, we're 
keeping the music alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Wein admits, his Playboy lineup sells a lot of tickets. He proudly calls 
the festival, which has sold out almost every year of its existence, "the most 
successful two-day jazz event." But Wein feels the party atmosphere that 
dominates the event is the real sign of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really have a good time. There's a sense of joy, of happiness" in the 
audience, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the complete lineup for the June 18 show, which runs from 2:30 p.m. to 
11 p.m.: Lionel Hampton and the Golden Men of Jazz, with Louie Bellson, Harry 
"Sweets" Edison, Al Grey, Junior Mance, Benny Golson and Pete Candoli; Wynton 
Marsalis; Spyro Gyra; Earl Klugh and Friends; Family Laws, featuring Hubert, 
Ronnie, Eloise and Debra Laws; Ramsey Lewis; Joshua Redman; Fourth World, with 
Flora Purim and Airto; and Cassandra Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert program for June 19 runs from 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and goes like 
this: David Sanborn, Tito Puente's Golden Latin All-Stars with Mongo 
Santamaria, Dave Valentin, et al.; Joe Williams; Pete Fountain; King Sunny Ade; 
the Count Basie Orchestra, directed by Frank Foster; Marcus Roberts; and 
Russell Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cosby, accompanied by his trademark stogie, will emcee. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will be preceded by a number of free community events. On May 13, 
the Locke High School jazz band plays at 11 a.m. at the Watts Labor Action 
Community Center. Dan Siegel, Michael Wolff and the Nedra Wheeler Group perform 
on May 15, 2 p.m., at L.A. Valley College. On June 5, Santa Monica College 
hosts Boney James, Ernestine Anderson, Cecilia Noel and the Wild Clams and the 
B-Sharp Quartet. A band to be announced will perform June 17 at noon on the 
steps of Los Angeles' City Hall, and that evening at 8 p.m., archivist Mark 
Cantor hosts a screening of jazz films at the Pacific Design Center in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, priced between $10 and $27.50, are available from the Hollywood Bowl 
box office, (213) 850-2000. For general festival information, call (310) 
449-4070 during normal business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to His Roots: Saxophonist Ernie Watts readily admits he likes different 
kinds of music. He says he has just as much fun playing with bassist Charlie 
Haden's mainstream-based Quartet West as he does in the contemporary jazz 
ensembles led by guitarist Lee Ritenour. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his various stylistic stances, Watts, 48, has only a couple of really 
major influences: John Coltrane and Miles Davis, in the period when he led a 
quintet that featured Wayne Shorter. And it's the mark of those stellar artists 
that shines through on Watts' new recording, "Reaching Up" on JVC Records, an 
all-acoustic album that spotlights drummer Jack DeJohnette and pianist Mulgrew 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been plugged into the energy of John's and Miles' playing, and I 
wanted to go back and get in touch with that energy and do some really 
spontaneous playing," says Watts, who leads a quartet tonight and Saturday at 
Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks.

THEATER BEAT: THE ORDINARY BECOMES COMPELLING IN 'THE SPEED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Tesich is one of those rare playwrights who can handle touchy subjects 
like domestic violence, suicide and post-traumatic stress without sounding too 
much as if he were writing the movie of the week. His insightful "The Speed of 
Darkness" at the Tamarind is a case in point. The play teeters near gooey, but 
it's so finely observed that it only occasionally gets sucked into its own 
self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
 A drama about the pull of the past, "The Speed of Darkness" centers on a 
Vietnam vet named Joe (Andy Garrison) and his family and what happens to their 
home sweet home when one of Joe's old war pals shows up. Mostly though, it's 
about two particular skeletons in Joe's closet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the situation or the characters are particularly original, 
although they are convincingly detailed. Instead, Tesich's triumph is that he 
makes the ordinary compelling -- mostly by virtue of his economical yet 
naturalistic dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Glass gives a standout performance in the proverbially tough role of a 
homeless disturbed vet. Garrison's Joe is relaxed and believable, while Scott 
Weinger is also convincing as Joe's daughter's boyfriend, Eddie. The two women 
(Shawn Weatherly, Rachael Harris) acquit themselves respectably, but they add 
little to their admittedly underwritten roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Spera's evenhanded, if sometimes too reverential, direction makes the 
play flow. But the device he uses to bridge the blackouts -- a lone stagehand 
slowly and deliberately places an array of props every time the lights go down 
-- quickly wears out its welcome. Or maybe it's just the New Age music playing 
in the background that makes it a bit irritating. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Speed of Darkness," Tamarind Theatre, 5919 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends March 27. $18. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours, 20 minutes. Updated 'Servant' at the Fountain 
</P>
<P>
 Some things never change -- like the gags in the 200-year-old Carlo Goldoni 
romp "The Servant of Two Masters" at the Fountain. This theatrical cotton candy 
still provides a good chance for a wily director to strut his stuff. And sure 
enough, Florinel Fatulescu adds lotsa lazzi.  
</P>
<P>
 Re-imagined as a cross between a backstage comedy and a circus, the farce 
centers on a moonlighting servant who gets caught in the middle of a web of 
mistaken identities and foiled romances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatulescu cleverly updates the commedia with a wash of stylization that 
includes anachronisms such as rap music and a hanging microphone that's used 
for asides to the audience. Not all of his devices and bits of business work, 
but it's a pleasantly chock-full approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Running around on a cluttered and cartoony set (by Robert W. Zentis), the 
servant Truffaldino (agile Alan Goodson) and the merchant Pantalone (sly Ed 
Levey) marshall the necessary combination of physical and verbal humor, and 
their limber performances drive this staging. Most of the rest of the young 
cast, however, aren't up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Servant of Two Masters," Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., 
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 3 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends 
March 26. $15-$17.50. (213) 663-1525. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes. A 
Heavy-Handed 'Cross in Mirror' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine writer Coral Aguirre's "La Cruz en el Espejo" (The Cross in the 
Mirror) may take as its subject one of Mexican history's most enigmatic 
figures, but the wooden acting and staging at the Bilingual Foundation of the 
Arts suffocate this already turgid play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the English translation by Margarita Stocker, "The Cross in the Mirror" 
tells the story of the cloistered 17th-Century nun Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz 
(Johanna Seigmann) who was punished for her controversial writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly set against the backdrop of the Spanish Inquisition, Aguirre's 
version of the nun's life actually narrows the story. Sor Juana the 
proto-feminist goes head to head with one-dimensional Church bad guys and 
appears with an array of simpy women, including her benefactor. But the heroine 
herself is never fully realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Margarita Galban treats each ponderous, expository beat of the story 
as if we wouldn't know the forces of evil without a score card. And none of the 
actors rise much above chest-beating. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Cross in the Mirror," Bilingual Foundation of the Arts, 421 N. Avenue 
19, Lincoln Heights. Alternate weeks in Spanish and English: 
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 3 p.m. Ends March 20. $15. (213) 
225-4044. Running time: 2 hours, 5 minutes. 'Elvis & Juliet': Don't Be Cruel 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regrets. I've had a few . . . More than a few, actually, about "Elvis & 
Juliet" at the new Theatre at the Improv. Mary Willard's clunky comedy is so 
derivative that even a decent Sinatra impersonator can't save the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Two star-crossed sweethearts fall in love while at Yale, only to find they're 
from different worlds -- a la Romeo and you-know-who. She comes from a family 
of nerdy eggheads given to spouting Latin at one another. He's from a bunch of 
tacky, loud-mouthed Vegas performers, and Dad, natch, is an Elvis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict consists of pitting the two clans against one another, but there 
are no surprises here. Most of the actors in the more caricatured parts confuse 
louder with funnier, while those in the "normal" roles have a tough time 
avoiding being upstaged by their garish castmates. Fred Willard and Johnny Dark 
do manage to eke out a few funny moments, but they quickly get sucked back down 
into the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Return to sender. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Elvis & Juliet," the Theatre at the Improv, 8156 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends March 19. $10. (213) 651-2583. Running time: 2 
hours, 15 minutes. 'Car Tunes' Stalls at the First Light 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do you get if you cross a kiddie show about some friendly automobiles 
with one of those campy big-hatted revues like "Beach Blanket Babylon"? "Car 
Tunes" at the Melrose Theatre. Fasten your seat belts. This one really is a 
bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of songs performed by an under-rehearsed cast of eight (all dolled up 
in silly, sparkling car outfits), "Car Tunes" is strung together by a story 
that's about as exciting as the DMV drivers' test booklet. The heroine, Siren 
the sports car (Heidi Godt), has to get Buck the truck (Robert Jeffrey Wagner) 
to perform with her in the big song and dance number, or else she won't win the 
"Windy 500" competition. 
</P>
<P>
 If the setup sounds older than the maps in your glove compartment, it is. And 
the songs, amateurishly sung, are straight off the factory line as well. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a smattering of mildly off-color humor throughout, but it's neither 
plentiful nor smart enough to make this into one of those over-the-top 
late-night spoofs. And it ruins "Car Tunes" as children's fare (which is what 
this show really wants to be). 
</P>
<P>
 Stop. Yield. Don't Go. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Car Tunes," Melrose Theatre, 733 N. Seward St., Hollywood . Tuesdays, 8 
p.m. Ends March 8. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THIS PAIR OF CHIANTIS EQUALS TWO SO-SO OUTINGS; OLD STANDBYS 
PROVE TRUEST AT OLD-WORLD CHIANTI; CHIC CUCINA OFFERS UNEVEN FARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the beginning, there was Chianti, the darkest restaurant in town. And then 
Chianti gave birth to Cucina, a child of light and clatter that became the 
prototype for the 10-million noisy, wide-open, elbow-to-elbow Italian 
restaurants proliferating all over the country. Chianti Cucina remains 
distinctive for preserving its two-tone nature, its marriage of opposites. The 
dark and the bright. The shadowy cave and the sun-filled kitchen. The perfect 
place for anonymous assignations; the classic spot to see and be seen.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Chianti Cucina hired a new chef. The food for this Old World dinner 
house/chic pasta joint comes from one kitchen, so I stopped in to see how he 
handled the challenge of dual menus. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to Chianti first, with a female friend. Two women, I was reminded 
again, are a dining combination too often doomed behind the proverbial potted 
palm. Indeed, we were offered a choice of the drafty table by the front door, 
or a tiny, cramped corner in the banquette way, way, way in the back under the 
stag head with wide antlers. We chose the stag. 
</P>
<P>
 Chianti is dark, proudly dark; the pretty little lamps house the weakest of 
flashlight bulbs. We squinted, moving closer and closer to the menu until it 
looked as if we were snuffling about, trying to smell the words rather than 
read them. Only then, like Virgil guiding Dante, did the waiter appear with the 
famous penlights so we could choose our dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 At this birthplace of restaurant hipness, the service is cheerfully 
impersonal, and the dress code seems to be fashionably casual; that is, 
anything fashionable goes except suits and ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dinners were OK. Just OK. An appetizer of prosciutto-wrapped endive and 
radicchio served with lasciviously plump marinated mushrooms was the best thing 
we ate all night. A cold, juicy seafood salad was refreshing, but otherwise 
unremarkable. The Caesar was under-dressed, dry and grainy with too much dry, 
ground cheese. I hate to be marrow-minded, but osso buco made from turkey 
"shanks" served on a bland bed of soft polenta only made me long for the 
classic veal bones and saffron-tinged risotto. Curiously, the more traditional 
dish is served over on the Cucina side, leading us to wonder if the inevitable 
is taking place: Is the child becoming the parent, the parent the child? 
</P>
<P>
 Next, I visited Cucina with two other women and we were ushered into a small 
back room paved with Cucina's signature, noise-bouncing white tiles. It was a 
little like eating in a converted shower area. Petals of seared tuna with a 
small salad of radicchio and arugula was the favorite appetizer. There was no 
favorite entree; mesquite-grilled salmon and its complement of vegetables was 
dull, and a lasagne of porcini mushrooms, spinach and potatoes was besotted by 
a cloying heavy cream sauce. Risotto with Muscovy duck ragout was chalky, 
loaded with too many rosemary needles, inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 Return visits to both restaurants yielded better seating (I came with men), 
but I never did have anything approaching a transcendent eating experience on 
either side.  
</P>
<P>
 At Chianti, old standbys prove truest: The beef carpaccio was delicious 
drizzled with good oil, but I wished the celery were less chunky and the 
truffles more flavorful. The veal chop is classic: thick, beautifully grilled; 
too bad it's served with more spiritless polenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfectly good scallops, clams, a split langoustine, swordfish and 
green-lipped mussels swam in a tasty brodo that's ultimately a little too 
thick, too tomatoey; spoonfuls off the bottom are like seafood-spiked marinara 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cucina, we found capellini alla checca good if a bit too cooked, salads 
undistinctive, fedelini (thinner than spaghetti, thicker than capellini ) with 
lobster hearty and satisfying.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a definite sag in the cooking, I left Chianti Cucina with plenty of 
residual affection for the place. One feels confident the kitchen will rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and I take it back about having no transcendent moment with the food: The 
famous cre me bru le e , with its gorgeously smooth texture and buried berries 
is as good a bowlful as you'll find. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chianti Cucina, 7383 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 653-8333. Cucina open 
seven days for lunch and dinner. Chianti open seven nights for dinner only.

MUSIC REVIEW; TECHNIQUE, NOT EMOTION, IS PIANIST ROGE'S FORTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though he played here just three years ago as soloist in a concerto, pianist 
Pascal Roge's last local solo recital took place in 1976 in Royce Hall at UCLA. 
At that time, one speculated on just what kind of pianist the then-24-year-old 
French musician would eventually become. 
</P>
<P>
 The future has arrived, and Roge's second Southland recital, Wednesday night 
at Ambassador Auditorium, answered our questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He remains a reliable, unperturbable technician, one whose seamless delivery 
of even the most convoluted mechanical passage comes across smoothly. He plays 
with a natural and unforced musical rhetoric, letting the scores he chooses 
make their own points. In his Ambassador program, which mixed music by 
Schumann, Beethoven, Faure, Satie, Ravel and Poulenc, he seemed comfortable in 
differing idioms. 
</P>
<P>
 All Roge's playing lacks is strong emotional projection, a sense of destiny, 
the light of charisma and a gift for sharing music with his listeners. His 
skills apparently do not include the ability to seduce an audience, or to raise 
his own artistic temperature measurably above the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning a recital with Schumann's "Kinderszenen" is a good idea if the 
pianist has made these meditations on childhood his own personal expressions -- 
they are, of course, not children's pieces. Roge did not seem to have done 
this, and the suite emerged simultaneously fussy and unfocused. Then, his 
"Appassionata" Sonata, nicely paced and technically immaculate, became handsome 
rather than convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most engaging moments arrived with Faure's haunting E-flat-minor Nocturne 
and with three of Satie's stately "Gnossiennes"; four slow movements in a row 
could have been too much of a good thing, yet these charmers held the ear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonatine of Ravel and Poulenc's jolly/tawdry "Les Soirees de Nazelles," in 
good-natured performances, concluded the program proper. Here, as before, 
urbanity and artistic honesty marked Roge's readings. All they missed was 
magic.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'GRAMMY'S GREATEST' GOES MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "H ere's the explosive! . . . the one and only! . . . Tina Turner!"  
</P>
<P>
 From the introduction and the cheers that follow, you might assume that you're 
hearing a live recording from a landmark pop showcase -- say the legendary 
Apollo, where James Brown recorded one of the most exciting live albums ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner surely sings "What's Love Got to Do With It" with the vitality and bite 
that you'd associate with a raucous concert. 
</P>
<P>
 What a surprise, then, to learn that the number was actually recorded during a 
Grammy Awards telecast -- one of 11 numbers in Vol. 1 of "Grammy's Greatest 
Moments," part of a four-volume series released by Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Turner vocal from the 1985 show, where "What's Love . . . " was 
named record of the year, Vol. 1 also includes such celebrated Grammy moments 
as Marvin Gaye's live rendition of "Sexual Healing" (1983) and the Barbra 
Streisand-Neil Diamond duet on "You Don't Bring Me Flowers." Other selections 
include Sting's performance of "Russians" (1986), Bonnie Raitt's "Thing Called 
Love" (1990) and Natalie Cole's "Unforgettable" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 The albums were packaged in association with the National Academy of Recording 
Arts & Sciences, which sponsors the Grammy competition. Net proceeds will go to 
MusiCares, a charitable organization that helps people in the music industry 
through various financial and service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sound quality is excellent, the mainstream tone of the Grammy shows 
diminishes the historical significance of the series. Just as the Grammy voters 
have tended over the years to overlook many of the most vital and original 
forces in pop, the show itself has leaned toward mainstream best-sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hard-rock entries among the 47 performances showcased in the series 
are Aerosmith's 1991 rendition of "Come Together" and Billy Idol's 1991 version 
of "Cradle of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 An added problem is that the most appealing performances are on Vol. 1. 
Nothing reflects the subsequent drop in quality better than the introduction to 
a track on Vol. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, one of the five nominated performances for record of the year," a voice 
says with all the exaggerated drama of a TV spectacular. "It's . . . Huey Lewis 
& the News. " 
</P>
<P>
 Among the selections found on Vols. 2, 3 and 4: Michael Bolton and Kenny G's 
"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" (1990), Eric Clapton's "Tears in 
Heaven" (1993), Olivia Newton-John's "Hopelessly Devoted to You" (1979), Amy 
Grant's "Baby Baby" (1992) and Patti LuPone's "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" 
(1981).

POP ALBUM CHART; CELINE DION SHOWING HER CHART POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How about the power of Celine Dion? Not only is her new album, "The Colour of 
My Love," moving up in the Top 10--two notches to No. 8--but her single, "The 
Power of Love," continues to clobber the competition, leading the pop single 
chart for the past month. Her appearance on the Jacksons' TV special on Tuesday 
should translate into even more sales--the album might just crack the Top 5 
next week. R. Kelly, who falls somewhere between Teddy Pendergrass and Snoop 
Dogg, is heating up the chart with his steamy "12 Play." It moved up two more 
notches to No. 3 and has a shot at No. 1. Look out for Ace of Base, whose sound 
is an update of '70s disco. The Swedish group's album, "The Sign," moved into 
the Top 10, at No. 9. The single of the title song is No. 2 on the pop chart. 
Many predicted a chart free-fall for country singer John Michael Montgomery's 
"Kickin' It Up," but it's still hanging in--at No. 6--after a month on the 
chart. That Frank Sinatra "Duets" album looks as if it's going to be a strong 
long-range seller. After four months on the chart and more than 2 million 
copies sold, it's still doing well, climbing five notches to No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Crash Test Dummies are gearing up to crash the Top 20. The group's 
second album, "God Shuffled His Feet," shuffled up from No. 44 to No. 32 and 
seems to be just getting started. A huge underground buzz preceded the release 
of this album, which has been on the chart six weeks. 05,46,06,08,08,04 Rank

MOVIE REVIEW IN 'GOLDEN LOTUS,' LIFE IS ROUGH -- ALL OVER AGAIN; CLARA LAW'S 
REINCARNATED HEROINE FINDS HERSELF IN A WORLD THAT'S STILL INHOSPITABLE TO 
WOMEN, EVEN CENTURIES LATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus," screening tonight as part of UC Irvine's 
"Tragedy and Comedy" film series, begins with a fantastic prologue: 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus, described as the "No. 1 slut in ancient Chinese history," is offered a 
deal at the gates of hell. But rather than accept it, the feisty heroine 
(played by the lovely Joi Wong) decides to send her spirit back to Earth to set 
the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Clara Law, a Chinese director not afraid of visual risks, takes us 
on a wildly erotic run through feminist terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Reborn as a young dancer during Mao's violent Cultural Revolution, Lotus is 
soon raped, labeled a whore and counterrevolutionary and finds herself married 
to a foolish baker, all the while plagued by flashbacks from her life centuries 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As events unfold, she learns, as we do, that her present experiences closely 
mirror those of her previous life. Through Lotus' growing awareness, Law 
comments on how a man's world can be a pretty inhospitable place for a woman, 
especially in China, where traditions hang on through the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Placing the movie in the Cultural Revolution also adds a political resonance 
that makes the melodrama that much more intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Law isn't a didactic filmmaker. In this 1990 release, only her second 
feature, she brings comic shading to the fast action (the movie often seems to 
sprint along) and a rich, curious texture. How about an orgy scene set to 
disco? That's one of the tickles Law offers in "The Reincarnation of Golden 
Lotus." 
</P>
<P>
 Law also has a disarming way with dialogue: Lotus' chunky husband, not the 
finest of lovers, remarks to her during one particularly clumsy night, "My best 
performance yet. Ah, how romantic!" 
</P>
<P>
 The film is sprinkled with those kinds of asides. It's also sprinkled with 
spurts of intense violence and unblinking sex, not always complementary 
elements in Law's hands. But even when Law slips and the film feels graceless, 
the overall impression is of confident originality. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clara Law's "The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus" screens tonight at 7 and 9 
p.m. in the UC Irvine Student Center's Crystal Cove Auditorium, Campus Drive 
and Bridge Road, Irvine. $2 and $4. (714) 856-6379.

THEATER REVIEW; A THREADBARE 'PLAY' MARRED BY HOLES IN SCRIPT; THE TERRENCE 
MCNALLY FARCE AT GARDEN GROVE COMMUNITY THEATRE IS MORE BILE THAN SMILE, AND 
THE STAGING DOESN'T MUSTER THE FEVERISH ENERGY DEMANDED BY THE AUTHOR. 
</P>

<P>
 For some reason, it seems as if every successful American playwright: a) 
Counts the money coming in from the latest hit, then b) Blows off steam by 
writing a play that trashes the whole establishment that made the money 
possible in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every playwright does it, of course (the perennial class act, Arthur 
Miller, for instance) but from Neil Simon to John Patrick Shanley to Terrence 
McNally, a lot of them do, and it's almost always a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Take McNally's 1986 "It's Only a Play," which has finally arrived in Orange 
County at Garden Grove Community Theatre. Borrowing liberally from the 
situations -- if not the verve and wit -- of Moss Hart's backstage comedy 
"Light Up the Sky," McNally's would-be farce takes place in the upstairs 
bedroom of a neophyte Broadway producer's home (Julia, played by Riley Evans) 
where the opening-night party is going on downstairs. Upstairs, naturally, it 
eventually turns into a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 James (Peter Dolan) had turned down the lead in this play, "The Golden Egg," 
by friend and playwright Peter (Bart Story). Now, he's glad he did: James has a 
hunch it just laid an egg on opening night, or "a 35-pound Butterball," as he 
phrases it. 
</P>
<P>
 Right off the bat, McNally is playing on the idea that the theater biz is no 
different from the movie biz: Nothing is relished like somebody else's failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The first act amounts to a parade of stereotypes panting nervously for the 
first reviews. Before the papers arrive, the star (Jane Nunn's Virginia), the 
Peter Sellars-ish director (Michael Kirchhoff's Frank) and Peter join James and 
Julia in an orgy of back-stabbing, self-pity and eulogies for the death of 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 This last notion underscores the problem with McNally's threadbare comedy, 
since Broadway's death has been declared so many times that the only joke is on 
the poor chap who declares it. Even more ludicrous, though, is the final 
stereotypical character: Ira (Michael Ross), a pompous critic clearly modeled 
on every New York playwright's bete noire, John Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: Ira shouldn't even be upstairs fraternizing with the very artists 
he'll soon be reviewing for his monthly magazine. And McNally knows it: He has 
Ira acknowledge his professional misconduct and then fraternize anyway. He even 
pitches his play to the producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we know playwrights hate critics, but things get out of hand in "It's 
Only a Play." The initial reviews everyone has been waiting for sound like the 
glowing quotes that show up in ads -- until, that is, The Times' man, David 
Richards, sounds forth. (The topical names are kept up to date in this current 
edition, per McNally's instructions.) 
</P>
<P>
 This review isn't a review at all, but a kind of verbal torture chamber, 
McNally's gratuitously unfunny device to destroy every character in the room. 
Sometimes, playwrights are crueler than critics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Light Up the Sky," "It's Only a Play" collapses like a house of cards 
in the second act -- you could say a review killed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The script demands a feverish energy that director Philip Weitzman's staging 
isn't up to. And his actors don't seem quite up on their knowledge of theater 
references, not terrific in a play that's most enjoyable in its catty jokes 
about current theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, if one actor isn't referring to David Mamet as "David 
Mammette," another is referring to Artaud as "Ar-Tod." The performances? It's 
only a show, but not everyone is up to speed.  
</P>
<P>
 Nunn genuinely captures the feeling of an actress making a comeback, and Jason 
W. Green is effortlessly funny as the clueless party servant. Dolan misses a 
lot of the nuances of James, the closest thing here to a genuine character, and 
Story doesn't suggest a besieged author. Ross has Ira's pomposity down cold and 
Kirchhoff effectively reeks of Yale-style self-importance, but Evans turns 
Julia's problems into one long whine. 
</P>

HOME TECH / VIDEO: 'SNOW WHITE' HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN DEMAND; DISNEY'S ANIMATED 
RELEASE IS EXPECTED TO RIVAL 'ALADDIN' AND 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' IN NUMBER OF 
CASSETTES SHIPPED. 
</P>

 How badly do fans want Disney's "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on home 
video? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tania Steele, vice president of publicity and marketing for Buena Vista Home 
Video -- which releases Disney tapes -- offers this gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year my office alone got 15,000 letters about it," she reported. "It's 
consistently been the most demanded of all the animated features." 
</P>
<P>
 The company announced earlier this week that "Snow White" is finally coming to 
video this year. Though she declined to make any specific predictions, Steele 
said the number of cassettes shipped will rival those of "Aladdin" and "Beauty 
and the Beast," which would put the figure at more than 20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the release, such as a date and price, won't be announced until 
April, but the movie should be out in early fall, to position it to do big 
business in the Christmas gift market. The price probably will be in the 
$20-$25 range but, with expected discounts, should be available in the $13-$17 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Various promotion tie-ins are likely too, Steele said. They will be announced 
in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Deluxe packages of "Snow White" will also be available. "They'll include 
pieces of footage and various extras that would be of great interest to 
collectors," Steele explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney got as much box-office mileage as possible out of the movie. Last 
summer's theatrical re-release, the first time it had been in theaters since 
1986, telegraphed this home-video debut. Normally Disney will dust off an 
ancient animated feature and put it in theaters a year or so before its 
home-video release, which reacquaints audiences with it.  
</P>
<P>
 And "Snow White" underwent such a costly, extensive audio-visual upgrade 
before last year's movie-house bow that observers felt Disney was also sprucing 
it up for home-video release. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the last blockbuster in the Disney vault that has never been on video. 
"Song of the South" and "The Aristocats" are still there but neither is in a 
league with "Snow White." 
</P>
<P>
 But through a shrewd marketing ploy, Disney re-creates a long-range demand for 
its animated features. Routinely, Disney will only ship copies of an animated 
feature for about seven months after its home-video release. In the ensuing 
years, the number of available copies dwindles, and a new crop of children are 
born who have never seen the movie. So, years later, Disney can re-market the 
feature to a whole new audience. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an expanding-market factor too. "Pinocchio" and "Sleeping Beauty" were 
released in the mid-1980s, when the home-video market was much smaller. So a 
typical release totaled less than a million copies, a fraction of today's 
totals. For example, Steele reported, Disney shipped about 600,000 copies of 
"Pinocchio" in 1985 vs. 12 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is not only that more homes have VCRs, but also that the 
home-video sales market has sharply expanded to include the major 
discount-store chains, which have grabbed a huge share of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the announcement of the home-video release of a Disney animated 
classic will no doubt anger the laser-disc industry. Typically, the laser-disc 
release comes many months after home-video -- to foil pirates -- and Stelle 
said that will be the case here too. Laser-discs make such good home-video 
copies that putting the laser on the market at the same time as the cassette 
would increase piracy and cut into home-video profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The laser market will get a title the same time as home video when there's 
some kind of copy protection on laser," Steele said.  
</P>
<P>
 What's New 
</P>
<P>
 "Strictly Ballroom" (Touchstone). With the possible exception of "Saturday 
Night Fever," this movie conveys the sheer joy of dancing better than any film 
since the 1950s. Dubbed the dance-floor "Rocky," it's about a ballroom dancer 
(Paul Mercurio) trying to win the championship with a meek new partner (Tara 
Morice) and some bold new steps. Forget the comic-book plot and focus on the 
dazzling dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Love or Money" (MCA/Universal). The wheeling-dealing concierge (Michael 
J. Fox) of a fancy New York hotel yearns to open his own hotel, seeking the 
help of a shady financier (Anthony Higgins). Problem: The concierge is in love 
with the financier's mistress (Gabrielle Anwar). This often mushy romantic 
comedy is only fair entertainment. How much longer can Fox play these 
variations of his old "Family Ties" character? 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing Helena" (Orion). Soft-core porn with a grisly twist. A warped surgeon 
(Julian Sands) is such a control nut that he deforms the object of his 
obsession, Helena (Sherilyn Fenn), turning her into an amputee and his captive. 
Director Jennifer Lynch seems to have inherited a passion for weirdness from 
her father -- director David -- but, based on this silly movie, not much of his 
talent. Too unsavory for most tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calendar Girl" (Columbia TriStar). Jason Priestly, star of TV's "Beverly 
Hills, 90210," plays one of a trio of teens who head for Hollywood in 1962 to 
get a date with Marilyn Monroe. Bad movie full of ho-hum humor. Mainly for 
Priestly fanatics who can't get enough of him on TV and will watch him in 
anything.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fortress" (LIVE). Set in the future, this sci-fi thriller is about a 
jailbreak from an underground computerized prison. The heroes are a couple 
(Christopher Lambert and Loryn Locklin) who are jailed for excessive breeding 
-- an intriguing premise. Director Stuart Gordon, noted for "Re-Animator," 
packs it with homage to other horror/sci-fi flicks. Often exciting and amusing 
despite a vapid performance by Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amongst Friends" (New Line). Set in suburbia, director Rob Weiss' first film, 
featuring a cast of unknowns, is an unconvincing cross between Martin 
Scorsese's "Mean Streets" and "GoodFellas." Though he shows promise, Weiss 
clearly has been watching too many Scorsese movies. It's about three idle, 
middle-class, Long Island teen-agers who turn into drug dealers. Characters and 
subplots don't hold your interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son-in-Law" (Hollywood). Pauly Shore plays a fish-out-of-water, urban college 
student who ventures to a Midwestern farm on Thanksgiving vacation, trying to 
worm his way into the hearts of his girlfriend's parents. Even if you find 
Shore's obnoxious whining amusing, you may find yourself grimacing through all 
the forced, juvenile jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son of the Pink Panther" (MGM/UA). Italian comedian Roberto Benigni portrays 
the son of clumsy Inspector Clouseau, who was brilliantly played by the late 
Peter Sellers. In this one, the son bungles his way through the hunt for the 
kidnapers of an Arabian princess. Incoherent and chock-full of lame gags, it's 
nowhere near the quality of the Sellers movies.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'SEATTLE' A VALENTINE'S DAY DELIGHT

 The Valentine's Day weekend rental run on "Sleepless in Seattle" finally 
boosted it into the top spot, toppling "The Firm," which slipped to No. 4. Of 
all the Top 10 rentals, "Sleepless" is the only one with strong romantic 
appeal, so it naturally benefited most from the holiday.It's also the kind of 
movie that does strong repeat business. "In the Line of Fire," the suspense 
thriller with Clint Eastwood, is next in line for the top spot. John 
Malkovich's supporting actor Oscar nomination is bound to elevate the movie's 
already-high rental appeal. "Kalifornia," a low-budget movie with Brad Pitt and 
Juliette Lewis, continues to do surprising business. Though racking up a small 
box-office gross, it inched up two more notches to No. 14, doing nearly as well 
as the expensive, heavily hyped "Coneheads," which has stalled at No. 11. 
Robert Townsend's "The Meteor Man," about a ghetto super-hero, isn't off to a 
blazing start, debuting at No. 31.  
</P>
<P>
 * Will all the promotion for Kim Basinger's new movie, "The Getaway," spill 
over and motivate renters to give this one a try? Movie-goers certainly never 
bothered with "The Real McCoy"--a true box-office dud with a $6.3-million 
gross. It's off to a modest rental-market start, at No. 21. 03,27,06,08 Rank

GUNMAN MAY HAVE STRANGLED ON OWN VEST; AUTOPSY: NECKLINE OF BULLETPROOF 
PROTECTOR APPARENTLY CHOKED DAVID FUKUTO DURING STRUGGLE AFTER HE KILLED TWO 
OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge's son who shot two Palos Verdes Estates police commanders to death at 
a motivational seminar apparently was strangled by the neckline of his 
bulletproof vest as officers tried to subdue him, according to sources, who 
also said they are not convinced robbery was the motive. 
</P>
<P>
 David J. Fukuto, 32, who last week burst into a Torrance Holiday Inn 
conference room with a pistol in each hand, was restrained by three members of 
the tiny South Bay department after he opened fire on Capt. Michael Tracy and 
Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a coroner's report has not been completed, sources close to the 
investigation said a preliminary examination of Fukuto's body suggested that 
his sturdy synthetic-fiber vest rode up against his windpipe as he struggled to 
break free. Initially, the sources said, there had been indications that Fukuto 
died from a control hold applied by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to come out that he probably strangled himself in his attempt to 
get out of the officers' grasp," said one of the sources, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. "He did himself."  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coroner's office declined to comment, citing an order from 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office that the autopsy results be 
kept confidential for 45 days. A spokeswoman for that office said Thursday that 
there were no plans to lift the hold sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 A relative of the gunman, whose father, Morio L. Fukuto, is a respected state 
appellate court justice, said the family was too consumed with grief and 
embarrassment to worry about the details of his death. Considering that he 
could have faced the gas chamber if he survived, "it was probably the most 
merciful thing that could have happened for everyone concerned," said the 
family member. 
</P>
<P>
 The account of Fukuto's death is one of several new details to emerge, some of 
which raise more questions about the attack than they answer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Torrance police sergeant who is helping supervise the investigation said 
that detectives are no longer sure that Fukuto's motive was robbery, which had 
been the only explanation provided by officials for his Valentine's Day raid on 
the 12th-floor conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto, who was carrying 30 to 40 pairs of plastic handcuffs in a fanny pack, 
fired on Vanderpool after the veteran officer stood up to challenge him. He 
shot Tracy after the captain went to his fallen comrade's aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some difference of opinion among the people in that room as to what 
his motive was," said Sgt. Ron Traber, declining to elaborate. "We're not 
absolutely convinced it was a robbery. By the same token, we don't know what 
else his motive could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the confusion apparently stems from Fukuto's remarks as he burst 
through the doorway just as the all-day seminar was wrapping up. At first, 
officials believed he was intent on robbery because Fukuto reportedly stated, 
"This is a robbery." But one source said that of the 13 people in the room, 
only one now recalls Fukuto making that remark. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit that was used to obtain the search warrant, Torrance Police 
Detective James Cook quotes Fukuto as saying, "This is not a joke. Everyone put 
your hands behind your neck. I have a silencer." After firing a warning shot 
from the silenced weapon into a wall, the affidavit says, Fukuto repeated: "So, 
it's no joke." 
</P>
<P>
 A search of the Mid-City home Fukuto shared with his grandmother revealed that 
he was fascinated with paramilitary gear and survivalist-themed magazines. 
Along with numerous weapons and ammunition, detectives also seized computer 
disks, notebooks, phone bills, the cassette from an answering machine, a roll 
of film and a photo of Fukuto with a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, sources said, none of it has revealed an explanation for the 
attack or linked him to any other crime. "Nothing," said one source 
knowledgeable about the case. "That's what makes this so bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto, who worked as a telemarketer for an insurance company, was rejected by 
the Los Angeles Police Department when he applied to be an officer shortly 
after the 1992 riots. Hoping to clear up rumors of a possible link to Palos 
Verdes Estates, city officials this week said he had never applied for a job or 
been arrested there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in another strange twist, The Times has learned that for 15 years the 
Fukuto family lived five houses away from the family of Palos Verdes Estates 
Police Lt. Ed Jaakola, who was among the department's top brass attending the 
Holiday Inn seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old Jaakola, who is considerably older than Fukuto, said he had no 
recollection of him from their old north Torrance neighborhood. "I wouldn't 
have known him if he walked past me down the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto's two siblings, Steve and Donna, said they had not been aware of the 
connection and did not think it was significant. "You can come at this from any 
angle you want," said Steve Fukuto, 34. "But nothing makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaakola's 35-year-old brother, Lance, also did not think there was a link. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of St. Mary's Episcopal Church, where Fukuto was on the 
vestry, have begun taking up a collection for the families of the slain 
officers, said the Rev. John Yamazaki, pastor emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congregants wanted to attend the officers' funeral, which drew an 
estimated 4,000 mourners last Monday. "But we refrained," Yamazaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto was buried in a private funeral.

NOLAN PROTESTS HIS INNOCENCE TO SUPPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after he pleaded guilty to racketeering charges, a tearful former 
Assemblyman Pat Nolan protested his innocence before a roomful of emotional 
supporters in Burbank on Thursday night, walking them through the FBI's 
recorded evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by about 170 backers at a Holiday Inn, Nolan said: "I'm going to do 
my time, but they are not going to shut me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant and at times tearful, Nolan told the crowd that he had no regrets over 
his guilty plea because, "I am now free to speak my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan plans to spend his prison time writing a book about "the abuses of the 
federal judicial system," he said. "I want to change it so other people don't 
have to go through this torment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've taken their best shot," Nolan, 43, said of federal prosecutors who 
secured indictments against him on six counts of racketeering, conspiracy, 
extortion and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've shot me and they've made me mad," he said. "Now I'm a wounded bull 
elephant." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a 33-month sentence -- instead of the eight years he might 
have faced had he gone to trial and lost -- Nolan pleaded guilty to one count 
of racketeering last week. In so doing, he filed a sworn statement in U.S. 
District Court describing his Assembly office as a racketeering enterprise for 
extorting campaign contributions in 1988 from those who sought legislative 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday night he said he admitted accepting the $20,000 in question -- 
which the FBI said were bribes -- but maintained he did so only to strengthen 
the Republican leadership, not to benefit himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of facing overzealous prosecutors and unfavorable courtroom odds 
-- instead of his conscience -- led him to plead guilty, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to show how the FBI and U.S. attorneys fell short of proving 
that he intended to sell his vote, Nolan passed out transcripts of the FBI's 
secretly recorded conversations with him. In one session between him and an 
undercover agent seeking assurances that Nolan would persuade the governor to 
sign a bill, Nolan is quoted as saying, "There's no way we can guarantee 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan also maintained that he did not bring up the subject of campaign 
contributions with the agent. He also played the FBI's secretly made videotape 
of a hotel room meeting in which an agent passed two checks for $5,000 apiece 
to Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 The low angle of the camera and the grainy black-and-white quality of the film 
was meant to give the tape a sinister appearance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said he will spend the next month before he reports to prison March 28 
making arrangements for the support of his wife, Gail, and three children, ages 
5 and under.  
</P>
<P>
 While Nolan is in prison, supporters said, a trust fund set up to receive 
donations will help Nolan's wife pay household bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during his speech, Nolan had to stop to regain composure. Many 
in the crowd also were moved to tears.  
</P>
<P>
 Rand Brooks, a Glendale businessman and retired actor, said after the event: 
"He was framed, but good. When you read the actual transcript, you can't find 
anything wrong there. He's a straight-shooting honest guy."

GARRETT MORRIS OF SATURDAY NIGHT' SHOT IN HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garrett Morris, one of the original "Not Ready for Prime Time Players" on the 
"Saturday Night Live" television show, was shot and critically wounded Thursday 
during a botched holdup attempt in the Hyde Park area of South-Central Los 
Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 57, underwent surgery at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in 
Inglewood, where doctors said he is expected to survive the gunshot wounds in 
his chest and arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Castello, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said 
Morris was walking to his parked car in the 6700 block of 10th Avenue about 
12:50 p.m. when two men confronted him on the sidewalk and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that when Morris told them he had no cash, one of the men fired two 
shots. As Morris slumped to the pavement, the two men fled, according to 
police. Investigators said late Thursday that the suspects had not been 
identified or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris is a native of New Orleans who graduated from Dillard University there 
with a degree in music, spent 10 years with the Harry Belafonte singers and was 
a successful actor, singer, conductor and playwright on Broadway during the 
1960s, appearing in shows such as "Porgy and Bess," "Showboat," "The Great 
White Hope" and "I'm Solomon." 
</P>
<P>
 His big break came in 1975, when he joined Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy 
Chase, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner as part of the original 
cast of "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris played hundreds of roles during his five years on the television show, 
but the one many people remember best is that of Chico Escuela, the amiable, 
scarcely bilingual Latino second baseman for the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Escuela slugged no hits, fielded no line drives and never stole a base. But 
what he lacked in performance he made up for in gratitude, assuring viewers, 
often and eloquently, that "base-e-bol been berry-berry good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In another memorable bit, Morris would repeat news gags for the 
"hearing-impaired" by cupping his hands around his mouth and yelling the 
statements of the show's Weekend Update anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other television credits have included "Hunter," "It's Your Move," "The 
Jeffersons," "Married . . . With Children," "Roll Out," "Murder She Wrote," 
"Hill Street Blues" and "Diff'rent Strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 His film appearances include, "The Jazz Man," "Critical Condition," "Harriet 
Tubman" and "Car Wash." In addition, he joined actors Whoopi Goldberg, Esther 
Rolle and Rain Pryor in a special, 28-minute educational movie about sexual 
abuse entitled "Blackbird Fly."

DESPITE FRAUD CONVICTION, FIRM WILL RUN BURBANK AIRPORT SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Atlanta-based concessionaire convicted last month of felony mail fraud and 
conspiracy in a corruption scandal that rocked the Georgia capital is scheduled 
to set up shop at Burbank Airport in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paradies Shops, one of the nation's largest airport news and gift 
concession agents, will take over three stores at the airport and open a fourth 
after the current concessionaire's contract expires March 31. The 34-year-old 
company won the contract in December after outbidding five others. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal jury last month found The Paradies Shops and its owner, Daniel 
M. Paradies, guilty of 83 counts of mail fraud in one of the most politically 
charged trials in Atlanta history. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Paradies also was convicted of one count of conspiracy for his role in 
a scheme to funnel more than $1 million in illegal payoffs to a prominent 
former city official and airport commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport officials said Thursday they are aware of the conviction, but 
that their agreement with The Paradies Shops would stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept the fact that there's been a judgment rendered. . . . But we're not 
going to say that because there was a conviction back East there's 
automatically a loss of your concession out here," said Robert Garcin, 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority president. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the matter has been referred to the airport's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dickson, senior vice president of The Paradies Shops, insisted that 
his company would have no trouble meeting its Burbank Airport obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to airport authority members, however, Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) urged the airport to cancel its contract with Paradies 
as "a prudent public interest decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Polanco acknowledged that his letter was spurred by a 
complaint from an unsuccessful rival bidder for the concession, MBE Inc. in 
South Pasadena. But he reiterated his contention that the contract does not 
represent "good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to reward the leadership of companies that have been convicted of 
felonies?" Polanco said. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Denver city officials have decided to end their relationship 
with Paradies, even though opening day for the new Denver International Airport 
is scheduled in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark K. McBee, Burbank Airport's manager of contracts and properties, said the 
airport's contract with Paradies does not allow termination solely because of 
convictions of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel it's going to impact their ability to operate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for John Wayne Airport in Orange County said the company's two 
stores there have performed "very satisfactorily" since they began four years 
ago and that there are no plans to review its 10-year contract. The company 
does not operate a concession at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which logged $100 million in sales last year and operates in 38 
U.S. cities, landed the Burbank concession after a search process spanning 
several months. Six proposals were submitted to the airport, and the list was 
winnowed to two in November: The Paradies Shops and British concern W. H. 
Smith, both of which guaranteed at least $2.4 million in rent over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Daniel Paradies and his company were under indictment on fraud 
and conspiracy charges, and as required, his bid mentioned that both he and The 
Paradies Shops had been named as defendants in a criminal action. 
</P>
<P>
 But based on expected revenue and the company's plans for a specialty shop 
with a golf theme, Burbank Airport staff members recommended approval of the 
Paradies bid as "a superior proposal," according to an agenda report. The 
airport authority voted unanimously at its Dec. 20 meeting to award the 
contract to Paradies, praising Paradies-owned shops as "a beautiful, quality 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment was not mentioned in a 5 1/2-minute discussion at the meeting. 
Authority and staff members agree that commissioners had been briefed, but 
officials said Thursday it did not seem necessary to bring up the matter again. 
</P>
<P>
 Convictions in the Atlanta case were handed down Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb announced that he would seek to end 
his city's relationship with the company. "The mayor just felt that he didn't 
want that cloud over the new airport," said Briggs Gamblin, an aide to Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 For its mail-fraud convictions, the company faces maximum fines of $500,000 
for each count. Daniel Paradies could receive up to five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine for each mail-fraud count. The conspiracy conviction also could 
net him a five-year prison term and $250,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for 
April 15. Paradies, 72, has vowed to appeal.

RAID ON GANG FINDS CASINO HEIST EVIDENCE; CRIME: MONEY WRAPPERS FROM TUESDAY'S 
$47,000 LAS VEGAS ROBBERY ARE FOUND IN SOUTH-CENTRAL SWEEP. FOUR SUSPECTS ARE 
IN CUSTODY.

<P>
 An anti-gang raid in South-Central Los Angeles on Thursday may have 
inadvertently netted the culprits in a brazen $47,000 casino robbery that this 
week sent crowds of high rollers diving for cover in Las Vegas, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said they were serving routine search warrants in a 
neighborhood controlled by a notorious gang when a suspect inside a targeted 
home panicked and tossed startling -- and unexpected -- evidence out the 
window: a plastic bag full of money wrappers from the Aladdin Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrappers -- typically used by casinos to hold bundles of bills -- were 
marked $100 and $500 and stamped with the name of the Aladdin, where five 
bandits in gloves and ski masks on Tuesday night staged a takeover-style 
robbery before hundreds of gamblers and casino employees. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third casino robbery in the past year that Las Vegas authorities 
now believe may have been committed by Los Angeles gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a fortuitous thing," Los Angeles Police Detective Richard Marks 
said of Thursday's early-morning arrests of three men and a 17-year-old boy at 
the home where the money wrappers were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house, according to Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, police found $600 
and a receipt for hamburgers and fries from a Las Vegas Burger King dated Feb. 
21, the day before the heist at the Aladdin casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kroeker said the evidence provides a strong link between the four 
suspects and the casino robbery, one resident of the home said the four have an 
alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous," declared Leola Diaz, who said her brother and two sons were 
among the four suspects taken away by the swarm of officers who showed up at 
her home at about 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could they be in Vegas and be here at the same time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police identified the four arrested as Henry Diaz, 33, Bryon Diaz, 
21, Charles Logan, 20, and a 17-year-old juvenile, and said they were booked on 
fugitive robbery charges stemming from the casino incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas police said the massive Aladdin gambling hall was packed at 9:30 
p.m. Tuesday when the robbers burst through its northwest doors. The room was 
so jammed, in fact, that scores of people failed at first even to hear the 
shouted commands to hit the floor over the din from the slot machines and the 
lounge orchestra, Lt. Mike Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 While three of the bandits stood guard, waving pistols and a double-barreled 
sawed-off shotgun, Hawkins said, the other two slipped under the bars of the 
cashier's cage. Shoving a cage worker to the ground, they then began stuffing 
stacks of money into pillowcases they had brought along. 
</P>
<P>
 As they fled, their guns trained on the crowd, they tried briefly to abduct a 
woman who was standing outside the hotel -- located on the famed Vegas Strip -- 
passing out Aladdin promotional leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 But when two security guards began to converge on them, Hawkins said, they 
released the woman and roared away in a Chevrolet van. The van, which turned 
out to have been stolen on Monday from a Los Angeles motorist, was found 
abandoned in the parking lot of an apartment complex about a half-mile from the 
hotel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No shots were fired, and the entire incident was over within two minutes, the 
Las Vegas police official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said the robbery -- captured on hotel surveillance videotape -- was 
Las Vegas' third casino heist in a year. In recent months, bandits have twice 
robbed the casino cage at the San Remo Hotel casino, which is about a 
half-block off the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 All three robberies, he said, are believed to have been committed by Southern 
California street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD's Kroeker agreed that the Las Vegas robbery appears to be the latest 
criminal activity committed outside the state by Los Angeles gangs, which for 
years have been linked to robberies and narcotics trafficking nationwide. 
Usually the gangs set up temporary residence in a city first, Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's raid, however, was aimed at curtailing operations of a local Los 
Angeles gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation -- carried out by the LAPD, the state Department of Corrections 
and federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents -- was the culmination of a 
four-month homicide and narcotics investigation, Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy chief would not identify the targeted gang, but residents of the 
Dalton Street neighborhood where Diaz lives said the 2600 block is controlled 
by the Rollin' 20s, a faction of the Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the block is lined with neatly-kept one- and two-story homes, the 
walls are scrawled with the gang's logo and Diaz's neighbors say it is common 
to hear gunfire at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dalton Street home was one of 23 locations that were raided at dawn on 
Thursday in South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles, Kroeker said. A total of 
12 alleged gang members were arrested on various charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed at the police news conference, along with the evidence from the 
Dalton Street home, were shotguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, several bags 
of marijuana and an additional $2,600 in cash, all confiscated during the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the casino cash haul still unaccounted for, Los Angeles police 
said the investigation is continuing and more arrests are expected. Las Vegas 
police were flying into town to assist.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SUNLAND; MAN KILLED 
AFTER WALKING IN FRONT OF METROLINK TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified man was killed in Sunland on Thursday by a Metrolink train 
about 40 feet west of the spot where a bicyclist who ignored an engineer's 
warning signals was killed three weeks ago, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told Metrolink officials that Thursday's victim was carrying several 
duffel-type bags that he placed on the ground next to the tracks before walking 
into the path of the oncoming train, Metrolink spokesman Francisco Oaxaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, crossing barriers, bells and flashing lights 
signaled a train approaching, but the victim apparently ignored them, Oaxaca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident took place at 6:27 p.m., about 40 feet from a railroad crossing 
at San Fernando Road and Sunland Boulevard, Oaxaca said. "As far as we can 
tell, the victim made no attempt to get out of the way of the train," Oaxaca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who Oaxaca said ignored repeated blasts from the train's whistle, 
was hit by a train headed from Union Station to Canyon Country.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
OFFERS TO PAY DAMAGES IN RODNEY KING BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles, in an effort to put the Rodney G. King beating case behind it, 
offered Thursday to admit liability for the motorist's beating and pay "actual 
damages" for King's injuries -- a settlement a federal judge indicated he will 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge John Davies said the proposal, which he called 
"unusual and imaginative," probably won't save the city from a lengthy civil 
trial in which the now-familiar issues of the police beating are replayed 
through the testimony of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants have a heightened right to defend against punitive damages," 
Davies said, predicting that testimony on that question will take many weeks. 
"The saving in time may occur but it won't be as great as we may think," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Skip Miller, representing the city, told the judge: "The city wants 
to put this incident behind the city and the citizens of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies said he understood the city to be saying, "We are responsible for 
everything that happened to Mr. King." However, he said this does not decide 
the liability of individual officers who beat King on March 3, 1991, and jurors 
will have to decide if and when the officers crossed the line into excessive 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 King did not attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies said he plans to go ahead with the civil trial March 22, indicating 
that any chances for a full settlement of King's lawsuit have evaporated.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; D.A. TO 
PURSUE CASTRATION CASE DESPITE RECONCILIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A prosecutor vowed Thursday to convict a woman accused of cutting off her 
husband's testicles with a pair of scissors -- even though the couple have 
reconciled and want to stay out of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not him vs. her.It's the people of the state of California vs. her," 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Longo said of the case against Aurelia Macias, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias pleaded not guilty to felony mayhem in the Sept. 20, 1992, attack on 
Jaime Macias, 39. If convicted, she could receive eight years in prison. An 
enhancement of great bodily injury could add three years to the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias allegedly cut off her husband's testicles as he slept in a drunken 
stupor after a baptismal party for the daughter of a neighbor, Longo said. She 
was angry because she believed her husband had been unfaithful, Longo said. 
Their 17-year-old son awoke to screams from his parents' bedroom and found his 
father bleeding in bed. A pair of bloody five-inch scissors were lying in the 
kitchen, Longo said. The testicles were never found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurelia Macias' attorney, Nan Whitfield, has said that her client had been 
abused by her husband and that he had extramarital affairs. Longo denied those 
charges, although he did acknowledge that police were called to the Macias home 
in 1990 after Macias allegedly slapped his wife. No charges were filed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; FAULTY GAS 
HEATER BLAMED IN DEATH OF 10-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year-old boy died and three people were hospitalized with carbon monoxide 
poisoning apparently caused by a faulty natural gas heater, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, whose names were not immediately released, were discovered 
unconscious by a neighbor in a Mentone Avenue home about 11:40 a.m., Fire Capt. 
John Penido said.Paramedics took the victims to St. Luke Medical Center and 
Huntington Memorial Hospital, Penido said. The boy died at 12:55 p.m. at 
Huntington, hospital spokesman Steve Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 35-year-old woman was in serious condition at Huntington, Willis said. The 
conditions of the other two victims at St. Luke were not available. All three 
were being transferred to Northridge Hospital Medical Center for hyperbaric 
oxygen treatment, Willis said. Investigators believe a malfunctioning natural 
gas heater filled the home with carbon monoxide, Penido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Estrada, spokeswoman for Southern California Gas Co., said inspectors 
found a soot-clogged vent on a wall heater and high readings of carbon monoxide 
in the home.

 A 15-year-old boy was shot in the back Thursday at a high school campus in 
Whittier, the apparent victim of a gang attack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when a group of youths in a car 
drove up to the victim as he stood on a playing field at Frontier High School, 
Whittier Police Lt. Dave Carlisle said . 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that one of the youths shouted gang names at the victim 
before shooting him with a .380-caliber handgun. The group fled in the car, 
which was found abandoned about an hour later in the 13500 block of Virginia 
Avenue just outside the city limits, Carlisle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the owner of the vehicle in connection with the shooting. 
Arturo Jimenez, 18, of Whittier was booked on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was taken by helicopter to Martin Luther King Jr. Medical Center. 
No details of his condition were immediately available, a nursing supervisor 
said.

SKELETON FOUND IN CONCRETE BELIEVED TO BE MISSING BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 An anonymous phone call to Los Angeles police has led to the grisly discovery 
of a child's remains entombed in a trash can filled with concrete, and 
detectives said Thursday the victim is believed to be the brother of a girl 
whose body also was found encased in concrete last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the trash can Tuesday at a Public Storage facility in 
South-Central Los Angeles near the Harbor Freeway after the tipster said the 
girl's missing brother could be found in a storage facility somewhere on 
Manchester Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information provided by the caller and evidence found in the storage 
unit, police arrested Maurice Nathaniel Moore, 21, Wednesday on suspicion of 
murder and will seek an additional murder charge against Moore's mother, Madie 
Lee Moore, 43, said Detective Eric Campos of the Newton Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Madie Moore is scheduled to go on trial Monday in the murder of 8-year-old 
Latoya Harris, whose body was found in July encased in concrete in a 30-gallon 
trash can behind Moore's rented South-Central home. Moore was the girl's aunt 
and legal guardian.  
</P>
<P>
 Following the tipster's call, Campos said, a metal can was removed from the 
storage complex at 345 W. Manchester and taken to the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office, where the concrete was chipped apart Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office, said the body "appears to 
be a child. We will have to call in an anthropologist to examine the bones and 
determine the sex and race and hopefully establish the cause of death." 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the child found Tuesday may have been dead for several years. 
"When we were investigating Latoya Harris' death we learned there was a brother 
that was missing, and nobody knew for some time where he was," Campos said.

PIZZERIA OWNER WINS SUIT OVER RIOT DAMAGE; COURTS: INSURERS ARE ORDERED TO PAY 
$7 MILLION TO DOMINO'S FRANCHISEE. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE LARGEST AWARD TO RESULT 
FROM THE CIVIL UNREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In what is believed to be the largest judgment stemming from the 1992 riots, a 
Los Angeles Superior Court jury has awarded more than $7 million to the owner 
of a Domino's pizza franchise that was burned out during the civil disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordered to pay, under verdicts returned Wednesday and Thursday, were the 
Insurance Co. of North America and the Gold Cities Insurance Agency -- which 
jointly refused to pay the approximately $200,000 claim submitted by Dennis 
Stephan, according to his suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said Stephan was awarded punitive damages of $6,484,790 from 
the insurance company, along with more than $500,000 in compensatory damages, 
attorneys fees and other expenses from the insurance company and the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The franchise owner's attorney, Jay Elliott, said his client feels vindicated 
by the verdict returned in the court of Judge Ray Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices of David Gorney, attorney for the agency, and Stewart Brody, 
lawyer for the insurance company, did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his suit filed in April, Stephan said that several months before the riots, 
he entered into an oral insurance contract with Gold Cities under which 
insurance was to be provided for his pizza shop at 643 E. El Segundo Blvd., 
which was on an unincorporated strip of land between the cities of Los Angeles 
and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said his client understood that this coverage would provide him with 
$100,000 coverage for personal property, along with coverage for the loss of up 
to 12 months income. When the place was gutted by fire April 30, 1992, Stephan 
filed a claim for the losses, which totaled about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that the companies refused to pay the full benefits to which 
he was entitled, saying the oral contract did not provide the coverage Stephan 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 In their verdicts handed down Wednesday and Thursday, the jury found that Gold 
Cities was negligent and that the Insurance Co. of North America breached "its 
duty of good faith and fair dealing."

SUSPECT IN HATCHET MURDER MAY BE A SATANIST, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 An 89-year-old woman may have been hacked to death in her Glendale home 
earlier this month as a "human sacrifice" to the devil, according to a sworn 
police affidavit filed to obtain a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police insisted Wednesday that they are still unsure of the motive 
for the hatchet attack on Josephine Adinolfi, but the search warrant affidavit 
gives a chilling description of an investigator's belief that homicide suspect 
David Condry may have been driven by a belief in Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her death, Adinolfi had for the past six years rented the 31-year-old 
Condry a little house behind her neat, white-frame house on West Salem Street. 
Investigator William R. Currie's search warrant affidavit paints a scene of 
horror as Adinolfi's grandson, Augustus Pisano, entered her home Feb. 8 and was 
attacked by a screaming Condry wielding a hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although wounded in the attack, Pisano managed to subdue Condry and then found 
the nude body of his grandmother in a bedroom where she apparently had been 
hacked to death, Currie stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Condry, who is jailed on suspicion of murder, told police that he had struck 
Adinolfi with a hatchet, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 When booked, Currie wrote, officers discovered "the suspect was wearing a 
pentagram -- a five-pointed star associated with satanic rituals" on a chain 
around his neck, and he also had a magazine clipping with headlines about human 
sacrifice and satanic slayings.

A SHOW OF THEIR OWN; * THE PALOMINO'S BARNDANCE IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE 
COUNTRY MUSICIANS CAN PLAY ORIGINAL MATERIAL. BUT THE PROGRAM ISN'T DRAWING 
CROWDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paul Marshall has paid his dues, which is what country music has always been 
about. Country legends such as Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, Johnny Cash and 
Waylon Jennings made it the hard way, after years of playing low-pay beer bars 
and one-night stands in joints that Haggard used to call the "fightin' and 
dancin' clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 44, of Tujunga, has been singing and playing bass guitar on the 
country-Western circuit for more than 20 years. He's played as a sideman for 
Hank Thompson, Johnny Tillotson and Johnny Rodriguez. He's been named 
California Country Music Assn. bass player of the year, and he's had songs 
recorded by Juice Newton and Highway 101. His ballad "Learning to Forgive" is 
on Patty Loveless' new album, and "C'mon, C'mon" is on the new Boy Howdy album. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Barndance show at the Palomino club in North Hollywood, Marshall is 
playing his own songs with his band, the Marshall Plan. Like most 
country-Western singer-songwriters, Marshall's dream is to get a recording 
contract for himself. He's seen other L.A. groups play at the Tuesday-night 
Barndance on their way to getting label deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Barndance night at the Palomino, a weekly showcase for local country 
musicians, is practically the only place in Los Angeles where country musicians 
can play original material. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the local clubs," says Marshall, who's played them all, "you pretty much 
have to stick to tunes off country-Western radio playlists. People don't want 
to hear songs they haven't heard before." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a real irony, in a genre of pop music in which most performers 
traditionally write their own material, and original songs are the primary 
means of getting noticed by record labels and promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barn Dance is produced as a nonprofit venture by Ronnie Mack, 39, of Los 
Angeles, as a place for musicians to present original material and also to 
perform the traditional country music repertoire that no longer is played in 
country dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm trying to get across with the Barndance," says Mack, a gangly, 
gregarious, 6-foot-5 native of Baltimore, "is that country music is a form of 
American culture. I'm trying to help maintain the integrity of the music and 
its roots. That's not an issue for country radio stations, or the Nashville 
Establishment, but it is for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, a singer-songwriter-guitarist who describes himself as a "mediocre 
talent," has made the presentation and preservation of what he calls "roots" 
country music in Los Angeles a personal crusade. Since founding Barndance in 
1988, he has put considerable energy and money into the show. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no admission charge for Barndance, unlike the other nights at the 
Palomino, when the door charge ranges from $6 to $10. But even with free 
admission, Barndance rarely fills the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that country music doesn't seem to be making it that well in Los 
Angeles," says Linda Cauthen, editor of the Los Angeles-based Country Fever, a 
country music magazine. "We lost our oldest country radio station -- KLAC -- 
and some of the country-Western clubs are closing. People don't realize there 
always has been a country music scene in L.A. -- back through Buck Owens and 
Merle Haggard, all the way to the movie cowboy days." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palomino was part of the Los Angeles country music scene as far back as 
1949, when it opened. Most of the legends in country music played at the 
Palomino during the 1950s and 1960s, before and after they became stars. But in 
the late 1980s, the club gradually shifted from country to rock. Now, Barndance 
is the only country music night at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Ronnie Mack does with 'The Barndance' is as important a thing as you can 
do for a music community," says Rene Engel, host of the eclectic Monday-night 
country music show "Citybilly" on KPPC 98.3-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives you a chance to see someone before they make it big," Engel says. 
"And then they keep showing up on his show. But it's a real tough row to hoe. 
There isn't a lot of local support for the music he puts on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Mack introduces another local group, the Plowboys, after Paul Marshall 
leaves the stage. They kick off with "She's Gone to Austin," a driving, 
up-tempo rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our Saturday-night Texas fighting song," says the singer, in jeans, 
Levi's jacket, red neckerchief, black cowboy hat and Western boots. "Now we're 
gonna do a song about the town of Abilene." 
</P>
<P>
 The song has a powerful, hard-hitting beat, and there's warm applause when 
it's over and Mack takes the microphone to talk up the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hear it for the Plowboys," Mack says, after their performance, with his 
exuberant, upbeat delivery. "That's the kind of music that shows the 
'Achey-Breakey' crowd that there's more to country music than guys with big 
muscles and the T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack is openly derisive of much of the country music played on the radio -- 
with the monster hit "Achey-Breakey Heart" by young hunk Billy Ray Cyrus a 
particular target of scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feature the real roots music here on the Barndance," Mack says, as he 
kicks off a song with the Barndance band, "and this music will be around after 
that stuff has gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During its tenuous six-year life, Barndance has been featured on a number of 
FM radio stations. But one, KCSN (88.5) at Cal State Northridge, turned from 
country to classical, and two others changed their programming. 
</P>
<P>
 With minimal advertising and promotion, Barndance has seen the debut of a 
number of local artists and groups that went on to recording success. Rosie 
Flores, Chris Gaffney, James Intveld, Lone Justice and Lucinda Williams are all 
veterans of Barndance. So are Boy Howdy, Highway 101 and Karin Tobin. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, when country music and country dancing seemed like the new wave in 
San Fernando Valley clubs, Barndance temporarily pulled up stakes and moved to 
In Cahoots, a popular country-Western dance club in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, and the management of In Cahoots, hoped that the drinking and dancing 
crowd would warm to the sound of original country music -- and the roots of the 
tunes they listened to on the radio. They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hated us at In Cahoots," Mack says, without exaggeration. "They wanted 
their tush-push, their 'Achey-Breakey,' their 'Boot Scootin' Boogie,' their 
line-dancing songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we went over there, I had a theory that if you just expose people to 
music they can't hear on mainstream radio, they'll hear it and say, 'Wow, 
that's really cool.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But that turned out to be wrong. People want what they want, and at L.A. 
country-Western clubs, they want what they hear on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 The sojourn at In Cahoots, which lasted only a few weeks, was an experience in 
frustration and hostility for Barndance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dancers didn't like us because the show wasn't music off the radio," Mack 
says. "It was so bad, even our musicians said, 'Man, we don't belong here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mack threw in the towel when an angry customer jumped on stage and 
told the band: 'We don't want your . . . show. We wanta' dance. We want stuff 
we've heard before. You're in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mack took the show back to the Palomino last fall, to a small but loyal 
audience. The celebration of Barndance's return to the venerable Palomino, 
though, was dampened by rumors in January that the club was going to be turned 
into a billiard parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no truth to that rumor," owner Bill Thomas says. "I was considering 
it, but I'm not going to. The Palomino's going to stay open." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumored closing brought a show of support from musicians and fans. The 
show went on Jan. 18, the night after the Northridge earthquake closed most 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Barndance's sixth anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had over 135 people that night," Mack says. "That's a pretty good turnout 
the night after the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack has no illusions about the security of Barndance. It is a marginal night 
for the Palomino, even with free admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad people won't come out to hear alternative country acts, even for 
free," Mack says. "But I don't feel negative about it. If I die tomorrow, I 
would die happy. I've been putting this show on for six years, and we're still 
here." WHERE AND WHEN

IN THE HARD BOP MODE; * IN VOGUE FOR A DECADE, THE RHYTHMIC STYLE FELL FROM 
FAVOR WHEN JAZZ TOOK A MORE FREE-FORM TURN. BUT THE HARDBOP QUINTET IS DEVOTED 
TO KEEPING IT ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creamy blends of saxophones and trumpets delivering alluring, bluesy melodies, 
followed by involved yet come-hither solos that are underpinned by 
make-you-move rhythms -- these are just some of the earmarks of the music 
called hard bop. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 1955 to 1965, hard bop was the form of jazz in vogue, and it was 
played by most of the then-active greats, among them trumpeter Miles Davis, 
saxophonist Sonny Rollins, pianist Horace Silver and drummer Art Blakey. Hard 
bop fell from favor in the early-to-mid '60s as a less-structured, freer style 
of jazz, typified by saxophonists John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, came to 
the fore. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, hard bop is having something of a revival, and pianist Keith 
Saunders is one of its staunchest advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hard bop was an extremely creative period, and it flew by so fast," says 
Saunders, a former resident of Van Nuys who lives in Queens, N.Y. "I'm trying 
to find a way to take that great hard-bop thing of melody and harmony and put 
it in a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's succeeding. Saunders is the pianist and spokesman for the HardBop 
Quintet, a group of five New York City-area residents -- the others are 
saxophonist Jerry Weldon, trumpeter Joe Magnarelli, bassist Bim Strasberg and 
drummer Ed Ornowski -- devoted to playing originals and classics in the 
hard-bop mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized after four of its members toured Japan in 1990, the band plays 
tonight and Saturday at Jax in Glendale. It will also appear Saturday afternoon 
at the Pedrini Music Showcase Theatre in Alhambra and Sunday at the Hamlet in 
Cambria. 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders, 33, and his partners revere the tunes that exemplified hard bop, 
such as Silver's "Nica's Dream" and Lee Morgan's "The Sidewinder." Still, the 
musicians have chosen to focus on their own compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll never get anywhere unless we do," Saunders says frankly. "There are 
millions of bands that play tunes like 'Nica's Dream' exactly as they were 
recorded. If we did that, we'd make the tune sound good, but anybody could buy 
a record by Horace and hear him play it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas, if we play our own songs, they sound fresh while being steeped in 
the hard-bop tradition. Those compositions are what set us apart from other 
bands." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist says that often the selections contain interludes, which are 
colorful written sections played between solos, as well as shout choruses -- 
intense, rhythmic passages that climax a number and are played by the entire 
ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those elements add to the music," he says. "We need as much variety as we can 
get, to make the music interesting for the audience, and for us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders looks to Silver as a major personal and group influence. "If I had to 
compare us to a classic group, the band we probably feel closest to is 
Horace's. His songs have sublime melodies and are rhythmically very 
sophisticated. They make you feel good. He's done for small-band jazz what Duke 
Ellington did for the orchestra. We're definitely influenced by his sound." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The HardBop Quintet does play a few Silver compositions, but only the more 
arcane ones, such as "The Outlaw" and "Cookin' at the Continental." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the quintet have appeared with such notables as Harry Connick Jr. 
(Weldon), Toshiko Akiyoshi (Magnarelli) and Richie Cole (Saunders). The group 
is making headway in New York, where it performs in such rooms as Visiones and 
Birdland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band is first-rate," wrote Jennifer Dunning in the New York Times. "It's 
a deft ensemble whose members work in tight complicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Vibist Charlie Shoemake, who performs with bands at Hamlet in Cambria, hasn't 
heard the group, but adds, "Anything that Keith is associated with is bound to 
be good. He's a very exciting, creative player who really knows the tradition 
of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders hopes the California tour, and an upcoming CD the band is producing 
itself, will increase the quintet's visibility. "We're not famous now, but I 
expect that in 10 years, we'll be known," he says. "We are a band that has a 
distinct personality, that has a sound. I'm glad to be a part of it." WHERE AND

GROWING BLUEGRASS; TONIGHT'S CONCERT IS INTENDED TO LURE NEW FANS TO THE GENRE 
PETE SEEGER CALLED 'FOLK MUSIC IN OVERDRIVE.'

<P>
 The energetic acoustic sounds of bluegrass music will escape the confines of 
local pizza parlors and other less celebrated venues through a series of 
concerts by nationally recognized artists, if the Bluegrass Assn. of Southern 
California has its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's performance by Lou Reid, Terry Baucom & Carolina at the Granada 
Hills Masonic Temple is the first of many concerts by major bluegrass acts that 
the group plans to organize in the hope of introducing new fans to the music 
Pete Seeger once called "folk music in overdrive." 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the show will be used to sponsor more concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "National bluegrass bands don't normally come to the L.A. area," said Sharon 
Cort, who organized the show for the Bluegrass Assn. and is a bluegrass 
musician. "Usually this kind of music is not commercially popular because it's 
not played on commercial radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to expose it to a wider audience," she said. "Sometimes it's 
perceived as being 'old men music' or something they heard on 'The Beverly 
Hillbillies.' It's more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid discovered that as a child growing up in Virginia, when his interest in 
the energy of rock music (and the Beatles in particular) ultimately led him to 
the fast-paced tempo of bluegrass. Now singing and playing mandolin and guitar 
with the Carolina quartet, Reid said he still sees much in common in the two 
musical genres. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of newer bands have a lot of energy, like in rock 'n' roll," Reid said 
this week from his home in Fredericksburg, Va. "It's a picker's paradise. You 
really get to play. You don't stand on the side of the stage and wait for your 
20 seconds to release your energy. You get to use the knowledge that you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid joined singer/banjo player Baucom, singer-guitarist Clay Jones and 
singer-bassist Marcus Smith after many years working as a successful sideman to 
several major country artists. He spent nearly five years recording and touring 
with Ricky Skaggs, and has played on recent albums by Vince Gill, Michael 
Martin Murphy and Vern Gosin. Reid also was a member of the popular 
folk-bluegrass act Seldom Scene. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the mainstream country scene to refocus his energies on the genre of 
music and playing that has always been the most satisfying to him. Now Carolina 
is in its second year of touring, with plans to release a second album in 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just love the music," said Baucom of the mixture of country, American folk 
and blues ultimately perfected by Bill Monroe and Earl Scruggs in the 1940s. 
"My dad still plays it. It's in my blood. I really enjoy listening to it, and 
it's even more fun to play it." 
</P>
<P>
 For fans, bluegrass performances offer a more relaxed communal atmosphere too 
often missing from rock and country shows. Howard Yearwood, a West Hills 
musician who hosts a bluegrass show Saturday mornings on KCSN-FM, said: "The 
artists are more accessible to the fans. There isn't any need for a backstage 
pass. You can go to any festival and pretty much mingle with the top talent." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a social phenomenon," said Cort. "We need to get more people exposed to 
the music. I really feel that if they heard it they would like it." WHERE AND 
WHEN

FAITH IN THE MUSIC; * COUNTRY SINGER GEARY HANLEY SAYS FANS NOW ENTHRALLED BY 
HIT RECORDS WILL AGAIN FLOCK TO LIVE GIGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Local country singers are finding some irony on the club scene these days. 
That's because while the likes of Garth Brooks and Billy Ray Cyrus are taking 
the genre to a massive new pop audience, those still toiling at the local level 
are finding clubs more interested in spinning the newest hit records than they 
are in booking live musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to give any fiddler or pedal-steel player an achy-breaky heart. 
"Back in the 'Urban Cowboy' days it was the same thing," says singer-guitarist 
Geary Hanley, reminiscing about that early-'80s country craze, without a hint 
of bitterness or worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley has been playing this circuit, in clubs across Los Angeles, the San 
Fernando Valley and beyond, for more than 20 years. He has faith that the fans 
and gigs will return as they have before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll want to go back to listening to live music more," Hanley 
says. "They'll get bored with the songs that the deejays play day after day. 
You can hear those on the radio. With a band there is more versatility." 
</P>
<P>
 The country music veteran will test that theory tonight when he brings his 
Geary Hanley Band to the Country Club in Reseda, where the quintet will be the 
first act in a long series of country shows at the venue. Hanley will perform 
his usual mix of originals, country music chestnuts by Merle Haggard and George 
Jones, and newer hits by Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a great voice and great stage presence," says Marilyn Crispen, who 
booked Hanley at the now-defunct Longhorn Saloon for several years, before 
bringing him to the Country Club for a night of the two-step, country waltzes 
and line-dancing. "He's got a deep voice, kind of like a Merle Haggard, very 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his longtime musical idol Haggard, Hanley was born in Oklahoma. He left 
the small farm community of his youth in 1969 to join the Marines, when he was 
assigned to Camp Pendleton and first sampled the Southern California country 
music scene. Hanley ultimately decided to settle in Thousand Oaks and pursue a 
music career on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad encouraged me when I explained to him that was what I wanted to do," 
says Hanley, now 46 and with a wife and 15-year-old daughter of his own. "That 
was really great. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew that I really wanted to do this particular thing. I knew that I 
couldn't pursue it much in Oklahoma. There weren't that many places to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Hanley released two albums in the mid-'80s on the Nashville-based 
independent Kansa Records label and watched five of his singles reach the 
Cashbox country top 100. During some of those years, Hanley performed as part 
of singer-actor John Schneider's touring band, back when the former "Dukes of 
Hazzard" star was playing such hits as "Country Girls" and "I've Been Around 
Enough to Know." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley says he enjoyed that experience, but isn't anxious to join the band of 
another national touring artist. "I'm not too interested in doing that anymore 
unless it's my own deal," he says. "The road can be long and hard. If I'm out 
there pushing my own stuff, it's a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 While he does spend a lot of his stage time playing the music of other 
artists, he often squeezes at least three originals into each of his usual two 
or three 45-minute sets. Among those would be "Guitar Picker from the Lonely 
Side of Town" and "The Pride of Texas." He's also just signed a deal with the 
Los Angeles-based Ten Squared Records to record a new 12-song CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Okie songs, though," Hanley says with a laugh. "I haven't written any. I 
don't know why." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 Who: Geary Hanley Band, with special guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: The Country Club, 18415 Sherman Way, Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 tonight. 
</P>

 Price: Ticket prices undetermined at press time, but free admission is offered 
to those who bring an item of Western memorabilia (wagon wheel, rodeo buckle, 
etc.) to decorate the club.

A SHOW OF FACES; * THE 'PORTRAIT' EXHIBIT FEATURES WORKS BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS 
FROM 18 MONTHS TO 81 YEARS OLD. THE CURATOR CALLS IT A WAY TO 'CELEBRATE 
PEOPLE.'

<P>
 Less than 48 hours after "Fires: A Community Art Show" opened at the New 
Canyon Gallery to help the community heal from the November fires, the 
Northridge earthquake rattled through. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing resulted in some ironic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 During the "Fires" opening, "Eames Demetrios showed a continuous video 
time-lapse loop of the firestorm, shot from a vantage point that no longer 
exists; the earthquake has since tumbled away the palisades bluff where his 
camera was set up," wrote exhibit co-curator Barbara King in a recent issue of 
the Santa Monica Mountains twice-monthly newspaper, the Messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake shook artwork off the walls and delayed the New Canyon Gallery's 
opening of its next exhibit, the second annual invitational "Portrait Show," by 
one week. That show is now on view, covering the walls from floor to ceiling 
with about 150 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and sculptures by 56 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all the recent traumas, curator Ainslie Pryor says, "I wanted this show 
to be a celebration. We're just ready to celebrate people and the human spirit 
and beautiful paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to find images of celebrities or popular public officials here. 
Pryor, a writer and illustrator of children's books who describes herself as 
the show's "judge, jury and hangman," asked those who wanted to participate to 
submit work that has some personal meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two self-portraits mingle with the faces of family members, pets, 
students, neighbors, friends and lovers. Among Pryor's own paintings in the 
show are a life-size self-portrait that was damaged during the earthquake, and 
a large canvas of her dog, "Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the organizers of the "Fires" show, Pryor emphasized the importance of 
inviting people from the larger community to join in the "Portrait Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "People get excited about being in the show and do work for the show. I find 
it very exciting for artists to get together and share the experience of seeing 
their work on the wall," she said. Apparently, seeing one's work in a gallery 
show was the real motivation for many of these artists. Only about half of the 
pieces on view are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Participants range in age from 18-month-old Danielle Boucher -- who has made 
several line drawings of faces (which actually look like faces) -- to 
81-year-old Beatrice Welles. Her paintings, "Cowboy" and "Chief Joseph," 
express a hearty fondness for the men of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Moskowitz created a cool and colorful neon-like self-portrait with an 
economy of detail. "It looks exactly like him," Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Roberts' zany "Co-Zap" is anything but a classical image. This highly 
stylized individual, with taunting tongue and tough demeanor, almost dares 
viewers not to get too close. But ultimately, "Co-Zap" is amusing. So is Robin 
Scott Walker's ink drawing, "Portrait of a Marriage." On the floor with their 
backs to each other, this man and woman seem to be down for the count. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Mississippi has made an affectionate watercolor of Topanga Canyon's 
local bread-seller, "Rudy." Gerard Bourgeois surely warmed the heart of his 
sister with his loving painting, "Ma Soeur." Susan Santiago captures the 
essence of two of her inner-city high school students in her bold composition, 
"Crenshaw Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Messenger editor Colin Penno created the assemblage "Crack in the Canyon," 
using a photograph he shot of Betsy Moline in her home after the earthquake 
struck. The house in Topanga's Glenview area crumbled during the quake, and it 
was recently torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Penno surrounded the picture with broken plaster from the house, which is seen 
in his photograph. Those elements have been mounted on plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, 7-year-old Noah Saltman had brought Pryor his drawing of Jiminy 
Crickett. She asked him to try again with something more personal. He returned 
with a striking photograph of the family cat, "Felix," which he shot, developed 
and printed. Perhaps his mother, K Saltman, who is a photographer, gave him a 
little help. She is represented here by her 1987 image, "Faerie," of her young 
daughter, Erin. Erin, and Erin and Noah's brother, Elan, also have drawings in 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite the Saltmans' works is Pryor's "baby wall," dominated by the Bateman 
family. Laura Bateman, the mother of five daughters, has contributed images of 
two of her girls. Her daughters are responsible for the three other images: 
Camille drew Danielle, Danielle shows us Sally Anne, and Sally Anne presents an 
image of Annie. WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Portrait Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: New Canyon Gallery, 129 S. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga.

 Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 4 p.m. Sundays. Ends

LIFE IN THE BIKE LANE; EXERCISE AND ECOLOGY ARE A FEW REASONS THAT MORE PEOPLE 
ARE TAKING UP CYCLING. MANY ENJOY THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF CLUBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 He swaggers on two wheels, fighting head winds that howl through the Santa 
Susana Pass, chomping on PowerBars for quick energy, thumbing his nose at 
Father Time. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Wolfe is a swashbuckling 62-year-old who conquers hills on a bicycle the 
way GIs attacked ammo dumps in Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 His idea of leisure fun is getting up early on Saturday mornings and keeping 
fast company on his bicycle from Chatsworth to Simi Valley and back -- a 
punishing, 60-mile round trip that a fellow rider long ago ghoulishly nicknamed 
the Barry Wolfe Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 His companions in the Warner Velo cycling club of Woodland Hills (115 members, 
including 85 licensed racers) worship him as a patron saint of the fast lane, 
the patriarch of bicycling in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the oldest member of our club -- but in many ways, he's the youngest," 
says Steve Burton, 39, a founder-director of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "A legend in my own mind," Wolfe wisecracks at his North Hollywood engineering 
firm, in an office filled with 30-odd years of trophies and other memorabilia 
from competitive cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising that Wolfe scoffs at so-called recreational cyclists -- 
including virtually all 550 members of the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club and 
most of the estimated 99 million Americans who, according to the Washington, 
D.C.-based Bicycle Federation of America, an advocacy group, ride for fun, 
exercise, sociability, environmental appreciation and even to commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they do is ride to eat -- and eat to ride," Wolfe says. "They're 
basically tourists. They go from McDonald's to McDonald's -- Tour de 
McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 To which they retort, "Good for us!" They say they'll take fast food over the 
fast lane any time, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to stop and get something to eat and drink, even if you're not 
hungry or thirsty. You're burning up calories, even though you may not feel 
tired at all," says Maria Fribourg, 52, of Woodland Hills. She's the president 
of the San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club, which offers weekend rides (round 
trip: 25, 50 or 100 miles) with such names as the Woodland Hills Wiggle, 
Masochists' Mirth on Mountainous Mulholland, Ring Around the Rose Bowl and Pig 
Out at Paty's (a Toluca Lake coffee shop). 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you don't eat," Fribourg adds, "you do something we call 'bonking' -- 
which means you have no energy left and you have to get off your bike and stop. 
If you're a runner, it's like crashing into a wall. You feel like lying down 
and taking a nap. . . . You just need some sugar and carbohydrates, and you're 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the kinds of choices that make bicycling so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pastime that lets the young and the young at heart choose their own 
paths. It's for loners and joiners, families and friends. It's a trip around 
the block, a race across America. It's a statement against air and noise 
pollution, against stress brought on by clogged arteries -- in people and in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for the enthusiast who keeps it simple -- pedaling a department-store 
bike with a standard steel frame for, say, $200, in T-shirt and jeans -- or the 
one who opts for extravagance: a 21-speed with a titanium frame and $400 
shocks, $200 headlights, a $100 handlebar-mounted computer to monitor speed and 
mileage and myriad other bells and whistles that can drive some bicycles from a 
pricey $2,500 to a very-top-of-the-line $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And when you tally up Styrofoam helmets ($25 to $75), padded-crotch stretch 
shorts ($25 to $50), stiff-soled shoes ($40 to $75 pair) and dazzling, 
neon-colored jerseys ($30 to $70) of porous, synthetic fabric that "breathes," 
it's clear that bicycling is a tour de force as both sport and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for spenders big or small, happiness is simply a bike path with a 
see-forever view, a whoosh of mountain air in the face and cold swigs from 
plastic bottles or tubes attached to backpack containers called "CamelbaKs." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "There are days when I just like to go out and pedal slowly -- I don't have to 
ride hard every day," says Shanna Hadlock, 38, of Calabasas, a mother of three 
and an international racer who trains by riding five days a week -- 150 miles a 
week in winter, 250 in summer. "If I rode hard all the time," she adds, "I 
wouldn't enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Steve Burton, a Woodland Hills attorney who helped organize the Warner Velo 
club, cycling offers not just the rush of competition but a way to "meet people 
from other walks of life -- people I'd never have met otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jamie Griffis, 39, manager of the Canoga Park shop Bikesport and co-leader 
of a women's club called LA FORCE (Female Off-Road Cycling Enthusiasts), 
bicycling enables her to "get in touch with my child self again. And you see so 
much more on a bike at 15 miles an hour than you do in a car going 40 miles an 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 And to Maria Fribourg, who gave up running ("My knees started to hurt because 
of all the pounding"), cycling brings "joy to my life -- and as you talk with 
those you ride with, the miles go by so much faster. . . . It's the exercise 
and the social life combined. The two of them are unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
 About all these devotees ask is that we call them "cyclists." To them, biker 
dredges up not fanciers of sleek Univega or Mongoose bicycles but devotees of 
high-decibel Harleys, leather jackets and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same mentality, but a different instrument," says Doug Benedon, 38, 
a Woodland Hills civil-appellate attorney and founder-director of the Warner 
Velo club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, he adds, offers far more than just an ideal year-round climate 
for bicycling -- a sport, incidentally, long pursued by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thinks of L.A. as nothing more than Disneyland, smog and 
congestion," Benedon says. "But in L.A., we've got the Santa Monica Mountains, 
and you can ride into the canyons and see coyotes. You get to see a part of 
L.A. that most people don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Winning, 58, of West Hills agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. bashing is very much in vogue at the moment. Yet for me and thousands 
like me, Greater Los Angeles is the best urban bicycle-riding area in the 
world," Winning writes in "Short Bike Rides in and Around Los Angeles" (Globe 
Pequot Press), a newly published handbook. He adds that "some of the most 
fascinating territory is in the Santa Clarita Valley and Canyon Country, part 
of a bicycle rider's Los Angeles but outside of its political definition." 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century ago, bicycles were bulky contraptions with balloon tires, pedal 
brakes, fenders and mud flaps -- ridden almost exclusively by schoolchildren. 
But along came lighter, European-style three-speeds equipped with hand brakes, 
then state-of-the-art 10-speeds popular in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Valley-area riders continue reinventing their wheels in concert with 
America's fitness explosion. They cheered this country's winning cyclists in 
the 1984 Olympic Games, watched bicycle-themed feature films "Breaking Away" 
(1979) and "American Flyers" (1985) and more recently joined the hordes of 
get-away-from-it-alls who now buy mountain bikes (sturdier frames and heavier, 
knobby tires) instead of the more traditional road or touring bikes (lighter 
with skinny tires) by ratios as high as 9 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the sport has surged so far that when Winning began riding 
in 1967, he couldn't have felt lonelier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you saw an adult on a bicycle," he recalls, "he really stood out in a 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, local cycling buffs would converge on the Encino Velodrome, built 
in the early 1960s, where riders competed during weekends, and America's 1968 
Olympic trials took place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Veldrome -- at Oxnard Street and Louise Avenue -- offers more during 
its spring-summer season: Saturday night racing (March 26 to July 9 and Aug. 13 
to Sept. 17) and instruction on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, using 
so-called track bikes specially equipped for the Velodrome's banked, oval, 
concrete track measuring .17 mile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual, says Velodrome operator Rick Denman of Sylmar, for cyclists 
to learn to pedal at competition speeds of 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 And as bicycling for both fun and trophies continues to boom, it spawns a 
subculture with its own parlance, such as "drafting" (riding in single- or 
double-file to cut wind resistance) and "sweepers" (those who bring up the 
rear), as well as a literary presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning's handbook tracks cycling roadways such as mountaintop Mulholland 
Drive, interweaving them with morsels of little-known history. He writes, for 
instance, of Lankershim School in North Hollywood, where in 1938 a child named 
Norma Jean Baker won a high jump and the sobriquet "Norma Jean the jumping 
bean." Norma Jean grew up to become Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he refers to lovers-lane vistas on Mulholland where "L.A. police and 
private patrols have put a crimp in the romantic goings-on, but at times it's 
still hard to find a parking place at the better scenic overlooks." 
</P>
<P>
 But bicycling sometimes rumbles over rocky roads. Now and then, cyclists clash 
with joggers, hikers, backpackers and equestrians -- each group battling for 
space as Greater Los Angeles becomes increasingly crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the most skillful, experienced cyclists point out that their sport 
can be hazardous, particularly in heavy traffic or on roads with ruts, rocks or 
potholes. Although state law requires protective helmets for cyclists who are 
18 and younger, Barry Wolfe and other veterans strongly recommend that all 
adults wear them to guard against head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding in packs of 30 to 100, Wolfe says, demands painstaking concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people who wear headsets and listen to music while they ride are 
absolutely dumb," says Wolfe, who suffered a broken hip in a 1987 spill, after 
a stick accidentally spun into the spokes of the bicycle in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it takes is one guy to screw up," he adds, "and you'll have 100 guys on 
the pavement." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bob Winning's forehead was skin-grafted after a recent accident in traffic. 
"My helmet saved my life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club, which Winning serves as secretary and 
editor of a bimonthly newsletter, offers a symbol of valor to members who 
suffer a fracture while cycling: the Broken Bones Bicycle Brigade Patch, 
fittingly a purple heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the club's 1994 handbook points out, only one patch can be awarded per 
member. "If you break two bones, you get one patch. If you have a second or 
third accident and break more bones, it's tough, but you get only one patch." 
</P>
<P>
 So, let everyone be warned: Bicycling is not for wimps! 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as club members are advised, they can't just writhe in pain or 
black out and expect to wear the coveted Broken Bones Bicycle Brigade Patch. 
They must immediately collect their wits and make every effort to alert Allen 
Kessler, the honcho in charge of awarding patches. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you are lying in the road, if you are certain that you qualify for the 
patch," the handbook advises, "give the paramedics Allen's name and phone 
number along with any other information they may request." So You Want to Be a 
Cyclist? 
</P>

PREDICTABLE MORALITY TALE; * 'FREAK OF NATURE,' ABOUT A MODEL'S RISE TO 
SUPERSTARDOM, FAILS TO LET THE AUDIENCE MAKE ITS OWN CONNECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jo-Jo's a dog's name, modeling agent Tamara declares in Ken Hanes' play "Freak 
of Nature" at the Road Theatre Company. So what does Tamara rename her new 
modeling discovery? "Adam." 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying joke that runs through the rest of Hanes' caustic morality 
fable is that "Adam," the model (Ken Sawyer), is actually the dog on the leash 
held by Tamara (Maria Spassoff), while Jo-Jo is the free innocent. This is a 
golden leash, though, as Adam vaults into superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hanes' concept, it's a distinctly bitter superstardom, and the notion of a 
purely nice guy shot into a world of slime and money resembles nothing so much 
as Frank Capra's "Meet John Doe" with Gary Cooper. Sawyer's Jo-Jo, in fact, is 
very Cooper-like: ultra-laconic, studly, nearly blank, full of a likability 
bound to attract sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Hanes' concept goes beyond this -- way beyond. His fable begins 
in heaven, where Jo-Jo is instructed by God on life's purpose, which is to 
destroy other people. You get the idea that Hanes is not fond of God. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if Jo-Jo has made some kind of Faustian deal with the Almighty, then 
Tamara makes a Svengali deal with Jo-Jo: She'll take him far, but he has to 
follow orders, down to how much and whom to talk to at parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept syndrome keeps getting in the way. Alternating scenes of 
"fantasy" and "reality" (incredibly, identified as such on hard-to-spot, 
side-wall slide projections next to the stage) are meant to play off each 
other, and show us the anger building in our nice-guy hero. But they only add a 
plodding, schematic sensibility to an already predictable tale of fallen 
virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath both Hanes' play and Che'Rae Adams' staging is a fatal lack of 
trust in the audience to make its own connections. We are always way in front 
of the play's action, knowing all too well, for instance, that "Adam" will be 
caught in a tabloid scandal because Hanes telegraphs the danger so early. 
</P>
<P>
 -At this stage in its development, "Freak of Nature" is caught somewhere 
between the symbolic and the satiric, between profundity and simplicity. Like 
Jo-Jo, the play appears to want to tell its story with directness; like "Adam," 
it also appears to want it all, from romance to business drama to smart-ass 
comedy to a struggle between God and the devil. But without unexpected ideas to 
ponder or vital language to carry us along, "Freak" gets crushed under so many 
incompatible and competing forces. 
</P>
<P>
 It would help, of course, if Adams' cast maneuvered the peaks and valleys 
here. Instead, this is an uneven team, led by Sawyer's quietly boiling Jo-Jo 
and Spassoff's nicely acidic Tamara. Barbara Lindsay never convinces as a 
fashion industry hot-shot, nor does Elizabeth Tobias as the hot-shot's good 
teen-age daughter who aches for Jo-Jo's love. Carl Johnson's obviously gay 
photographer lacks the kind of competitive edge his character would have, but 
Jeff Corbett (as a personal trainer) and LaTonya Welsch (as a deformed nurse) 
know their professions well. WHERE AND WHEN

SONG OF THE SISTER; * 'I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER' ISN'T JUST ABOUT DAD AND 
SON, THE DIRECTOR SAYS. IT'S A WOMAN'S STORY, TOO. 
</P>

<P>
 For all those who think "I Never Sang for My Father" is a play about a son's 
relationship with his father, Juanin Clay has news for you: It's just as much a 
story about the grown-up daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the relationship of the daughter to both her parents is devastating 
-- and so timely now," says Clay, whose staging of Robert Anderson's 
10-character drama begins previews tonight at Group Repertory Theatre. "It's 
about what happens to young girls after (age) 8 that robs them of their 
confidence as they enter the male-defined worldview. It's such a universal 
story. You just change a couple of the references and it could happen anywhere. 
And it's just as much a woman's story as a man's." 
</P>
<P>
 Clay's introduction to the play came 15 years ago when an acting teacher 
suggested that she work on the sister role. "I've picked it up and reread it at 
least once a year ever since," she says. "People are always talking about the 
graying of America, taking care of the aging parent. I think the character's 
whole struggle in the play is not his parents dying, but wanting to make peace 
before they die. I see people struggling with those things all the time: 
loyalty, responsibility, the right to live one's own life." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of familial Angst was originally taken by Anderson from his own 
screenplay "The Tiger," and first produced on Broadway in 1968 by Gil Cates -- 
who also directed the 1970 film with Gene Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
 For her version, Clay has insisted that the four actors playing the Garrison 
clan meet at each other's houses for weekly "family" dinners. "It's as much to 
build a sense of familiarity as anything -- that ease you often don't see 
onstage when actors have only known each other six weeks," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Florence Schauffler, who plays matriarch Margaret Garrison opposite 
Logan Ramsay's Tom, has her own long-term connection with the material: She 
became friends with the playwright more than 50 years ago, when she was a young 
drama student in Boston. Anderson was then a Harvard student performing in her 
school's thrice-yearly productions -- he later married Schauffler's teacher, 
Phyllis Stohl. In the late '40s, Schauffler appeared in Anderson's play "Johnny 
Comes Marching Home" in New York and, in 1986, in his "Solitaire/Double 
Solitaire" at Group Rep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers of that generation -- I see a lot of my own mother" in Margaret's 
character, says the actress, who notes strong parallels between the 
relationships explored in "Solitaire" and "Father." 
</P>
<P>
 "The head of the family was the head of the family; families were not 
democracies. But in each play, mothers have a certain power: the caretakers, 
the woman's power. The crux of this story, I think, is everyone staying in 
their own place, and the difficulty of expressing love for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York's Westchester County, director Clay earned a bachelor's 
degree in economics at Smith College and a master's degree in education at 
Harvard before netting a National Science Foundation Grant to travel to 
Antarctica. After theater work in New York, she landed in Los Angeles in 1979, 
followed by another seven years in New York. Finally she returned to Los 
Angeles in 1991. In 1992 she co-wrote (with Robert Gallo) and directed "King of 
the City: An Evening With Al Capone," which played at Group Rep and toured at 
Scotland's Edinburgh Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The director has set "Father" on what she describes as a black box set. "And 
we have a curtain, this scarfy thing placed halfway upstage, that we're using 
like a panel to change sets, indicate a change of place. Also, there'll be a 
lot of music and sound to float the whole piece. . . . The delicacy of the 
changes will, I hope, keep the audience drawn along and in with the characters 
and movement." WHERE AND WHEN

 What: "I Never Sang for My Father."

THE CALL OF THE MALL; * SHOPPERS PACK THE GLENDALE GALLERIA PARKING STRUCTURE, 
DISREGARDING EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 We have learned much from the Jan. 17 earthquake. For instance, who knew that 
there would be widespread, post-quake, suburban hysteria known as 
"mall-withdraw al?" Yes, when an earthquake damages or closes San Fernando 
Valley shopping malls, Valley residents can muster only so much patience. Then 
they will hazard any traffic situation, not to mention feelings of 
claustrophobia, to find a mall, any mall. So it was no wonder that on a recent 
weekday, the fully functioning Glendale Galleria, a sort of Mother Ship of 
malls in the Valley anyway, reaped the rewards of this stir-crazy bounty as our 
fear of being indoors was overcome by an urgent need to sip an Orange Julius 
while listening to a salesman playing "Lady of Spain" on a Wurlitzer organ that 
comes with a convenient payment plan: 
</P>
<P>
 1-1:10 p.m.: We enter the parking garage off Central Avenue. . . . PARKING 
GARAGE?! (Rapid, cinema verite flashback to disturbing newsreel images: CSUN, 
Northridge Fashion Center. "Trapped." "Twisted metal." "Steel beams.") Yes, 
these are our soul mates -- fellow citizens who have repressed some very primal 
death fears to sit bumper-to-bumper in a multilevel parking structure while 
aftershocks continue to top 4.0 on a regular basis. We are proud to be among 
them, even as we curse them for bringing our already snail-like progress to a 
complete halt, waiting for a woman with three kids, a stroller and eight 
shopping bags to slowly pack up her car. Finally, we find a space, celebrate 
briefly, then try not to breathe fumes as we make our way to the mall entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 1:10-1:20 p.m.: We enter to find ourselves in what can only be described as 
the M.C. Escher wing of the Galleria -- there are three levels to Nordstrom, 
but only two connect with the mall, and by the time you get to the other end, 
the two levels of the mall have shifted to coincide with two different levels 
of the three-story Broadway. But we have survived a 6.8 earthquake and handle 
disorientation well. In Nordstrom, we are immediately reassured, because spring 
frocks and swimsuits are on display, a sure sign that life goes on. But we find 
recent events have colored our appetite for merchandise. When we see bathrobes 
and pajamas, we wonder if we could have looked a little more fashionable during 
that surprise 4:31 a.m. meeting with the neighbors in the street. But as we've 
taken to sleeping fully clothed now, we press on. 
</P>
<P>
 1:20-1:35 p.m.: In the mall, we find no signs of earthquake residue save cans 
requesting relief donations that are prominently displayed by merchants. The 
Nordstrom-Mervyn's wing of the mall has a number of specialty stores such as 
Guess?, the Disney Store and a Rand-McNally map store, which features a South 
Pacific Handbook display in its window, perhaps an homage to the "You know, I 
bet we could get jobs in Tahiti" concept that sprang to mind during a certain 
30 seconds in January. At merry Toys International, a selection of board games 
suitable for no-electricity evenings under curfew. One of them is even "Shakin' 
Sorry!" Thanks a lot. A healthy run of customers in the Autumn Harvest store. 
Stocking up on dried fruit, perhaps? We could pig out at Mrs. Fields. Or the 
Popcorn Palace. Or McDonald's. We could easily live in this part of the mall, 
as long as it didn't fall on us. At Sam Goody's record store, the bin for a 
rock band called Aftershock is sadly empty. But there's always AC/DC's "You 
Shook Me All Night Long," or Tori Amos' "Little Earthquakes," and that's just 
in the "A" section. 
</P>
<P>
 1:35-1:50 p.m.: We double back to The Broadway, where a visit to Housewares 
reminds us why we persist in living in sunny California despite now-irrefutable 
evidence that it doesn't want us here: colorful plastic outdoor dishware, 
picnic baskets and beach chairs. Hah! It takes a 4.5 or better to even get our 
attention now, but it's still winter back East. Then again, we do seriously 
consider this butane-powered stove burner. 
</P>
<P>
 1:50-2:05 p.m.: We exit The Broadway on the lower level and pass one of three 
Footlocker stores and a Don Carlos Mexican restaurant. (One need never go more 
than 100 feet or so without sneakers or sustenance in this mall.) Dishes break 
during the quake? Here's Williams-Sonoma. Waldenbooks has plenty of reading 
material suitable for temblor-sitting. For instance, "The Great American 
Bathroom Book," in two volumes, offers truncated versions of the classics, 
perfect for when you have only a few minutes peace at a time between bolting 
for the door during aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 2:05-2:15 p.m.: The weeks of stress have sapped our shopping stamina. Luckily, 
we have come to the food court. We seek out our personal favorite, the 
unfortunately named hot dog on a stick. At least those ridiculous, tall, red, 
white and yellow hats the poor teen-agers who work here have to wear have taken 
on a certain '60s rave hipness, however briefly. Dog and a lemonade, $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
 2:15-3 p.m.: Just a thought: Is the grunge look not dead when Kinney shoes 
displays knock-offs of Alp construction boots? Maybe we're just segueing into 
the survival look. Quel desappointement. The Gap has no sweats, so perfect for 
those now-sleeping/now-running outdoors kind of nights. At J.C. Penney's 
cosmetics department, they hawk huge, very bounceable plastic containers of 
bath crystals. But aren't we saving water with these 30-second, 
please-no-aftershock-right-now showers? 
</P>
<P>
 3-3:05 p.m.: Back out in the mall, an information desk touts public 
transportation. They should relocate to the parking garage where people are 
probably ready to abandon their single-family vehicular units. Miller's 
Outpost: flannel and denim, more clothes you can sleep in. Besides, you're 
ready for either a mosh pit or a Red Cross shelter at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 3:05-3:10 p.m.: Kaybee Toy and Hobby has Barbie bicycle helmets that could 
double as hard hats for the kids. Fly-apart Crash Dummies dolls are on sale for 
only $9.99. Practical under the circumstances, perhaps, but also a little too 
weird. 
</P>
<P>
 3:10-3:25 p.m.: We glide up the Robinsons-May escalator and catch a glimpse 
into the adjacent parking garage where dozens of frustrated drivers are 
generating great clouds of smog but very few parking spaces. We feel sorry for 
them, but we're in the mall and they're not, because, no doubt, we've been 
living right. In housewares, we find an adorable Tea Cattle, a cow-shaped 
kettle. If you have to boil water to eliminate impurities caused by a sudden 
rupture in an already crumbling urban infrastructure, why not be cheery? And 
what's this? Fondue sets have their own source of power, and they're so 
civilized. Then there's the food dehydrator. For only $99.99 you can make your 
own beef jerky and be the envy of the rest of the people sleeping in pup tents 
in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 3:25-3:35 p.m.: We start back toward The Broadway on the upper level. Ah! 
Victoria's Secret. Natural disasters can be so romantic. "Oh, my! All I'm 
wearing is a lace teddy, and I'm so frightened!" (Hey, those emergency workers 
can be darned good-looking.) Across from Ann Taylor is an Easy Spirit store -- 
you know, they make fashionable pumps you can play basketball (or flee the 
apocalypse) in. The Wherehouse will buy your used CDs, the ones that all fell 
on the floor and made you wonder why you have more than 100 of these things 
that contain probably a sum total of four songs you actually listened to 
sometime during the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gadget store Brookstone, with its capitalistic finger firmly on the pulse of 
the community, prominently displays emergency lights and therapeutic vibrators. 
(Someone, somewhere, must be inventing a combination flashlight-transistor 
radio-shiatsu massager.) 
</P>
<P>
 3:35-3:40 p.m.: We now stop and behold in awe the piece de resistance of 
earthquake preparedness. Artwork fall off the walls during the 6.8-er? Have to 
scrounge for food while the power was off? Solve both problems at once! How 
will a Monet-like Impressionist painting in an intricate gilt-like frame solve 
all your earthquake needs? It's made out of chocolate! See Pseudio's for 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 3:40-3:50 p.m.: One last stop at the GNC store to stock up on vitamin, 
homeopathic medicines and energy bars -- not for the quake kit -- for the 
parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 3:50-4 p.m.: At least if the Big One hits now, we have malled one last time. 
We meander slowly to our vehicle, feeling the gaze of desperate would-be Orange 
Julius purchasers who really want to get out of this parking garage. . Which 
one of these poor souls should we allow to have our golden, gleaming, 
sought-after parking space? What better therapy for that awful feeling of 
helplessness we had when Mother Nature toyed with us too cruelly. Now, we get 
to play God.

FUN IS ON THE MENU; * THE LOS ANGELES BREAKFAST CLUB HAS BEEN A FRIENDLY 
INSTITUTION SINCE 1925. THE GROUP IS GRAPPLING WITH DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's not yet 6 a.m., still dark outside -- but these seniors arrive sunny-side 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 They happily sit down to ham (or bacon and sausage) and eggs every Wednesday, 
most of them impeccably groomed as if attending church or a dress-up party, to 
form a group called the Los Angeles Breakfast Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real waker-upper," says E.T. Lundgren of Glendale, a retiree and 
great-grandparent who wins prizes in senior skiing competitions when he's not 
still tinkering with the stick-shift Thunderbird he ordered brand new in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in gear -- I get more done on Wednesday than any other day of the week," 
says Virginia Nielsen of North Hollywood, a retiree who recently toured Hong 
Kong and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we offer is love, kindness and friendship," says Mabelle (Miss Angel) 
Crowley of Los Angeles, editor of Ham and Egg News, the club's newsletter, and 
whose arrival at club meetings is heralded by her red 1991 Camaro Z-28 and its 
throaty Corvette engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breakfast Club -- born in 1925 with a membership including film producers 
Darryl F. Zanuck and Jack Warner, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of 
Tarzan -- calls itself "not a church, not a lodge, not a service club, but the 
Shrine of Friendship," awarding $6,000 annually to a dozen charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is a community fixture where the fun also rises, herding members into 
buses and trains for day trips locally and weekend forays to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as homespun as a coffee klatch, as predictable as its piano sing-alongs 
("Grand Old Flag" and "Happy Days Are Here Again") and every bit as 
lighthearted as, say, George Burns, who recently wisecracked about why, at 98, 
he smokes a dozen cigars a day: "At my age, you've gotta hold on to something 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every Wednesday for 69 years, Breakfast Clubbers have banged spoons, 
knives and forks rhythmically against coffee cups and water glasses as they 
sing the club's anthem, "Ham 'n' Eggs": 
</P>
<P>
 I like mine fried good and brown.  
</P>
<P>
 I like mine fried upside down . 
</P>
<P>
 Ham 'n' eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 Flip 'em, flop 'em, flap 'em . 
</P>
<P>
 Ham 'n' eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 And inside headquarters near Griffith Park, at 3201 Riverside Drive -- in a 
gleaming, one-story building called Friendship Auditorium, which the club sold 
to, and now leases once a week from, the city -- about 170 Breakfast Clubbers 
shout, in unison, a shibboleth created in 1925 by club member Ralph Springer, 
an artist at the old Los Angeles Evening Herald. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading block letters printed on a huge board onstage, they recite: 
</P>
<P>
 FVNEM?  
</P>
<P>
 SVFM.  
</P>
<P>
 FVNEX?  
</P>
<P>
 SVFX.  
</P>
<P>
 OICVFMNX!  
</P>
<P>
 Translation: "Have we any ham? Yes, we have ham. Have we any eggs? Yes, we 
have eggs. Oh, I see. We have ham and eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially ham. 
</P>
<P>
 A few men nicknamed the Roosters sit at a table and repeatedly interrupt the 
meeting with heckling chants. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Baptist preacher and the club's chaplain and resident jokester -- the 
Rev. James Whitcomb Brougher Jr. of Glendale, who is 92 and going on eternity 
-- was introduced not long ago, the Roosters crowed: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohhh, Jim! Tell us about the heavenly shrine!" 
</P>
<P>
 On this winter morning, Brougher tells of neither heaven nor shrines but two 
old men who converse in rocking chairs and reminisce about their long 
friendship, whereupon one says: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember your name." 
</P>
<P>
 "How soon," the other asks, "do you have to know?" 
</P>
<P>
 For all its renown as a citadel of un -change, the Breakfast Club has bent, if 
not snapped, with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally an all-male preserve founded by the city's film, business, 
professional and social elite, who rode horseback together in Griffith Park 
before sitting down to breakfast, the club admitted women as members in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, women could only accompany their husbands to club activities. "At 
the annual meetings," says Joan Weeks, the club's office manager, "they had to 
sit in the back of the room and be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Breakfast Club grapples with demographic change, its membership of 
226 (including 124 women and 102 men) ranging in age from 55 to 95. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership is down from the more than 1,000 who belonged when members were 
collectively younger and, even as they reared families, seemed to have more 
leisure time. 
</P>

 "There's a lack of interest today among the younger generation. Why? I cannot 
tell you," says Aurelio (Sal) Salazar, 68, who with his wife Rose, 69, drives 
to club meetings from their house in Bell Canyon, a 70-mile round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young people can't afford it (dues are $18.50 a month or $200 a year, if 
paid all at once), and the retired people are dying off," Mabelle Crowley says. 
"It used to be that the companies where our members worked paid the club's 
dues. Not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Inez Smith, a retired Los Angeles schoolteacher and now the club's second 
woman president, concedes that its long-range future appears "a little dismal. 
We've lost 11 members this past year. The younger people are too busy. They 
have to support their families -- and now more women than ever are working." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, a male member suggested that the club should boost membership by 
inviting Griffith Park's early morning joggers and bicyclists to breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way!" some club women protested. 
</P>
<P>
 As Joan Weeks remembers, "That was the only time the women had a big voice in 
this club. They said, 'We don't want to look at those sweaty bodies and hairy 
legs. . . . If they can't come dressed and clean, don't bring them here!' "

UCI TO OPEN SATELLITE CENTER IN ANAHEIM; EDUCATION: THE EXTENSION-STUDIES 
CAMPUS WILL OFFER NON-CREDIT, MOSTLY NIGHT COURSES. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON JOB 
SKILLS AND RETRAINING.

 By next fall, residents of north Orange County can improve their job skills, 
prepare for new jobs or learn more about the arts when UC Irvine opens its 
first satellite extension program, university official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite campus will be in Anaheim, in temporary quarters on Broadway 
between Clementine and Lemon streets, said Dr. Melvin E. Hall, dean of 
university extension. It will move to permanent facilities in 15 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Extension, a non-credit certificate program that offers mostly night 
courses, now serves between 13,000 and 14,000 students a year on the Irvine 
campus, Hall said.  
</P>
<P>
 While this is the first satellite campus, Hall said that it will not be the 
only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope in a few years to open a South County satellite south of the El Toro 
'Y,' and make our courses and services convenient to anyone in the county," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, most extension classes meet once a week for three hours, over a 
10-week period. Costs for the courses range from $195 to $300 per course, 
depending on materials. There are also mini-courses, mostly in the arts and 
humanities, which run from four to six weeks and cost $85, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the temporary quarters, most of the courses will be offered in the 
evenings, Hall said, with daytime classes added later. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's extension program began when the university opened its doors 27 years 
ago, said Hall, who has headed the program for the past five years. At first, 
the emphasis was on arts and culture, but over the years, the emphasis has 
shifted to work-related offerings, a trend which has accelerated with recent 
changes in the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most popular offerings, taught by a part-time faculty of 600, are 
engineering, business management, international business and competitive 
manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major focus of our coming to Anaheim is to assist people who have been laid 
off or are concerned about the stability of their employment," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the Anaheim campus is "to provide ongoing support to economic 
development; assist in the redeployment of the county's skilled work force; 
continue to aid the development of the county's small- and medium-size 
businesses; and support the ethnically diverse communities located in North 
County," extension officials said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Curricula will focus on "leading-edge topics, high-tech issues and advanced 
concepts in all course work," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although at UCI Extension "we try not to get in the job-placement business," 
Hall said. Having 400 representatives of Orange County companies on advisory 
committees helping to develop the curriculum is "a good reason why our 
certificates are so popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that UCI Extension has begun applying for new federal funds made 
available to help retrain displaced workers, as well as those workers who have 
received company buyouts who want to start small businesses.

ROHRABACHER HAS NEW PLOY; GOVERNMENT: CONGRESSMAN TO STEP UP DRIVE AGAINST 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BY ASKING CONGRESS TO CUT OFF CERTAIN TYPES OF AID TO 
UNDOCUMENTED SCHOOLCHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping up his attack on illegal immigration, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) proposed Thursday that the federal government cut off 
certain types of financial aid to undocumented children in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on this issue for three years now, and my approach has always been 
the same -- if we're going to get control of this flood of illegal immigration, 
we've got to eliminate the benefit package that serves as their main attraction 
for coming here," he said in an interview Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, sure to inflame an already volatile issue, drew an immediate rebuke 
from minority activists who called the proposal both unconstitutional and 
immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Congress will see it for what it is -- political grandstanding 
without any substance," said John Palacio, a director of the Orange County 
chapter of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "What he's 
really talking about is denying U.S. children an opportunity to be educated, 
and that's simply unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rohrabacher said he believes he stands a real chance of success following 
his highly publicized push to ban long-term aid to illegal immigrants who were 
hurt by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher's proposal, which he plans to offer next week as an amendment to 
an educational funding bill now being considered by the House of 
Representatives, would apply only to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Acts of 1965.  
</P>
<P>
 That portion provides federal assistance to districts with students whose 
families live below the poverty level, although Rohrabacher said he was 
uncertain how much money is funded through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman also wants to require school districts to tally the costs of 
educating illegal immigrants and report them to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said he has offered similar proposals in the past to restrict 
funding for illegal immigrants, but his amendments have invariably been 
rejected at the committee level. This time, because of the rules by which the 
education bill is to be considered, Rohrabacher said he is confident that the 
full House will be able to consider his amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've finally got enough support now that we'll be able to offer these 
amendments on virtually every piece of legislation that comes through Congress. 
Public outrage is at such a level that basically the Democratic Congress can't 
just put up roadblocks anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arturo Montez, an Orange County activist who is a state director of the 
League of United Latin American Citizens, said Rohrabacher's ideas for 
reforming the educational system are misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best example of the need for education is in Congress -- just 
look at the intelligence level there," he said. "What Rohrabacher's trying to 
do is prevent the education level in Orange County from getting any higher so 
people like him will remain in office." 
</P>
<P>
 And Palacio said that Rohrabacher's proposals would place an "unwieldy" burden 
on local school systems, forcing administrators to become de facto agents of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to weed out undocumented children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the idea of denying educational aid to illegal 
immigrants would fuel discrimination against children who "do not look like 
'typical Americans' " and would violate a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that 
mandates public education for all children.

YOUNG HOSTAGE-HOLDER DEMANDS . . . A BURGER; JUVENILE HALL: AFTER LONG STANDOFF 
ENDS WITHOUT INJURY, AUTHORITIES SAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PRANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Authorities summoned deputies to Juvenile Hall early Wednesday to confront a 
teen-ager who apparently had taken another inmate hostage, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-hour standoff -- during which the youth demanded hamburgers for 
himself, the apparent hostage and another inmate -- he surrendered. No one was 
hurt and the fast-food delivery was never made. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities suggested the incident may have been a prank, with one of the 
inmates playing the role of hostage. No one seemed to be victimized, said 
Stephanie Lewis, chief deputy probation officer at the Orange County probation 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age boy with the hamburger craving used a piece of glass from a 
broken window as a weapon in the standoff, which began about 1 a.m. when he 
held the shard to the neck of his cellmate, according to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (had) the Sheriff's Department respond with some officers. If we have any 
kind of disturbance, we need additional manpower," she said. "As long as one 
boy had glass in his possession and wanted to use it as a weapon, we didn't 
want to risk the safety of the staff or other kids." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lewis, when the negotiator asked the inmate with the weapon what 
his demands were the teen-ager replied: " 'Um . . . a hamburger?' " according 
to Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The second youth was also interested in getting a burger, she said, and the 
teen brandishing the glass asked for enough food to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the two cellmates, a third youth in a cell next door participated; he 
may have provided the broken glass from a window in his cell, Lewis said. The 
boys' ages were 13, 16 and 17, but officials would not identify them further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids kept demanding their hamburgers until 5 o'clock in the morning," 
Lewis said, when they gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real unusual thing, when two kids hold another kid ransom for a 
hamburger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The food request was not met, because "the hamburger places were all closed," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities do not expect charges to be filed against any of the boys 
involved, though the Sheriff's Department and the probation office are still 
conducting an investigation.

SCANDAL-ROCKED FIRM TO OPEN AIRPORT STORE; BURBANK: PARADIES SHOPS HAS A 
CONTRACT FOR FOUR OUTLETS. THE OWNER WAS CONVICTED IN ATLANTA OF CONSPIRACY AND 
MAIL FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Atlanta-based concessionaire convicted last month of felony mail fraud and 
conspiracy in a corruption scandal that rocked the Georgia capital is scheduled 
to set up shop at Burbank Airport in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paradies Shops, one of the nation's largest airport news and gift 
concession agents, will take over three stores at Burbank and open a fourth 
after the current concessionaire's contract expires March 31. The 34-year-old 
company outbid five others for the space and won the contract in December. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a federal jury last month found The Paradies Shops and its owner, 
Daniel M. Paradies, guilty on 83 counts of mail fraud in one of the most 
politically charged trials in Atlanta history. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Paradies was also convicted on one count of conspiracy for his role in 
a scheme to funnel more than $1 million in illegal payoffs to a prominent 
former city official and airport commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport officials said Thursday that they are aware of the conviction, 
but that their agreement with The Paradies Shops would stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accept the fact that there's been a judgment rendered. . . . But we're not 
going to say that because there was a conviction back East there's 
automatically a loss of your concession out here," said Robert Garcin, 
president of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. "We have a 
contract," Garcin said. "We have to honor the contract." But he added that the 
matter has been referred to the airport's legal counsel but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dickson, senior vice president of The Paradies Shops, insisted that 
his company would have no trouble meeting its obligations at Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any question that we would be able to perform all of our 
commitments," Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a letter sent to authority members last week, Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) urged the airport to cancel its contract with Paradies 
as "a prudent public interest decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Polanco acknowledged that his letter was spurred by a 
complaint from an unsuccessful rival bidder for the concession, MBE Inc. in 
South Pasadena. But he reiterated his contention that the contract does not 
represent "good public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to reward the leadership of companies that have been convicted of 
felonies?" Polanco said. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Denver city officials have decided to end their relationship 
with Paradies, even though opening day for the new Denver International Airport 
is scheduled in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark K. McBee, Burbank Airport's manager of contracts and properties, said 
the airport's contract with Paradies does not allow for termination solely 
because the vendor has been convicted of criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel it's going to impact their ability to operate at Burbank 
Airport from what we know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for John Wayne International Airport in Orange County said the 
company's two stores have performed "very satisfactorily" since they began four 
years ago and that there are no plans to review The Paradies Shops' 10-year 
contract. The company does not do business at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which logged $100 million in sales last year and operates in 38 
cities around the country, landed the Burbank concession after a search process 
spanning several months. Six proposals were submitted to Burbank Airport, and 
the list was winnowed to two in November: The Paradies Shops and British 
concern W.H. Smith, both of which guaranteed the airport at least $2.4 million 
in rent over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Daniel Paradies and his company were under indictment on fraud 
and conspiracy charges, and as required, his bid mentioned that both he and The 
Paradies Shops had been named as defendants in a criminal action in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 But based on expected revenue and the company's plans for a golf-themed 
specialty shop, Burbank Airport staff members recommended approval of the 
Paradies bid as "a superior proposal," according to an agenda report. The 
airport authority voted unanimously to award the contract to Paradies at its 
Dec. 20 meeting, praising Paradies-owned shops as "just outstanding" and "a 
beautiful, quality operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 1/2-minute discussion did not raise the indictment issue. Authority and 
staff members agree that commissioners had been briefed, but officials said 
Thursday that it did not seem necessary to bring up the matter again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no secret," said Thomas Greer, director of airport services. 
</P>
<P>
 Convictions in the Atlanta case were not handed down until Jan. 22, after a 
sensational three-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the verdict, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb announced that he 
would seek to end his city's relationship with The Paradies Shops. Officials 
say The Paradies Shops has agreed to let other companies buy out nine of the 
contracts where it is the sole owner and an additional nine contracts where it 
forms part of a joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor just felt that he didn't want that cloud over the new airport. He 
felt that was not a standard that Denver could live with," said Briggs Gamblin, 
an aide to Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 For its mail fraud convictions, the company faces maximum fines of $500,000 
for each count. Daniel Paradies, who remains free on bond, could receive up to 
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each mail fraud count. The 
conspiracy conviction could also net a five-year prison term and $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is scheduled for April 15. Paradies, 72, has vowed to appeal.

TATTOO PARLOR NEEDLES OFFICIALS; IT MAKES IMPRESSION ON PLACENTIA ZONING LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the city's first tattoo parlor opened in November, it did so with 
surprising ease. There were no requirements for Grant Lawther, owner of the Ink 
Well, to appear before the Planning Commission or the City Council, and no 
special restrictions were placed on his business. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Lawther's application for a business license was granted so easily 
that it left the City Council wondering about the lack of control over the 
types of businesses moving into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we aren't doing a very good job of monitoring" what kinds of 
the businesses are opening, Councilwoman Maria Moreno said at a recent council 
meeting. "Why didn't we know about this before?" 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the council didn't find out about the tattoo parlor until after it 
opened was because Placentia has no ordinances or zoning requirements that 
would trigger a public hearing or review by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But that changed earlier this month when the council approved three ordinances 
that will ensure that businesses such as tattoo parlors will have to be 
approved at least by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ordinances requires tattoo shop owners to apply for a permit, which 
allows the city to dictate a variety of conditions, such as hours of operation 
and how many parking spaces are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit process also requires a public hearing before the Planning 
Commission. If a council member appeals the decision by the Planning 
Commission, the City Council will also hold a public hearing. Residents can 
petition council members to appeal a commission decision. The council can deny 
a permit for virtually any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new zoning ordinance, tattoo parlors, massage parlors and acupressure 
establishments will not be allowed in certain parts of the city, such as 
Placita Santa Fe, the city's historic downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 The third ordinance lists 20 regulations that tattoo parlors must follow, from 
requiring tattoo operators to wear "clean, light-colored short-sleeve smocks," 
to specifying how a client's skin should be prepared before a tattoo is 
applied. This ordinance, but not the zoning and conditional-use requirements, 
would apply to the Ink Well. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little about the Ink Well to suggest that it should cause much 
consternation among council members or residents. Squeezed between a liquor 
store and a secondhand shop, the 500-square-foot tattoo parlor is scarcely 
noticeable from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ink Well is on Bradford Avenue in a strip mall-style shopping center in an 
aging section of town. While a few houses are nearby, the area is predominantly 
retail and office buildings. Other businesses in the area include a pizza 
restaurant, travel agency, video store and carpet store. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners and employees of four nearby businesses said the tattoo parlor had 
caused no problems and was an asset to the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been no trouble," said a woman who identified herself only as the 
owner of Elsie's Travel and Services. "They are fine neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But several council members, who said tattoo parlors do not portray the right 
image, pushed for even stricter requirements. Moreno and Councilman Michael L. 
Maertzweiler both opposed allowing tattoo parlors and similar businesses in the 
city's most visible retail and commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm too traditional, but so many families use these areas for so many 
things," Maertzweiler said. "If we allow (tattoo parlors) at all, I don't want 
to see them in the center of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owner Lawther, who employs one other tattoo artist, said his clients 
include physicians, lawyers and teachers. With prices starting at $25 a square 
inch, Lawther said the people who get tattoos at his shop shouldn't be seen as 
potential trouble for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 So where are the bikers in leather and chains, the gang members, the 
undesirable element some council members fear will scare residents away from 
other businesses in the area? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not here," Lawther said. "Not in my place. Those types get tattoos on the 
street, from friends with homemade instruments. We're more low-key. The people 
who come here are here for the art." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Capps of Huntington Beach, who was at the Ink Well recently, agreed. He 
said that Freddy Von Musser, who had just tattooed Capps' name in blue, Old 
English-style letters on Capps' left arm, was an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have another tattoo on my leg that was done with a homemade (tattoo) gun," 
the 20-year-old Capps said. "It's really sloppy, and you can tell the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Perez, an actor from Laguna Beach who was having his ex-wife's name 
covered with a new tattoo, said he followed Von Musser from a tattoo parlor in 
San Clemente to the Ink Well because he admires his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best," said Perez, 27, whose arms are covered with Native American 
symbols and mythical figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawther calls his work the "ultimate art form." He is as proud of the Native 
American symbols, animals and other designs he draws on his clients' skin as 
the oil paintings he creates on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear these stereotypes about tattoo parlors, about the people who get 
tattoos," Lawther said. "But a lot of respectable people get tattoos now."

DANA PARSONS: SMALL-TOWN BOY'S HERO IS QUIETLY FULFILLING THE ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local heroes are hard to come by in Nebraska farm towns of 200 people, so as a 
kid in Marquette, Neb., in the late 1950s, I kept a scrapbook of national 
sports figures. Page after page of photos from newspapers and magazines, 
meticulously cut out and pasted on . . . that was my main connection with 
heroic people. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more flesh-and-blood level was a local kid named Todd Ferguson, a 
crew-cut son of the town banker and a very good athlete. He was six grades 
ahead of me and, well, you take your heroes where you find them. He played 
varsity basketball as a freshman. He was a crack quarter-miler in track. He was 
an excellent baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Todd didn't seem to mind hanging around with me, although I 
was still in grade school and he was in high school. That he had a crush on my 
sister and that Dad was the coach and school superintendent never registered 
with me as a possible motive for his interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, who cared? He'd occasionally buy me a chocolate malt at the town 
cafe. He'd let me listen to Kingston Trio records in his basement. I guess you 
could say he played big brother Wally to my Beaver. One hot day we were walking 
the dusty streets of Marquette, and I let fly with a wad of spittle. I was 
probably all of 10 years old but already proud of both my spitting trajectory 
and velocity, until Todd said something like, "It's not cool to spit." I never 
did it again in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 We left Marquette when I was 11. As superintendent/coach, Dad left behind some 
kids he fondly recalled the rest of his life, and Todd was surely among the 
first order of them. Todd went to the same small college Dad attended, went 
into the Marines as Dad had and, to complete the cycle, also became an educator 
and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, I hooked up again with Todd. The kid was now a family 
man in his 40s, living in Tustin, married and the father of two daughters. 
Besides doing some coaching, he was a junior high science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago my parents came to visit. Dad was in ever-failing health, and he 
wanted to make sure he and Todd got together. Todd and his wife, Gwen, came 
over for a delightful Sunday afternoon, talking about Marquette days, taking 
photos and chronicling the years in between. Dad died a year later, in January 
of 1993, and Todd was one of his old "kids" whom I made sure to notify. 
</P>
<P>
 By sheer coincidence, I saw the Fergusons last Friday night. Out of the blue I 
suggested we go see a high school basketball game, something I hadn't done in 
years. We went to a game at Tustin High School, where their daughter Sara is a 
sophomore. In the stands, I had no trouble conjuring up mental images of a lean 
Todd Ferguson running up and down the Marquette gym floor 35 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 At their home afterward, while we ate cherry pie and watched Dan Jansen win 
his Olympics gold medal, Todd packed for a trip to Washington, D.C., where he 
and three of his students from Bernardo Yorba Junior High would compete in a 
national science contest. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked excitedly about the trip, and I made a mental note to call when he 
got back to see how they fared. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't need to. On the front page of the Thursday Times was a headline, 
"Yorba Linda Teens' City of Future Takes Design Honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd's kids had won first place. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard not to feel great pride for the crew-cut kid from little ol' 
Marquette, toiling all these years quietly and anonymously, but now tasting the 
fruits of acclaim. Knowing Todd, he'll give all the credit to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 So I called his principal, Richard Vouga. "The wonderful thing about Todd," 
Vouga said, "is that like so many other teachers, he puts in so much extra time 
with kids, weekend excursions, all kind of things, doing things that are not 
notorious, but time after time helping kids. Getting this kind of notoriety, I 
can't tell you how good I feel about it." 
</P>
<P>
 I know exactly what he means. 
</P>
<P>
 I mentioned our family's longstanding connection with Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he told me about some coach he had who put some kind of imprint on his 
life," Vouga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, that was probably my father, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't Todd visit him a year or so ago, after he hadn't seen him for a long 
time?" Vouga asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I said, recounting the Sunday afternoon visit. "I'm surprised that Todd 
would have mentioned that to you," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it made such an impression on him that he came back to school on Monday 
morning and told his principal about it," Vouga said. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't be happier to trumpet Todd's success, although he'll probably never 
forgive me for doing it in print. In many ways, he represents all the teachers 
who put in the free time, pay for school supplies out of their own pocket and 
want nothing more than a generation of successful students. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible for me to think of Todd without thinking of how connected he 
and Dad were. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passing the torch" is the phrase, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 Well done, Todd. You have handled the torch with care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad would have been quite proud. 
</P>

LIFE IN THE BACKGROUND; SURVIVAL: A ONCE-HOMELESS SCREEN EXTRA KEEPS BODY AND

 Corky Parks left the streets two decades ago, but even now the streets have 
not left Corky Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They linger in his sleep and in his thoughts and even at the television and 
movie sets where he makes his living. Although he lives on the fringe of a 
glamorous world, memories of cold pavement and empty days both haunt him and 
keep his feet on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Without these memories, Parks, 44, wonders where he would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is a Hollywood extra, one of the nameless faces that flit through the 
backgrounds of films and TV shows. The pay: $65 a day. The work: irregular at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 His vocation is oddly poetic, considering that Parks was once a societal 
extra, one of the nameless faces that flitted through the background of daily 
life in Downtown Los Angeles. The pay: whatever he could scrounge or beg. The 
work: surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years in the early 1970s, a young, homeless Parks slept under 
cardboard in Skid Row alleys, foraged for food in trash dumpsters and amused 
himself by watching scavenging rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, Parks rents a room in Sun Valley. He is a member of the 
Screen Actors Guild and regularly portrays for the cameras the sort of 
character he was -- a bum -- or those he could easily have become -- winos, 
thieves, dirt bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is not rich. But when it rains, he stays dry. And when he is hungry, he 
eats. 
</P>
<P>
 Few aspire to his current station, but it suits Parks, comfortable in an 
uneasy way. He is no hero, just an ordinary person surviving as best he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet traces of the street remain. His bed is the same battered piece of foam 
that once padded him from the pavement. The lining of his jacket is an old 
blanket stitched into place. His few possessions are stashed in plastic grocery 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 It is force of habit more than anything else. A few things have changed, 
however. On the street, cleanliness is rarely achieved and never sustained. 
Once he left, Parks became almost compulsive about his cleanliness and personal 
hygiene. Even the engine of his '68 Ford is clean to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 To Parks, everything has changed and nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still just surviving," said Parks, whose gentle eyes are framed by a face 
made harsh by life. "How I do it has changed, but nothing else has." 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid growing up in Winnetka, Parks did not aspire to become an extra. In 
fact, he aspired to very little. "I ran away quite a bit. I had a few jobs, but 
nothing I was real excited about. I couldn't find anything I was interested 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 So he spent his early 20s drifting and ultimately ran aground on Skid Row. It 
turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to Parks, who said he was 
reclusive and insecure as a child and teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for the streets, I don't know where I'd be. The streets taught 
me to respect myself. I figure I'd either be dead or in jail. I didn't have the 
strength to rob someone and I didn't have the desire to hurt someone." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three years, Parks wandered Downtown streets. Then one morning 
he found his calling. Or, rather, it found him and damn near ran him over. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he thought the growling engine was a trash truck, but they were 
usually more careful, accustomed to dodging snoozing winos in Skid Row 
alleyways. He felt the edge of his cardboard shelter crumple under the weight 
of heavy wheels and scrambled out to see a truck from a Hollywood studio. It 
had come to Skid Row for a day of filming. 
</P>
<P>
 With nothing better to do, Parks watched the filming -- especially intrigued 
by the crowd of extras shipped in to portray street people. "They looked like 
the kind of people who were hanging around and who I should know. But I had 
never seen any of them before." 
</P>
<P>
 And so he watched with interest as the morning wore on and the alley filled 
with the smell of brewing coffee. Lunch came and the cinematic street people 
lined up at a lavish catering table. 
</P>
<P>
 It all looked pretty good to Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up the names of casting agencies by eavesdropping. A few days later, 
he walked from Downtown to Hollywood, intent on finding work as an extra. 
</P>
<P>
 At one office he picked up an application from a clerk who was repelled by 
Parks' swollen face, stained skin and overwhelming body odor. But as he was 
leaving, another man came out of the office and asked him: "Can you work 
tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked behind me and then pointed at myself," Parks recalled. "He said, 
'Yeah, you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Parks worked for the first time in years. He doesn't remember 
the show or the movie, but he remembers the lunch table. "I ate my head off and 
a few weeks later I picked up my first check. It was the first check I'd seen 
in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several weeks, he registered at more agencies and found more 
work, stashing the money he earned in the cracked mortar of a brick building. 
He tried to stay clean, but not too clean because he was in demand portraying 
street people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bum look is the thing that got me going," he said. "But I started to feel 
more self-respect and more self-esteem. I tried to broaden my look." To that 
end, he drew on experience from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He often filled long and boring days watching the daytime denizens of Downtown 
-- the lawyers, the bankers -- and studied their movements, their tics and 
their mannerisms, duplicating them in his extra work. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he saved enough money to move from one shelter to another, finally 
renting a room at a Sun Valley house for $165 a month. He bought an old car 
used during filming for $100 and spent years fixing it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he rents it back to a studio for a daily rate that is higher than the 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an easy life. Every day, Parks hustles for work, knowing that the 
supply of extras far exceeds the demand. But there are benefits. He is rarely 
bored with the job and he has rubbed shoulders with such actors as Roy Scheider 
and Robert Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Parks is circumspect. He rarely watches the movies or shows he's 
worked on, even though he does have a small black-and-white TV. The stars he 
works with are just people, no different from the down-and-outs who huddle in 
alleys and beg for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't interest me," he said. "The glamour doesn't affect me. You 
have to look back at where I came from to understand my point of view. We're 
all human."

FATHER-SON BURIAL WILL END BOND OF TORMENT; VIOLENCE: STEVEN AND CHRISTOPHER 
GOLLY WILL BE INTERRED SIDE-BY-SIDE IN A FAMILY GRAVE. TUESDAY'S MAYHEM WAS 
RESULT OF A CHRONIC DOMESTIC BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The hard-nosed Vietnam veteran who tried to mold his only child with 
discipline and costly gifts and the alienated teen-age son who killed him and a 
police officer before committing suicide will be buried side-by-side in a 
family grave Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Golly, 49, and Christopher Golly, 17, are to be interred in a single 
ceremony in a Camarillo plot purchased by Steven's mother, Eleanor J. Golly, 
before the shooting in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not at her home in Camarillo Thursday. A neighbor said she has been 
staying with a daughter since the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Their burial together closes a tortured father-son relationship. Since the 
drug-overdose death of Christopher's mother four years ago, the two had been 
locked in escalating conflict, the father trying to rein in the errant youth 
who increasingly withdrew into "speed metal" music and amphetamine abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher ended the tug of war early Tuesday morning, drawing his father 
into his bedroom by increasing the volume on a recording of the Doors' "The 
End," then shooting him through the forehead as he opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he had planned the whole event, including ambushing officers who 
arrived after the shooting. A volley of shots from behind a wall beside his 
darkened house killed rookie Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, 45. His last act 
was to put a pistol to his own temple and pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Conner, one of Christopher Golly's closest friends, told The Times on 
Thursday that he had asked his own father to intervene with the Gollys, because 
Conner worried that Christopher Golly was going to follow through with repeated 
threats to kill the elder Golly. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner, 18, who told police that Christopher revealed the plan to him the 
night before the shooting, said he called his friend twice that night to try to 
dissuade him. The second time he put his father on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Conner said he heard his father say: "You should think about what you're 
doing, this is just one little incident." 
</P>
<P>
 The father, Keith Conner, who was recovering in a hospital Thursday following 
previously scheduled surgery Wednesday, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner quoted his father as telling Christopher: "If you want to come down 
here and talk about this, you can. You can stay here for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Conner said he then took the phone back and extracted a promise from 
Christopher Golly not to harm his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Are you still going to do it?' and he said, 'No.' Then I said, 'You 
have to promise me you are not going to do this.' And he said, 'I promise.' I 
said, 'You have to promise me on our friendship that you are not going to do 
this.' And he said, 'I give you my word.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And then I said, 'Call me tomorrow,' and he said, 'OK, I'll call you 
tomorrow. Bye.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several months, friends of Christopher said, he had told them 
he was on the verge of killing his father, holding back only because he was 
frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the friction between them, Steven Golly, who court records show had an 
estate valued at more than $2 million, had bought his son two cars, friends 
said. First was a souped-up gray 1968 Chevrolet Camaro that was later stolen 
and, more recently, a Chevy S-10 pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 A business partner and 30-year friend of Steven Golly said the father also 
bought his son the AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle that Christopher Golly turned 
on police as they arrived at the scene Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The two of them often took the rifle target shooting together, said Yo 
Hasegawa, one of Golly's partners in the Acme Electric Supply Co. of Culver 
City, a product wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had so much. His dad gave him everything and that was the wrong thing to 
do," reflected Ernest Reepmaker, Christopher's maternal grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the gifts, the discipline persisted until the end. The night before 
the shooting, the father had threatened to disable the pickup truck because the 
son took it for a drive without a valid license. Christopher Golly's driver's 
license had been suspended Feb. 14 following his conviction for marijuana 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 In an epilogue to Christopher Golly's death, three friends, including James 
Kushner, 18, were arrested in West Hills early Thursday after police found a 
stolen pistol and 180 rounds of ammunition in their car, which was stopped for 
having a broken headlight, the Los Angeles Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-millimeter handgun had been reported stolen by the parents of one of the 
youths, a 17-year-old girl, said Detective William Seeley of the West Valley 
Juvenile Division. The girl was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall on suspicion 
of grand theft of the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner was arrested for possession of alcohol and released, Seeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old driver of the car was arrested for driving under the influence 
of a controlled substance, Seeley said. He was booked and released to his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of the youths were high on amphetamines and told the officers 
they received the drugs from Christopher Golly before the Tuesday-morning 
shootout, said an officer who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Kushner described his relationship with Christopher Golly: "We 
partied. . . . We had real good times, teen-age stuff. We drank our beer, 
smoked our weed." Kushner said at the time that Golly also sold small 
quantities of methamphetamine to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Steven and Christopher Golly will be held at 11 a.m. in 
the Chapel of the Islands at Conejo Mountain Memorial Park and Funeral Home, 
2052 Howard Road in Camarillo, said funeral director David Buchta. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Hamilton will be held at 10:30 a.m. Monday at Grace 
Community Church, 13248 Roscoe Blvd., in Sun Valley. Burial will follow at 
Forest Lawn Memorial Park, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, in the Hollywood Hills. A 
viewing is scheduled for 4 p.m. Sunday at Forest Lawn.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; KING SPEECH SPARKS NEW DEDICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned a day when freedom would ring from the 
prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire to the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado to 
the curvaceous slopes of California. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a grassy field in front of Chapman University's Memorial Hall, students 
and teachers gathered Thursday to honor King's vision of liberty for America, 
immortalized in his "I Have a Dream" speech, delivered during a massive civil 
rights march on Washington in August, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people re-enacted the historic march Thursday afternoon, walking 
through the heart of the small university in Orange. The re-enactment is one of 
a host of activities staged in recognition of Black History Month at the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and students spoke briefly about civil rights and race relations 
before quietly listening to a recording of King's speech in the midday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Crow was a horror on this land," said Robert Slayton, a history professor 
at Chapman University. "And this movement beat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton urged the audience to seize the moral high ground -- as King did -- in 
championing civil rights. "If I have one dream," he said, "it is that God grant 
us the genius, self-sacrifice and subtlety of our predecessors." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange High School teacher John Johnson hoped the re-enactment would encourage 
the 18 students he brought along to learn more about the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little history lesson for the kids," said Johnson, who was active in 
Chapman's Black Student Union when he attended the university more than a 
decade ago. "It's important not only to African Americans but to all Americans. 
Civil rights is a concern for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Rivers, head of the university's Black Student Union, hoped that black 
students would heed King's message of unity and that white students would 
strive to judge people not by color but by "the content of their character." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine now majoring in history, Rivers, 28, said he believes civil 
rights has certainly advanced since King's speech, but that the movement "still 
has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the beneficiaries of that movement," Rivers said. "And let us never 
forget that, because that would be a grave injustice."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL DISTRICT PUTS FREEZE ON SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District has frozen expenditures to help close a 
projected $1.9-million shortfall in its budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which is expected to save about $500,000, will restrict school 
officials from making the planned purchases of such items as computers, 
audiovisual equipment and classroom supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze was discussed by the school board last week and is now in effect. 
Supt. David E. Brown said the freeze and other measures are necessary to offset 
the expected budget gap without laying off teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members will decide how to balance the budget in June or July 
when district officials present them with a final plan. For now, the board has 
decided not to lay off teachers, a move that would have required the 
notification of targeted instructors over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Garretson, president of the Irvine Teachers Assn., said the freeze could 
prevent some teachers from receiving big-ticket items for their classrooms such 
as televisions, computers, projectors and science equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson said he expects the district will still be able to provide basic 
classroom supplies such as paper, pencils and chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it looks like some of the larger purchases are going to be put 
off," he said. "We are just hoping that the financial picture clears up soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the spending restrictions might be lifted in certain cases. "We are 
not going to ignore things that are absolutely essential," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the freeze, district officials plan to ease the expected 
shortfall by placing available district funds in high-yielding investments and 
delaying the repayment of a loan the district made to itself. Both ideas must 
still be approved by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 fiscal-year budget is expected to be about $97 million. Funding 
from the state should to be the same as last year. The shortfall is likely to 
come from increases in employees' salaries and benefits as well as needed 
infrastructure improvements. SHELBY GRAD

 The law firm of City Atty. Jerry Patterson was given a new contract this week 
that is expected to raise the city's base legal fees by $550 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to increase the hourly wage and retainer 
fee paid to the Costa Mesa-based firm of Burke, Williams and Sorensen. 
Patterson, a former congressman, is a member of the firm and most often acts as 
the city's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract pays the law firm a retainer of $95 an hour for the first 50 
hours of work each month -- or $4,750 -- and $120 an hour for all time over 
that. Although Patterson does the majority of the work and attends most City 
Council meetings, 14 attorneys from the firm have represented the city in 
recent months, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council gave me very high ratings in terms of job performance," Patterson 
said, adding that he believed the increase in pay "was a modest one." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Eileen Krause applauded Patterson's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very confident of Mr. Patterson's performance and evaluate him highly," 
Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mike Eggers also backed Patterson, saying he has defended the city 
successfully. Last year Patterson successfully defended the city's General Plan 
from a challenge by a local community group. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher cast the dissenting vote, suggesting that 
the city explore hiring an in-house attorney or put the legal-services contract 
out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we need to do is look seriously at the alternatives," 
Ossenmacher said. "I'm still not satisfied this procedure is the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossenmacher handed out a memo that charted the costs of the city's legal fees 
over the past several years and pointed out they have gone up from $91,000 for 
1988-89 to $583,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really promoting we need a change, because we haven't done the 
homework necessary to see if we need to make a change," Ossenmacher said 
Wednesday. "I certainly don't support any raise at this time. It isn't very 
timely in terms of the way the economy has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Karen Lloreda acknowledged that the city's high legal fees are 
"kind of nauseating." But those fees are beyond the city's control, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to sue the city and every time they do it costs us money," 
Lloreda said, adding that "$120 an hour is very, very low."LEN HALL

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; DISTRICT AGREES TO REVIEW CANCELED PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale school district officials have agreed to formally review a canceled 
AIDS awareness play if parents at Hoover High School still want it performed 
during class time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would give it a second look if in fact the Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. 
wishes the district to do so," said Vic Pallos, spokesman for the Glendale 
Unified School District. The district canceled the play just one day before the 
scheduled Feb. 8 performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pallos said the review process involves an evaluation only and does not 
guarantee that district staff will permit the showing of "Secrets," a play 
produced by the Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente hospital care organization. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district refuses to allow the play to be performed during school hours, 
Hoover officials still have the option of asking the district for permission to 
show it after school. Given those two options, PTSA members said they are 
willing to take their chances with a formal review process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied with it, but I'm willing to try to work within the system," 
Carolyn Crane, AIDS awareness chairwoman for the PTSA, said Thursday. "I would 
like them to have a second look at it. I am hoping they will say that 'Secrets' 
can go on" during school. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the play, about a boy who is HIV-positive, was 
canceled because it conflicts with district policy. "Secrets" promotes the use 
of condoms for safe sex, but the district wants abstinence to be taught as the 
only way to avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald W. Empey, deputy superintendent of educational services, said his staff 
has been working on proposed guidelines for evaluating such sex 
education-related programs as "Secrets." No formal review procedure had existed 
in the district before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving along to get it done as quickly as possible," Empey said. "Once 
staff has developed these guidelines, it will be submitted to the board for 
approval." 
</P>
<P>
 The new process would also require campuses to report any outside 
sex-education-related programs or speakers to district officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, "Secrets" was shown at Daily High Continuation School -- next 
to district offices, said Principal Ted Tiffany. Pallos said the district was 
not aware that the play was presented at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover PTSA President Susan Kussman doubts that a review process would resolve 
the controversy surrounding "Secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll probably put some process together that not even God can comply 
with," Kussman said. TOMMY LI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; PRIVATELY BUILT FIRE STATION IS DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new fire station in Porter Ranch was officially dedicated Thursday with a 
lavish luncheon bash worthy of a senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
 After scanning the balloons, the silverware and the serving tables laden with 
roast beef and chicken, Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning remarked that 
it sure didn't look like your everyday municipal ribbon cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. The food, the balloons and the cutlery -- like the station itself 
-- were provided by a private company, Porter Ranch Development Co., which 
built the fire station as part of a deal with the city to allow 6,000 homes in 
the area. Porter Ranch was allowed to forgo installing sprinkler systems in the 
homes in exchange for building the fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 The station, dubbed No. 28, is the first in the city's history to be built and 
equipped by a private company, said Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was up to us, you would have had no lunch, and certainly no tablecloths 
and linen," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Fleming, a member of the city Fire Commission, heralded the deal as the 
beginning of a new era of public-private partnership in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new paradigm in the relationship between city government and the 
private sector," he said. "For the benefit of both, there has to be a 
partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, however, a clear benefit of the deal was sumptuous food, 
quickly set upon by more than 100 dignitaries, community activists and fire 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter Ranch officials chuckled wanly as City Councilman Hal Bernson ribbed 
Irving Feintech, a general partner with the firm, about negotiations for the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irving cried a little bit, but he came through," said Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was struck before a slump in the housing market prompted Porter Ranch 
to slow construction of its planned community, leaving the new station stranded 
among rolling green hills and wildflowers at the end of a dead-end street. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its remoteness, more than a dozen firefighters now work at the 
station, reassigned since a station on Reseda Boulevard was closed due to 
earthquake damage.  
</P>
<P>
 The new building itself suffered only one long crack in the ceiling in the 
Jan. 17 quake -- a problem, said Manning, not of structure but of spackle. JILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; MEDICAL CAREER SCHOLARSHIPS OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local high school seniors who are interested in a career healing people or 
animals may apply for about $38,500 in college scholarships that will be 
awarded this year to students pursuing a medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
 South County students can pick up applications, beginning March 1, in the 
office of their guidance counselor and must return them to school no later than 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarships are funded by the Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center's 
volunteer group through the sale of goods in the hospital gift shop. Donations 
also come from doctors, memorial gifts and contributions from the public. 
Depending on donations, sponsors say they may award more than $38,500. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 students applied to the fund last year. Students are allowed to 
reapply through their first four years of college. Almost half of last year's 
applications came from previous scholarship winners, said Erma Thomas, 
chairwoman of the Auxiliary of Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund has helped young people interested in all areas of medicine since 
1973, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for students who also want to become nurses, physical therapists and 
even veterinarians," she said. "We just want to help needy and deserving 
students who are looking to go into the medical field." 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants need at least a 3.5 grade-point average. Grades make up about 70% 
of what judges are looking for in scholarship winners, with financial need and 
outside interests also considered, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with questions about the scholarship program or those interested in 
making a donation can call (714) 364-1883. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH COSTA MESA; ADMINISTRATOR WILL LEAVE SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School officials announced Tuesday night that Assistant Supt. Thomas A. Godley 
will leave the district next month to become the superintendent at the San 
Marino School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Godley is the second top administrator in recent weeks to signal an intention 
to leave the district. Earlier this month, Assistant Supt. Carol Berg accepted 
a job in Sacramento with a private consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Godley will assume his new responsibilities on March 27, while Berg is not 
officially leaving until summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has always been a career goal of mine," Godley said. "I leave the 
district with mixed emotions. I have a lot of good memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Mac Bernd said that he has made no moves to replace either Godley or 
Berg, and will await the results of a curriculum audit before moving in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to rush into this," Bernd said, adding that Godley "has done 
an outstanding job. It is a wonderful opportunity for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Godley began his career in education as an English teacher in 1968 in 
Bellflower. From there, he went to the Garden Grove school district, and also 
served as an assistant principal at a high school in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 He then moved to administrative positions at Saddleback High School and the 
Fullerton Joint Union High School District, before joining the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District in 1989 as assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Newport-Mesa district, Godley was thrust into the center of the 
$4-million embezzlement scandal involving former district budget director 
Stephen A. Wagner, who is now serving a six-year state prison sentence. Godley 
headed the district's internal investigation into the intricacies of the 
embezzlement scheme, and was given the responsibility of getting the district's 
finances back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also one of the top district leaders targeted in an overwhelming vote 
of no confidence by the district's teachers in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Godley said he feels comfortable leaving the district for a better position, 
because the district's finances are now "on solid ground." 
</P>
<P>
 "He took a lot of shots," board President Edward H. Decker said of Godley. "He 
took a no-confidence vote, and didn't whimper. He took corrective action and 
got something done." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the scandal erupted, the top three administrators in place during the 
embezzlement scheme -- Godley, Berg and retired Supt. John W. Nicoll -- have 
either left the district or announced plans to leave.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY POSTPONES PLAN TO BURY UTILITY LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week postponed a proposal to install utility lines 
underground along Red Hill Avenue between Copperfield Drive and Nisson Road 
because of opposition from property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Councilwoman Leslie Anne Pontious after 
Tuesday'sunanimous vote."But I can't hold it against people who are absolutely 
against the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison Co. proposed removal of overhead wires and electric poles and 
burying the utility lines at a cost of about $250,000. The city had set aside 
an additional $6,000 for five new street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that the project was necessary for safety reasons and to 
improve the appearance of city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the property owners protested the cost of restoring their electric and 
telephone service once the utility lines were underground. The city's Public 
Works Department estimated that the property owners would have to pay $400 
each, down from an original estimate of from $1,200 to $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a difficult economy," said Carolyn Santos, one of the property 
owners. "I can't afford that kind of money. I'm pleased the council listened to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Kovac, who led the fight against the project since the council proposed 
it last year, said there are city streets where the need to put utility lines 
underground is more urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 He said electric wires that pass through or very close to trees pose a danger 
to residents, and must be removed first, ahead of the Red Hill location where 
he said there is only one tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Another property owner, Jeff Alderson, said he liked the idea of putting 
utility lines underground. "Aesthetics is good. But I don't want to pay for 
it." BERT ELJERA

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE'S LIBRARY REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The damaged Pierce College library reopened this week amid a research crisis 
caused by the closure of most San Fernando Valley libraries after the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although book borrowing is limited to Pierce College students, the public is 
allowed to peruse the college's 110,000 books and 400 periodicals inside the 
building and use the reference services, said Florence Robin, chair of the 
Library Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a relatively small library," Robin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we're important to the Valley, especially now that very few others are 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage, only four of the 16 Los Angeles Public Library 
branches in the Valley are open. Libraries at Cal State Northridge and Valley 
College also are closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pierce College library opened Wednesday morning, after crews of volunteers 
spent the weeks that followed the earthquake cleaning up, securing loose 
ceiling tiles and lights and restacking books, Robin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while just to get all the books back on the shelves," Robin said. 
"It's not like stacking cans of green beans in the grocery store. They have to 
be put back in order." 
</P>
<P>
 Further repairs to the ceiling will be made during the summer break, said 
Cathy Cameron, dean of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 The library at Pierce is open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. on Fridays and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays, except on holiday 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 David May, chairman of the Valley College Library Department, said he hopes 
the library at that school will be open by late next week for the use of 
periodicals and reference books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just beginning the process of seismic reinforcing of our shelving," 
May said. "It's going to be a while before the library is fully open." KURT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO MOVE TO AUTO CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have approved an agreement to move Buena Park Toyota to the 
city's Manchester Boulevard auto center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The auto dealership is important in a lot of ways," said Mayor Donald L. 
Bone. "No. 1, it was an effort to retain business in Buena Park, and it . . . 
will help us attract other dealerships to fill out available land." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, the city has been buying property along Manchester Boulevard to 
expand the auto center, which now has nine dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Toyota will move from its current location at Western and 
Orangethorpe avenues to the auto row site at Beach and Manchester boulevards, 
next to the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two historic homes now sit on the 3.4-acre site, Bacon House and the 
Whitaker-Jaynes home. They will be moved to a newly created historical district 
on Beach Boulevard across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 KLJ Partners, which owns Buena Park Toyota, will buy the site for about 
$481,000. The dealership also has a two-year option to buy an adjacent 2.9-acre 
site to build a second dealership, said May Hui, assistant director of 
development services-economic development for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Hui said the city's investment in the dealership project is about $5 million, 
which includes costs to buy the property for the historic homes relocation, 
move the homes and improve the site as well as to buy the Manchester Boulevard 
property (which the city will sell to KLJ) and demolish buildings on that site. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials lauded the dealership's move because of the projected sales-tax 
revenue of $250,000 a year. If the second dealership is built, the business is 
expected to bring in $225,000 a year in sales taxes. Property taxes generated 
from both sites are expected to be about $70,000 a year, Hui said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; RESIDENTS PROTESTING PLAN FOR 1,150 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to build up to 1,150 homes in Olinda Heights has some Brea residents 
protesting, saying the project will increase traffic, noise and density. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents, who generally live within four miles of the project, hope to 
persuade the Planning Commission to reject the current plan for the 
development, which would include luxury homes, horse trails, a school and a 
park. Commissioners are expected to review the project sometime this year and 
make recommendations to City Council members, who will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, city officials held two workshops at which 200 people 
commented on the project's environmental impact report. They claimed the added 
housing will cause traffic congestion on Carbon Canyon Road, increase air 
pollution and add 10% to the city's population of 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the project is just way too big," said Judi Kasper, an Olinda 
Village resident who formed Help Improve Land and Living Space, a grass-roots 
campaign against the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Resources Inc. wants to develop the project on 277 rural acres in 
Olinda Heights that it has owned for 100 years. City planners said they are 
weighing residents' concerns and about 200 letters that were mailed to City 
Hall regarding the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Santa Fe Resources and the city said plans for the project are fluid and 
there would be revisions to the current development plan before it goes to the 
Planning Commission. Those changes will be unveiled a month before the first 
public hearing, said City Planner Konradt Bartlam, who added that comments from 
the public are still welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved by planning commissioners and council members, the 
city would first annex Olinda Heights, which is currently in an unincorporated 
area but in Brea's sphere of influence, and construction would begin in 1995, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed project calls for Santa Fe Resources to also build an elementary 
school and a 14-acre park, to preserve three historical buildings and to widen 
Carbon Canyon Road and Valencia Avenue. In addition, Santa Fe is negotiating 
with Cal State Fullerton and other nearby universities and local school 
districts in an effort to make more than 300 homes available for faculty and 
employees at affordable costs. About 393 of the project's homes would be luxury 
estates with horse stables. 
</P>
<P>
 If the entire 1,150-home project were approved, the city would allow Santa Fe 
to build 230 extra homes, provided they are sold as affordable housing units. 
However, John Ullom, the project's manager, said it was unlikely that the extra 
homes would be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plan, Santa Fe would dedicate more than half the 277 acres as 
open space and shut down 102 of the 150 oil wells on the property. The city's 
first oil pump, which is no longer in use, would be preserved. The development 
would include horse, hiking and biking trails and would be completed in seven 
to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community will benefit overall," said Phillip R. Schwartze, a planner for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Taylor, an Olinda Village resident who lives about three miles from the 
project area, disagrees. She said she believes the added traffic would affect 
residents in her neighborhood and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development that is being introduced is urban development in a rural 
setting," Taylor said. "I have a problem with the number of houses (Santa Fe) 
wants to build and I think (the company) should rethink the whole proposal. . . 
. I would be satisfied if they build 400 to 600 homes and offered senior 
citizen housing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullom said the plan is "in a dynamic state. We're responding to input that we 
are getting from neighbors and we're looking at" possible changes. MIMI KO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; EFFORT CUTS DOWN ON PANHANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, panhandlers outside of convenience stores on Foothill Boulevard 
scatter when they see Joan Slater coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think I'm handing out religious pamphlets," said Slater, president of 
the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce, which a few months ago started a 
campaign against panhandlers because merchants and residents complained they 
were too aggressive, accosting customers even before they got out of their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the chamber printed up about 3,000 copies of a pamphlet listing 
services to help the homeless and needy, encouraging them to be distributed 
instead of giving spare change. That and a newly visible police presence -- 
marked also this week with the beginning of extra foot patrols -- has 
alleviated the problem, community leaders and police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were running up to cars before people would even park," Slater said. 
"They were physically grabbing people. Some were drunk and abusive." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber now is trying to raise money to print signs for local businesses 
to post that read "Don't Give Spare Change. Help Make a Real Change," 
explaining that money should be given to charitable agencies rather than to 
panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By giving them money just because they are intimidating you doesn't solve 
anything, it just encourages the problem," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's happening," Slater said. "I would say there is a 100% 
improvement in the last two months." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates have differing views on the approach. Many like the idea -- 
Los Angeles County and the United Way also distribute business cards that 
merchants can hand out that list where services and help are available -- but 
some wonder about the motives and the effectiveness of handing out a card or 
pamphlet instead of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't enough resources in the area to handle the panhandling and 
homeless in the San Fernando Valley," said Cynthia Caughey, head of the Women's 
Care Cottage, which helps homeless women and children. She said that often 
those who hand out pamphlets "typically do not support the groups in the Valley 
that help the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Giving money or a pamphlet is fine, she said, but then people should get 
involved and "at least be part of the solution somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Childress, head of the LA Family Housing Corp., which runs 
homeless shelters, said he encourages local business groups to use the cards or 
pamphlets. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VOUCHERS FUEL BUSINESS FOR SOME RETAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some retailers, it's Christmas in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last month's earthquake, San Fernando Valley merchants have enjoyed a 
boom from customers with American Red Cross vouchers, prompting comparisons to 
the December holiday rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had days when I have closed and have had $10,000 to $11,000 in 
vouchers," said Dean Gasaway, cashier supervisor for the Target store on Balboa 
Boulevard in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worse than Christmas," said Julie Roberts, a Target cashier. "People are 
driving around the parking lot looking for a space." 
</P>
<P>
 The vouchers are distributed by the Red Cross to victims of the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake to replace damaged or lost essential goods. The victim can 
present them to participating merchants, who are reimbursed by the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, the range of merchandise being bought with the vouchers is as 
diverse as the area's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Target store, Lisa Garcia, 25, filled up five shopping bags 
with $450 worth of clothes for six people. The items ranged from Aladdin shirts 
to sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't able to get anything out of our apartment," said Garcia, a mother 
of two who had lived in a Van Nuys apartment with her sister, niece and mother. 
"It's just like starting all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are other department stores that accept Red Cross vouchers, 
Garcia chose Target because "we wouldn't be able to get as much at the other 
places as we would here." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the voucher rush, Gasaway said the store has hired about 20 new 
employees since the quake, with more on the way. Other stores that take Red 
Cross vouchers, including Home Depot in Sylmar, have also hired additional 
employees to deal with added business. 
</P>
<P>
 Furniture is a hot item in addition to clothes. In North Hollywood, Simply 
Discount Furniture manager Vic Asher said he has received about 25 vouchers 
"usually (worth) over $1,000" since the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You name it, we're selling it," Asher said. "Sofas, cocktail tables, dinette 
sets, kids' beds. We're refurnishing whole homes." JEFF SCHNAUFER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PROTOCOL OFFICE WILL MARK ITS 10TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From her corner office on the ground floor of the county Hall of 
Administration, Gayle Anderson, the county's official diplomat, fields calls 
from foreign ambassadors, makes appointments to meet royalty, and chats with 
foreign businessmen interested in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's volunteer work as chief of protocol is all part of a 10-year effort 
by the county office of protocol to change the county image from that of 
sidekick to Los Angeles to one of haven for international investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately funded office will mark its 10th year Saturday with a gala 
fund-raiser in Newport Beach. The $150-per-plate affair features champagne, 
salmon, baked Alaska and the chance to hobnob with more than 40 foreign 
emissaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now the international social event in the county," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, the office of protocol has been successful in forging a 
close relationship with foreign diplomats by hosting them at fancy dinners and 
tours of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major functions of the office has always been to introduce members 
of the consular corps to the county, a tradition started by Mary Bonino Jones, 
who left her job as an executive with Disneyland in 1985 to become the county's 
first protocol chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Anderson whisked the consul general of France, Jean-Maurice 
Ripert, on a tour of McDonnell Douglas, Fluor Corp. and the Performing Arts 
Center. Anderson averages 25 such tours per year, with most diplomats wanting a 
look at high-tech industries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The office of protocol also is host to more than 300 yearly visitors sent by 
the United States Information Agency. The number of visitors has grown steadily 
since 1986, when the office greeted 32 foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The office is almost entirely self-sustaining and uses no government money. 
The 350 members of the Protocol Foundation pay annual dues ranging from the 
student rate of $50 per year to the corporate rate of $5,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Membership dues and fund-raisers pay for two full-time staffers and a budget 
of about $130,000 per year, and the county donates office space and telephones. 
The main perquisite for members is the chance to meet foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people join us because they want to meet interesting people from all 
over the world," Anderson said, noting that there are far more individual 
memberships than corporate ones. 
</P>
<P>
 This emphasis on mingling with the international elite is one of the things 
that Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who helped found the office in 1984, would 
like to see changed.  
</P>
<P>
 "The concentration has been more on the social side -- entertaining -- and 
that is not why I started it," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to improve the trade and working relationships with other countries," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The office has begun to make efforts in that area, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Anderson and representatives of two small Orange County businesses 
traveled to China to visit various government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for a small company to get into China and do business," 
Anderson said, but she hopes the trip and others in the future will open lines 
of communication between county businesses and foreign markets. MARY LOU PICKEL

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RESEDA; CHICK VOWS EFFORTS FOR SCHOOL SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a summit called to refocus attention on an issue that surfaced in the fall 
with reports of a serial molester who was attacking San Fernando Valley 
schoolchildren, Councilwoman Laura Chick vowed Thursday to work with school 
administrators and parents to improve crime prevention programs in and around 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scanty turnout in the Reseda High School auditorium where Chick spoke 
stood in stark contrast to the emotional crowds that gathered at similar 
meetings in the fall when the reports first surfaced -- reminding those present 
that the issue has shifted to the sidelines in the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake and lack of new attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a realist," Chick told the two dozen principals and parents in the 
audience. "I know there was a fear factor going on with the child molester. I 
know we've lost some of the momentum we had in terms of making our community 
safe. But we all know that we don't live in safe neighborhoods anymore and our 
schools are not safe anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick invited principals and parent representatives from about 150 Valley 
schools to the summit, a follow-up to a December meeting attended by 
representatives of several dozen schools. Chick called the low turnout 
disappointing, but said the effort would not be derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a small nucleus to get something going," she said. "We are going to 
start something with this." 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Chick discussed a number of crime prevention programs, some 
already under way, others still ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 One was a Safe House program that officers in the Los Angeles Police 
Department's West Valley Division launched in January, which the LAPD hopes to 
have in all 32 West Valley elementary schools by June. Working with schools, 
police designate pre-screened houses and mark them with green triangles to give 
children somewhere to flee in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Another program in place is one at El Dorado Avenue Elementary School in 
Sylmar where parent volunteers walk groups of children home from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ideas included an extension of morning and afternoon supervision at 
schools and a parental notification program in which parents would be called 
immediately if their children did not arrive at campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Disimile of Canoga Park, who has two school-age children, attended 
the meeting to voice support for the parental notification program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If schools take time to call, it sends a message to our children that 
somebody cares about them," she said. "Our first step is awareness." SUSAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; TIME CAPSULE OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers completing seismic retrofitting of one of the city's oldest buildings 
came upon it by accident last month: a foot-long copper box that has provided 
an unexpected looking glass into the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 The box contains a time capsule placed below the two-story brick building when 
the structure was completed in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, workers found letters, papers and photographs. The contents have 
little material value, but those who have examined the items said they are 
local historical gems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really pretty fascinating to look at this stuff," said Paul Motenko, 
co-owner of the new Italian restaurant that occupies the building. "Seal Beach 
has so much historical character. And you have a lot of people who have lived 
here 20 or 40 years and know about the history. It's very fitting to have this 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 BJ's Chicago Pizzeria opened its door Thursday by officially unveiling the 
time capsule to the public. The restaurant plans to eventually place the 
capsule on permanent display, Motenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The box contains rare photography of Main Street in 1922. Now a 
bustlingshopping district, the Main Street depicted in the photo is nearly free 
of buildings, except for the masonry structure where the capsule was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first major building on Main Street," Motenko said. "The 
building was all alone there on the street. It's pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The building originally housed a bank, and the capsule includes assorted 
banking materials such as original loan papers and financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 Also contained in the box is a handwritten letter from a man asking for a job 
at the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was written with beautiful penmanship with a fountain pen. It's the kind 
of English you don't see today," Motenko said. "At the end of the letter, he 
said he would be expecting a salary of $100 per month." 
</P>
<P>
 The box was found by workers digging six feet beneath the building to lay 
seismic posts. "They were digging into the ground, and all of a sudden the 
jackhammer hit metal," Motenko said. "Sure enough, there it was." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear who placed the capsule there. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days after the box was found, workers redesigning the old Masonic lodge, 
also on Main Street, came upon something else: an urn containing the remains of 
the city's first mayor, R.E. Dolley.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; IRVINE-FULLERTON RAIL ROUTE RECOMMENDED IT'S 
OFFICIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County rail planners have said for weeks that they would probably 
recommend a 28-mile urban rail route between Irvine and Fullerton. On Wednesday 
they did so, in a report to be discussed Monday by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA board is scheduled to vote on the route April 11 as part of the first 
step in applying for federal transit funds. A public hearing is planned for 
March 14, with results of a related public opinion survey to be presented March 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 "This centrally located corridor best serves existing commuter patterns and 
shows the greatest potential for future transit ridership," states the OCTA 
staff report released Wednesday. "The recommended corridor connects key 
employment and activity centers as well as residential areas of the cities of 
Fullerton, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Orange, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 An urban rail line would not be operational until at least 2002, transit 
experts say. Urban rail lines have more stops than do inter-county Metrolink 
commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine officials have lobbied strongly for their city to be added to the 
initial 13-mile segment between South Coast Plaza and Disneyland that is likely 
to be funded first. A modified route along Harbor Boulevard instead of Bristol 
or Main streets in Santa Ana also looks promising, according to OCTA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park officials are unhappy with the OCTA staff's findings because a 
proposed route serving that area has not been recommended. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

<P>
 Residents, especially those who speak Spanish, are being sought to become 
foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Bureau of Southern California is recruiting people to act as 
parents to needy children and is holding a foster parent orientation meeting 
March 16 for those interested.The 7 p.m. meeting will be at the Brea Senior 
Center, at the corner of Elm Street and Sievers Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent reports show that more children are being abused and neglected, making 
foster families more necessary, said Sandy Sladen, director of community 
services for the Children's Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children need foster family settings to live in rather than in institutions," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Requirements for becoming foster parents, Sladen said, include making an 
adequate income, having enough room in the home for a child and being in good 
health. In addition, foster parents cannot have criminal records and must have 
a desire to help children, she said. For more information, call the Children's 
Bureau at (714) 385-9025. MIMI KO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MEETING TARGETS PROSTITUTION PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of community and business activists has met with Los Angeles city and 
police officials to talk about ways to fight the increasing problem of 
prostitution on Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Wednesday night meeting, representatives from the Van Nuys 
Homeowners Assn., Sepulveda Business Watch and Sepulveda Boulevard-area 
Neighborhood Watch are drafting petitions urging prostitution-fighting measures 
to send to city and state politicians. Among the ideas being considered for the 
circular are harsher sentences for prostitutes and their clients, mandatory 
minimum sentences and fines for peddling sex, and an extra police car to patrol 
Sepulveda Boulevard for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Romana Catton, a Neighborhood Watch leader and a co-organizer of the meeting, 
said many of community residents' initial ideas for the petition were 
jettisoned or revamped after the meeting. But she added that the new ideas were 
generated by the residents in attendance. Deputy City Atty. Rick Schmidt, who 
heads the Van Nuys branch of the city attorney's office, and three Police 
Department representatives were also present to discuss existing prostitution 
laws and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the mapping program, petitions and letter-writing (to elected 
officials). We talked about every avenue we could possibly pursue," said 
Catton, who with Flip Smith, co-chairman of Sepulveda Business Watch, is 
spearheading the organization's efforts. The new group has named itself the 
Unified Community Watch Group, Catton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catton said neighbors would like to see a "mapping" program instituted by the 
city attorney's office and Police Department, which would discourage convicted 
prostitutes and their clients from loitering on Sepulveda Boulevard by making 
any prostitution-related activity -- such as lewd conduct or waving down cars 
-- a probation violation. A similar program is being tried in Hollywood, Catton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists are focusing on Sepulveda Boulevard between Ventura 
Boulevard and Devonshire Street, Smith said.

 Last year, the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. obtained more than 1,000 signatures 
on a petition that recommended several measures designed to combat 
prostitution. Although the proposals garnered some political support, none were 
introduced as legislation in 1993. KAY HWANGBO

BERGESON BILL WOULD CONTINUE BEACH CLOSURES; LEGISLATION: SHE'S PRESSING FOR A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE COASTAL COMMISSION, WHICH OBJECTS TO THE CURFEWS, AND 
ORANGE COUNTY CITIES THAT NEED THEM TO CURB CRIME.

<P>
 Hoping to speed the resolution of a dispute between cities and the state over 
beach curfews, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) introduced a bill 
Thursday that would allow the nightly closures to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said the legislation is, in part, a way to prod the state Coastal 
Commission to continue apace with efforts to negotiate a solution with city 
representatives from Orange County and other oceanfront areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County city officials and Bergeson have met twice in recent weeks with 
commission leaders in an effort to settle the dispute, which began when the 
commission warned coastal cities that their curfews are illegal without state 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If those talks fail to produce an agreement, Bergeson said, her bill would act 
as a backstop to ensure that the cities can continue the curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter M. Douglas, the commission executive director, took exception with 
Bergeson's bill and another introduced earlier by Assemblywoman Juanita M. 
McDonald (D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills, Douglas said Thursday, would undermine the fundamental 
jurisdiction of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's precisely the battle I was seeking to avoid," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meetings, Bergeson and local elected officials have been cooperative 
and both sides seek to continue with negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime," Bergeson said, "I made (commission representatives) make 
perfectly clear that there will be no intervention, no required changes for any 
of our local curfews." 
</P>
<P>
 In view of those meetings, Douglas said he doesn't believe legislation is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've demonstrated our willingness to work with the public and these 
officials on issues involving public safety," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was sparked after the commission dispatched a letter in October to 
73 cities and counties along the state's 1,100-mile coastline -- including four 
Orange County communities that have imposed curfews this year to curb 
late-night crime -- indicating that such closures are illegal without state 
approval. The letter also said that approval of any ongoing closures would not 
be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials in Orange County and elsewhere were upset that the 
commission might try to override their ability to fight shoreline crime with 
curfews limiting access during late-night hours. Commission officials have 
historically refused to approve any request to close beaches to the public on a 
continuing basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state officials said they thought the curfews were illegal under the 
state Coastal Act, no effort has been made to override the locally approved 
closures with the exception of Long Beach. Commission officials have indicated 
in the past that each local government might have to apply for a permit in 
order to keep enforcing the curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight budgets, as well as a spate of drunken brawls and a few shootings, 
prompted the state Department of Parks and Recreation to impose a curfew at 
state beaches in Orange County last April, rolling back its closing hours from 
midnight to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, which had 
curfews of 11 p.m. or midnight, promptly followed, fearing that those turned 
away from the state beaches might just move down the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 While those curfews were not challenged, the commission has acted in some 
cases to thwart stricter restrictions. Long Beach had closed its beaches at 
midnight since the 1950s, but when it imposed a tougher curfew -- running from 
10 p.m. to 5 a.m. -- the move was rejected by the commission last year.

GARAMENDI SAYS STATE WELFARE SYSTEM NEEDS OVERHAUL; POLITICS: BRINGING HIS RACE 
FOR GOVERNOR HERE, HE TELLS DEMOCRATIC GROUP HE WOULD PUT AID RECIPIENTS TO 
WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, bringing his bid for governor to Orange 
County for the first time, called Thursday for a complete overhaul of the state 
welfare system to prod more recipients into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must end welfare as we know it today," Garamendi said in a speech before 
some two dozen members of the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, held at 
the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, considered an underdog to beat state Treasurer Kathleen Brown in 
the Democratic primary for governor, delivered an impassioned oration that 
closely paralleled the themes he is addressing in a two-week blitz of 
television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 He portrayed himself in Anaheim as a candidate outside the typical political 
mold, trumpeting what he described as "a different kind of campaign" for the 
governor's job. Instead of "just sitting in some back room dialing for 
dollars," Garamendi said, he has been touring the state in recent weeks working 
at different jobs for a day to explore real issues of public concern. One of 
his future "jobs" may come at Disneyland, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working at a jail, Garamendi said, he saw firsthand the tremendous strain on 
the mental health system. At a construction site, he saw the need for close 
oversight of workplace regulations. And at a school, he saw the demands placed 
on teachers who had to double as school crossing guards in the afternoons 
because of a lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said there are "a thousand tasks" that are being left undone in the 
state, from removing graffiti to cleaning parks and roadways, and he suggested 
that putting more welfare recipients back to work in exchange for public 
support offers one potential solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm governor," he said, "these school crossing guards are going to be 
welfare recipients who are finally given some decent work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown holds a huge fund-raising advantage over Garamendi and had a strong lead 
over him in one recent statewide poll as well, but surveys have continued to 
show that Garamendi is better known among likely voters than his competitor is. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He saved his fiercest rhetoric Thursday, however, not for Brown but for Gov. 
Pete Wilson, attacking the governor on everything from transportation planning 
to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson cannot lead a Boy Scout troop home from a rained out weenie 
roast," Garamendi said. "Pete Wilson cannot, will not, does not know how to 
lead, and he must therefore be led from the scene of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard O'Neill, a longtime Democratic leader who attended Thursday's event, 
said that Brown probably holds an edge among Orange County Democrats. But 
O'Neill said he is backing Garamendi -- especially after his speech in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "He usually sounds pretty corny, talking about himself and his Peace Corps 
days, but tonight was pretty good," O'Neill said.

UNLICENSED CONTRACTOR IS SENTENCED

 A Canoga Park man who posed as a licensed contractor to perform 
post-earthquake repairs was sentenced Thursday to 20 days of community service 
work on a Caltrans crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustin Serrano, 33, was sentenced by Los Angeles Municipal Court 
Commissioner Harold S. Vites after Serrano pleaded no contest to working as an 
unlicensed contractor.Vites also placed Serrano on two years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is the first sentence" resulting from sweeps and sting 
operations conducted in the wake of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, said 
Deputy City Atty. Ruth Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers arrested Serrano Feb. 3 as he worked on a block 
wall in the yard of a quake-damaged home in the 18300 block of Chatsworth 
Street in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner did not ask that Serrano be sentenced to jail or request 
jail time or restitution because he felt the work Serrano performed was up to 
code, according to Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano was among several workers issued citations during a sweep.

NATION'S YOUTHS RESPOND TO QUAKE; SCHOOLS: STUDENTS FROM MORE THAN 200 CAMPUSES 
OFFER AID AND SUPPORT TO L.A.-AREA COUNTERPARTS.

 In Cedar Falls, Iowa, children did chores to raise money. In Tarborog, N.C., 
students collected 70,000 pennies. And in Erie, Pa., students are collecting 
6,600 new books. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts reflect an outpouring of support from students at more than 200 
schools nationwide. The youths, moved by searing scenes of destruction from the 
massive Northridge earthquake, have mounted fund-raising dances, book drives, 
pen pal writing campaigns and other efforts to aid their Los Angeles-area 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most amazing thing -- since the day after the earthquake my phone 
has been ringing off the hook," said Kathleen Barry, the Adopt-a-School 
coordinator for the L.A. Unified School District. "Almost every day I get a 
call from a principal or a teacher and they tell me it's the children who have 
come up with the idea of helping the children of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, students from Fort Irwin School in Yermo, Calif., are traveling to 
Patrick Henry Middle School in Granada Hills to meet the children and deliver 
clothes and school supplies collected in the community and at a school dance. 
The idea came from Fort Irwin's student council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason we're doing this is that in a time of need, everyone should 
work together," said 14-year-old Michael Touhill, Fort Irwin's student council 
co-president. "We talked about it, if something like this had happened to us, 
we would like other people to donate items to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Peekskill, N.Y., the children in Amy Stewart's first-grade class returned 
to school after the Jan. 17 Martin Luther King holiday and wanted to talk about 
the weather -- the ice and snow from which they were suffering and the 
earthquake that slammed Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart began by calling the school district and asking to be put in touch 
with a quake-damaged school that had children the same age as her class. The 
district matched her with Tarzana Elementary School and her students decided to 
write their new friends a letter to ask what they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dictated it to me and it said, 'We are first-graders and anyway we could 
help out we would love to do it.' And then they drew pictures of what our 
school looks like and what our class looks like." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hansen Elementary School in Cedar Falls, Iowa, children did chores to raise 
about $420 to send to the displaced students at Van Gogh Elementary in Granada 
Hills, said third-grade student teacher Elaine Johnson. The Van Gogh children 
have been moved to temporary quarters at Frost Middle School because of what 
officials fear is unstable soil at their school. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stocks Elementary in Tarborog, N.C., students collected 70,000 pennies for 
the children at Danube Avenue Elementary in Granada Hills. And in Mill Creek 
Township in Erie, Pa., students have a goal to collect 6,600 new books -- based 
on the original estimated quake magnitude of 6.6. 
</P>
<P>
 In Muncie, Ind., Zach Rozelle, an art teacher at Wilbur E. Sutton Elementary, 
said his school's letters to students at Germain Street Elementary in 
Chatsworth is a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an educational process as much as anything else," Rozelle said. "The 
teachers are using it to teach geography and to develop social skills, things 
like compassion and responding to human needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the overwhelming interest, some schools such as Cantara Street 
Elementary in Reseda have received inquiries from several schools -- and 
because so many teachers contacted Cantara and other schools directly, the 
LAUSD has been unable to get a total number on how many such projects are under 
way or how much money has been collected. On its own, the district lists about 
200 such partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantara Principal Sandy McGuern said the principal at Blue Lakes Elementary in 
Miami told her the school was referred to Cantara by a Los Angeles firefighter. 
Students at the Florida school collected $1,000 and a box full of letters in a 
10-day period. McGuern said she has also fielded calls from schools in Alice, 
Tex.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Goose Creek, S.C., and towns in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In suburban Washington, Rosemary Hills Primary School, with 650 kindergarten 
through second-graders, had collected several hundred dollars in cash and 
supplies by mid-week, Principal Jeff Martinez said. Martinez said students and 
parents at the Silver Spring, Md., school undertook a similar effort for the 
victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida.

JURISDICTIONS DISAGREE ON SCHOOLYARD OIL LINE; UTILITIES: NEITHER SAN FERNANDO 
NOR LOS ANGELES WILL TAKE THE QUAKE-DAMAGED PIPE THAT ARCO WANTS REALIGNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If the Northridge earthquake had happened a few hours later in the morning, on 
any Monday other than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, scores of 
children would have been arriving at O'Melveny Elementary School in San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have greeted rivers of crude oil spewing from a fractured pipeline 
on Wolfskill Street -- rivers that later ignited, seriously burning a man, 
charring a house and 17 cars, and terrifying an entire neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that public officials now are unanimous in wanting to move a segment of 
that same pipeline from beneath the school playground is to understate the 
obvious. Even the owner, the Arco Oil subsidiary Four Corners Pipeline Co., 
wants to realign the pipe and replace its aging segments and archaic welds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it seems no one can say where, how, when -- or even if -- the line will 
be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't come to an agreement, it's going to be major lawsuits coming from 
all over the place," Los Angeles Board of Education President Leticia Quezada 
warned Thursday. "It's in the interest of everyone involved to come to an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreement, however, appears to be a long way off. Officials in San Fernando, 
where the school is situated, don't want to move the pipe anywhere else inside 
their city -- even though they already have almost a mile-long segment of it 
under their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon doesn't want it moved into his 
district, which surrounds San Fernando and borders the school, and which also 
already hosts a segment of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take a major modification of the city's franchise with Arco to move 
the line," Alarcon said Thursday. "What I am saying is I will not support a new 
franchise agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 If neither side budges, though, the line will stay where it is, and oil can 
begin to flow again once Four Corners repairs and tests the line, state 
regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only regulate the safety of the pipeline once it's operating," said Nancy 
Wolfe, chief of the state fire marshal's Pipeline Safety Division. "So, on 
issues of where the pipeline is located, we have to be mute." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates some aspects of oil 
pipelines, also may remain mute. "The one thing we don't have jurisdiction for 
specifically, like we do for natural gas lines, is the safety of oil 
pipelines," said Martha Sullivan, a regulatory analyst for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-mile pipeline, which links Kern County oil fields to South Bay 
refineries, travels south along O'Melveny Street in San Fernando before hooking 
west on Wolfskill Street and back into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Installed in the early 1920s, the pipeline predates the school by more than 20 
years. San Fernando has had franchise agreements allowing the oil to flow since 
1924, according to public records. The city of Los Angeles has had similar 
accords governing the segment traversing its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to officials at the time, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
inherited the pipe in 1949, when it got the city of San Fernando to vacate a 
segment of O'Melveny Street so it could be incorporated into the school's 
playground, Quezada said.  
</P>
<P>
 When they found out about the line, school officials granted an easement to 
Arco in return for getting the company to bury the pipe deeper, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, San Fernando claims its franchise agreement doesn't govern the 
schoolyard. But school officials say they don't have jurisdiction either. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school district has no franchise authority over the pipeline that runs 
underneath the playground," said Bradley R. Hogin, a school board attorney. 
"The city (of San Fernando) has the only authority. It has the franchise for 
the entire part of the line within its boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned over the age of the pipe and whether gasoline could be shipped 
through it, San Fernando never renewed the Four Corners franchise when it 
expired in 1989. It has let Four Corners continue the flow until it could 
negotiate another agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if San Fernando and Four Corners never sign a new franchise, it remains 
to be seen whether the city can stem the oil flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that in the end we'll find out we can't stop them even if we 
want to," San Fernando City Administrator Mary Strenn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is governed by rules similar to those applying to power lines and 
natural gas pipes, Four Corners could resort to eminent domain proceedings to 
ensure unimpeded flow of oil to South Bay refineries, Four Corners' Vice 
President Daniel C. Reyneveld told a community meeting in San Fernando 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that issue also is not clear, Arco spokesman Scott Loll said 
Thursday. "It's so complicated that we can't define it yet, either," he said. 
"We just don't have the definitive answers yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither do the 150 parents who crowded the O'Melveny School auditorium to hear 
public and pipeline officials address the issue Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is I don't want the pipeline at all," said Marisela Torres, whose 
nieces and nephews attend O'Melveny. "I think we should find another way to 
route this oil. We are a small town, but I think we should show that we don't 
want the pipeline in our schools or in our cities."

HEARING TO RESUME ON RETURN OF CHILD TO FOSTER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Juvenile Court judge postponed a hearing Thursday to determine whether 
4-year-old Taj Jayyusi will remain in Orangewood Children's Home or be returned 
to his foster mother, who is fighting to get him back. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is expected to resume today in Orange County Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The child has been in protective custody at the shelter for neglected and 
abused children since Feb. 18, six days after his biological parents allegedly 
abducted him from his foster mother's home in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Services officials say they placed Taj there rather than with his 
foster mother, Sue White, to prevent any future abduction attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj's biological parents are accused of kidnaping him from White's garage Feb. 
12 while she was taking a shower. Sheriff's deputies who staked out a Cerritos 
business where the boy's father, 55-year-old Yaser Jayyusi, worked as a 
security guard, arrested him and his wife, Deborah Ann, when the couple arrived 
to pick up Yaser Jayyusi's paycheck six days later. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, Taj was in the car at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 They were booked into the Orange County Jail on Thursday on suspicion of child 
abduction and remained there Thursday in lieu of $250,000 bond.

ANTI-MALATHION ACTIVISTS START NEW INITIATIVE DRIVE; POLITICS: GROUP CITES 
UNKNOWN HEALTH RISKS IN URGING BAN ON SPRAYING UNLESS EVERY RESIDENT AFFECTED

<P>
 Calling malathion spraying by the state "sick" and "an abomination," an 
activist group announced an initiative effort Thursday to ban use of pesticides 
without permission of every owner whose property is sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Remedy Our Laws, formed in 1990 in opposition to malathion 
spraying, said they hope to gather 600,000 signatures by May 10, well over the 
385,000 needed to get on the November state ballot. The initiative failed to 
get enough signatures when it was first tried in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not calling for banning pesticides," said Oscar Singer of City Terrace, 
founder of the group. "We're just saying that before they are used, the state 
gets written permission of the property owners." He conceded that meant that 
one homeowner's refusal might prevent spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative also would make state and local governments liable for injuries 
resulting from pest control and would require public disclosure of ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen supporters, including some members of Orange County Citizens Against 
Malathion Spraying, stood with Singer as he accused the state of not telling 
the public about the "secret poisons" in malathion.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Department of Food and Agriculture, the spraying does 
not endanger humans or animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion is one of the most studied chemicals to come down the pipe," said 
Bev Passerello, who works in the state department of Environmental Health 
Hazard Assessment. "I think it would seem very unlikely and illogical for . . . 
any agency to allow people, pets and crops to be sprayed with chemicals that 
would have negative health effects."  
</P>
<P>
 Any chemical product would be harmful to people overexposed to it, she said, 
citing aspirin, bleach and household cleansers as examples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion is just a chemical like any of those. In the strength being used, 
we are assured there are no ill health effects." 
</P>
<P>
 But Costa Mesa resident Phil Cutler said, "How much risk are we willing to 
take to profit growers? It's not necessary to know just how dangerous malathion 
really is . . . it's not knowing what the impact will be 10, 20, 30 years down 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Activists urged more use of sterile Medflies to replace the use of malathion. 
But Alan Reynolds, manager of Treasure Farms in Irvine, said that "if using 
sterile Medflies alone worked, we'd do that, but it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Price of Irvine Valencia Orange Growers said, "I don't think we have 
health risks and there is much more to risk with losing agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said the group has 1,000 volunteers so far. Another public drive to get 
signatures will be held in Corona, where aerial spraying began last week, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand why they're doing it," said Carl DeWing, spokesman for the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture. "But I'm not sure if they understand the 
ramifications."

MUSICIAN-ACTIVIST YOUNG TO RUN FOR SANTA ANA MAYOR; POLITICS: THE FIRST TO 
ANNOUNCE CANDIDACY, HE WANTS TO REFORM THE CITY INTO A 'MARKET-LIBERAL 
MUNICIPALITY.'

 Blues guitarist, restaurateur and stockholders' rights activist Randell Young 
became the first announced candidate for mayor Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young called the City Council's unanimous vote to increase the utility tax to 
fund a new jail "the last straw" in his decision to shift from a full-time 
entrepreneur and musician to a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not be a politician per se," Young, 39, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Mayor Daniel H. Young, who is no relation, has said he will not run 
for reelection in November. Other frequently mentioned possible candidates 
include plumbing contractor and community activist John Raya and Councilman 
Miguel A. Pulido Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Randell Young, who operates the jazz and supper club Randell's on Hutton 
Drive, voiced particular frustration with Pulido. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get Pulido to meet with me," Young said, to discuss his plan for 
reinvigorating the city's economy "by increasing jobs and opportunities for 
residents -- not by raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quickest and surest path toward greatly reducing crime in Santa Ana is to 
reform the city into the most market-liberal municipality in California."  
</P>
<P>
 Young, who moved to Orange County 11 years ago from Washington, opened his 
namesake Art Deco club in 1992 on the ground floor of a Hutton Centre 
skyscraper. It is completely nonsmoking, considered a risky proposition for a 
jazz club, and features creole cuisine. One of the appetizers is called 
Randell's Supreme. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday nights, Young plays with his own blues group at the club.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Young filed a civil rights lawsuit against the club's landlord, 
Nansay USA, charging that the company was harassing him and discriminating 
against him because of the club's African-American clientele. That suit is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also owns commercial property in Santa Ana and Santa Monica, as well as 
a small record company. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a concerned citizen with two businesses located in this city, the only 
responsible course of action for me is to rally its citizens around a new, 
entrepreneurial direction for Santa Ana," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his mayoral candidacy, Young's best-known activism was in the 
"shareholders' rights" movement, founded by corporate financier T. Boone 
Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about what he saw as power abuse and waste on the part of 
management, Young joined Pickens' United Shareholders Assn. and began attending 
area stockholders' meetings at such companies as Allergan, Northrop and 
National Education Corp.

MAN HELD IN SEXUAL ATTACKS ON 3 WOMEN; CRIME: SUSPECT IS ARRESTED AFTER VICTIMS 
REPORTED ASSAULTS NEAR ORANGE COAST COLLEGE IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Mesa man was arrested on suspicion of sexually attacking three women 
Thursday near Orange Coast College, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the three women, who reported the attacks within 20 minutes of 
each other, identified Matthew Paul Krieger, 21, as the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieger was arrested in the area and booked into the Costa Mesa Jail on 
suspicion of attempted rape. He was held on $50,000 bail, according to police 
Investigator George Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3:20 p.m., the first victim, a 21-year-old Orange Coast College student, 
told police a man approached her from behind while she was walking on Merrimac 
Way near the campus, grabbed her, tried to fondle her and made lewd remarks, 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman screamed and broke free from the assailant, who fled. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes later, a 27-year-old Costa Mesa woman reported that she was 
grabbed while walking with a 40-year-old Tustin woman in the 300 block of 
Hanover Drive, about two miles from the site of the first attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger woman screamed and got away from the attacker, who then accosted 
the older woman, knocked her to the ground and fondled her, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant fled when the two women's screams attracted residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Krieger a short distance from the scene of the second attack. All 
the victims identified Krieger as the attacker, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that Krieger may have been involved in similar attacks, and 
asked anyone with information to contact Detective Frank Rudisill at (714) 
754-5363.

EX-TOP AIDE TO ROTH WILL SEEK WIEDER'S SEAT; POLITICS: STEVEN E. MALONE 
ANNOUNCES BARE-BONES CAMPAIGN FOR SUPERVISORIAL POST. HE'LL TRY TO DISTANCE 
HIMSELF FROM ETHICS CONTROVERSY THAT TOPPLED HIS FORMER BOSS. 
</P>

<P>
 Steven E. Malone, who served as chief of staff for former Supervisor Don R. 
Roth, has announced that he will make his own bid for the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, 48, of Huntington Beach, said Thursday that he will offer himself to 
voters as a "truthful, low-key, independent" candidate seeking the 2nd District 
seat that Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder plans to vacate when she retires next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will have to divorce himself from the controversy surrounding his 
former boss, who resigned last year and pleaded guilty to violations of the 
state's ethics codes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the criminal probe of Roth, Malone cooperated with investigators and 
described how he helped his boss conceal gifts he received for political 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened is a legacy I have to live with, but it's an experience I've 
learned from," Malone said. "I'm a stronger and wiser person for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, a Republican, said his 19 years of experience in government have given 
him an insight into the problems and excesses of local government. Before 
joining Roth's staff, Malone was an aide to former Supervisor Ralph Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone plans to run a bare-bones campaign: He said he has no campaign manager, 
no campaign funds and no plans to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Roth's resignation in March, 1993, Malone has been "on hiatus," watching 
Orange County politics from afar, he said. "The supervisors have neglected the 
business of this county in exchange for furthering their political careers," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Malone, citing strategy, declined to describe his platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Three board seats will be up for grabs this year, with seven candidates vying 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone joins Huntington Beach council members Jim Silva and Linda 
Moulton-Patterson, and businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson as candidates for 
Wieder's post. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson and Laguna Hills businesswoman Madelene Arakelian 
are vying for Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's 5th District spot. Riley also plans 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth District Supervisor William G. Steiner, appointed to fill Roth's spot, 
is so far running unopposed.

OVERALL CRIME IN ANTELOPE VALLEY DROPS SLIGHTLY IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime in this north Los Angeles County region decreased slightly in 1993, 
although there was a significant jump in the number of arson fires, according 
to a report released Thursday by the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of crimes dropped by 1% to 14,214 in 1993, compared to 1992's 
total of 14,454. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall crime has remained consistent in the Antelope Valley," said Sgt. Bob 
Denham. There were 215 reported arson blazes in the Antelope Valley last year, 
compared to 97 in 1992. Much of the increase is because of last summer's arson 
grass fires, most of which were set by minors, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of assaults also climbed in 1993. There were 3,487 assaults in 
1993, a jump of 3% over the 3,378 assaults in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it has to do with domestic violence," Denham said. "We are seeing a 
lot of domestic violence." 
</P>
<P>
 A new computerized system of tallying crime statistics also may have an 
impact, he said. The 1993 crime report is the first by the automated system, 
which may be more accurate than the former method of manually tracking the 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all categories of crime increased in 1993 in the Antelope Valley, where 
the 1993 population was estimated at 295,392. The number of homicides, 
burglaries, larcenies, and robberies all dropped in 1993 compared to the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very encouraged when we see burglaries and larcenies go down," said 
Denham, noting the decline is probably the result of residents' increased 
awareness of crime and increased involvement in neighborhood watch programs. 
"People are locking up their homes more, keeping their garages locked." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Antelope Valley, the number of burglaries dropped from 3,296 to 
3,012 while larcenies fell from 5,267 to 4,742. The number of robberies 
declined 2% from 566 to 553. 
</P>
<P>
 Denham said the decrease in homicides, from 38 in 1992 to 27 in 1993, is not 
telling because the number is too low to indicate a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 An area of concern is the rise in grand thefts of automobiles, which jumped 
21% in 1993 to 2,047, he said. In the Antelope Valley, he said, the cars most 
frequently stolen are average family cars, taken between 1 and 4 a.m. from 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Car owners, Denham said, should keep their vehicles in their garage at night 
and make sure they are locked and that the keys are not inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of demand for (stolen) autos," he said. "There's a big market."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA APPROVES $1-BILLION RECOVERY 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Santa Clarita will spend more than $1 billion in local property 
taxes over the next 45 years on an ambitious plan to recover from the 
Northridge earthquake, while simultaneously improving its infrastructure, 
redeveloping blighted areas and building affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council adopted the Santa Clarita community recovery plan by a 4-0 
vote on Tuesday. Councilwoman Jill Klajic was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The debt from the plan, which will be implemented over 30 years, could take as 
long as 45 years to pay off. It will be paid for with a percentage of property 
taxes in the redevelopment zone, which is encompassed by the city's original 
boundaries, excluding undeveloped land, golf courses and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials were adamant that property taxes were not being raised to fund the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not raise taxes. It does not raise taxes. It does not raise taxes," 
said Steven Peck, a financial consultant hired to help implement the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as home values and property taxes rise, the agency will take about 
half of the increase to fund improvements, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds would otherwise go to such public agencies as schools and county 
government. Peck said the state would reimburse local schools for funds lost as 
result of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first five years, the agency will focus its aid on restoring 
quake-damaged structures and helping individuals and businesses who suffered 
losses in the quake. The program is scheduled to begin in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the agency will tackle a backlog in repairs to city streets, roads and 
bridges and other public property. Finally, the Redevelopment Agency will help 
revitalize blighted areas such as east Newhall and build affordable and senior 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although areas annexed to the city after its 1987 incorporation are not 
included in the zone, they are eligible for improvements if it is determined 
that they would benefit from the overall project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jan Heidt praised the plan, saying it gets to the meat of the 
issues facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope I'm around in 30 years to see what we've done with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last month's quake, attempts to establish such an agency had been 
stalled because of time and cost constraints. But by using emergency powers 
brought about by the quake, the council was able to activate the agency and 
define its boundaries without going through the standard -- and potentially 
arduous -- environmental review process. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the quake did is loosen up some regulations and make it easier for us to 
jump through some of the hoops we needed to jump through," said city 
spokeswoman Gail Foy. "We think the result is going to be great for this 
community."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REFORM REMAINS GOAL FOR TEACHERS DESPITE 
CHARTER SCHOOL DEFEAT; EDUCATION: HIGHLAND HIGH INSTRUCTORS HAVEN'T DECIDED HOW 
TO PROCEED AFTER TRUSTEES DENIED PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They won't be able to abandon the rules entirely, but that doesn't mean they 
aren't looking for new ways to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational reform remains a goal for Highland High School teachers, who 
worked about a year toward the creation of a charter school on their campus 
only to have their plan rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five Antelope Valley Union High School District trustees voted 
last month against the charter school proposal, which would have allowed 
Highland High to operate outside the constraints of the state education code. 
Trustees Wilda Andrejcik and Bill Olenick supported the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Horst, head of the charter committee and a Highland High English teacher, 
said reform supporters at the school have yet to determine how to proceed now 
that their charter plan was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really exactly sure," he said. "We're kind of wrestling that out 
for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is working toward educational reform, Horst said. Now it's a 
matter of figuring out how to get there. "We don't have a focus now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate bill signed into law in late 1992 by Gov. Pete Wilson allows for the 
creation of 100 charter schools in the state. Since the law took effect Jan. 1, 
1993, 48 charter schools have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of the bill by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) was to give schools 
the freedom to reinvent themselves. With authority to abandon the dictates of 
the education code, the charter schools are free to concentrate on education 
programs tailored to the needs of their students. Of course, such schools must 
produce measurable results. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Highland High, the first in the Antelope Valley to propose a 
charter school, had envisioned creating a learning environment based on the 
"needs of students in the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the proposal, supporters said, involved an effort to "develop 
self-motivated, competent, life-long learners." 
</P>
<P>
 The first year of the five-year charter would have been a development year 
with the governance of the school to remain unchanged, Horst said. The charter 
was to have been implemented in the second year with an elected council of 
students, teachers, staff members and community members as the decision makers 
for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the concepts in the 18-page proposal, he said, were based on "Second 
to None: A Vision of the New California High School," a 1992 report prepared by 
the California High School Task Force that laid out a vision for reform 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of high school district board members failed to support the charter 
plan, in large part because of a two-page letter from the general counsel at 
Bakersfield-based Schools Legal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by Frank J. Fekete, the letter states: " . . . the charter proposal 
still fails to address many of the specifics that must be determined before the 
school can begin operation." Fekete cited items such as management of the 
school, fiscal control, curriculum and liability as not being detailed enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter concludes: " . . . I think there are good reasons to delay approval 
until further development work is completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Horst said the charter committee went through "every hoop that was conceived" 
before putting the proposal before the board of trustees for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "In truth there was no reason to fear this proposal on any level," he said. 
"People who claimed there weren't enough details don't have a good structural 
understanding of the process approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The charter committee considered appealing the decision to the Los Angeles 
County Board of Education, as allowed in the legislation, but decided against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year's tough enough," Horst said. "We don't need to belabor this anymore. 
It was a long, arduous haul doing what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the denial of the charter proposal was a letdown, committee members 
believe their effort is having some benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ripple effect is already being seen," Horst said. "Things are happening 
at other schools that we've been talking about (for) a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Andrejcik, who supported the proposal, also believes that despite its 
defeat the charter plan will have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the ideas that went into the planning of that could still be incentives 
for restructuring, which we need in the high schools," she said. "We're working 
on some new ideas (such as) curriculum changes and realignment of curriculum 
along vocational lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how it happens, she said, "What we need to do more than anything 
else is spark in these students a purpose for education so they'll take more 
interest and devote themselves more to what they're engaged in."

RILEY'S SPINAL SURGERY 'A GREAT SUCCESS'; HEALTH: DOCTORS CUT PINCHED NERVES TO 
RELIEVE LEG PAINS. IT'S UNKNOWN WHEN HE WILL RETURN TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Spinal surgery performed early Thursday on Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley was "a great success," leaving the politician groggy but resting 
comfortably at Hoag Hospital, his chief of staff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 81, underwent three hours of surgery and is expected to remain 
hospitalized until Sunday or Monday, aide Christie McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley was admitted to Hoag on Wednesday after his doctors decided that surgery 
on pinched nerves in his lower back would alleviate the intense leg pain that 
Riley has suffered in recent weeks. The leg problems are the latest in a string 
of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all real, real pleased," McDaniel said. "It's amazing. I don't know if 
he's a cat with nine lives or how many he's got left, but he looks great." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel said she did not know when Riley would resume his duties as chairman 
of the Board of Supervisors. Vice Chairman Gaddi H. Vasquez, who will fill in 
for at least the next regular meeting on Tuesday, could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's hospital stay comes just two months after he was hospitalized for a 
foot infection. The infection, which confined Riley to a wheelchair, masked the 
severity of the unrelated leg pain until he resumed walking in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley had felt occasional jolts of pain through his legs dating back to last 
year, but after he began to recover from the infection in his left foot, the 
discomfort became more intense, McDaniel said. That pain continued until, in 
the past few weeks, even the slightest weight on his legs was agony. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley underwent magnetic resonance imaging last week, a scan that pinpointed 
nerves in his lower back as the culprit behind the pain, McDaniel said. During 
the surgery Thursday, neurosurgeon Nasrola Edalatpour "cut back the nerves so 
they wouldn't rub against the spine," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has represented the 5th District on the board since his 1974 appointment 
by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Riley plans to retire when his term expires next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Riley has weathered a series of maladies, including bouts of 
emphysema, asthma, bronchitis and problems related to his diabetic condition. 
In 1991, he underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery.

ANGELS SIGN LANGSTON TO THREE-YEAR EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have had this bizarre history of allowing marquee pitchers to walk 
away from their organization, only to be left looking foolish the minute they 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, they decided to change that reputation by signing All-Star starter 
Mark Langston to a three-year contract extension for $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, which was completed during a 90-minute meeting with agent Arn 
Tellem and General Manager Bill Bavasi, stipulates that Langston will be paid 
$5 million in 1995, $5 million in 1996, and $4 million in 1997. He is eligible 
to earn $1 million in incentives in 1997, and cannot be traded without his 
permission for the duration of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract not only prevents Langston from leaving as a free agent at the 
season's conclusion, but significantly changes the perception of the Angels and 
their budgetary cutbacks. Perhaps they never again will unload Gene Autry's 
saddlebags in the free-agent marketplace, but they will spend money to keep 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this sends a message to everyone on our club that they're just not 
going to let people slip away as free agents anymore," Langston said. 
"Hopefully, we can take care of things and keep the young players around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to see this thing through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have been ridiculed the last few years for their drastic 
payroll reduction, also are on the verge of signing right fielder Tim Salmon to 
a four-year contract that could pay him about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't be happier with what's going on around here," Angel first baseman 
J.T. Snow said. "I think it shows this organization is really committed to 
winning, and Mark proved that by staying." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who signed a five-year, $16-million contract with the Angels in 1989 
as a free agent, had little reason to believe he'd return after this season. 
Although he never wanted to leave Southern California, and had a no-trade 
provision, he engaged in a bitter argument in November with Whitey Herzog. He 
was told to seek a contract with any team, and Herzog would accommodate him by 
trading him. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston discussed long-term contracts with the New York Yankees and Chicago 
White Sox during the winter, but in his heart, he wanted to stay. It was only 
after Herzog's resignation as general manager in January -- and the subsequent 
promotion of Bavasi -- that Langston knew he would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there hadn't been a change," Langston said, "I don't know if this is where 
I would have wanted to be. But that all changed when they made the moves in the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things moved pretty quickly after that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had offered Langston a two-year contract while Herzog was in 
office, and Langston requested a four-year deal. They compromised Thursday, and 
the Angels believe they have retained the finest left-handed starter in the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, 16-11 with a 3.20 earned-run average last season, has won at least 
15 games in five seasons. He also is the only active major league pitcher who 
has thrown least 223 innings in each of the last eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I signed this with the thinking that it will be my last contract," Langston 
said. "And believe me, it's a comfortable feeling knowing that I'm going to be 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'll be part of something special here." 
</P>

ANALYSIS; DUCKS STILL IN THE HUNT LATER THAN EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD and ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strange but true: Three-quarters of the way through their first season, the 
Mighty Ducks are still in the chase for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Dec. 2, Coach Ron Wilson couldn't believe his first-year team was tied 
with the Stanley Cup finalist Kings. Now, it's almost March and the Ducks are 
two points ahead of the Kings and four behind San Jose in a three-team race for 
the eighth and final Western Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one games -- 10 at home, 11 on the road -- remain, and Wilson stops 
short of saying the Ducks (23-35-5) will make the playoffs. He keeps saying 
they'll be close, and that's as startling a development as any this season in 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the success of their fellow expansionists, the 26-24-10 Florida 
Panthers . . . Or an 0-9 record against the Kings and Sharks . . . Or a 9-20-2 
record at Anaheim Arena . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where would the Ducks be then? 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side: 
</P>
<P>
 * They tied Tampa Bay's 1992-93 expansion debut of 23 victories with a 6-3 win 
over Philadelphia last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * They could tie or better the NHL expansion record of 31 victories, set by 
the Flyers and Kings in 1967-68. (Of course, Florida will probably get there 
first). 
</P>
<P>
 * They finally made a trade, bringing scorer Stephan Lebeau from Montreal in 
exchange for steady goaltender Ron Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the three-quarter report card: OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring goals is still the Ducks' most glaring weakness. Their 174 goals are 
better than only Florida (170), Tampa Bay (165) and Ottawa (155). 
</P>
<P>
 The Lebeau trade should help. He had 80, 58, 53 and 35 points in four seasons 
in Montreal. Signing Paul Kariya of Canada and Valeri Karpov of Russia, two of 
the biggest offensive stars of the Olympic Games, in the coming days would 
help, too. It's no slam dunk that Kariya and Karpov will soon be in Duck 
uniforms, but General Manager Jack Ferreira has been keeping an eye on both in 
Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading scorer Bob Corkum, who has 20 goals and 44 points, has proved to be 
the team's biggest offensive surprise. Terry Yake, expected to lead the team, 
has 20 goals and 43 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Since returning from a dislocated left elbow that sidelined him for 
two months, Anatoli Semenov has only three points in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: C. Down from a C+ at halfway. DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 There have been occasional defensive lapses, but a 7-2 loss to Detroit on 
opening night still ranks as the season's only blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei Kasatonov is expected to be sidelined for about a month with a hairline 
fracture in his right foot. But there are plenty of others ready to take up the 
slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McSween has provided added depth and Sean Hill and Bill Houlder have come 
around lately. Houlder worked his way out of Wilson's doghouse after being 
scratched for three consecutive games. He had a bad habit of making a mistake 
that led to a goal for the opposition, driving Wilson batty. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: The Ducks' 194 goals allowed is the least in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: B-. Holding steady. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Power-play efficiency: In a word -- brutal. They rank 23rd in the NHL and 
recently went through a five for 60 stretch. It's hoped that Lebeau will turn 
things around. In his first game as a Duck, he played on the power-play unit 
along with Semenov and Bob Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: They were scoreless in 18 consecutive power-play opportunities until 
Yake broke the streak with a first-period power-play goal against Buffalo on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: D. Down from a C-. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalty killing: One of the most impressive aspects of their game continues to 
be their penalty killing. They rank ninth in the NHL, allowing 50 goals in 291 
short-handed situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: They fell from first to eighth in killing penalties on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A. GOALTENDING 
</P>
<P>
 There appeared to be two reasons the Ducks made the Tugnutt trade. First, they 
needed more offense and second, Guy Hebert finally emerged as the No. 1 goalie. 
Hebert started 10 of 13 games before Sunday's trade and had a 4-4-2 record, 
including a 3-0 shutout of Vancouver Feb. 4 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Shtalenkov, who will be Hebert's backup, won seven of his last 10 for 
the San Diego Gulls and was 15-11-2 with a 3.45 goals-against average overall. 
Shtalenkov stopped 21 shots in a 2-2 tie at Pittsburgh Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Hebert had a 1.50 goals-against average in his last four victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A-. The effects of the Tugnutt trade have yet to be determined. 
COACHING 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks can thank Wilson's grinding game plan for much of their success this 
season. When they lapse into a freewheeling style, they get burned. It happened 
often at home and was the main reason the Ducks were 4-12-2 at Anaheim Arena at 
the season's midway point. They settled into a more defensive mode in the 
season's third quarter and are 5-8-0 in the last 13 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has complained about some silly stuff this season -- the width of 
Florida goalie John Vanbiesbrouck's pads, for instance. But he was on target 
when he questioned Wayne Gretzky's injury, and sportsmanship, after a 
five-minute high-sticking major to McSween Jan. 29 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's postgame comments inspired Tony Tavares, team president, to fire this 
salvo on the eve of the teams' Feb. 11 rematch at Anaheim: 
</P>
<P>
 "He has influenced more calls than any other player probably in the history of 
sports. It's to his credit and his team's benefit. I wish I had somebody who 
could get away with what he gets away with." 
</P>
<P>
 Hello rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Wilson's preseason prediction was for 18 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade: A-.

RAM NOTES; RAMS MOVE TRAINING CAMP TO UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams will move their training camp from Cal State Fullerton to UC Irvine 
this summer, according to university and team officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Novak, general counsel for the Rams, said Thursday that an agreement has 
been reached with UCI, and a contract is expected to be signed within a week or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams trained at Fullerton throughout the 1980s, but when construction of 
Fullerton's Titan Sports Complex began in the fall of 1990, the team moved its 
camp, which runs from mid-July to mid-August, to Irvine for 1991 and '92. The 
Rams returned to Fullerton last summer but were not happy with all of their 
accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facility at Fullerton is fine, but the whole arrangement at the 
University Village dorms was not a positive," Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak and Ed Carroll, UCI's associate athletic director for financial affairs, 
declined to discuss financial terms of the deal, but it's expected to be a boon 
to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the publicity value of having them here, but we rent facilities all 
the time to generate revenue," Carroll said. "They pay for facility use, 
housing, food service, parking . . . it's a good chunk of change." MIKE

FIRST PERSON / RICH TOSCHES: WANT A FROZEN FISH? STICK WITH MRS. PAUL'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behold the ice fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Behold that frozen thing hanging off the end of his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of you who don't go ice fishing on a regular basis -- and admit it now, 
there are some of you who hardly ever pick up the ice chisel and mealworms and 
head out for a nice day at the lake this time of year -- snicker at those who 
do. If you don't snicker, it's because you howl right out loud at the thought 
of intentionally stumbling onto a frozen lake to allow the ripping Arctic winds 
of winter to mercilessly rake your face and body. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you should be advised that there are people in these parts who 
really think highly of your habit of lying nearly naked in the sand, the sun of 
a thousand deserts sauteing your oil-smothered skin in what entomologists and 
physicians agree is the perfect setup for that coveted double delight: infected 
horsefly bites and a slow, cancerous death. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget that. This is about ice fishing, which, according to government 
statistics, is the fastest-growing sport in America that involves four pairs of 
socks and so many other layers of clothing that it is humanly impossible to go 
to the bathroom, a sport in which the frequent wiping of your nose on a sleeve 
is considered perfectly acceptable social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 And it doesn't even have to be your sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is here, in highest Colorado, that sometimes dozens of stout people 
-- mostly men with names like Arglok and Gbjorke -- forsake that other winter 
sport, the one that has made Colorado so famous (I speak, of course, of leaping 
frantically out of the way of lurching, glassy-eyed actors and actresses riding 
cocaine and skis in Aspen) for this more placid sport of yanking a bewildered 
trout through a small hole in the ice and then clubbing it on the head until it 
is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 On 100 lakes, from Colorado Springs to Grand Junction, from Blue Mountain to 
Bonanza to Bond to Boone to Buffalo Creek -- hey, why even look past the Bs for 
funny names when you've got those five together? -- they shuffle themselves out 
onto the ice, clutching rods and reels and worms and shiny little lures and ice 
chisels to blast their way through several feet of crystal ice, all with the 
very same prayer: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear God, please don't let me slip and crack my head wide open right now 
because there are no hospitals within a day's drive and even if there was one, 
these demented people I am with, Lord, none of them would drive me anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 If they don't slip and crack their heads open, and believe it or not such 
misfortune doesn't strike all of them, they trudge methodically across the 
frozen wasteland, the ice threatening with each step to fling them down heavily 
onto their skulls. They walk and walk and walk some more. Finally, they stop at 
the spot , a place they are sure the fish swim in numbers so great as to rival 
the unfortunate things Dan Quayle has said in his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 They know this is the spot because a guy named Lou, who has a friend who is 
the uncle of the stepmother of the guy he works with, claimed he caught three 
fish right there in that spot from a boat 11 years ago. In the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And then they chisel their way through 36 inches of granite-hard ice, lower 
their baits through the hole and wait for a trout or salmon to cruise by. 
Specifically, a trout or salmon that doesn't think it even slightly odd for an 
earthworm with a hook through its face to be dangling from a string under three 
feet of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't catch any fish -- and as you'll see in a moment, such a thing 
does happen -- they blame the barometric pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It is at this moment, as they settle onto the ice above the holes and the 
howling wind of a Rocky Mountain winter blows so hard that it musses up their 
hair -- and I'm talking the hair in their noses -- that the anglers become the 
ice-fishing adage: 
</P>
<P>
 A jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, they are rewarded. Colorado folklore has it that a man 
known only as Fred actually caught a fish in this manner. Recently? Well, you 
be the judge: That fish, legend has it, was the very last real meal eaten by 
the Donner Party on its way to California. Next on the menu for that tough-luck 
group was Baked Stuffed Eldon. 
</P>
<P>
 But without that account of an ice fishing trip more than 100 years ago, it 
wouldn't be much of a sport at all. Because deep inside the frail human mind is 
the need to believe, the need to be bolstered by such stories of roaring 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I sit on an upside-down bucket far from shore on a place called 
Eleven-Mile Reservoir near the Continental Divide, elevation 10,000 feet, the 
temperature of a hundred Ice Ages (officially -18 degrees) making me shiver so 
violently that people in cabins nearly a mile away are shouting at me to keep 
the noise down, the winds of all the universe snapping my ears back and forth 
like the flippers on a pinball machine. 
</P>
<P>
 After chiseling through the endless ice, I lower a line. Problem: At 18 below, 
standing water freezes again in -- let me check this with hydro-physicists -- 
uh, half a second. So the line was stuck in the re-forming ice faster than you 
could shout "hypothermia." 
</P>
<P>
 You get around this problem by kicking at the hole with a boot heel. And then 
the water freezes over the hole again and your boot is encrusted in ice and 
your feet hurt real bad from the invading cold. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of that is the good part of ice fishing. The bad parts? Well, try 
slipping your hands out of a pair of warm gloves into 18-below temperatures and 
then trying to tie a knot in fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
 How cold? Well, with an uncontrollable spasm induced by the cold, my left 
thumb twitched badly and the needle-sharp point of the hook buried itself into 
the flesh. Deeply. And you know what? It didn't hurt. Not a bit. Not a single 
sensation of pain. I had, in essence, caught myself. And the only way I knew 
that was because the sight of a three-inch metal minnow dangling from your 
thumb with blood trickling down your hand is, well, an uncommon sight. 
</P>
<P>
 I yanked the hook right back out, taking a bit of meat with it, the blood 
flowing a bit steadier, and it still didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 I fished in vain for nearly four hours, deciding to call it a day only after 
the crushing cold began to affect my mind. I think. Because unless Dom DeLuise 
actually was at Eleven-Mile Reservoir in remote Colorado that day, leading a 
pack of llamas across the ice, well . . . I firmly believe I was hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
 But you know what kept me going for those hours? It was that need to believe. 
The need to hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And oh, did I ever hope. 
</P>
<P>
 I hoped like hell that my truck would start. 
</P>
<P>
 And I hoped like hell that when my brain thawed, I could remember the name of 
the guy who suggested I give this sport a try. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to return his razor-sharp six-foot-long ice chisel. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he turns his back.

 Imagine: It is 1 a.m. and you are desperate for a fashion fix. You switch on 
"Donna Karan Home Shopping" and for the next hour watch Christy Turlington swan 
around in jersey bodysuits and cashmere pullovers while the designer tosses out 
advice in her Noo Yawk bark. 
</P>
<P>
 You order a $750 cashmere sweat shirt to pair with the $500 suede jeans you 
bought last week from the Calvin Klein show. Before drifting off to sleep, you 
make a date with your best friend to watch tomorrow's prime-time debut of 
"Shopping With Giorgio Armani." 
</P>
<P>
 Dream on. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the hype about shopping via TV and the attempt by its two major 
outlets -- QVC (Quality, Value, Convenience) and the Home Shopping Network -- 
to improve their kitschy image, top designers have so far shunned electronic 
retailing. (Arnold Scaasi, a jewel in QVC's fashion crown who last season 
pushed $150 to $225 dresses, has not been scheduled for a return appearance.) 
But how long can they ignore a burgeoning $2-billion-plus industry that 
promises to do for shopping what the automobile did for travel? 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be impossible for me to pretend I could sell a fabulous evening 
dress or a tailored suit on television," said New York designer Isaac Mizrahi. 
"These things have to be tried on and fitted." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally skeptical is Bill Blass: "My clients don't really shop by TV. I can't 
imagine the Bel-Air ladies sitting around watching home shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, "the mall you call" is still in its embryonic stages. As it 
becomes more sophisticated, fashion's big wheels may decide to roll onto the 
electronic retailing highway. "I guarantee you within a year most designers 
will jump in," predicted Diane Von Furstenberg, a close friend of QVC Chairman 
Barry Diller who has sold more than $10 million worth of her Silk Assets and 
accessories collection via TV. "Right now they're waiting to see what new 
home-shopping networks will be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 They may be lured by Catalog 1, a Time Warner/Spiegel electronic venture 
scheduled to premiere next month, offering items by Neiman Marcus, 
Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel, among others. Or perhaps On Q and Q2, two 
QVC creations also set to air this spring, will entice them with promises of an 
updated format and cutting-edge products. Or maybe TV Macy's, to debut in the 
fall, will snare fashion's reluctant stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't expect to see the latest Seventh Avenue designs dancing across your 
tube anytime soon. Some well-known designers say that although they find the 
concept intriguing, they're wary of selling their clothes via television. 
Reasons range from an unwillingness to share the airwaves with frying pans to a 
lack of time to a belief that sales agreements and high return rates on 
merchandise would keep profits too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, QVC is basically a discount store, and the Home Shopping Network has 
fake designers like Vanna White and Ivana Trump," observed Alan Millstein, 
publisher of the New York City-based Fashion Network Report. "It's the wrong 
ambience for upper-crust designers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more, on our current television system, most high-fashion clothes, 
which are heavily black, beige and gray, look very dull on screen," he 
continued. "You can have the finest models and the best lighting and the 
merchandise will still look blah. Maybe in five years when high-definition TV 
comes along, things will be different. But right now, you can't tell the 
difference between polyester and silk." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Buchman agreed. "The clothes I see on television are very simplified in 
cut, and the detailing isn't at all subtle," said the New York designer, whose 
separates are sold in better department stores. "I don't mean to sound snobby, 
but they're selling $19 blouses -- which isn't our customer." Buchman said she 
might be interested in electronic shopping "once things get more focused on a 
higher-priced customer." 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibilities are endless," she added. "Imagine that right after watching 
'Murphy Brown' you could turn on some home-shopping program that appeals to the 
woman who identifies with Murphy's clothes. Now that would be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Kemper, a favorite designer of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, said 
he had been approached about doing a home-shopping line but declined. "I'm too 
involved with getting my collections in the stores to spend time creating a 
separate line for TV," he said. "To me, home shopping is about oversize, 
elastic-waist clothes. I make $650 suits for the urban career woman. I'm not 
convinced that the image is right. There still seems to be something tacky 
about home shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a make-over, electronic retailers might have trouble attracting some 
designers, including Alexander Julian. 
</P>
<P>
 "My financial people say the difficulty is that you can sell a lot of 
merchandise but only QVC makes money," the New York menswear designer said. 
"You also need more interesting programs. Men don't have the attention span for 
home shopping that women do." 
</P>
<P>
 Blass, who is "skeptical" about selling clothes on television, conceded that 
he recently had a grand time hawking sheets on QVC. "Sheets are a standard 
size; it's not like a dress that you have to try on," he explained. "And we had 
very few returns. But I've heard that returns on clothes are astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
 QVC maintains that returns run about 19%, not the 50% or higher quoted in the 
industry rumor mill. A company representative declined to discuss QVC's 
contracts with clients. "All financial deals are confidential and vary with 
each designer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all designers are reluctant pioneers in the fertile field of electronic 
retailing. Those who already sell a collection in department stores create a 
completely different one exclusively for television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of designers are being very shortsighted about 'teleshopping,' 
" said Randolph Duke, who sells a collection of separates on QVC. "It's part of 
that old '80s mentality of elitism. You can't hang on to the old way of 
building a business through expensive prices and prestige image. You have to 
look for new opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just what Duke did. In 1992, after five years on Seventh Avenue, he 
split with his backer and closed his showroom. A year later, he introduced 
Style Systems, one of the hipper lines of QVC, with $150 jackets and a $48 
leather-and-gold-chain belt. On his first two-hour show, he sold more than $1.1 
million in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can do on television is teach women how to put together three 
different looks from one jacket or how to take the season's hot silhouette and 
make it work for her," explained Duke, who also designs a higher-priced 
collection exclusively for Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average woman relates to this, not the fantasy pictures they see in 
Vogue. How many people in middle America have heard of (Belgian designer) Ann 
Demeulemeester, let alone can describe the clothes she designs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Unger also says she is delighted to be part of QVC. Her Kay Unger Desk to 
Dinner line of $20 to $99 washable separates features such gimmicks as snap-on 
beaded collars and rhinestone cuff links. Better known for her pricier, 
career-oriented Gillian collection sold in major department stores, Unger is 
careful to keep her lines entirely separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never mention Gillian on the air," she said. "I would never do anything to 
jeopardize my relationship with my retailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would Regina Porter, who, in addition to her eponymous retail line, does a 
sportswear collection for QVC. "Since the lines are totally different and don't 
compete with one another, the retailers don't object," she explained. "The 
fashion-forward stuff that sells in the stores doesn't have the mass appeal you 
need for television. You're not going to offer the viewer a see-through blouse 
that 1% of the audience would wear." 
</P>
<P>
 But designers who have made their names with pricey, high-style creations 
aimed at Vogue readers aren't interested in whipping up Size 14 polyester pants 
for the masses. "I don't want to downscale my clothes," Mizrahi said. "I'd 
rather wait until the market became more upscale." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably will. The tony retailer Bergdorf Goodman recently announced that 
it would begin testing an interactive home-shopping system in parts of New York 
City. On Q plans to spotlight innovative fashions, accessories and cosmetics, 
while Q2 will air programs geared to a young, active, affluent audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get the major designers on board," predicted Candace Carpenter, 
president of Q2. She declined to say who they might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every big designer is waiting for someone else to be the first one to take 
the plunge," analyst Millstein said. "To market on TV requires an enormous 
amount of planning, time and work. It's not something you do overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Added designer Kemper, summing up the feelings of many designers: "Everybody 
keeps saying, 'Go on TV and you can make a ton of money.' It's like the gold 
rush. But right now, I'm not ready to join the stampede."

INTO AFRICA; LOCAL DESIGNERS LOOKING TO THEIR HERITAGE FIND THAT THEIR SOURCE 
OF PRIDE IS ALSOTHEIR INSPIRATION FOR FUSING TRADITIONAL, IMPORTED FABRICS AND 
CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its crowded freeways and countless strip malls, Orange County is unlikely 
territory for fostering fashions that recall the remote villages of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here amid the urban sprawl, local fashion designers are turning to Africa 
as the inspiration for their fledgling clothing collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Their designs are a melting pot of traditional African fabrics and 
contemporary American styles. For these designers, using an imported fabric 
such as colorful Kente cloth woven by tribes on the Ivory Coast is more 
powerful than any other kind of mass-produced material. It's a source of pride, 
a tribute to the designers' heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 They import their materials directly from Africa -- the hand-dyed batik 
cottons, the woven Kente with its brilliant gold stripes and mud cloth with its 
nubby texture and deep, coffee-colored, mud-based dye. Some of the materials 
have been produced in African factories. Others have been made by hand in the 
African villages, using methods that go back for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Coffey, owner of an African American boutique called Images in Santa 
Ana, designs her line of clothing for adults and children from fabrics imported 
from West Africa. The line, called Image Wear, includes everything from 
business attire for the office to casual jogging suits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is what I call contemporary fashion with an African flair," Coffey 
says. "We use African fabrics for all or part" of the garment. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of Image Wear's cultural fusion: a man's vest made of black leather (a 
favorite of urban dwellers) and mud cloth made by African tribes with 
hand-painted stripes and dots on an inky background ($88). 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey can turn a woman's suit into something exotic but still appropriate for 
the office by designing the simple A-line jacket and straight skirt out of a 
gold and maroon wax-finish cotton print with stylized doves soaring among puffy 
clouds ($129). 
</P>
<P>
 Sarong skirts and loose-fitting baby doll dresses for women made of batik, 
unisex vests in bright geometric cottons and coordinating T-shirts and beach 
pants in cotton prints for adults and children round out her collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey opened her shop in November, 1992, after searching without success for 
books that featured African American children to give to her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County we're such a small part of the population that the stores 
say, 'There's not enough of you' " to carry African American merchandise, she 
says, referring to the county's 2% black population. "I wanted to fill that 
void." Her shop carries African American books, art, jewelry and gifts as well 
as apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 She began designing clothes as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started sewing a couple of outfits for myself and got such a response that 
it kind of grew into a clothing line," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her customers are primarily African Americans from Orange County, although 
some buyers come from as far as Los Angeles and San Diego. She also sells her 
clothes through a mail-order catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wear the African fabrics as a symbol of pride in their heritage. That's 
why authentic strips of Kente cloth are popular. Traditionally worn by tribal 
chiefs, Kente strips have become badges of honor that are worn around the neck 
or shoulders with everything from blue jeans to tuxedos. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of actors and musicians wear them to awards ceremonies," Coffey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Komuntale, a former resident of Kenya, creates contemporary and 
traditional ceremonial clothing using fabrics imported from Africa. She sells 
her designs from her home in Irvine and at fashion shows held at her church, 
Main Place Christian Fellowship in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Komuntale's collection ranges from casual sportswear to evening wear. Among 
the pieces are ceremonial robes, head wraps, shorts, business suits, reversible 
jackets and sarongs, all in the bright colors and unusual patterns of Africa 
($50 to $200). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way to bring culture to people, to show them the African designs 
but make them contemporary," Komuntale says. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers sense a growing acceptance among Americans for African styles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to see American people develop a taste for African products, 
because Africans have always liked American goods," says George Siaw Osborne, a 
native of Ghana now living in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in the United States years ago, Osborne quickly learned that 
his royal clothes would look out of place in his new country. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousins said, 'You can't wear that,' " he says. "People here have a whole 
different style." 
</P>
<P>
 He has incorporated Western style into his eclectic collection of evening 
wear, sportswear and even bikinis made from African fabrics. Timbuktu in Costa 
Mesa carries a few select pieces of his clothing, including a parka made of 
Kente ($145) and a jacket of green and maroon batik with an embroidered front 
($125). 
</P>
<P>
 "These are modern designs in traditional fabrics," says Joanne Baker, owner of 
Timbuktu, who was born and raised in South Africa and came to the United States 
21 years ago. Timbuktu also carries art, masks, trinkets and jewelry imported 
from Africa as well as yards of African fabric that can be worn as a sarong or 
sewn into a vest or other garment. 
</P>
<P>
 African jewelry appeals to people of all ethnic backgrounds looking for unique 
accessories, Baker says. 
</P>
<P>
 Timbuktu has bracelets and necklaces of old glass trade beads dating back to 
the 1700s, amulets, shells, bone, seeds and carved pieces of ostrich eggs. Men 
in particular like the bracelets made of rows of small ostrich shell beads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're one-of-a-kind," Baker says.

A SARTORIAL SHORT CUT THAT MANY MEN FIND LONG ON COMFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shorts are not complicated. They require no ironing. They complement nearly 
every T-shirt in a man's wardrobe. And some styles feature a ventilated liner, 
which eliminates the bother of underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 What more could a guy want? 
</P>
<P>
 "Functionally comfortable" is how Malcolm Wilson puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Beach artist counts himself among a common breed: men who love 
to wear shorts. Five, six days a week in summer or winter. Bermudas, hiking 
shorts, jams. Wilson prefers baggy flannels. 
</P>
<P>
 Such men crave sartorial brevity after work, on weekends and on Friday nights 
when their significant others wish they would dress up for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplicity of the garment no doubt appeals to male sensibilities. When it 
comes to men and fashion, the fewer buttons, the better. But a more powerful 
force must fuel what, for some, amounts to dependency. A subconscious 
insistence, a primal machismo perhaps, tints Wilson's voice when he speaks for 
all shorts lovers: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just gotta let my legs breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 This sentiment rings familiar, typically male and typically Californian, an 
archetype that wraps every Beach Boys album and most Frankie Avalon films into 
a tidy, sun-drenched package. Think about it. The only time you saw Malibu Ken 
wear long pants was when he had to take Barbie to the prom. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the depths of the Golden State, in the bluster of winter's 60-degree 
afternoons, Harley riders cruise Hollywood Boulevard in denim cutoffs. Sure, 
they might be cold. But they will not admit it. Meanwhile, the young guys at 
Culver City Ice Arena skate circles in their jams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see them every day," says the manager, who assures us that skating 
bare-kneed is no problem "unless you fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there are other risks. The risk of exposing knock-knees, scrawny 
calves and lumpy ankles. Some dare to uncover wide expanses of pale skin. Not 
that there is anything wrong with pale skin. Some of my best friends are pale. 
It's just not the physical attribute they should be accentuating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I shop for a pair of shorts, I end up in line behind some geek who 
shouldn't be wearing shorts at all," says Keith Heerdt of Canyon Country. "I'll 
ask myself, 'Should I be wearing them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, he says, the answer is a brazen "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1959 tome "The Importance of Wearing Clothes," Lawrence Langner 
suggests that people use clothes to convey a message about who they are or 
would like to be. Even the guy in the velour pullover and Sansabelt slacks 
will, at some point, look in the mirror and say: "Oh, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although cultural restrictions have loosened since olden days when bare shins 
were considered inappropriate, wearing shorts still conveys a hint of 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, for one, revels in his opportunity to wear shorts while working. 
Self-employed, he considers himself a fortunate misfit in a world where most 
white-collar workers must don a coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got long hair and an earring," he boasts. "So I may fit into that rebel 
category." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is such impetuousness, the need to strike out against convention, 
that incites men to wear shorts on rainy days or in other inappropriate 
instances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a warm summer day and you look nice and you're not wearing knee socks 
and dress shoes, then shorts are OK," says Maxine Moshay, a Los Angeles writer 
who harbors strong opinions about the public display of gams. "Wear them to a 
Sunset Boulevard cafe on a Saturday afternoon, but don't wear them to a nice 
restaurant. And don't wear them to the Music Center. I mean, there are a couple 
of men who wear shorts to my church." 
</P>
<P>
 This propensity goes against the very grain of evolution. Clothing served to 
separate early humans from the animal world, Langner writes. It offered certain 
illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this he was helped by the invention of clothes which covered his body, 
kept his higher centers plainly visible, but covered the lower centers which 
emphasized his kinship with the animal world," he writes. "He no longer felt 
akin to this animal world, but to the world of gods and spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 Who, Langner poses, wear more clothes than clergymen? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is where primal urges come into play. The author notes that Levant rock 
paintings, dating from about 10,000 BC, provided an early glimpse of men 
wearing shorts. They were virile men, great hunters wielding spears. Does a 
blip in our genetic memory draw us back? 
</P>
<P>
 The mere suggestion evokes Robert Bly and his mytho-poetic beckoning for 
modern "soft men" to discover their "hairy wild man" side. Or the infamous 
Bohemian Club, a San Francisco men's group that counts ex-Presidents and 
self-made millionaires among its members. Each summer, this august body 
retreats to a redwood grove in Northern California to gallivant half-naked and 
urinate on trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gentleman's club," an official once explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, such gentility will result 
in an enthusiastic invitation to 72 hours of psychiatric observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, by wearing shorts and refraining from public relief, the legally 
acceptable man may be indulging a deep-felt, if unacknowledged, desire to bare 
his thighs, to let shin hairs bristle in the breeze, to avoid chaffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not dismiss this as mere whimsy. The unassuming shorts may, in fact, serve 
as a battleground in the clash between fundamental male psychology and 
contemporary social mores. They may represent a subconscious attempt to regain 
the manhood that was lost when men became dependent on gas-driven automobiles 
and TV dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorts may be the last connection to man's true nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just put them on," says Kyle Matthews, a Calabasas teen-ager. He shrugs 
at the suggestion of any deeper significance to the pair of dark baggies he 
sports. "They're easier than pants."

THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT; THERE'S NO ONE LENGTH -- OR LOOK -- FOR BLACK 
WOMEN'S HAIR ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quick flip through the music television channels reveals anything but a 
trend in hairstyles for African American women. It seems as if the latest looks 
are as diverse as the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Black women are at a turning point in their thinking about hair, explains 
Nadine LeBlanc, who describes herself as an "ethnic hair-care specialist" and 
owns the homey Penthouse Salon in Leimert Park. She credits singer Toni Braxton 
with sparking the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women who have hard-to-grow hair have always believed they could 
only be beautiful with long hair," she says. "Now that they see Toni Braxton 
and other singers with very short hair, they see how beautiful they can be. 
They're not afraid to cut their hair anymore. All lengths are in fashion now." 
</P>
<P>
 Braxton's style is a geometrically cut wrap, in which the head acts as a 
roller to straighten the hair and keep it flat. Other recent sightings on the 
air waves include Vanessa Williams in a long, smooth style; the clipper cut and 
wrapped dos of the duo Zhane; Yo Yo rapping in the ultra-popular braided wrap 
-- complete with braided bangs -- and newcomer Me'Shell Ndegeocello, a jazz 
rapper who opts for a shaved head. And the members of Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue 
turn out in everything from relaxed and straightened hair to finger-waves and 
pasted-down curls. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional women have been picking up the individualist direction, LeBlanc 
says. "I send everyone out of the salon looking different. You have to take 
into consideration (the) length of the face, body size and profession. . . . A 
judge and a student won't wear the same look." 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Williams, a nurse, wears the "ultimate maintenance-free" style. It's 
half an inch long and texturized with a relaxer to elongate the curl, which 
creates a soft wave in front. Williams gets a cut every four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Laws, who works in media relations for a television show, opts for a cut 
that can take on different personalities. She can wear it in an updated shag, 
with ends beveled by a curling iron -- reminiscent of styles worn by Patti 
LaBelle, LeBlanc says. Or she can wrap it, like Braxton, for a closer-to-the 
head style. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrative assistant LaSondra Brass likes to keep her curly hair long. She 
uses thermal straightening to get the look of Carole Lombard, with the hair 
falling over one eye, or of Vanessa Williams. Brass says: "It reminds me of 
Jessica Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the sophisticated new hairstyles involve some degree of chemical or 
thermal straightening, which involves heat styling with a pressing comb or blow 
dryer. To prepare for for such treatments, LeBlanc encourages women to stand on 
their heads to improve circulation to the scalp, drink lots of water to 
decrease brittleness and buy special hair-nourishing vitamins in health food 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBlanc expects to see some women go back to full, '60s-era "naturals" adopted 
by rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg and Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop's style, LeBlanc says, is a "blow out," a look that involves braiding, 
unbraiding and then combing out into a natural. 
</P>
<P>
 The hairstylist says she recently spotted an older woman with a silver natural 
as long as six or eight inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wore it like a crown. It was absolutely stunning." 
</P>
<P>
 A return to unprocessed hair would make sense, LeBlanc says. "If you wear 
ethnic-look clothes, you should have hair that's compatible."

PRICE IS THEIR STRONG SUIT; DISCOUNTERS: WEEKEND-ONLY CLOTHIERS PROMISE 50% TO 
75% OFF AND LOTS OF STOCK. AND MEN ARE BUYING.

 Maybe it's the rock-bottom prices that make Erik Barros wonder. Or the 
erratic, weekend-only hours. Perhaps it's the cheesy name: "Suit City." 
</P>
<P>
 "It all sounds so illegal, doesn't it?" says Barros, 31, a Montebello 
carpenter whose wife dragged him to the Fountain Valley discounter to find an 
inexpensive suit for a wedding. "It makes you wonder if they're stealing these 
things off dead bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping in a 22,000-square-foot warehouse may unsettle some customers. But 
there's nothing unlawful about the rash of three-day "suit brokers" popping up 
throughout Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. And with promised 
savings of 50% to 75% off retail and a seemingly fathomless selection, such 
retailers as Suit City, Three-Day Suit Brokers and Men's Clothiers of Santa Ana 
(temporarily open daily) have become a new haunt for bargain-hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the word discounter sounds a little dirty to some men," offers Edward 
Phillips, executive vice president of Suit City, with stores in Corona and 
Fountain Valley. "But when a guy comes in and sees 10,000 suits on the floor, 
he realizes this is fantastic inventory. If he can't find a suit here, there's 
something wrong with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even very tall or short customers will find a suit -- plus sport coats, dress 
shirts, neckties, belts and shoes -- to fit them, say the weekend warriors, as 
these discounters are known in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go from 36 shorts to 60 longs, and we offer more than 300 suits in (each 
of) those sizes," says Leo Shahinian, president of Three-Day Suit Brokers, with 
stores in Fountain Valley and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The labels lean toward such obscure Italian brands as Paulo Gucci and 
Leonardo, as well as Hugo Boss, James Edmonds, Oleg Cassini and Hartmarx, all 
priced from $89 to $535. (Don't expect to see a Donna Karan or Calvin Klein 
among the pack.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The average suit at Suit City goes out the door at $150," Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in the kind of mammoth quarters usually associated with light industry, 
the suits are divided into long aisles. Boldly lettered signs hanging from the 
ceiling or a post direct shoppers to their sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 In some places, the hang tags include the original price; in others, they list 
only the "everyday low price." Shirts, shoes and accessories get their own 
self-serve sections. The amenities amount to chairs outside the curtained 
dressing rooms for mates in waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's like walking into a Home Depot for men's clothing," Shahinian 
says of the shopping experience. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep down prices, the weekend-only discounters buy manufacturers' leftovers 
and sell them about 30% above wholesale, less than most department stores' 
markups. They eschew fancy fixtures, storefronts and long-term marketing 
strategies, relying on a midweek blitz of radio and print ads. And the 
part-time employees receive no commissions or benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, sales help may be scarce in the stores, Phillips concedes. 
"There's no one standing over you pulling suits out and saying, 'Try this on' 
or 'This will look great on you.' " The stores do, however, offer alterations, 
including free hemline fixes, through on-site tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend warriors suggest that a suit shopper's mate is his most important 
asset anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we're open only on the weekend is because most guys like to shop 
with a woman, either their girlfriend or their wife. And they can't do that 
during the week," says Bob Sherinian, general manager of Three-Day Suit 
Brokers.

COMMENTARY; A BELOVED SPY SAYS GOODBY, ITS COMIC MISSION JUST BEGUN; FRIVOLOUS, 
SOPHOMORIC OR DOWNRIGHT VICIOUS, AT ITS BEST SPY MAGAZINE WAS THE FUNNIEST 
THING ON THE NEWSSTAND. AND NOW -- PFFFFT! -- IT'S GONE. 
</P>

 I'm going to miss Spy Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 With this simple statement, I'm sure I've just made some new enemies, but I 
don't care. I know that the magazine, which announced last weekend that it 
would fold after the next issue, was sometimes frivolous, sophomoric -- even 
downright vicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of my friends were bludgeoned by Spy at one time or another and I've 
taken a punch or two myself in the dreaded "Review of Reviewers" section. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at its best, Spy was probably the funniest magazine around. Not since 
before the National Lampoon stopped being both tasteless and hilarious and 
became merely tasteless has there been such a consistently engaging humor 
magazine in America. (I would except the political pages of the Village Voice, 
but I sometimes have the horrible suspicion we're supposed to take them 
seriously.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, at the start of its run at least, Spy took on the right targets. 
Back in the mid-'80s, pre-crash, when every other magazine on the stands seemed 
determined to outdo its competitors in sycophantic hymns to the financial and 
social genius of Donald Trump, Spy presented him as a preening, narcissistic, 
publicity-addled fool. For that alone, the magazine deserves its wings.  
</P>
<P>
 A column devoted to the New York Times -- while sometimes needlessly cruel to 
the poor souls who, through force of circumstances, have been impelled to work 
there -- was often uncannily accurate in its chronicle of the paper's internal 
politics. In the late '80s, photocopies of each column were gleefully smuggled 
around the Times newsroom like samizdat.  
</P>
<P>
 Windy critics, corrupt politicians, overrated brat-pack novelists, overpaid 
Hollywood moguls -- Spy dispatched them all gleefully, with extreme prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best articles: a wonderful devastation of the man who personified 
all that was ossified and boring about the pre-Tina Brown New Yorker, Ved 
Mehta; a case-by-case study of the "Alive With Pleasure" advertisements created 
for Newport cigarettes that demonstrated, quite convincingly, a subtext of 
sexual cruelty that would have shocked Vance Packard; the time Spy asked a host 
of politicos what they would do about the situation in Fredonia (the mythical 
country in the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup") and received typical politico 
answers ("Take action," "I'll have to look into it" and "It's a different 
situation from the Middle East"). 
</P>
<P>
 And I recall some great throwaways, as when Spy noted that Upper Volta had 
changed its name to Burkina Faso. "Please," the editors begged, "celebrate in 
moderation." 
</P>
<P>
 There was much about Spy that always made me uncomfortable: straw targets, 
glib denunciations, New York provincialism, specious innuendo. Some people were 
able to fight back (New York magazine, a regular target, returned fire with a 
cover story that slammed Spy as brutally and idiomatically as Spy had slammed 
its victims). Others suffered in silence.  
</P>
<P>
 And there was no doubt that the magazine had lost some of its edge. The Times 
column was effectively finished when one staffer who had been unusually willing 
to share state secrets left the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 But as recently as the January issue, there was a riotous, letter-perfect 
parody of the Conde Nast magazine Details, titled Retails, complete with 
stupefyingly banal ersatz-verbatim interviews with inarticulate "celebrities" 
nobody will ever hear of (Retails: "Does America belong in Bosnia?" Janeane 
Garofalo: "People belong . . . I think . . . it's important, really, you 
know?") and the prediction that Harrisburg, Pa., will be "the new Seattle." 
("So what should I see tomorrow night?" asks the breathless young journalist. 
"Uh, you could catch a movie," suggests the hometown boy.) 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its faults, I'm going to miss Spy. I found something in every issue 
that made me laugh -- and I'm willing to forgive a lot for that.

20 PALESTINIANS IN MOSQUE KILLED BY JEWISH SETTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Jewish settler on the Israeli-occupied West Bank opened fire early today on 
Muslims praying at a mosque in Hebron, 20 miles south of Jerusalem, killing at 
least 20 Palestinians and wounding dozens more, according to Israeli military 
spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The settler, described as a civilian but dressed in an army uniform, burst 
into the Ibrahim Mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site holy to both Jews 
and Muslims, about 5:45 a.m. today local time and fired long, indiscriminate 
bursts at the Palestinians as they prayed, Israeli military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settler then shot himself to death, according to Israeli sources, but 
Palestinians reported that he was killed by worshipers at the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Army Radio identified the gunman as a resident of the nearby Israeli 
settlement Kiryat Arbat and a member of the ultranationalist movement Kach, an 
offshoot of the Jewish Defense League founded in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio put the Palestinian dead at 20, and hospital officials in Hebron and 
Jerusalem said at least 125 had been wounded, many critically.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Nasser Ghazali, who was praying at the mosque, "We were praying 
and we heard a lot of shooting. Somebody shouted 'The settlers are attacking.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters saw more than 10 ambulances rushing victims toward Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Palestinians poured into the streets of Hebron, pelting army units 
with rocks, firebombs and grenades as the soldiers struggled to restore order. 
The army then sealed Hebron, a city of 50,000, and imposed a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident had apparently begun Thursday evening when Israeli settlers, 
observing the start of the Jewish festival of Purim, quarreled over the use of 
the Cave of the Patriarchs with Muslims, who are in the midst of the Muslim 
holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its importance to both religions, the Cave of the Patriarchs has 
been the scene of frequent clashes, many of them bloody, between Israelis and 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Jewish settlers both in Hebron's center and its outskirts, the town 
has become the focus of much recent violence on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Israeli troops in Jerusalem killed a suspected Palestinian 
guerrilla and captured another wanted in the killing of eight Israelis, 
including a security police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said the two men -- a third escaped -- belonged to the military wing 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, which vehemently opposes a 
peace deal between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops laid siege for seven hours to a house in Abu Dis, two miles 
southeast of Jerusalem's Old City, battling with the guerrillas barricaded 
inside, according to military sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops fired antitank missiles repeatedly at the one-story stone house, 
but were unable to storm it as the guerrillas inside shot back with rifles and 
pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 The army identified the dead guerrilla as Abed Rahman Hamdan, 23, and the 
other who was captured as Ali Ahmed Ali Amudi, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources said they belonged to a Hamas cell that had killed eight 
Israelis since the Sept. 13 peace accord signed between Israel and the PLO.

FEAR SHROUDS AUTOPSY IN FUMES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What are you afraid of?" a reporter shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 In a basement room, not far from a gathering throng of pathologists, 
paramedics, fire crews and hazardous-materials specialists, Chief Deputy 
Coroner Dan Cupido answered without hesitation: "The unknown . . . the fear of 
the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Late on Thursday night, doctors cloaked in heavy-duty safety suits -- in a 
building sealed off by police tape -- began to perform the most extraordinary 
autopsy ever conducted in Riverside County or perhaps anywhere else. They were 
to open the body of Gloria Ramirez cautiously, hoping to determine why the 
31-year-old cancer patient apparently emitted toxic fumes while she lay dying 
in a hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Ramirez, who died of a heart attack Saturday night, has perplexed 
health officials despite nearly a week of investigation. The ammonia-like fumes 
were so severe that six emergency room attendants at Riverside General Hospital 
had to be rushed to other emergency rooms after suffering breathing 
difficulties and muscle spasms, and two of them remained hospitalized Thursday. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials were evasive about what they found in laboratory tests of 
Ramirez's blood, they told a crowded pre-autopsy news conference at the 
Riverside morgue that they remain baffled.  
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we absolutely know about this case is that very little is 
known," Tom DeSantis, a Riverside County spokesman, told at least 50 reporters 
and photographers who filled a basement conference room. Through the day, the 
number of media on hand from around the nation grew as interest in the mystery 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Supervisor Bob Buster, who called the episode 
"unprecedented," added: "The hunger for a thorough (explanation) of this 
strange event . . . has certainly overrun our medical and scientific 
abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the autopsy, scheduled when the building would be mostly 
empty, would begin to unravel the mystery. But county health officials 
acknowledged that the incident might never be fully understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Humberto Ochoa, who stood next to the most seriously afflicted nurse 
throughout the incident, said he suffered no problems and did not notice the 
noxious fumes. He did, however, notice what appeared to be white crystals in 
blood drawn from Ramirez just before his colleagues began collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen anything like that," said Ochoa, chairman of the hospital's 
Emergency Medicine Department. "I have no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, authorities said it seemed likely that the fumes were caused by 
organophosphates, a highly reactive group of chemicals used in pesticides and 
nerve gas. But preliminary tests conducted on the blood sample uncovered no 
evidence of organophosphates.  
</P>
<P>
 Cupido, who said investigators were "still dealing with an unknown," seemed 
reluctant to say whether anything unusual had turned up in the initial tests on 
Ramirez's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you saying they're normal?" one journalist called out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hesitating, Cupido answered, "I did not say that," but he termed it premature 
to disclose exactly what the blood analysis showed. "We have reason to believe 
it was not a natural death," the deputy coroner added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who was in the advanced stages of cervical cancer, had consulted with 
doctors at Loma Linda University Medical Center, but was not being treated 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was possible, investigators acknowledged, that the fumes might have come 
from elsewhere, including a rinse basin located inside the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kinds of questions we are asking," DeSantis said. "At this 
point, we can't rule out anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the autopsy, authorities closed off two narrow avenues 
beside the quaint Spanish-style, ivy-covered coroner's office. Safety cones and 
yellow police tape divided Orange Street along its center stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the barrier, reporters and TV camera crews huddled outside 
their satellite transmission vans and clustered near the rear entrance of the 
building, hoping for glimpses into the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the police line, emergency teams prepared for the moment 
when Ramirez's body would be removed from its airtight, aluminum casket and 
double layer of plastic body bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody's ever done anything like this," said Bill Redden, a 
supervising industrial hygienist for the Riverside County Environmental Health 
Department, as he showed reporters the arrangements -- including the 
8-by-15-foot, plastic-lined enclosure specially created to house the 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Two industrial hygienists -- from Riverside County and Cal/OSHA -- were to 
begin the procedure by removing the outer body bag and poking small holes into 
each end of the inner bag, Redden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Air samplers and a remote camera were to monitor the body for about an hour 
with no members of the autopsy team present, he said. The forensic examination 
was then to begin and would involve checking the skin and organs for chemical 
contamination and clues to the cause of death. The autopsy was expected to 
conclude about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 All four members of the team were to be wearing "Level B" safety suits, 
sealing themselves completely from gases in the room. Four members of a 
hazardous-materials team would be outside in oxygen masks and protective suits, 
ready to rescue the others if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a detailed report released Thursday, Ramirez arrived by ambulance 
at the emergency room semiconscious with a rapid heart beat. Nurse Susan Kane, 
who was drawing blood, was the first to faint. Dr. Julie Gorchynski, who took 
over, also passed out, and soon afterward Ochoa ordered an evacuation. County 
officials said Ramirez received uninterrupted care. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rice of Cal/OSHA said the heating and ventilation system in the emergency 
room had been checked and nothing was found that could explain the bizarre 
episode. A spokesman for the hazardous-materials team noted at the news 
conference, however, that no one had checked the drains in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski was removed from a respirator at Loma Linda University Medical 
Center and was breathing normally, hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said 
Thursday. Gorchynski's condition is listed only as fair, however, because she 
continues to have mild muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Riverside who looked on with curiosity Thursday expressed 
sympathy for Ramirez's family while puzzling over the strangeness of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "God only knows, if they find something, how it might change the medical 
profession," said attorney William Shapiro, who speculated that the worst-case 
scenario might be another "AIDS-type epidemic."

L.A. CAN SQUEEZE $1 BILLION IN CUTS, INCOME, PANEL SAYS; FINANCE: BUSINESS 
LEADERS ASSEMBLED BY MAYOR RIORDAN SUGGEST REDUCING SOME PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, 
OTHER CHANGES OVER FIVE YEARS. UNIONS VOICE OBJECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Painting a broad portrait of waste and inefficiency in city government, a 
committee of business leaders assembled by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
concluded Thursday that $1 billion in new revenues and cost savings can be 
squeezed from city operations over the next five years to fund more police and 
other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting predictions by some that Riordan's ambitious police buildup will 
require tax increases, the panel offered a sweeping menu of more than 40 
recommendations -- some of them highly controversial -- to finance a 40% 
expansion of the Los Angeles Police Department, as well as repair badly damaged 
roads and buildings, replace dilapidated city vehicles and purchase new 
computer technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are real opportunities to save hundreds of millions of dollars each 
year," committee member Dick Poladian, managing partner of Arthur Andersen & 
Co., told a City Hall news conference. "Los Angeles has the money to turn this 
city around." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which drew a mixture of praise, skepticism and swift criticism 
from lawmakers, neighborhood groups and powerful employees unions, marks a 
jumping-off point for Republican businessman Riordan's effort to bring 
corporate management strategies to bear on the city's troubled fiscal affairs. 
The recommendations will be reviewed and refined by the mayor's office and 
forwarded to the City Council for possible enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment banker Michael Tennenbaum, who chaired the four-month study, said 
in a statement given to reporters that "hundreds of businesses are abandoning 
Los Angeles because key city services have deteriorated after years of neglect 
caused by grossly inefficient financial practices and excessive costs." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other committee members urged residents to rally behind the panel's 
recommendations, some of which have run into strong political opposition and 
legal obstacles before. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the influential chairman of the city budget 
committee, said the study was a useful "talking paper" that will help frame a 
re-examination of City Hall financial practices. But he noted that many of the 
recommendations are not fully detailed, and it remains to be seen how viable 
some of the proposals will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've identified a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but they haven't 
exactly told us how to get there," Yaroslavsky said. "They're going to leave 
that to us mortal politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key revenue-generating elements of the strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce by tens of millions of dollars in city contributions to some employee 
pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immediately seek bids for a long-term private lease of Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * Push for federal and state law changes to shift tens of millions of dollars 
in airport and harbor revenues to the general operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extend a hiring freeze for five years, reducing the 44,000-employee work 
force by 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trim Department of Water and Power operating expenses to levels more 
comparable to investor-owned utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamline management and contract out services for up to 4% savings in all 
departments. Launch a trash collection pilot program, similar to a model used 
in Phoenix. City rubbish bureau would be prodded to increase efficiency and 
worker productivity by having to compete with private firms for parts of the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Step up and modernize efforts to collect unpaid parking tickets, paramedic 
ambulance bills and business license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's findings are an "important blueprint to make city government 
function more efficiently and effectively," Riordan said in a statement issued 
by his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to use the skills, tools and management of the 1990s, not the 1950s," 
he said. "This report points us in that direction." After a review of the 
report, aides said, the mayor will offer specific proposals to begin 
implementing the recommendations, possibly when he makes a State of the City 
address to the City Council on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The types of proposals included in the Tennenbaum report reflect a far larger, 
often controversial struggle to balance budgets and find new efficiencies in 
cities across the nation, particularly as more fiscally conservative mayors 
take office. Newly elected New York Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, faced with his own 
budget woes, has proposed similar measures of private contracting of services 
and maximizing income from city assets, such as a city-owned radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are following the same overall practice you're finding in all big cities 
in the country and private corporations -- finding better ways to do things 
with less resources and big return," said City Administrative Officer Keith 
Comrie, the city's top budget expert. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may seem like simple cost-cutting solutions from a corporate 
perspective often become tangled in arcane laws, Civil Service rules and 
political considerations in the complex decision-making atmosphere of local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennenbaum, for example, said that tens of millions of dollars in reductions 
in annual city pension fund contributions can be made "at the stroke of a pen," 
without jeopardizing benefits to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But powerful unions have strongly disputed the underlying assertion that the 
accounts are substantially over-funded. A spokesman for the DWP employees 
union, which went on strike last year to win higher wages, said they would file 
a lawsuit in an effort to halt reduction in pension contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian D'Arcy, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers Local 18, said the DWP pension fund has been managed conservatively 
because it was underfunded in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't go from conservative to radical and risk people's retirements," 
D'Arcy said. "It's mortgaging the future in order to accomplish a political 
goal now." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, federal and state restrictions, if not relaxed, could preclude much 
of the anticipated $80 million to $170 million in revenue proposed to be drawn 
form the city's airport and harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky noted the projected $237 million a year that could be saved in the 
fifth year of the proposed hiring freeze would, as a practical matter, amount 
to a radical reduction in workers in departments such as parks and libraries 
because major front-line departments, such as police and fire, would not be cut 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky also questioned whether the projected $10-million to $30-million 
savings from contracting out trash collection services was worth the potential 
risks of disrupting service. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticisms, some homeowner group representatives said the report 
may strike a responsive chord with taxpayers hungry for more police protection 
and generally convinced that City Hall wastes large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the question is whether the public prevails or public employee unions 
prevail," said Richard Close, head of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. Close 
said there is "no question (Riordan) he has ability to rally the public based 
on (getting) more cops on street." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Christopher, founder of PLAN/LA, a citywide consortium of neighborhood 
and community groups, added: "We all are aware of the problems out there in 
terms of deferred maintenance . . . the parks, the libraries, streets don't get 
swept, sidewalks don't get maintained. They may hit some nerves out there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was clearly the committee's intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can stem the tide of neglect," said panel member Eli Broad, a prominent 
builder and investment specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the proposals were open to vigorous debate, particularly 
those directly affecting public employee jobs and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said avoiding more taxes and beginning to invest heavily again in road 
repairs, building upkeep and higher efficiency in paperwork-handling technology 
is essential to attract new business investment. The city for too long has 
balanced its budget by deferring tough decisions and necessary improvements, 
Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now high noon," he said. "Tomorrow has arrived. Los Angeles is truly in 
financial jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee report takes only a long-term view and does not offer specific 
recommendations for closing a projected $197-million deficit in the 1994-95 
spending plan now being worked up by the mayor's office. Nonetheless, 
Tennenbaum said the committee believes hundreds of millions of dollars could be 
realized quickly if the mayor and city council move ahead on pension fund 
changes and leasing Los Angeles airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee members, including corporate executives, lawyers and 
entrepreneurs, said they would monitor the response to the proposals and lobby 
for the recommendations. Revamping L.A.'s Finances 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of business leaders appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan has 
concluded that huge potential savings and new revenues can be garnered from 
city operations for police and other needs without a tax increase. Here are the 
proposed savings in fiscal year 1998-99, and how those funds should be spent.

COLUMN ONE; LABOR PLAYS HARDBALL IN FRANCE; FISHERMEN RAMPAGE. FACTORY WORKERS 
TAKE HOSTAGES. COMMANDO-STYLE PROTESTS BRING GOVERNMENT CONCESSIONS AND PUBLIC 
SYMPATHY AS HARD TIMES FUEL RISE IN VIOLENCE.

<P>
 For generations, the muscled fishermen of Brittany have harvested the cold, 
choppy waters of the Atlantic, relishing the good years and enduring the bad 
ones to keep seafood on the great tables of France. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that changed when they went on strike recently over low prices for 
imported fish. In one city, 5,000 fishermen battled riot police with baseball 
bats and iron bars, injuring 134 officers beneath a tear-gas haze. Elsewhere, 
they cleaned out supermarket display cases and warehouses, setting fire to 
giant mounds of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisherman Marcel Denic, 36, warned: "There is no fish storehouse in France 
that is safe." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Michel, 45, a fisherman for three decades, explained: "If we stay 
silent, nobody will hear us. This causes more attention. And it brings the 
television cameras." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it does. The Denics had taken part in a riot that damaged dozens of 
cars, stores and telephone booths. It also inadvertently touched off a fire 
that left a 17th-Century Parliament building, Brittany's pride, a smoldering 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 France certainly is no stranger to labor strife or tough talk. But the 
militant seafarers and their commando actions are part of a new, more 
belligerent and more desperate phenomenon emerging today: French workers, 
facing 12% unemployment, have lost patience with old-fashioned strikes and 
picket lines. And they are turning to increasingly violent ways of holding on 
to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, angry dockworkers in Marseilles have welded shut the gates of 
a bankrupt port and stopped all ferry traffic between the city and North 
Africa. Workers at a Tampax factory in the Loire Valley, protesting layoff 
plans, kidnaped two top managers and held them in their offices for three days. 
No one has been arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "France has always loved reform but hated change," says Franz-Olivier 
Giesbert, editor of Le Figaro, the pro-government daily newspaper. "That is 
why, unlike a lot of other nations, we feel the need occasionally to make a 
revolution, good or bad, so as to decompress." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confronted today by social groups that feel their existence itself is 
threatened," says Brice Teinturier, director of the political department at the 
French Institute of Public Opinion. "And, for the most part, the French 
sympathize. They feel these are just causes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new wave of violent labor unrest began two years ago with farmers, who 
blocked traffic, burned produce and clashed repeatedly with police in a dispute 
over European and American pressure to cut agricultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has gained momentum since a strike by Air France workers last 
September, when demonstrators protesting a government plan to lay off 4,000 
employees from the money-losing airline blocked runways at Charles de Gaulle 
Airport and waged running battles with riot police. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has fanned the flames of unrest by 
throwing money and other concessions at the most violent strikers, sending an 
unmistakable message that the more belligerent the strike, the more likely the 
government will be to open its pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur quickly backed down in the face of the Air France strikers, agreeing 
to withdraw the airline survival plan. He has taken a series of steps to 
appease the fishermen too, offering financial aid for boat loan payments and a 
five-month ban on the import of cheap fish. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week he launched a $1.8-million radio and billboard ad campaign, 
urging the French to eat more of "our fresh fish" and reminding consumers that 
fishermen have to battle rain and worse, "while you were asleep," to bring in 
their precious catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have labeled Balladur's strategy le tactique salami , in which he slices 
off piece after piece of the public treasury to feed each protesting group. A 
recent editorial cartoon in Le Monde, the influential Parisian daily, showed 
Balladur holding a fishing pole, with money affixed to the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell the fishermen I'm ready," Balladur calls out in the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur, like most top-level politicians in France, has a deep respect for 
the power of public demonstrations in his country. Still fresh here are the 
memories of the violent May, 1968, student protests that led to the retirement 
of no less formidable a statesman than President Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very centralized state, and that creates a certain fear," said Denis 
Lacorne, a political analyst at the National Political Science Foundation in 
Paris. "In the United States, when something goes wrong, it might cost a 
company or university president his job. But, in France, it goes right up to 
the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Although labor strife has intensified in France -- and even though people have 
died in recent years in strike-related violence in such nations as South Africa 
and Nicaragua -- these incidents are rare in most of the world. That is true 
even in such places as Germany, where social tensions are rising among workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, scattered communities have been torn in recent years by 
bitter disputes where strikers were replaced by so-called scabs, but violence 
has been relatively limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of America's bloodiest labor disputes came in the late 1800s, including 
the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago and the Homestead strike against Carnegie 
Steel in Pennsylvania, which was suppressed after several people died. In the 
1930s, probably the worst era of labor strife, sit-down strikes swept through 
steel and auto plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, protesters who resort to violence are viewed as "the radical 
fringe," said Charles B. Craver, a law professor at George Washington 
University in Washington who has studied unions. "Americans are a relatively 
docile people that way. We tend to go by the rule of law." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main differences between the labor movements in France and the 
United States is that French workers enjoy generous social and economic 
benefits and view them as a right, Craver said. By contrast, he said, "in our 
country, workers don't think they have a right to health care or job security. 
Here, workers are happy if they have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 What is remarkable about France's current wave of violence is the absence of 
any criticism of the strikers from the government -- or the citizenry. Indeed, 
there is widespread sympathy for the workers' cause. That, along with a 
long-held distrust of the riot police, explains why the government has been 
reluctant to arrest the strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Balladur bristles at the suggestion that he is trying to buy civil 
peace. "What do you recommend?" he snapped at one reporter. "That I satisfy 
nobody?" 
</P>
<P>
 While sporadic violence has been a feature of labor unrest in France, the 
number of strikes and the number of violent incidents are on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests have injured hundreds of people, mostly police officers, and 
caused tens of millions of dollars in damage. But, so far at least, no one has 
died and the strikers have kept their protests from spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 (A notable exception was the fire at the Parliament building in Brittany, 
about which the fishermen seemed genuinely embarrassed. It was set, apparently 
accidentally, by one of the flares that strikers were setting off to light up 
the night sky.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the current unrest doesn't approach the magnitude of the 1968 
student uprising, which eventually led 10 million workers to stage strikes and 
occupy factories. Even amid those clashes, only one person died. 
</P>
<P>
 "One must remember that the right to strike is something very strongly 
embedded in the French," said Teinturier, the poll specialist. "It has been the 
main way of social gain for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one denies that the tone has changed, becoming more desperate and less 
easily doused by police water cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we are taught in school to respect the law. But this is not a 
question of respect for the law," said Rene Mouriaux, director of research at 
the Center for the Study of French Political Life in Paris. "These are 
reactions to things imposed from outside France -- fish imports, farm imports." 
</P>
<P>
 And many French workers believe that they already have made financial 
sacrifices but have little to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pushes them toward harder strikes," Mouriaux added. "Now each group 
feels the need to pressure the government to get their own piece of the pie." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the fishermen-commandos were thinking when they laid siege to the 
countryside earlier this month. They ended a two-week strike after the series 
of government concessions, but the message was clear: The threat of civil 
unrest pays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very sad that we've nearly arrived at the year 2000 and we're still 
reduced to this type of action," said Serge Nedelec, a 40-year-old fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, a heavy mist hung over the hundreds of boats in the Guilvinec 
port, which had been blocked the night before with a long chain marked by blue 
buoys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are up against the wall," he added, pausing to light a cheap, crumpled 
corn-leaf cigarette. "The government told us not to break things. But it was 
only when we started to break things that the government started taking 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Michel Coic, 38, who owns one of the boats in Guilvinec, said the clashes 
with police were "just an alarm bell. Maybe it wasn't justified, but that's the 
only way. The government has known for a long time that we have serious 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other fishermen, Coic blames European trade agreements that have removed 
French barriers to cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
 France has about 16,000 skippers and sailors on 7,000 fishing boats, and they 
lead a difficult existence. They often spend several weeks at sea, returning to 
the market and an on-the-spot division of the proceeds. If the price is too low 
to meet costs, as it has been since last month, they earn nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the annual catch is exported, mostly to Spain and Italy, but 
those markets have been hurt by a strong French franc. The remainder is 
consumed in France, as part of a national network of shops offering 25 species 
of fresh fish daily. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the fish consumed in France these days, though, is imported, 
mostly from Britain, Norway and Denmark. Sole from the Netherlands, for 
example, typically sells for as little as $4 a pound at French fish stores, 
compared to about $6 a pound for French sole. 
</P>
<P>
 During their demonstrations, the fishermen tore down traffic lights, pulled 
bricks from city streets, seized fish from delivery trucks and foreign trawlers 
and destroyed hundreds of tons of fish. At Rungis, the giant food market known 
as the "belly of Paris," more than 1,000 fishermen broke in shortly after 3 
a.m. one day this month and managed to destroy nearly 500 tons of fish, both 
French and imported, before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen also broke into dozens of supermarkets across central France, 
trashing the frozen fish counters. Edouard Leclerc, the owner of several 
hundred supermarkets in France, filed suit against the government and announced 
stepped-up security at his stores. He even tore up an agreement he had made 
with the fishermen last year to buy at least half his fish from French sources. 
</P>
<P>
 And he warned endive and cauliflower producers that, if they made good on 
threats to follow the fishermen's example, "you won't find one endive or head 
of cauliflower in my shops for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 But France's sympathy remains with the fishermen. Even Balladur told them, "I 
hope that your children will feel like doing the same job as you in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much chance of that, the fishermen say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Peillon, a stocky, silver-haired man of 51, is the 14th generation of 
Breton fishermen in his family. "But this is the last one," he said. "I've 
never even allowed my son to get on board a boat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe our grandson will become a sailor," his wife, Annie, added with a 
rueful laugh. "Or a windsurfer."

PLAN TO EASE U.S. HIGH-TECH EXPORT CONTROLS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration unveiled a plan Thursday to relax U.S. controls on 
high-technology exports, making it easier for U.S. companies to sell computers, 
communications gear and other sophisticated equipment overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most likely to benefit from the plan are U.S. high-technology exporters 
and East European nations that until recently had Communist governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, put together by the departments of Defense, State, Commerce and 
Energy, is the first major revision of the government's export controls in 15 
years. Congressional approval is required before it can take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, multinational groups would be given a larger role in 
determining which sensitive technologies would remain under the control of the 
United States and its major Western trading partners. The licensing procedure 
would be streamlined and the authority of U.S. government officials to withhold 
licenses would be sharply reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Business groups complained that the plan does not go far enough in easing 
export limits that make U.S. products non-competitive with those manufactured 
by foreign companies. But critics concerned about the spread of militarily 
sensitive technology said it would make it easier for such renegade nations as 
North Korea to obtain machinery and materials needed for the manufacture of 
missiles and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, defending their proposal, said they were trying to 
remove "needless burdens" imposed on exporters while strengthening the 
government's ability to stop the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the legislation strikes the critical balance that is much needed 
between non-proliferation concerns and economic concerns," Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will "get rid of obsolete Cold War controls that had no impact on 
non-proliferation" of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, said Barry 
Carter, acting undersecretary of commerce for export administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, limits would be removed or reduced on the export of most 
computers, other than those considered to be supercomputers, and as much as 
$30-billion worth of computers would be made available for sale abroad without 
export licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Controls on the export of composite materials used in rocketry, 
microelectronics and highly specialized machine tools would remain, but 
procedures for obtaining permission to export them would be streamlined, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 20% to 25% of the companies holding export licenses are based in 
California, the National Assn. of Manufacturers says. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the potentially controversial nature of the plan, President Clinton 
was said to have delayed until the last moment his approval of the decision 
limiting the government's hand in issuing export licenses while balancing 
Pentagon pressure to retain certain controls with Commerce Department efforts 
to open up markets for U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Pentagon and Commerce Department views, Brown said: "There are 
always discussions on these issues." He said he had spent "a good deal of time" 
with Clinton on Wednesday evening working out a balance between the two 
departments' positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The international organization to which such export licensing decisions have 
been handed in the past is known as the Coordinating Committee on Export 
Controls, which is composed of members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, along with Japan and Australia. The U.S. government, however, 
retained control over licensing all but generally unsophisticated technology 
with little if any military applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was established in 1949 to coordinate export policies and 
prevent the Soviet bloc from obtaining potentially useful military technology 
from the West. It is scheduled to cease existence March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no agreement on any successor regime," said Stephen Bryen, who 
oversaw export control issues at the Pentagon during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting that the relaxed rules would hasten the flow of weapons technology 
to outlaw nations, he said: "If you're (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein or 
North Korea, this is all great news." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said three organizations, two of which would include 
Russia and one of which would include China, would be given the 
responsibilities for keeping sensitive equipment out of the hands of "outlaw 
nations." They said strict limits would be placed on the ability of U.S. 
government agencies to impose their own restrictions on such exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other steps, the Administration's proposal would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the rights of industry to seek the elimination of controls on the 
export of sensitive technology if such limits would place U.S. companies at a 
disadvantage with foreign manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guarantee that decisions on granting licenses would be made within 90 days. 
If that schedule could not be met, they would be referred to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mandate a "clearer and more complete statement" spelling out why controls 
are imposed on specific products. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining that these steps are insufficient, Howard Lewis, vice president of 
the National Assn. of Manufacturers, said: "It sure isn't going to help. It 
doesn't represent the type of fundamental reform we thought needs to take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Central Intelligence Agency under instructions from its director to 
pay greater attention to international industrial espionage and the renewal of 
attention being paid to Russian spying after the arrest of a longtime CIA 
employee on charges of spying for Moscow, a senior Administration official 
acknowledged that the program is being unveiled at an inopportune moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are flying off into a future we can only appreciate very dimly," he said. 
He said, however, that the timing was dictated by the expiration in June of the 
1979 Export Administration Act and by the Administration's desire to rewrite 
the old laws rather than extend them for a year as was done last June.

YELTSIN TARGETS CRIME AS NO. 1 RUSSIA PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Admitting that Russia is mired in chaos and crime, President Boris N. Yeltsin 
proposed a new regime of law, order and political cooperation on Thursday in 
his first State of the Nation speech to the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck such a conciliatory note that he did not even mention the lawmakers' 
defiant vote on Wednesday to pardon all his political foes who face charges for 
their roles in the 1991 coup attempt and last October's Moscow clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he declared that Russia's period of conflict was at an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Political battles "can have only one outcome -- the destruction of Russia," 
said Yeltsin, looking fit if sounding a bit hoarse as he spoke in the Kremlin's 
Marble Hall. "The time for the internecine struggle for Russia has fully run 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the government must rather concentrate its energy on fighting 
crime -- "the question of the year" -- and making sure that the country's laws 
are solid and enforced. He also asserted that Russia's market-oriented economic 
reforms will continue full-force, though under better regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin sounded one combative note -- on foreign policy, a subject he 
addresses at home infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Henceforth Russia will assert its national interests more vigorously, he 
vowed, citing his government's recent role in the Bosnian crisis as evidence 
that it will not tolerate being ignored. Russia will take more responsibility 
for peacekeeping operations in the former Soviet Union and for defending ethnic 
Russians living in the former Soviet republics, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 49-minute televised speech offered little new overall, and its 
generalities prompted more than one Parliament member to comment that it 
resembled a typical gust of hot air from a Communist Party general secretary in 
the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was perhaps most interesting in what it did not say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin abandoned his old habit of accusing Communists and opposition members 
of causing most of the country's ills. He made no threats. He strove to raise 
his presidential role above the political fray, to become the lofty figure 
envisioned in the constitution who gives the country its direction and then 
stands back. 
</P>
<P>
 By admitting that his government is riddled with corruption and confusion, 
Yeltsin also showed a new awareness of his own responsibility for many of the 
problems that economic reforms have brought. 
</P>
<P>
 The main slogan of his speech, "Stronger Russian Statehood," amounted to a 
call to straighten out the country beginning with his own bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Pavel Bunich was encouraged by what the speech did not say about the 
reforms: Yeltsin did not say he agreed with conservative Prime Minister Viktor 
S. Chernomyrdin on the need to resort to such drastic means as freezing prices 
or salaries to stem inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was key that the president confirmed the continuation of the course of 
reforms," Bunich told the daily newspaper Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
 He also praised Yeltsin's tact in not mentioning the Parliament's amnesty for 
the alleged coup plotters and the October rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Yeltsin would probably have struck back at Parliament 
immediately. But his inability to work with his old Parliament led to the loss 
of more than 140 lives in the fighting that followed his decree dissolving it 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he simply commented pointedly that social harmony does not mean 
"forgiving everything" and that mercy should not contradict the laws of 
morality. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the imprisoned leaders of the October rebellion, including former 
Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi and former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan 
I. Khasbulatov, remained unclear Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, said the legal battle over 
whether lawmakers had the right to issue the amnesty would last long enough so 
that the accused plotters would not be let out in "the coming weeks or months." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Russia's chief prosecutor, Alexei Kazannik, indicated that as soon as 
he got the paperwork from the Parliament he would drop the cases against the 
alleged plotters as instructed and release them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news agency carried the text of the amnesty Thursday night, 
satisfying the requirement that the document be published to come into force. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of some of the accused held in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison waited 
outside in the heavy snow for hours hoping for their release, but eventually 
they gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers who voted overwhelmingly for the amnesty said they saw it as paving 
the way for greater political harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin called for exactly the same thing in his speech, but it remained to be 
seen whether he would go along with letting all his worst enemies out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Yeltsin complained that during Russia's transition from the old 
Communist system to a market-driven economy, "those who cheat and use violence 
are having a field day." 
</P>
<P>
 Using some of his strongest language yet about the crime problem, he said "the 
country is being swept by a crime wave," and organized crime is trying to "get 
the country by the neck." He called rampant bribery "a grave disease of the 
young Russian state." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us at long last recognize that so far we have a weak state and that there 
is no elementary order in the country," he said in a virtual admission of his 
own failure. 
</P>
<P>
 As a remedy for Russia's many ills, he proposed the stable base of the 
country's new constitution, passed on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 With that new foundation, Yeltsin argued, the country could start to build law 
and order, beginning with anti-crime laws passed by the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 He also promised greater assistance to Russia's factories, many of which are 
grinding to a halt under both a tremendous tax burden and the difficulties of 
making it in the market system. At the same time, he demanded a halt to the 
government practice of granting giant subsidies and cheap loans to whatever 
enterprises lobby the best. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher praised Yeltsin's speech, 
saying it "came down in favor of continuation of reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I saw, he was in a strong, vigorous mood and made a strong, 
vigorous speech, which is a good sign in itself," Christopher told the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee.

TV PIONEER, ENTERTAINER DINAH SHORE DIES AT 76; SHOW BUSINESS: FRIENDS REMEMBER 
WINNER OF 10 EMMYS, PEABODY AWARD FOR HER CHARM AND GRACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dinah Shore, the durable and phenomenally successful entertainer who moved 
gracefully from radio and recordings to television, cookbooks and her own 
celebrity golf tournament, capturing and keeping America's heart along the way, 
died Thursday in her Beverly Hills home. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore died of cancer, with her former husband, film star George 
Montgomery, and their two grown children, Melissa Ann Hime and John David 
Montgomery, at her side, publicist Connie Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long span of her career, the golden-haired Southern belle garnered 
nine gold records, 10 Emmys -- more than any other performer in television 
history -- and her most cherished award, a Peabody, which included the 
inscription, "What TV needs, obviously, is about 100 Dinah Shores." 
</P>
<P>
 In observance of her death, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce placed flowers 
on one of Miss Shore's three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, awarded to 
her for outstanding achievement in radio, recording and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost one of the voices that defined an era for us," said Hollywood 
billionaire and former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis, who, with his wife, 
Barbara, was a friend of Miss Shore. "In many ways Dinah Shore set an example 
for us all to follow, not least in the areas of charity and fund raising for 
the less fortunate. Dinah was a joy to be around, independent and humorous. We 
should not mourn her death but rather celebrate her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore reigned over television for four decades from its infancy in the 
1950s until the 1990s with a succession of shows built around her husky, 
sentimental voice, Southern comedic charm, cooking talent and ability to cajole 
celebrities to join her for whatever they wanted to say or do. 
</P>
<P>
 Her string of enviable successes on the small screen included the 15-minute 
musical program, "The Dinah Shore Show," from 1951 to 1957; the 
Chevrolet-sponsored Sunday night hour, "The Dinah Shore Show" from 1957 to 
1963; the 90-minute talk show "Dinah!" from 1974 to 1980; "Dinah's Place" from 
1970 to 1974; "Dinah and Friends" from 1979 to 1984, and from 1989 to 1991, a 
half-hour talk show on the Nashville Network, "A Conversation With Dinah." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Miss Shore was a little nervous when she expanded her original television 
program from 15 minutes to an hourlong show on Sunday nights in which she sang 
"See the USA in your Chevrolet" and blew a huge kiss to TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Times entertainment editor Cecil Smith called that 1957-58 season "the 
year of Dinah Shore" and said Miss Shore "waltzed into the big color shows with 
the casual grace and warmth of a talented neighbor dropping in from next door 
to sing a little and show off some brilliant friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," Smith added, "she won the nation's Sunday-night hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore also won her Peabody, an Emmy, and the Sylvania Award, and was 
named Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, she was amused by attempts to describe the character of her 
various shows and analyze their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are is a 'Do' show," she told The Times in 1972 when she was holding 
forth on "Dinah's Place." "Almost everyone who comes on has something they want 
to do. Ethel Kennedy played the piano, Joanne Woodward did some beautiful 
needlepoint. Burt Lancaster did a perfect Italian spaghetti sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 With a sports enthusiasm based in a childhood bout with polio, Miss Shore 
became the first woman to earn the Entertainer of the Year Award from the 
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22nd annual Nabisco Dinah Shore Golf Tournament, one of the richest on the 
Ladies Professional Golf Assn. tour, will be played in March at the Mission 
Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Webb, deputy commissioner of the association, said Thursday that he was 
"shocked . . . deeply saddened. . . . We've lost a great friend and tremendous 
supporter of not only the LPGA but golf in general. It is like losing one of 
your very best friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore, with her well-known penchant for humor, recalled for The Times in 
1992 how reluctant she had been to involve herself in the tournament two 
decades earlier: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colgate Co. was sponsoring my television show, and I was a tennis player. 
I didn't play golf. However, the powers that be decided they were going to 
sponsor a golf tournament. I said make it tennis; I didn't want to look like a 
dummy in two sports. . . . I took a crash course in golf." 
</P>
<P>
 But in no time, even Miss Shore was describing herself as "a real golf bum." 
</P>
<P>
 The brown-eyed natural brunette who had been known for her honey-blond hair 
since 1942 was often on best-dressed lists and was known for her robust health, 
energy and verve that made her appear far younger than her actual years. She 
once described her formula for living as being able to "forget everything that 
happened yesterday and live in the present." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan, friends with the singer for 40 years, 
called her "a dynamic individual . . . talented, energetic (with) a sincere 
spark for life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dinah was five-star in every way," said former President Gerald Ford, a 
neighbor of Miss Shore in Rancho Mirage. "Betty and I have lost a very dear 
friend, one of the finest, most generous and thoughtful persons we have been 
privileged to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Burt Reynolds, who had a celebrated love affair with Miss Shore in the 
early 1970s, said: "Hollywood has lost its greatest and only real angel. Dinah 
is what God meant when he strived to make perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the sunshine in my life and millions and millions of others," 
Reynolds said. "She is the only person I ever knew who had nothing bad to say 
about anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, called Miss 
Shore "the kindest and the gentlest and the most enduring of all the talented 
folks in our world." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard to face tomorrow," he said, "without Dinah." 
</P>
<P>
 The multitalented Miss Shore, whose paintings have been exhibited at the 
California Museum of Science and Industry, was born Frances Rose Shore on March 
1, 1917, in Winchester, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricken with polio when she was 18 months old, she credited the experience 
with giving her an inferiority complex and for pushing her into sports and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That early experience made me shy and ambitious at the same time," she said 
in 1972. "I wanted to run faster than anyone else, and jump higher. I knew I 
had to do something to prove myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to act," she said, "but there weren't any Tennessee Williamses 
around in those days and it wasn't easy for a girl with a Southern accent to 
get work. Luckily, I could sing." 
</P>
<P>
 She started singing at Hume Fogg High School in Nashville, Tenn., giving up 
voice lessons to become a cheerleader. Nevertheless, she was soon singing on 
Nashville radio stations WSM and WLAC. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Vanderbilt University with a degree in sociology, Miss 
Shore sold her camera and radio to finance a two-week job hunt in New York. It 
didn't take that long. 
</P>
<P>
 She auditioned for disc jockey Martin Block at radio station WNEW, singing 
"Dinah." In a historic lapse of memory, Block announced that "Dinah Shore" had 
won the audition. Disliking her own given name, she carried that one to fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore worked as a fill-in singer at NBC radio on such shows as "Chamber 
Music Society of Lower Basin Street," and found steady work on Eddie Cantor's 
show. By 1943 she had her own radio show, and was recording with such famous 
bandleaders as Xavier Cugat. 
</P>
<P>
 She sold 1 million copies of "Yes, My Darling Daughter," and that recording 
success was followed quickly by "Blues in the Night," "Shoo Fly Pie," and 
"Doin' What Comes Naturally." Other hits were "Buttons and Bows," "Dear Hearts 
and Gentle People," "It's So Nice to Have a Man Around the House," and "I'll 
Walk Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite on radio and jukeboxes and with GIs as America went to war, Miss 
Shore eventually got her chance to act. She didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
 She was in such films as "Thank Your Lucky Stars," in 1943, "Up in Arms," 
"Follow the Boys," and "Belle of the Yukon" in 1944, "Make Mine Music" and 
"Till the Clouds Roll By" in 1946, "Fun and Fancy Free" in 1947, "and "Aaron 
Slick from Punkin Crick" in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it," she said years later. "Making (movies) was so boring. You sat 
around interminably. And I never thought I was photogenic. I thought I looked 
horrible on the Technicolor screen." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the experience also terrified her, and that she was afraid people 
would learn that she didn't read music well. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore found the small screen far more to her liking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to be afraid of that old red eye. It's one person to me," 
she told Associated Press in 1989. "I don't visualize large numbers of people 
out there. I'm comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, Miss Shore fell in love with Montgomery's image when she went to see 
his film "The Cowboy and the Blonde" 15 times. Two years later, when she was 
playing the Hollywood Canteen, he attended the show and confessed that he was a 
fan of hers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 They were married in Las Vegas Dec. 5, 1943, and after one of Hollywood's 
storybook marriages, were divorced May 9, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end," she said, "we just drifted apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Shore married Palm Springs contractor and tennis player Maurice Fabian 
Smith on May 26, 1963, but that marriage lasted less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 She began her romantic liaison with Reynolds after he appeared on her 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
 An enthusiastic cook, Miss Shore wrote three best-selling cookbooks, 
"Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah" in 1971, "The Dinah Shore Cookbook" in 
1983 and "The Dinah Shore American Kitchen" in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 She continued to give concerts, often benefiting her favorite philanthropies 
-- the March of Dimes, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Junior Achievement, 
on whose national board she served. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of her business acumen and wide popularity and experience in 
entertainment, Miss Shore was appointed to the board of directors of MGM/UA 
Entertainment Co. in 1985 -- one of the few women entertainers, including Mary 
Pickford and Grace Kelly, ever to serve on motion picture boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she broke important ground for women in entertainment and sports and 
by opening up country club memberships to single women, Miss Shore spoke out 
against "women's liberation in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been a man's world," she said in 1972, "and it probably always 
will be. I don't want to change that. All of my career, on radio, in recording 
studios, in films and on television, men have made the decisions for me, and 
they've usually been the right ones."  
</P>
<P>
 Among the accolades of a lifetime before microphones were nine Gold Medal 
Photoplay Awards, the Downbeat Pop-Jazz Award, the Golden Globe, and frequent 
listing on Gallup Poll's 10 Most Admired Women in the World. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her children, Miss Shore is survived by three grandchildren, 
Jennefer, Adam and Alexander.

QUAKE BOOSTS STRESS ON FAULTS IN L.A. BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of scientists said Thursday that there is evidence the Northridge 
earthquake increased geological stress under a wide area of the Los Angeles 
Basin, but particularly in Glendale, Burbank, North Hollywood, Hollywood and 
parts of the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 The scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and institutions in Woods Hole, 
Mass., and Strasbourg, France, said the stress increases were small but 
possibly significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of stress is not enough to cause an earthquake, but could trigger 
one if a fault were already close to failure," said Ross Stein of the 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge about earthquakes, however, is usually not sufficient to tell with 
reliability when a fault is close to failure, he and other scientists 
acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Stein told a four-hour seminar of about 200 earthquake 
experts organized by the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC that 
stress appears to have decreased in areas of Malibu, Topanga Canyon, Agoura, 
the San Gabriel Mountains and large parts of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica was said to be in a neutral zone where stress had neither 
increased or decreased as a result of the magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, speaking for the group of five scientists, characterized their findings 
as preliminary, but said the results are in accord with a 61-year pattern of 
stress transfers in the Los Angeles area dating to the 1933 Long Beach 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He said calculations have shown that the Long Beach temblor increased stress 
in the San Fernando and Northridge areas where earthquakes occurred in 1971 and 
1994, respectively. Similarly, he said, the San Fernando earthquake increased 
stress in Northridge and in the Whittier Narrows area, where a quake occurred 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tentacle of San Fernando aftershocks went straight into Northridge," Stein 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The geophysicist added that he and Ruth Harris and Bob Simpson of the 
Geological Survey, Jian Lin of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and 
Geoffrey King of the Institut de Physique du Globe in Strasbourg, believe the 
Jan. 17 Northridge quake has increased stress on the Elysian Park fault system 
extending from Whittier past Downtown Los Angeles and along the Hollywood Hills 
and Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake probably also transferred stress to the northern segment 
of the Newport-Inglewood Fault -- beneath parts of Inglewood and the Westside 
of Los Angeles -- as well as the Oak Ridge Fault system in the Santa Susana 
Mountains and parts of Ventura County and the Simi Valley Fault. Stein said 
stress rose on a portion of the San Andreas Fault between Palmdale and the 
Cajon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists present at the meeting at the University Hilton -- constituting 
the elite of earthquake scientists in California -- listened with rapt 
attention and peppered a series of speakers with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other presentations at the meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dan Ponti of the USGS, assigned to study ground deformations caused by the 
Northridge quake, questioned whether houses should be rebuilt in an area of 
Granada Hills near Balboa Boulevard and Rinaldi Street where substantial 
deformation was found. "What could be done to mitigate future deformations of 
the kind we have seen here?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Randy Jibson of the USGS, assigned to study landslides generated by the 
earthquake, said that while publicity has centered on landslides in Malibu, 
there were far more pervasive and spectacular slides in the Santa Susanas. One 
involved the movement of 1 million square meters of dirt, he said, and he noted 
that urban development "is creeping into canyons where such landslides 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Dewey of the USGS released the first maps using the modified Mercalli 
scale to show shaking intensities across Southern California. The scale 
estimates shaking intensities on a Roman numeral scale of I to XII, based on 
observations of damage and the way people in various areas felt the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dewey, the highest Mercalli readings in the Jan. 17 earthquake 
reached IX in areas of Reseda, Northridge, the Newhall Pass, Sherman Oaks, 
Santa Monica and the West Adams district of Los Angeles south of Downtown. All 
of those areas suffered partial collapses of modern store buildings or medical 
buildings, destruction of wood-frame apartment buildings or freeway collapses.

CROATS, MUSLIMS SUMMONED TO U.S. FOR TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday summoned Bosnian and Croatian leaders 
to discuss creation of a joint Muslim-Croatian state covering half of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- an idea that U.S. officials consider a key building block 
for peace in the divided republic. 
</P>
<P>
 If the talks succeed, the United States would work to promote a formal 
partition of Bosnia into two federated states, one shared by Muslims and 
Bosnian Croats and the other dominated by Bosnian Serbs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that there . . . is a good chance that we could make this happen," 
a senior State Department official told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to bring the sputtering Bosnian peace talks to Washington marks 
the first time that the United States has injected itself directly into the 
Bosnian war as the sole mediator in negotiations -- and stakes the 
Administration's prestige more directly than ever before on a successful 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased U.S. role also reflects American officials' view that a peace 
agreement may slowly be coming into reach, as well as a new willingness by the 
Administration to promote solutions that it once rejected -- including the 
country's partition. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who has been visiting Washington on 
behalf of the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo, strongly endorsed the U.S. 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say the Administration is being helpful, especially now that they are 
all focusing on the possibility of this rapprochement with the Croats," he 
said. "We believe that to be the first step toward peace in Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslims and Roman Catholic Croats initially were allies in the 
country's civil war, fighting the Eastern Orthodox Bosnian Serbs and military 
forces of the Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia. But in the last year, Muslims and 
Croats fell to fighting each other over the Bosnian territory that they still 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Muslims and Croats join together, the resulting state will be much more 
viable than separate ministates would be, State Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new republic would be designed to have a strong central government but 
also to permit considerable autonomy for local areas, or "cantons," in part to 
protect the rights of the Croatian minority, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint Muslim-Croatian republic could also form an economic confederation 
with the neighboring republic of Croatia, further improving the new state's 
chances of success, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the plan is intended to acknowledge the desire of many Bosnian 
Croats for union with Croatia, without depriving the Bosnian Muslims of the 
independent state they want. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. officials appear increasingly resigned to the prospect 
of a separate Bosnian Serb state that would seek to join Serbia soon after 
partition. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided to summon the Muslims and Croats 
to Washington after the Bosnian Croats abruptly pulled out of a similar deal 
that was negotiated in Europe last week. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the Bosnian Croats back to the table, U.S. diplomats told them -- and 
their backers in Croatia -- that the Administration would support a new 
Bosnian-Croatian confederation with significant economic aid, but only if they 
cooperated in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. officials warned Croatia that it risked U.S. 
displeasure -- and even the possibility of economic sanctions -- if it blocked 
a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the talks probably will begin on Sunday at the State 
Department, and will be conducted by Charles E. Redman, the U.S. special envoy 
for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to attend are Silajdzic, for the Muslim-led Bosnian government; 
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, for Croatia, and Kresmir Zubak, a leader 
of the Bosnian Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher will meet individually with the leaders of the three delegations 
but is unlikely to attend the talks himself, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who sent thousands of troops into Bosnia to 
fight the Muslims, endorsed the idea of a confederation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing would be to have a sort of federation of Croats and Muslims (in 
Bosnia) which would be in a confederation with Croatia. It would be in our 
interest," Tudjman said in a speech to the central committee of his nationalist 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, speaking to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, repeated the 
Administration's promise to send U.S. peacekeeping troops to enforce an 
agreement if the conditions are right. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a viable agreement, if it puts an end to the fighting, the 
Administration would make a very strong case to the Congress and to the 
American people that that was a worthy subject of peacekeeping," he said.

 In a case that sparked a tug of war with Mexico, the California Supreme Court 
on Thursday ruled that a San Diego court properly revoked the parental rights 
of a Mexican couple suspected of battering their child. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision clears the way for an American couple to adopt 
5-year-old Stephanie M., a Mexican citizen, who had been in their foster care 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government had contended that the San Diego Juvenile Court should 
have granted it jurisdiction in the case and allowed the child to live with her 
grandmother in Mexico. Justice Stanley Mosk, writing for the court, noted that 
Mexico did not assert jurisdiction until after the parents' rights had already 
been severed. The Mexican Consulate was aware of the proceedings and had 
participated in them, Mosk noted. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County authorities removed Stephanie from her parents' San Diego 
home after a doctor reported signs of abuse. At 1 year, Stephanie had three 
bone fractures and substantial bruising. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, who had entered the country illegally, denied they abused her and 
insisted she received the injuries in a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The county placed the child in the Encinitas home of Brian and Lynn Parker, 
who have an 8-year-old daughter. Experts testified in the case that she bonded 
strongly with her foster mother and should be allowed to stay in the home. The 
Parkers agreed to adopt her. 
</P>
<P>
 But the child's grandmother, a resident of Guadalajara, also wanted her, and 
Mexico intervened in the case on her behalf. A Court of Appeal in San Diego 
overturned the Juvenile Court's decision and ordered the girl to be sent to 
live with her Mexican grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of the Juvenile Court's ruling," wrote Mosk, "was that the child 
was fragile, that she had a strong, healthy bond with the foster mother, and 
essentially no bond with the grandmother. . . . The Juvenile Court correctly 
focused on these factors in deciding the best interest of the child." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carmela Simoncini, an attorney for the child's biological mother, 
complained that the decision will create "long-range problems and really a lot 
of deterioration of what we like to think of as family." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling you would hear quite a different response if an American 
citizen had been freed for adoption in Mexico," the attorney said, adding that 
the child is being raised in an "Anglo Saxon" home where the parents cannot 
speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie's foster parents were delighted. "This was a child who was near 
death . . . , " said Brian Parker, a broadcasting manager. "It's been painful 
for everyone -- we understand that. But especially for Steph. She is the one 
the court chose to rule for." 
</P>
<P>
 He said she is "tremendously loved" in their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a family, a life, a school that loves her, a Catholic church that 
loves her, friends, dance, pets and a sister who loves her very, very much and 
who she loves very, very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie's biological parents had complied with a county plan to reunite them 
with their daughter, visiting her at her foster parents' home. But the Juvenile 
Court noted that the child displayed fear of her parents and became emotionally 
upset after their visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining that her return to them would create "a substantial risk of harm 
to her physical and emotional well-being," the Juvenile Court denied them 
custody. The parents then sought to have the girl given to her grandmother or 
to an aunt in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials investigated the grandmother's home and reported that she 
would be a suitable guardian. They also promised to supervise the child's 
placement with the grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 But a county social worker said the grandmother would be unable to protect the 
child from her parents and recommended foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Simoncini, the biological mother's attorney, said the couple has returned to 
Mexico, and they now have a son. She said the mother was 17 when Stephanie was 
born, and no one saw her or her husband injure the child.

GARAMENDI URGES OVERHAUL OF STATE WELFARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drawing from his campaign experience of working alongside ordinary 
Californians, Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi on Thursday 
proposed an overhaul of the state's welfare program, which he said perversely 
rewards failure rather than success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first priority must be to continually emphasize the basic value of work," 
said Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner who is seeking the Democratic 
nomination for governor in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi cited an example of a mother of two he met while working with her in 
a nursing home in Woodland, just north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to quit," the woman told him, Garamendi recalled during an address 
to corporate public affairs officials at the Downtown Hilton Hotel. "Why should 
I stay at work when I can go on welfare?" the woman asked Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said the woman earned $540 a month and had to spend $150 of that for 
health insurance. On welfare, she would get free health care along with other 
benefits such as community college fees and child care, in addition to a 
monthly payment of $607 and food stamps worth $203. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are providing even more incentives to get on welfare," Garamendi said. 
"We're going at it backward. . . . We must change the way we think about 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said welfare reform should follow these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of job training by private business, nonprofit groups and public 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of local community-service job programs to provide work for those 
who cannot find private jobs. The money is available, Garamendi said, because 
"we are spending more than $1 billion a year for perfectly able-bodied people 
to sit at home." The state's welfare bill is about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Work must always pay more than welfare. "A system will never succeed if 
families are penalized for working." 
</P>
<P>
 * All Californians should have access to health care so that workers are not 
enticed into welfare by the free medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the proposals were general in nature and Garamendi did not offer 
details on how they would be financed. Also, many of Garamendi's ideas have 
been proposed by others and some are state law. Welfare reform has been a major 
goal of California governors since 1967, when former Gov. Ronald Reagan took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most significant changes in the program has been Greater Avenues 
for Independence, which provides education and job training to equip welfare 
recipients for the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has been highly praised since its inception in 1985, and now is 
mandatory for adult welfare recipients. Still, only about 175,000 have 
participated at any one time out of a caseload of about 2 million, largely 
because of a lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is seeking reelection this year, failed in an 
attempt to reform welfare through a state ballot measure in 1992. He introduced 
a similar plan in the Legislature last year, but it also lost because Democrats 
opposed the benefits cutbacks the governor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 budget negotiations, Wilson and Democrats controlling the Legislature 
negotiated reforms that would encourage recipients to obtain and hold jobs by 
keeping more of the income. Other provisions provided incentives to teen-age 
parents for completing high school, increased child care so that mothers can 
attend school or work and pumped more money into the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said Thursday that, with limited exceptions, teen-age parents should 
get welfare only if they are married. He also proposed tougher enforcement of 
laws designed to extract child support payments from "deadbeat dads." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi praised the program as it is administered in Riverside County, where 
officials put heavy emphasis on job hunting. Recipients who failed to maintain 
program attendance had their payments cut. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Garamendi's major competitor for the 
Democratic Party nomination for governor in June, so far has not issued any 
detailed proposal on welfare.

INSURANCE FIRMS WIN REVIEW ON ROLLBACK; COURTS: EX-GOV. DEUKMEJIAN, ARGUING 
BEFORE JUSTICES HE APPOINTED, PERSUADES PANEL TO TAKE UP ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE 
MANDATES FOR CONSUMER RATE RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the urging of former Gov. George Deukmejian and the insurance industry, the 
California Supreme Court agreed Thursday to review a case that tests the 
Legislature's ability to exempt certain insurance companies from voter-approved 
rate rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian, who appointed most of the court's justices, urged them to review 
the case on behalf of a surety insurance company whose owner contributed 
heavily to his political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The company wants the high court to overturn a lower court decision striking 
down a state law exempting part of the insurance industry from the rollbacks 
imposed by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reform advocates contend that four of the six Supreme Court justices 
have a conflict of interest in the case because Deukmejian appointed them.  
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas is a former law partner of Deukmejian, and Justice 
Marvin Baxter served as his appointments secretary. The seventh seat on the 
high court has been vacant since Justice Edward Panelli retired earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is gravely disturbing that the insurance industry was able to 
convince the court to take this case by using the influence of the governor who 
appointed a majority of the court," said Harvey Rosenfield, the chief author of 
Proposition 103.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield said his group, the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project, is 
considering "options" to ensure the case gets an impartial review. "I think the 
public is going to be revolted by this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting to review the case were Justices Lucas, Baxter, Joyce Kennard, Armand 
Arabian -- all Deukmejian appointees -- and Justice Ronald George, who was 
appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. Deukmejian represents Northridge-based Surety 
Co. of the Pacific, which is supporting the main litigant in the case, Amwest 
Surety Insurance Co. Neither Deukmejian nor Surety Co. could be reached for 
comment.  
</P>
<P>
 The high court will review a 2-1 decision by a Court of Appeal striking down a 
1990 state law, signed by Deukmejian, that exempts surety companies from the 
rollbacks required by the 1988 insurance initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety companies provide bonds to contractors, movie studios and others so 
they can guarantee that their projects will be completed. The surety industry 
could be liable for as much as $100 million in rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the high court, asked about a potential conflict of 
interest, noted that the governor has been a principle litigant in other cases 
before it. She said the court has no official comment on the 
conflict-of-interest charge.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / GLENN F. BUNTING: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THE RULES 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the third floor of the Capitol, off a hallway where herds of tourists line 
up each day to observe the process of lawmaking, a tiny chamber houses one of 
the most influential -- and least understood -- committees in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is not welcome here. When the committee is in session, a staffer 
stands inside a lone doorway shooing away the curious. Only a handful of seats 
are available to the media. On the rare occasions when C-SPAN is permitted to 
televise proceedings, a camera operator is stuck in a cramped supply closet 
with the paper clips, No. 2 pencils and Elmer's glue. 
</P>
<P>
 The restricted access to the House Committee on Rules is no accident. 
Democratic leaders prefer to shed as little light as possible on the way the 
committee manipulates legislation before it is sent to the floor for a vote. 
The 13-member panel is stacked with nine Democrats who are chosen by the 
Speaker of the House to carry out his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Californians serve on the committee. One, Republican David Dreier of San 
Dimas, has launched a crusade of sorts to make the rules process more 
democratic. The other, Democrat Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland Hills, agrees 
with many of Dreier's ideas, but generally toes his party's line when it 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker's Committee, as it is known, serves as the House traffic cop by 
setting the rules for debate before each bill goes to the floor. The Rules 
panel determines such critical issues as how many hours will be set aside for 
debate and how many amendments, if any, will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Each piece of legislation is assigned one of three rules -- an open rule, 
which means members are permitted to offer relevant amendments; a restrictive 
rule, which limits the number of amendments, or a closed rule, which prohibits 
any amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 The proportion of bills dispatched to the House floor under open rules has 
declined steeply, from 85% in 1977-78 to 23% last year. This trend, Republicans 
say, reflects a blatant abuse of power by the Democratic majority to stifle 
debate and avoid taking a stand on politically sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Rules Committee stymied an attempt by Republicans to offer an 
amendment deleting a controversial energy tax from President Clinton's budget 
resolution. Similarly, an amendment proposed by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) to deny federal arts funding to programs that benefit 
illegal immigrants was squelched before it could be debated on the House floor. 
Pesky amendments offered by individual Democrats also get scotched. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The inability of House members to amend legislation is one of the reasons Rep. 
Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) decided to run for the Senate after only 
eight months into his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many of us who have never been involved with legislative politics 
were shocked by the fact that there is something called closed rules," says 
Huffington, a multimillionaire businessman who had never run for elected office 
before winning a House seat in 1992. "They don't have that problem over in the 
Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, Dreier says, the Rules Committee often waives standing regulations 
to ram through legislation. He said the committee regularly revokes a rule that 
allows legislators three days to review a bill before it can be considered on 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier and his fellow Republicans have a legitimate beef, says Norman J. 
Ornstein, an authority on Congress and resident scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute. "There is a genuine frustration that you are an equal as 
a member of Congress (and) you ought to have the right to have your 
alternatives debated and voted on the floor," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Democrat on the Rules Committee sympathizes with these Republican 
concerns. Beilenson, who will soon be next in line to become the panel's 
chairman, says that he often argues "for as open a process as possible" and 
sometimes sides with his Republican counterparts in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But voting records suggest that Republicans can count on Beilenson's support 
only when the vote is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson joined all four Republicans on the Rules Committee in October to 
vote 5 to 4 in favor of an open rule for legislation to extend unemployment 
benefits. Four Democrats missed the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Democratic leaders met behind closed doors. Beilenson emerged to 
switch his vote and the open rule was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very much a team player when it is necessary to be," Beilenson says. "My 
ultimate allegiance on something of that sort certainly is to the Speaker."

MEDIA; SINGAPORE JOURNALISTS CHARGED WITH VIOLATING SECRETS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government here has never enjoyed a cordial relationship with the press. 
</P>
<P>
 It has banned some Western correspondents from entering the country and 
restricted the circulation of several publications, such as the Asian Wall 
Street Journal and the Economist, because it was displeased with their 
reporting about Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 But until now, almost all of its ire has been aimed at foreign reporters or 
journals edited outside of Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long trial that has just resumed hearing testimony here, the government 
has accused two prominent local journalists of violating the country's Official 
Secrets Act by publishing a preliminary government estimate of quarterly 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of local journalists say the trial has cast a pall over efforts by 
reporters and editors in this island nation to broaden debate over social 
issues in ways that do not conform to official policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, however, views the trial as a test of its ability to prevent 
leaks and says it has no wider implications for the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Although technically independent of government control, newspapers in 
Singapore are fat with advertising but rarely publish anything more than 
officially sanctioned handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Five men have been charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act, including: 
an official of the country's central bank; two employees of a stock brokerage; 
Patrick Daniel, editor of the Singapore Business Times, and Kenneth James, the 
paper's technology editor. All five have pleaded not guilty. They face two 
years in prison and fines of $1,400 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no dispute that a brokerage employee saw the data on the growth 
estimates -- normally confidential government information -- during a visit to 
the central bank; the employee then passed the material to the Business Times 
in a telephone conversation. The government contends that Business Times 
editors broke the law because the information was not officially released and 
they had to have known that it had been illegally leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case seems like a tempest in a teapot, the government has made clear 
that this is a test case of its right to control what information is made 
public. "You can't run a government which is leaking all over the place," 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong remarked about the case last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore who now advises the 
government as a senior minister, went further, describing journalists as a 
"pressure group" testing the limits of the government. He referred specifically 
to suggestions by independent economists writing in the press that the country 
could afford to cut back on social security savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were still PM and in charge, I doubt if the press or the economists 
working for stockbrokers or fund managers (would) say we are over-saving for 
the next generations, and be pressing for more spending or more funds for 
private investments," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuke was widely interpreted as a slap at his successor for allowing 
controls in Singapore's authoritarian society to slip too much. Goh took over 
promising a "kinder, gentler" government in which such things as film 
censorship were relaxed. Four months later, though, the government brought the 
charges of secrets-law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, after a two-month recess, the defense opened its case, arguing such 
issues as whether the information was actually ever classified secret. The 
stockbroker may simply have glimpsed the figure on a sheet of paper while at 
the central bank and that it was never "leaked" to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case is still stirring controversy here. Cheong Yip Seng, editor in 
chief of Singapore Press Holdings, the company that publishes the country's 
only English-language newspapers, including the Business Times, described 
Western news coverage of the case as "off target." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech, he said foreign coverage of the trial was wrong in suggesting 
that it tests the limits of press freedom. Cheong was quoted as saying: "Those 
involved in the case knew that the issue was confidentiality, not press 
freedom."

DAM ACCIDENT IN S. AFRICA KILLS 13; 64 MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of rescuers used dogs and sonar equipment to search Thursday for up 
to 64 people missing after a wave of poisonous sludge from a burst South 
African gold mine dam engulfed their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Col. Joe Malherbe said the bodies of 13 people had been recovered. The 
number of missing stood at 88 early Thursday but was later dropped to 64. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure changed as people feared buried alive reported to police or 
rescuers during the day that they were not caught in the path of the killer 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Malherbe told a news conference that he doubted anyone will be found alive in 
the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers said they planned to try to remove the mud from the disaster 
site today to see if there are any bodies still trapped. "We will carry on 
until we find the last body," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sludge swept away buildings in an area over a mile long after the dam 
burst during heavy rains Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Yards deep in places, the mud was hardening into a flat field Thursday with 
the remains of buildings, furniture and cars poking through the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dead were buried alive in their homes when a six-foot-high wall of 
sludge, laced with cyanide to extract gold from ore, roared through a housing 
complex for mainly white mine workers beneath the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 In another mining accident, 35 coal miners were reported trapped by an 
underground fire at the Koornfontein colliery in the Eastern Transvaal. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Trans-Natal Coal Corp. Ltd. said 17 of the trapped men had 
been located in a refuge bay 600 feet underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food and water are being provided via a drill hole which ends inside the 
rescue bay," he said, adding that the company hoped to bring them to the 
surface within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Probe holes were being drilled to try to locate the 18 missing workers.

HONG KONG GOVERNOR TO PUSH REFORMS; ASIA: HEAD OF BRITISH COLONY TO MAKE PUBLIC 
DETAILS OF FAILED TALKS WITH CHINA ON ENCLAVE'S FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Chris Patten announced Thursday that he will further press his reform 
campaign by making public an electoral reform bill that China strongly opposes 
and a sensitive government report detailing Britain's account of its failed 
talks with China on Hong Kong's political future. 
</P>
<P>
 In a special session of the British colony's Legislative Council, Patten said 
he will submit to the legislature on March 9 the remainder of a political 
reform package that put Britain and China on a collision course when he first 
unveiled it in October, 1992. The bill will be published today, more than a 
week before it is introduced in the Council. 
</P>
<P>
 China denounced Patten's move and reiterated its previous threats to undo any 
reforms and dismantle Hong Kong's legislature when it assumes control of the 
colony in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said Britain will bear 
responsibility for refusing Beijing's demand that the reform proposals be 
withdrawn in exchange for a resumption of the talks, which broke down in 
November after 17 fruitless rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shen said Patten's announcement had "slammed the door closed" on further 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Patten expressed regret over the lack of an agreement but said Britain had not 
closed the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to talk on a whole range of issues and talk constructively," he said. 
"Let us try to draw a line under this dispute and cooperate together in other 
areas in the interests of the people of Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
 Patten got an implicit go-ahead on reform from the Legislative Council on 
Thursday, when it handed him a crucial victory by passing a "first stage" bill 
containing the least contentious elements of the governor's reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage followed an unusually heated 10-hour debate between the reformers and 
more conservative and pro-Beijing legislators who prefer to dilute or defer 
Patten's package. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bill lowers the voting age to 18 from 21, abolishes government 
appointment of local Council members, halves the number of popularly elected 
legislators to one per constituency and allows some members of China's 
Parliament to run in Hong Kong elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Patten's remaining bill would seal his entire reform program by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 It contains steps that will significantly broaden the voting base for the 1994 
municipal and 1995 legislative elections. Those elections will be Hong Kong's 
last before it reverts to Chinese control in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said that publishing an account of the Sino-British talks will 
help the public understand the course he has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 China objects to the disclosure, which would be unprecedented in nearly 12 
years of mostly secret Sino-British negotiations.

U.N. CONFIDENT PLAN WILL END BOSNIA'S CROAT-MUSLIM CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Applying the same mind-over-matter strategy that has restored peace in 
Sarajevo despite a shortage of enforcement troops, U.N. officials said Thursday 
that they are plunging ahead with an even more daunting step toward ending the 
Bosnian blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilian head of the U.N. Protection Force, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, 
confidently predicted after brokering a cease-fire between Bosnian Croat and 
government troops set to begin today that he had "no doubt it will be honored 
scrupulously." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to build on the success of the tense but so far durable calm in 
Sarajevo brought on by a similar truce announced here two weeks ago, U.N. 
military and political leaders have worked out a four-step plan for repairing a 
deadly rift between Croats and Muslims. The two groups have been fighting over 
the scraps of Bosnian territory left after a massive land-grab by rebel Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But trust between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims, who were allied against the 
Serb nationalist rebellion for the first year of the siege, has evaporated over 
the last 10 months of vicious fighting unmitigated by Western mediators' plan 
for carving up the republic into three ethnic ministates along the lines of 
what territory each community holds. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 7 deadline proposed for the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the 
scattered Muslim-Croat flash points in central and southern Bosnia has been 
modeled after the formula used in Sarajevo, but it lacks the threat of NATO air 
strikes against violators -- the stick that was seen as the prime motivation 
for partial Bosnian Serb compliance with the U.N. order for demilitarization of 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission, which has 12,000 troops in Bosnia, is clearly stretched by 
the current focus of manpower on Sarajevo to monitor the cease-fire and keep up 
the pressure on Bosnian Serb rebels, who have yet to genuinely comply with 
NATO's order. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of heavy Serb guns remain within the 12-mile exclusion zone that NATO 
declared around Sarajevo, despite the deadline for withdrawal that expired 
early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A renewed U.N. appeal for 2,500 more troops to enforce the tense peace in 
Sarajevo was issued last week and has yet to draw any positive reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a U.N. request last May for 7,600 soldiers to establish havens for 
embattled Muslims in six Bosnian cities attracted less than half the desired 
reinforcements, leaving the U.N. mission severely shorthanded and unable to 
deploy peacekeepers to several of the proclaimed safe zones that remain under 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 How the mission will ensure compliance by the Bosnian government and Croatian 
forces fighting across a broad swath of central territory has yet to be 
explained by U.N. officials, who have already had to redeploy troops from other 
Balkans peacekeeping tasks to bolster the patrols in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles and mechanisms that were successful in Sarajevo are 
applicable" elsewhere in the republic, said British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, 
commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has battled all this week to play down widespread Bosnian Serb violations 
of the NATO ultimatum, spotlighting instead the genuine reprieve from 
bombardment that has followed the cease-fire that he played a key role in 
brokering on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's de facto policy is that threatened NATO air strikes against the 
remaining heavy weapons will be withheld as long as there is no resumption of 
the shelling that savaged this city of 380,000 for almost two years. 
</P>
<P>
 After announcement of the Muslim-Croat accord, Ante Roso of the Bosnian Croats 
and Bosnian army Chief of Staff Rasim Delic spoke optimistically of the 
agreement, which was brokered by Rose and Akashi. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerous cease-fires agreed to by Muslim and Croat leaders have fallen to 
pieces because of fighting by renegade elements on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting along the Muslim-Croat fault lines has escalated in recent days, 
despite a general calming trend in most areas of the republic, which is now 70% 
in the hands of Bosnian Serbs, with the remainder split between the other two 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortar and machine-gun fire racked the central town of Vitez, site of a major 
U.N. base, and two humanitarian aid convoys came under attack from Croat-held 
positions near the town of Gornji Vakuf, U.N. spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Aikman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensified shelling was also reported from Bosnian Serb positions against the 
encircled Muslim enclaves of Maglaj and Bihac -- two areas where the Serb armor 
withdrawn from Sarajevo is believed to be bolstering sieges not yet targeted by 
the U.N. mission's step-by-step approach to an overall peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Maglaj has been described by the few aid workers who have managed to reach the 
city in recent months as the most desperate corner of beleaguered Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 No food or other relief goods have been allowed through the surrounding 
Bosnian Serb and Croat territory since Oct. 25. Widespread malnutrition has 
been reported among the Muslim community there. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 Bosnians are dead or missing after nearly 23 months of war 
that began when Serb nationalists rebelled against the republic's vote for 
independence from Yugoslavia in March, 1992.

BRITAIN'S MAJOR TO IRON THINGS OUT WITH CLINTON -- IN PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The special relationship between the United States and Britain, dented by 
collisions over Bosnia and Northern Ireland, will undergo some repairs next 
week in the unlikely venue of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's invitation, British Prime Minister John Major will join 
him on a trip to the Monongahela Valley region of Pennsylvania, where Major's 
grandfather helped build steel-mill blast furnaces in the 1870s. Then the pair 
will return to Washington, where Major will spend a night at the White House -- 
a rare honor for a foreign head of state. 
</P>
<P>
 This attention comes amid public declarations from the White House and the 
Major administration that there are no tensions between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a strained relationship," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers 
insisted this week. "Any reports to the contrary are . . . simply not true." 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts remain unconvinced, believing that the two leaders are 
trying to rebuild what -- since the unexpected recent strengthening of 
U.S.-French ties -- has become the coolest of America's relationships with its 
major Western European allies. 
</P>
<P>
 A warming could help Clinton in Bosnia, where the British have been among the 
most resistant to U.S. efforts to use the threat of force to bring peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of new respect from Clinton could also revitalize Major's sagging 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 While arrangements are incomplete, the Pittsburgh trip is expected to focus on 
the economic revitalization of an old-line industrial area that -- like many in 
England -- has been hard hit by the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Clinton and Major were once expected to be good, because 
both came from humble backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this year, one U.S. official described the chemistry between the 
gregarious Clinton and the stolid Major -- sometimes called "Mister Gray" -- as 
"non-existent." 
</P>
<P>
 While the tensions have received far less attention here, many in the United 
Kingdom have been alarmed by an apparent series of conflicts between the White 
House and Downing Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's decision to grant a visa to Gerry Adams, leader of the political arm 
of the Irish Republican Army, provoked angry and hurt reactions from the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton secured Major's agreement to support a NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs only by warning that disunity would weaken the Western alliance. And the 
two administrations have been at odds over other issues, including the plan to 
gradually expand NATO's membership and the U.S. government's more aggressive 
intervention in trade matters.

NEWS ANALYSIS; YELTSIN SHOWS HARD EDGE ON FOREIGN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin's State of the Nation speech on Thursday took a 
distinctly harder line on foreign policy, promising that Russia will pursue its 
national interests more vigorously and is prepared to get tough when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the speech was crafted for domestic consumption, its assertive stance 
signals Moscow's independence from the West at a time when Russia is suffering 
from superpower nostalgia and wounded national pride. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six weeks since President Clinton met with Yeltsin in Moscow in 
January, Russia has objected to Eastern European countries being admitted to 
NATO, launched its own peace-making gambit in Bosnia and shrugged off American 
outrage over the Ames espionage case. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, Yeltsin proposed that the leaders of France, Germany, 
Britain and the United States meet in Moscow to work on a settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict, a strategy that would draw diplomatic focus away from NATO, 
to which Russia does not belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin rarely speaks about foreign policy issues while at home, but in his 
first address to the new Parliament on Thursday, he said Russia's foreign 
policy has in the past been "short on initiative and creativity," with Russia's 
dramatic diplomatic intervention in the Bosnian crisis an exception to this 
passivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fond of saying that Russia is a great country. That is so. But then 
our foreign policy thinking should match this high standard," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said Russia's first priority is preventing global war, including a new 
Cold War. "That is why we fully support strengthening the program of 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the latest military 
technologies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he pointedly added that the principle "is binding on all (nations) and not 
only on Russia, as some people seem to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 The president vowed to make no more "unilateral concessions," especially on 
defense. He stressed the need to help Russian companies and defense contractors 
market their wares abroad, to take charge of peacekeeping on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union and to defend ethnic Russians living in the former 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin also made it clear that Russia will not tolerate being ignored -- in 
Bosnia or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is not a guest in Europe, but a full participant in the European 
community, with an interest in its well-being," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian politicians hailed Yeltsin's speech, and foreign policy analysts said 
it was "high time" for Russia, preoccupied with its wrenching domestic 
upheavals, to reassert its international interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of the totalitarian system, Russia has neither defined nor 
asserted its national interests, said Alexander A. Konovalov, a defense expert 
at Moscow's U.S.A.-Canada Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our foreign policy for some time has been largely based on the declaration of 
biblical and universal humanitarian values," Konovalov said. "That's fine, but 
every country has its own national interests to pursue, and Russia is no 
exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's interests "cannot always coincide with the interests of other major 
democracies," Konovalov said. "But that is no tragedy. It's a normal process." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's speech was short on specifics about where Russia's national 
interests begin and end. 
</P>
<P>
 But his pledge to defend Russians living abroad was a clear message to the 
Baltic states, where up to 20,000 Russian troops are still stationed, and to 
Kazakhstan, which also has a large ethnic Russian minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The tougher rhetoric seemed to please Parliament and could help defuse the 
appeal of neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who has accused Yeltsin 
of groveling to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikonov said relations between Washington and Moscow "are already not as warm 
as they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a new chill develops, he said, will depend on how both sides behave in 
Bosnia, the outcome of the spying case against CIA operations officer Aldrich 
Hazen Ames, and the willingness of Parliament to ratify such international 
treaties as START II, a new chemical weapons pact and the NATO-sponsored 
Partnership for Peace program that Yeltsin has endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said the Kremlin's more assertive mood does not necessarily 
mean chilly relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West needs a good, strong, assertive government in Russia which will 
control the country, prevent disintegration and be a pillar of the 
international community," said Viktor A. Kremenyuk, deputy director of the 
U.S.A.-Canada Institute.

AFTER YEAR, SOUTH KOREA'S LEADERSHIP IS DIFFERENT YET STRANGELY FAMILIAR; ASIA: 
FIRST CIVILIAN PRESIDENT IN DECADES HAS PUSHED HUMAN RIGHTS. YET LIKE HIS 
PREDECESSOR, HE STILL RULES BY DECREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Young Sam, South Korea's first civilian president in three decades, today 
marks a year in office that has brought a once authoritarian nation to its 
highest level of human rights and its government to a peak of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as they acknowledge the gains, observers point out an irony: Kim has 
been ruling largely by presidential decree -- not all that differently from the 
late President Park Chung Hee, a general who took power in a 1961 coup and 
introduced authoritarianism to South Korea in 1971 when he made himself 
president for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The style is the same. The content is entirely different," says Rev. Kim Kwan 
Suk, a retired president of the Christian Broadcasting System. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Sang Jin, a Seoul National University professor of sociology, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The power has been concentrated too much in President Kim," he says. "If 
President Kim disappeared, I would guess that all of the reforms would 
collapse. I don't see any forces that could continue them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The present situation is not as solid as foreign observers think," Han adds. 
"We are far from achieving the consolidation of democratic institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked their opinion of a post-Kim era, three Western diplomats responded in 
unison: "It would depend on who takes over." 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Rhee Sang Woo of Sogang University, who is a frequent consultant to the 
government, argues that there is a significant difference between Kim and his 
military predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fundamental difference is that the Korean people, including the 
opposition, accept the Kim administration as a genuinely democratic 
government," Rhee says. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll published by the newspaper Joong-Ang on Thursday found 62.3% of the 
people support Kim, while only 9.4% do not. The others had no opinion or said 
they neither supported nor opposed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Robert A. Scalapino, professor of government emeritus at UC 
Berkeley, says Asian political systems, including South Korea's, suffer a 
"uniformly weak . . . institutional base. Hence the dependence upon 
personalities is great." 
</P>
<P>
 That is certainly true for Kim Young Sam. Like Park, he has become a giant 
tree: Nothing is growing in his shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machinery of democracy has not been established," says Gene Matthews, a 
longtime Methodist missionary here. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's political parties remain moribund, unable either to generate 
policies or nurture new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even doubt whether the parties will remain intact until the next 
presidential election in 1997. The National Assembly still acts largely as a 
rubber stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Korean ideological and cultural ethics have worked against 
institutionalizing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this year's U.S. State Department human rights report on South 
Korea, "the government's indirect influence on the media remains considerable," 
with many journalists practicing "some degree of self-censorship to advance 
their careers." 
</P>
<P>
 Government payments to reporters "have been curtailed but not halted 
completely," it adds. 
</P>
<P>
 A national security law designed to thwart subversion by pro-Communist North 
Korea elements is still used "to violate the freedom of expression, association 
and travel," the U.S. report declares. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior censorship of the arts still remains in force. 
</P>
<P>
 A ban on broadcast of Japanese movies and music lingers on nearly half a 
century after the end of the 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws that violate the standards of the International Labor Organization, to 
which South Korea belongs, have not been changed because of such Confucian 
beliefs that teachers belong to a sacrosanct profession and should not organize 
unions, Labor Minister Nam Jae Hee says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My headache is how to compromise the ILO standards with Korean realities," 
Nam says. "We are not accustomed to the union activities of advanced 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 And a "curfew" that has been in effect since 1945 for all but the pre-1988 
Olympic period is still enforced only by a government edict. In its form now, 
Koreans are allowed to stay out all night, but bars and restaurants must close 
at midnight. Kim amended it -- again by decree -- to allow 41 specific bars and 
restaurants that cater to foreigners to operate until 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assembly has never voted on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't feel affected by these undemocratic practices," Rev. Kim 
says. "A system of democratic cultural values is not deeply rooted. Our 
traditional political culture emphasizes the wholeness of national identity" 
over individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's predecessor, Roh Tae Woo, another ex-general, deserves much of the 
credit for ending authoritarian rule and carrying out a 1987 election pledge to 
"democratize" the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Roh's greatest achievement may have been completing the transition from 
military to civilian rule by persuading Kim, who had spent three decades in the 
opposition, to join forces with him in 1990. Roh then anointed Kim his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim promised to go further. In his inauguration speech, he declared that 
his administration will "open a new era of democracy under civilian 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 "The government that serves you from today will be a different kind of 
government" -- one that will produce "a freer and more mature democratic 
society," a higher quality of life, a respect for the dignity of individuals 
and a presidential office that "will be your good neighbor," he said in that 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the old Establishment, Kim's reforms have drawn praise bordering on 
awe. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has ended three decades of political intervention and manipulation by the 
Korean CIA, now euphemistically called the National Security Planning Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He ousted a clique of more than 60 politically minded generals from the army. 
For the first time, the National Assembly has been empowered to examine the 
KCIA's budget and oversee its activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, these are rated as epochal accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected President Kim to accomplish such a feat as eliminating that 
clique of generals. . . . I compliment him without reservation," says Park Kwon 
Sang, a commentator who was ousted as editor of the daily Dong-A Ilbo in the 
wake of a 1980 coup by Maj. Gen. Chun Doo Hwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before President Kim, I always got calls from the Korean CIA and the police 
-- if only to maintain contact," Rev. Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 The notorious Defense Security Command, through which both Chun and Roh 
advanced to the top, was also downgraded and prohibited from conducting 
surveillance on civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coup watch is over," one of the Western diplomats says. 
</P>
<P>
 But while surveillance has ended, reports persist that government agencies are 
still eavesdropping and bugging telephones without warrants, Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights advocate Kim Keun Tae, whose most recent imprisonment came under 
Roh, says about 300 political prisoners remain in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 (The U.S. human rights report put the number at "well under 100," excluding 
persons jailed for committing violent acts while expressing opinions.) 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. report focused on two steps taken by the president as "democratic 
institutional reforms of historic nature." 
</P>
<P>
 One was presidential jawboning -- followed by enactment of an "ethics law" -- 
requiring all high-level officials and politicians to reveal their family's 
personal assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of politicians, judges, prosecutors, policemen, generals and high 
officials with questionable fortunes were forced out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was a decree requiring all financial transactions to be carried out 
under real names, rather than aliases. It was designed to thwart funds for 
bribery and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few charges were filed and no one was asked to give up any illicit 
earnings, the public was delighted by the sense of economic revenge and justice 
that both actions created. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the courts, once under the thumb of the president, also "are 
moving strongly toward establishing an independent judiciary," says Matthews, 
the missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is not all rosy, however.  
</P>
<P>
 Union membership, which shot up after Roh's promise of democratization in 
1987, is now falling. Labor strife continues on a much-reduced scale but is 
still regarded as a potential threat to economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor have student radicals faded away. But democracy is no longer an issue that 
draws any support for anti-government demonstrations from average students, 
Prof. Han says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Koreans forgive Kim for his authoritarian approach to implementing 
reforms because, they say, it is the only possible course. 
</P>
<P>
 His own followers remain a minority in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
that is dominated by backers of Roh and Chun. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he tries to compromise, he can't have reform," Labor Minister Nam says. 
"Only by using public opinion has President Kim overpowered his ruling party 
opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 The government itself has recognized its shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite its considerable results, the reform drive during the past year can 
hardly be said to have met the people's expectations," Prime Minister Lee Hoi 
Chang said in a speech to the National Assembly on Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Henceforth, the government will concentrate on institutional reform and 
enactment of Kim's reform policies into law, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Several planned major reforms also remain to be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first attempt to write legislation on its own, the National Assembly is 
now trying to work out new election laws to slash campaign spending. Once that 
is accomplished, the last major piece in the planned framework of democracy -- 
Korea's first election of governors and mayors since 1960 -- is scheduled for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those elections, Prof. Rhee says, may produce a desperately needed new 
platform for the emergence of new leaders not hand-picked by the president. 
</P>
<P>
 They may also spur reform in both ruling and opposition parties. But they will 
also constitute a high risk to Kim's own standing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an elected mayor of Seoul, a city of 12 million, or more than a 
quarter of all South Koreans, is expected to exercise power rivaling that of 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Kim's own popularity, this is a race that the ruling party, which has 
usually fared poorly in the nation's capital, might lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single issue of democracy will not be the determining factor for Kim's 
support," Rev. Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the economy appears to be turning upward again, rapid inflation poses 
an emerging danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's opening of the Korean rice market to foreign imports and his 
handling of the North Korean nuclear issue have already lowered his support 
ratings, Rev. Kim adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very difficult for him to maintain his popularity of the last 
year," Rev. Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 But in historic terms, if the president continues his reforms successfully, 
Matthews says, Kim could become the first president in South Korea's history to 
go into retirement "looking good and retaining a lot of credibility."

CIA CHIEF SEES RISK OF WIDER SPY PROBLEM; ESPIONAGE: R. JAMES WOOLSEY TELLS 
LAWMAKERS HE SHARES THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT OTHER SECURITY BREACHES. OFFICIALS 
DEBATE LIKELIHOOD OF SECOND MOLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In his first extensive public comments on the scandal rocking his agency, CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey acknowledged Thursday that discovery of what 
officials say is a Kremlin "mole" in the agency represents a "very serious" 
internal security breach and said a special commission is examining possible 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, facing sometimes sharp questions from the House Intelligence 
Committee, said he shares lawmakers' concerns that the spying controversy 
surrounding veteran CIA officer Aldrich H. Ames might be an example of a 
breakdown that others with sensitive access could be exploiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this is a very serious problem and it's one that we take 
seriously and it's one that, frankly, I fully admit," Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not specifically address the question of whether there might be more 
than one mole operating in the agency, but others in Congress and around the 
intelligence community debated the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions of an accomplice were fueled by classified documents found in Ames' 
CIA office that had nothing to do with his assignment in the agency's 
counternarcotics center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't necessarily mean there was a second mole in the agency, but it 
may suggest that Ames had a friend or an accomplice who obtained the documents 
for him," said one congressional source familiar with intelligence briefings on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agency has very strict procedures . . , information is very 
compartmentalized, and it seems unlikely that he could have gotten the later 
documents by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But a law enforcement source close to the investigation insisted that no 
Americans other than Ames and his wife are suspected of taking part in the 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 An intelligence officer with Ames' 31 years of seniority would have been able 
to acquire documents on assorted subjects without great difficulty, regardless 
of technical security restrictions, said a source familiar with CIA practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Anger and suspicion were pervasive in official Washington as officials both 
inside and outside the intelligence community tried to gauge the full extent of 
damage caused by spying activities that allegedly funneled sensitive 
information to the former Soviet Union and, later, to Russian intelligence 
services for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirmed that a delegation of U.S. national security officials, 
including a high-ranking CIA official, has been dispatched to Moscow to confer 
with their Russian counterparts. It is understood that the U.S. delegation 
wants to underscore common intelligence interests that the two countries share 
rather than seeking cooperation in the Ames investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators' hopes that the suspects themselves would help in the damage 
assessment were dashed when attorneys for Ames, 52, a middle-level intelligence 
officer who had specialized in Soviet counterintelligence, and his wife, Maria 
del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, indicated that they would fight the charges. The 
accused CIA agent is refusing to answer questions about his alleged espionage 
for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, he's going to plead not guilty and fight the charges," said 
Plato Cacheris, Ames' court-appointed lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 The veteran Washington defense attorney declined to elaborate, but a 
government source familiar with the case said Cacheris may have qualified his 
statement because of the strength of the evidence contained in an unusually 
detailed FBI affidavit filed in connection with searches and arrest of the 
couple Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ames, who worked briefly as a paid CIA source in Mexico City, attacked 
the accuracy of quotations in the FBI affidavit -- drawn from wiretaps -- that 
depicted her as an active participant in the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, William Cummings, said the part-time student at Georgetown 
University, "has been devastated by the distortions, out-of-context selected 
statements and alleged quotations in the government's affidavit, along with the 
subsequent press coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 When arrested Monday, she gave FBI agents a "very damaging statement," a 
source familiar with the investigation said Thursday. An aide to Cummings 
declined comment on her interview by FBI agents and whether it signaled that 
she is cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 But another source said there has been no further cooperation after the 
initial interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Woolsey faced questions heavily laced with 
disbelief that an intelligence officer with access to such extremely sensitive 
information -- including the code names of Russians spying for the United 
States -- could have escaped notice while living far beyond his means and 
taking unauthorized overseas trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may not have been alone in recognizing that the system may not have been 
operating, that discovery is not certain, that procedures were not working," 
said Rep. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House panel, said the Ames case 
"raises disturbing questions about the internal controls and management of 
counterintelligence activities at the CIA." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said a joint CIA-Defense Department commission appointed last year is 
currently studying security-related issues and would be making its 
recommendations shortly.

VIRUS FATAL TO 30 IN SOUTHWEST CLAIMS FIRST NORTHEAST VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A respiratory virus that killed more than 30 people in the Southwest last 
summer has claimed its first victim in the Northeast, health officials 
confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest person to die from hantaviral pulmonary syndrome was identified as 
David Rosenberg, 22, a student at the Rhode Island School of Design.He died 
Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Government health experts said they believe Rosenberg contracted the virus 
during Christmas break, possibly in the Queens section of New York City where 
he reportedly helped clean out a rat- and mouse-infested warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be significant because the virus that infected the student has been 
found previously only in rural deer mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important, because it is in an area where there are no deer mice," 
said Dr. Rima Khabbaz, a member of the Hantavirus Task Force at the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. "If this involves rats 
common to inner cities, the implication is that more people will be exposed to 
the hantavirus." 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials are searching areas that the man visited in New 
York and Rhode Island in hopes of finding traces of the hantavirus and infected 
rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus is characterized by flu-like symptoms with fever, muscle aches, 
headache and cough, followed by respiratory failure as the lungs fill with 
fluid and the patient essentially drowns. The disease is fatal about 60% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-nine hantavirus cases have been identified in the United States since 
the disease was first recognized in May. Most of the victims came from the Four 
Corners area of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The first case east of the Mississippi River showed up early last month in 
Indiana, when a 48-year-old teacher died three days after developing symptoms, 
including breathing problems, nausea and fever.

WINTER STORM SHROUDS EAST WITH THIRD LAYER OF SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The third storm in as many days swept out of the Great Plains on Thursday, 
adding another layer of snow to drifts that were more than a foot deep in many 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will come down hard and fast and then be gone like an express train," 
Peter Leavitt of Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass., said of the 
storm."Then it will turn colder." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures hovering near zero froze puddles and turned messy slush into 
rock-hard ice across much of the eastern half of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The thick layer of snow extending from Nebraska to New England will ensure 
colder weather by reflecting the sun's rays back into space while insulating 
warmth from the ground under its icy blanket, Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow was as deep as a foot and a half in the Dakotas and western 
Minnesota, with blowing and drifting snow adding to the hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Just behind the storm in Iowa, the temperature dipped to 3 below zero in 
Waterloo and 5 below in Mason City. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature in Chicago was below freezing Thursday, and forecasters were 
calling for two to six more inches of snow on top of the 12 inches already on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold weather was expected to delay flooding that had begun to plague 
riverside communities throughout the Midwest, but a rapid thaw could restart 
the flooding cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the moisture, it's whether you pay now or pay later," Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northeast, freezing rain on top of snow created sheets of ice Thursday 
that delayed morning commuters. Bus trips to New York City from New Jersey 
suburbs that normally take 45 minutes took as long as two hours.

TEEN-AGERS FACE SPECIAL SMOKING RISK, REPORT WARNS; HEALTH: SURGEON GENERAL 
SAYS TOBACCO USE AMONG YOUTHS IS STILL PREVALENT. THE INDUSTRY'S ADVERTISING 
CAMPAIGNS ARE SINGLED OUT FOR BLAME. 
</P>

<P>
 Cigarette smoking -- of all addictive behaviors -- is the one most likely to 
take hold during adolescence and almost all adult smokers took their first drag 
before they were graduated from high school, the surgeon general's annual 
report on smoking said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders unveiled the report with a warning to the 
nation's young people: "Tobacco addicts and it kills." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer discuss smoking as an adult habit -- because today, tobacco 
use, without question, is an adolescent tragedy," she added at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which focused on cigarette smoking and youth, is part of a series 
of documents released since the landmark 1964 report that first established 
cigarette smoking as a significant danger to health. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to heart disease -- the leading 
killer of adults in the United States -- and stroke, as well as a chief cause 
of certain cancers and respiratory ailments. Federal health officials blame 
smoking for an estimated 434,000 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tobacco use declined among high school seniors in the 1970s, it 
remained steady in the 1980s and is now on the rise again at all grade levels, 
according to a survey released recently by the federal government. Cigarettes 
and alcohol remain the most widely abused substances among the nation's youth, 
the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than 3 million adolescents smoke cigarettes and more than 1 million 
adolescent males use smokeless tobacco, the surgeon general's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite three decades of explicit health warnings, large numbers of young 
people continue to take up tobacco," the report said. One out of every three 
adolescents in the United States uses tobacco by age 18, it added. 
</P>
<P>
 The report blamed the tobacco industry's $4-billion-a-year cigarette 
advertising and promotional campaign for contributing to teen-age smoking, but 
said that disincentives to smoking -- such as tobacco tax increases and 
school-based tobacco-use prevention programs -- are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising "appears to increase young people's risk of smoking by affecting 
their perceptions of the pervasiveness, image and function of smoking," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since cigarette ads were banned from the broadcast media, "there has been a 
continuing shift from advertising to promotion," such as the sponsoring of 
sports events, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, young people are being indoctrinated with tobacco promotion at a 
susceptible time in their lives," it said. "Young people face enormous 
pressures to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 School-based programs that identify social influences on smoking and provide 
skills to resist those influences have demonstrated "consistent and significant 
reductions in adolescent smoking prevalence," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "a crucial element of prevention is access," the report added. 
"Adolescents should not be able to purchase tobacco products in their 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders took special aim at the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for its controversial 
"Joe Camel" ads, and she challenged the Federal Trade Commission to act on 
petitions against the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds, said a recent study done for 
the company indicated that Joe Camel was not influencing the nation's children 
to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed that Joe Camel is not the most memorable advertising character with 
youth -- and, in fact, the strong negative reaction to the product he 
represents suggests that the campaign is not causing youth to start smoking," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While condemning cigarette advertising for influencing young people to smoke, 
Elders did not call for a total advertising ban. However, she said "we 
shouldn't advertise something we know to be a poison and a killer." 
</P>
<P>
 She also called for higher cigarette taxes, a move already proposed by 
President Clinton to help finance his health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the tobacco industry said they agreed with much of the report, 
including its basic message -- that young people should be prevented from 
smoking -- but took issue with some of the specifics, particularly the charge 
that advertising and promotion are largely responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of room for agreement," said Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for 
the Tobacco Institute. "Industry has been a leader in developing and marketing 
(materials) for parents and working with the school systems to discourage young 
people from smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she called it "misguided" to attack advertising and promotion as 
the main villains in enticing young people to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Advertising is not the factor that gets young people to smoke," she said. 
"The (report) talks about ads creating a positive environment for smoking. The 
surveys all show that young people are very aware of the risks." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Assn. and the American Lung 
Assn. issued a joint statement supporting the report's conclusions and Elders' 
comments, saying: "We need to reduce conditions that contribute to tobacco use 
and help young people turn their backs on tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the report, the Department of Health and Human Services 
also released a new surgeon general's report for children. The magazine-style 
document is geared for students in sixth grade -- where smoking often starts.

CLINTON CONFIDENT ON HEALTH CARE REFORM; MEDICINE: HE DISMISSES CONGRESSIONAL 
CONCERNS AS 'DETAILS' THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT. PRESIDENT ALSO SEEKS THE SUPPORT 
OF THE ELDERLY IN A DRUGSTORE VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton shrugged off congressional qualms about his health care plan 
Thursday as he participated in another event designed to win support for his 
reforms among a crucial constituency -- the nation's elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Key legislators have said in recent days that large parts of the President's 
plan lack support on Capitol Hill. Chief among them is the provision creating 
the mandatory insurance purchasing cooperatives that the Administration calls 
health care alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton dismissed those concerns as "details" Thursday -- saying to 
reporters before a speech here that, if Congress agrees to his goal of 
guaranteeing health insurance for all Americans, "we'll work out everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning," Clinton said, noting the long line of 
subcommittees, committees and floor debates through which the health plan must 
travel in the next several months. "I'm not worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with continued doubts in Congress, however, the White House has been 
trying to bolster support within major constituencies and among business 
groups. As part of that effort, the President and his health care reformists 
have scheduled two weeks of events designed to persuade the elderly that his 
plan would benefit them far more than its rivals would. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he traveled to Edison, N.J., to enlist the support of the powerful 
elderly lobby, the American Assn. of Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the President's pitch focused on his plan to expand Medicare 
benefits to include prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the Greenville Drug Store here, the President met with several 
elderly customers, listening to the tales of their ailments and the high costs 
of the drugs they need. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people break down and cry" in the store because they cannot afford 
to buy the drugs their doctors say they need, pharmacist John Kiszkiel told 
Clinton. "I've had people here who told me they had to sell their homes" or 
chose between buying drugs and paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration included prescription drug coverage as a sweetener that it 
hoped would energize elderly voters and their often-influential lobbyists on 
behalf of Clinton's proposed reforms. In upcoming events, the President intends 
to emphasize a second element of his plan -- a limited program of assistance 
for long-term, in-home nursing care -- that also has considerable appeal for 
the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 No interest group has been courted more assiduously by the White House than 
the elderly. And for good reason. The support of groups like the AARP is 
crucial to enactment of Clinton's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the proposed coverage for long-term care and prescription drugs, 
two highly popular elements among the aged, the AARP has not endorsed the 
President's agenda -- much to the Administration's annoyance. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal AARP polls continue to reveal confusion among its 33 million members 
over the particulars of health care reform. As a result, AARP leaders -- who 
like much of the Clinton plan -- are loath to get too far ahead of their rank 
and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's plan, Medicare would become by far the nation's largest 
purchaser of drugs, giving the government enormous leverage over drug prices. 
Because of that, the proposal has drawn opposition from drug manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the Clinton plan has been popular with drugstore 
owners, who hope that lower drug costs for the elderly will increase their 
sales. As he appeared here, Clinton was accompanied by representatives of two 
drugstore industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress, seeking to cut the cost of Clinton's plan, have 
proposed removing the drug benefit for older Americans, but Clinton has 
strongly opposed that idea. Speaking to elderly customers at the drugstore 
here, Clinton said he realizes that Congress must trim costs, "but we must not 
take this drug benefit out." 
</P>
<P>
 Spending more on drugs for the elderly "will actually save the health care 
system money" over the long run by avoiding other, more expensive treatments, 
Clinton insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 That view probably overstates the case. Two studies commissioned by the 
drugstore associations and touted by the White House calculated that the drug 
benefit would lead to considerable savings elsewhere in the Medicare program. 
But the new benefit would still cost more than it saves, the studies concluded. 
The new benefit would cost about $60 billion over five years and reduce other 
expenses by roughly $30 billion, the studies suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the plans competing with Clinton's, the so-called single-payer proposal 
sponsored by Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) also includes coverage for long-term 
care and prescription drugs. The bill written by Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) 
would cover prescription drugs but not long-term care. The proposal by Rep. Jim 
Cooper (D-Tenn.) contains neither provision.

GOP ATTACKS HANDLING OF WHITEWATER; CONGRESS: SENATORS PRESSURE FEDERAL 
REGULATORS TO AGREE TO REVIEW INVESTIGATION OF ROLE PLAYED BY ROSE LAW FIRM, AS 
WELL AS FIRST LADY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers mounted a furious attack on the Clinton Administration's 
handling of the Whitewater controversy Thursday and succeeded in pressuring 
federal regulators into reviewing their investigation of the role that First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her former law firm had played. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew C. Hove Jr., acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
agreed to call on the FDIC's inspector general to review the agency's 
investigation of the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, where Mrs. Clinton was a 
partner. Last week, the FDIC cleared the firm of any conflict of interest in 
the tangled real estate venture. It was the first formal government report to 
be issued in the controversy over the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Hove's decision came in the midst of a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban 
Affairs Committee hearing marked by a bitter partisan split over Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides seeking a renewed investigation by banking regulators, Republicans -- 
led by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York -- also demanded that the White 
House and the regulators release all documents related to the affair. But the 
Administration refused, claiming that to do so would interfere with the ongoing 
investigation by Robert B. Fiske Jr., the special counsel appointed by Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats on the committee, meanwhile, dismissed Republican demands for formal 
hearings on Whitewater, arguing that those, too, would interfere with Fiske's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe what we're doing is piling on in a partisan fashion," argued 
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing had been called to review the status of the federal 
government's bailout of the savings and loan industry. But Republicans used the 
occasion to grill Administration officials and the heads of the major banking 
regulatory agencies for the first time publicly about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the officials attending the hearing were Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an obligation to get to the bottom of this sorry affair," D'Amato 
said. "And we have reasonable concerns about the integrity of the 
investigation" by federal regulators, he added. "Something smells rotten in 
Little Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 They charged that Clinton political appointees like Roger Altman, deputy 
Treasury secretary and acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp., were blocking 
public access to critical documents in the case, and complained that 
congressional Democrats were unwilling to undertake an investigation of 
Whitewater because of political allegiance to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to get information out of the White House about Whitewater is like 
trying to eat ice cream with knitting needles," said Sen. Lauch Faircloth 
(R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP senators pointedly referred to instances in the past in which 
Democrats had conducted congressional hearings while criminal investigations 
were under way -- such as the inquiry into the role of Neil Bush, son of former 
President George Bush, in the failure in Colorado of Silverado Savings & Loan. 
Congress also took testimony on the Iran-Contra scandal at the same time that 
an independent counsel was investigating the Ronald Reagan Administration's 
handling of the matter, the Republicans noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an aide to President Reagan had been found dead and another Reagan aide 
went through his papers, you can bet that the Democrats would be calling for a 
congressional investigation," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), referring to the 
mystery surrounding the apparent suicide in July of then-Deputy White House 
Counsel Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato charged that the FDIC's eight-page report on its investigation into 
Whitewater was nothing more than an "inept whitewash of Whitewatergate."  
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that a separate, newly released RTC report on the Rose firm's 
involvement in the case showed that regulators had not contacted "former or 
current" attorneys at the firm who were knowledgeable about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Mrs. Clinton, then a partner at the Rose firm, was hired by Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan to help the troubled thrift win approval from an 
Arkansas state regulator appointed by her husband, then the state's governor, 
for a novel plan to sell preferred stock and set up a brokerage subsidiary. At 
the time, the Clintons were business partners with Madison's owner, James B. 
McDougal, and his wife, Susan, in the Whitewater real estate development in the 
Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the central questions now being investigated by special counsel Fiske is 
whether Madison's funds were used to help pay off Clinton's campaign bills. He 
will also try to determine whether Madison deposits were diverted to other 
corporations owned by McDougal, including Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, after Madison had failed at an estimated cost to taxpayers of between 
$47 million and $60 million and had been taken over by federal regulators, the 
Rose firm represented the FDIC in a lawsuit against Madison's former accounting 
firm, Frost & Co. The lawsuit accused Frost of negligence for failing to detect 
fraud at Madison. But in 1985, Mrs. Clinton and another Rose attorney relied on 
a Frost audit report on Madison when they sought state approval for Madison's 
bid to sell stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster Hubbell, then a Rose partner and now associate attorney general, 
handled the Madison legal work for the FDIC in 1989, at a time when his 
father-in-law and his brother-in-law were suing Madison, and thus the FDIC, in 
separate cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC began its investigation of the Rose firm's potential conflicts of 
interest last December. The agency's report raised questions about whether Rose 
had disclosed to regulators the potential for conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC cleared the firm in part because the FDIC's own conflict of interest 
regulations covering attorneys handling cleanup work were not in effect at the 
time that Rose won the contract for the legal business.  
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans charged that the FDIC report could not be trusted because the 
investigation was handled by the agency's legal department, which had hired the 
Little Rock firm to do the legal work at Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development at the hearing Thursday, Altman acknowledged that he 
had met privately with White House officials three weeks ago to brief them on 
an aspect of the RTC's Whitewater investigation. He said the purpose of the 
meeting was to inform the White House about the RTC's options in view of the 
impending expiration of statutes of limitation on civil lawsuits involving 
Whitewater- and Madison Guaranty-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans raised the question of whether the meeting was improper, 
given his role as acting chairman of the RTC, which is supposed to be an 
independent regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was solely to be sure that (White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum) 
understood the legal and procedural framework," Altman told the committee. He 
said he felt a briefing was justified because he had been giving such 
information to inquiring members of Congress.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PLAN SENDS RIGHT MESSAGE TO BUSINESS; ECONOMY: MAYOR'S PROPOSAL 
COULD HELP CITY'S IMAGE. BUT SOME SAY IT OVERLOOKS KEY ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's billed as a "Blueprint for Economic Vitality." 
</P>
<P>
 But however it improves things, the proposal by Mayor Richard Riordan's 
blue-ribbon panel of business experts to revamp the city's fiscal structure 
won't go far in revitalizing the economy of this recession-weary, 
earthquake-rocked region, economists and executives say. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, the program -- if adopted -- will burnish the image of the city, 
sending a message that Los Angeles is willing to take steps to lessen crime, 
repair badly neglected streets and improve the efficiency of the bureaucracy -- 
all issues for businesses that have left town. 
</P>
<P>
 What it won't do is address the primary concerns of businesses that have fled 
California, as identified by recent surveys: high labor, health care and land 
costs; onerous regulations, permitting and taxes. Overhauling the city's 
permitting and fee structure is the bailiwick of another mayoral task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will the proposal reverse the economic forces that have put Los Angeles in 
the longest recession since the Depression of the 1930s: cuts in federal 
defense spending, the collapse of the real estate market, and the prolonged 
drop in construction. Indeed, it's unreasonable to expect a city government to 
overcome such forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael E. Tennenbaum, senior managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co. and 
chairman of the mayor's Special Advisory Committee on Fiscal Administration, 
admits that his committee's proposals won't reverse job losses attributable to 
such big economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said at a City Hall news conference Thursday: "Dramatic 
action now is needed to keep our world-class city from becoming second class. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep postponing . . . expenses, Los Angeles will become very 
undesirable as a place to live," he added. "Many many more jobs will be lost. 
Both private industry and local government will suffer. . . . If services keep 
dropping and taxes and costs keep going up, we're going to become another New 
York City." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the special committee unveiled its proposals to squeeze more 
revenue out of the city's fiscal structure and use it for initiatives to 
improve public service, hire police and repair infrastructure. The intention is 
to improve the city's economic competitiveness relative to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommends the creation of a $5-million annual program of 
tax abatements and other incentives to retain businesses in Los Angeles and 
attract new ones, said William Ouchi, a UCLA management professor and Riordan 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force advises holding the line on city taxes and lowering the 
Department of Water and Power's rates for industrial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as they go, the initiatives win favorable reviews as economic 
development aids. "They sound like modest, constructive things to do -- but 
they're not overwhelming changes," said David Hensley, a regional economist 
with Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 According to surveys of businesses, concern about crime and infrastructure 
rank down the scale of problems below taxes, labor costs and workers' 
compensation insurance premiums. But they are not insignificant concerns to 
many businesses. In particular, crime -- and the fear of it -- is emerging as a 
hot economic issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Archie Defterios, co-owner of Delta Floral Distributors in South-Central Los 
Angeles, says crime is the principal reason he is considering moving his 
70-employee business out of the area. Thieves regularly steal wooden pallets 
from his yard, vandals break the windows of his trucks and job candidates 
sometimes balk at coming to work for him once they see the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Private security guards and other crime prevention measures add $7,000 to 
$8,000 a month to his costs of doing business, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding more police, as the mayor has promised, would help. Now, Defterios 
says, "you call the Police Department, they don't show up. . . . They tell us 
they've got their hands full." 
</P>
<P>
 But a larger police force might not be enough to keep him at his present 
location, he added: "Maybe it's not enough to hire more police. But I don't 
know what else is required." 
</P>
<P>
 No city action would have been enough to keep Transamerica Life Co.'s 
500-employee insurance administrative operations in Downtown Los Angeles, 
spokeswoman Debra Newton said. The unit is in the process of moving to Kansas 
City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was economics," Newton said. "We can reduce expenses: The cost of living 
is cheaper in Kansas City, and labor costs are cheaper. . . . We face national 
competition from life insurers located in smaller cities, where the cost of 
doing business is lower." 
</P>
<P>
 Because school districts are governed by independent boards and financed 
primarily through the state, there is also little the city government can do to 
improve schools -- one of the major complaints by businesses, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Los Angeles does, it should not make economic development choices 
that conflict with those of other cities in the region, cautions Stephen Levy, 
director and senior economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important point is that business people make decisions to locate in 
the region, not in the city," he said. "So you want to be careful that what the 
city does aids in the regional effort and is not just focused on whether they 
locate in Riverside, Orange County or L.A. If you're merely shifting people 
around the region, it's just a zero-sum game."

BOND DEADLINE NEAR, OFFICIAL WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller has warned the Legislature and Gov. Pete 
Wilson that time is running out to approve a $1.05-billion bond issue to help 
pay for Northridge earthquake repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislators must act soon, Miller said, if the bond measure backed by the 
governor is to be placed on the June primary election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 22 deadline has passed for including information about the pending 
bond act in the regular ballot pamphlet to be sent to voters. Miller said a 
description of the proposed bond issue will have to be included in a 
supplemental pamphlet to be printed and mailed at additional cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake repair bond issue must pass both houses by a two-thirds 
majority to qualify for the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has said he prefers bond financing for earthquake costs rather than 
increasing taxes to meet the state's share of quake repairs. For the federal 
share, Congress approved and President Clinton signed into law an $8.6-billion 
earthquake aid relief package. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also assigned numbers to six other measures that will be on the ballot 
in June. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 175 -- Would restore the renters income tax credit of $60 for 
individuals and $120 for married couples filing joint returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 176 -- Would make nonprofit organizations exempt from locally 
imposed business license taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 177 -- Would exempt business property improvements made to 
increase disabled access from local property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 178 -- Would provide a property tax break for the installation of 
water conservation equipment for agricultural purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 179 -- Would make a drive-by shooting murder conviction subject to 
a life imprisonment penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 180 -- Would provide $2 billion in bond funds for the acquisition 
and development of parklands, historic sites, wildlife areas and forest lands.

TAG FELONS' FACES, INITIATIVE BACKERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller on Thursday approved the circulation of 
petitions for a November ballot initiative that would require violent felons to 
wear identification numbers implanted on their faces when they are freed from 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman J. Bedford of Healdsburg, the author of the measure, must submit 
384,974 valid signatures of registered voters by July 22 to qualify the 
proposal for the fall ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other provisions of his measure would establish a 24-hour telephone number for 
citizens to obtain or provide information about identified offenders and would 
make it a misdemeanor to taunt or harass anyone who had a facial implant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford could not be reached Thursday for further information. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballot proposals considered extreme occasionally reach the stage of being 
cleared for petition circulation but rarely attract the large number of 
signatures required to place them on the ballot. In clearing a measure for 
signature gathering, the secretary of state collects a $200 filing fee from the 
proponent and obtains title and summary language from the attorney general, but 
takes no position on merits or constitutionality.

TESTING POSITIVE; JOHN LUCAS IS MAKING THE MOST OF HIS LATEST CHANCE, TURNING 
THE SAN ANTONIO SPURS INTO UNUSUAL WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One still flies over the cuckoo's nest. Appropriately enough, it's John Lucas, 
coach of a wacky crew called the San Antonio Spurs and a man whose whole life 
was a warm-up for the assignment, even if he didn't realize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Lucas finds himself in charge of 12 young men, some of them with almost 
as many problems as he had, no two of them alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out this roster: 
</P>
<P>
 C -- David Robinson, a born-again Christian who participated, with A.C. Green, 
in an athletes' campaign for sexual abstinence. Robinson once asked then-coach 
Larry Brown after a timeout in a close game if it had really been necessary for 
him to curse. 
</P>
<P>
 F -- Dennis Rodman, a born-again outlaw who has dyed his hair blond, burgundy, 
red, blue and blond this season. Rodman doesn't talk to teammates, comes late 
to practices and games and often skips shootarounds on the theory he isn't 
going to shoot, anyway. He proved it by taking 38 shots in January. 
</P>
<P>
 F/G -- Lloyd Daniels, a New York prep legend who became addicted to cocaine, 
tried to detox but lost his chance to play college ball when he was arrested at 
a crack house in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 G -- Dale Ellis, who left Seattle under a cloud that included several arrests 
for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the merely disappointing, J.R. Reid and Negele Knight; the 
aging, Terry Cummings, and the road warriors, Antoine Carr and Vinny Del Negro. 
The question was whether they belonged in the NBA or in group therapy, but it 
has been answered. After a 2-4 start, this experiment in group dynamics went 
37-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little unusual?" Robinson asks, laughing. "It's a lot unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a collection of guys who really have to figure out how to play 
together, how to live together as a team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Surprisingly, we're pretty close. Dennis is a hard guy to get to know, he 
doesn't hang with anybody, but he's become a part of this team. When we're on 
the floor, I think everybody roots for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "'It's just a team of guys that like to do their own thing. Dale's kind of a 
loner a little bit. Negele is a little bit of a loner. Lloyd is . . . he just 
is different." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson laughs again, adding: "I try to hang out with everybody, but nobody 
wants to hang out with me." EVERYBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE HE'S SEEN 
</P>
<P>
 I believe in miracles. I am one. -- John Lucas Walk a mile in their shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas wore those same shoes his whole, star-crossed, highest-highs and 
lowest-lows life. 
</P>
<P>
 What did any of them ever know about the joy and seduction of stardom, the 
feeling of power and invulnerability, the fear that came in the night, the 
fall, the helplessness, the surrender, the shame -- where had they been that he 
hadn't been first and stayed longer? 
</P>
<P>
 His whole life was a setup. 
</P>
<P>
 His childhood looked like it had come out of a Golden Book. His father was a 
high school principal in Durham, N.C. His mother was a junior high assistant 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Luke lived to perform. He broke Pete Maravich's state scoring record and 
made the Junior Davis Cup team in tennis. He was an All-American at both sports 
at Maryland and the No. 1 choice in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years after entering the NBA, he dabbled in pro tennis, while also 
earning his master's degree in secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in my life was winner, runner-up and consolation," he once told 
Sports Illustrated's Jill Lieber. "I didn't know how to have fun. I never had a 
childhood. I still can't swim and I didn't ride a bike. The skills I was 
sharpest on were competition, drive and sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 He was effervescent, hard-driving, fast-talking, always the guy in charge. He 
partied hard, too; he drank and snorted. After a while, it wasn't something he 
did anymore, it was him. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, he had been with five teams and four detox programs. The 
cities whirled by: Houston, Oakland, Washington, San Antonio, back to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 He was out of control. He suffered from paranoid delusions. He was scared to 
shower and doused himself with cologne to hide the fact. He sweated so much at 
night, he slept on the cool tile floor in the bathroom. One morning, he awoke 
to find his 2-year-old son standing on him, trying to use the toilet. His 
6-year-old daughter caught him taking cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' wife used to lock him in, but one night in the spring of 1986, she 
forgot, and he ran away to get high. He awoke the next morning in downtown 
Houston wearing a suit, sunglasses and no shoes. The Rockets were practicing, 
but he couldn't make it. Instead, he got high again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets had him tested. When he came up positive, they released him. He 
was averaging 16 points and nine assists a game at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 That was March 13, 1986, when he hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too afraid to turn myself in, too afraid to ask for help, too afraid to 
stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really blessed. I didn't wake up saying my ambition is to become an 
alcoholic and a drug addict. My ambition in life was to become President of the 
United States. The greatest gift I've got is being an addict and an alcoholic. 
I found out who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 His life changed. He wasn't trying to become President anymore, or the best 
point guard in history, or the first NBA player to win Wimbledon. He was trying 
to get straight enough to hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Detox became his life. Speaking appearances led to active involvement in 
programs. Then he set up his own John Lucas Center with the help of a Houston 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 His NBA career ended in 1990 after a third tour of duty as a Rocket. Troubled 
or not, Lucas had that glow; even after he messed up, people would take him 
back if they had some assurance he could stay straight. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed the game, bought a team in the United States Basketball League, the 
Miami Tropics, and staffed it with players from his program like Roy Tarpley 
and Pearl Washington, so they could show they were back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While helping former San Antonio star George Gervin get sober, Lucas met Red 
McCombs, then owner of the Spurs and a recovering alcoholic himself. Years 
later, with the Jerry Tarkanian experiment foundering and Tark ripping the 
organization in the papers and acting in general as if he didn't need the job, 
McCombs thought of Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas says McCombs told him he would have to say yes or no right away. Lucas, 
happy with what he was doing, says he almost turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't resist, though. He took the job, pulled his rascals together and 
went 39-22 with a team that had started 10-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems remained. Lucas was the archetypal players' coach, but the Spurs were 
short of actual players. 
</P>
<P>
 So they traded Sean Elliott, one of the few who hadn't embraced the new 
program -- Elliott told friends he thought Lucas was a con guy -- for Rodman. A 
WALK ON THE WILD SIDE 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Rodman arrived in the NBA as a 25-year-old rookie, he was 
considered eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
 A late bloomer, he was small as a high school kid in Dallas, spurted later and 
got a basketball scholarship at Southeastern Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 He was desire personified. He became the greatest rebounder of his day, 
perhaps of any day. His 17.9 average this season is 30% ahead of the next man 
in the field. On a percentage-of-rebounds basis, his 18.6 average in 1991-92 
was better than Wilt Chamberlain's records. Even with the used-up Pistons, 
Rodman could tilt the arrow from losing to winning. With him last season, they 
were 36-26; without him 4-16. 
</P>
<P>
 The better he did, the more weird he became. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a fawn caught in society's headlights. He hid out after games, pedaling 
on an exercise bike for an hour or so after having just played 48 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 His marriage to a Sacramento model blew up. He mourned the departure of Chuck 
Daly as Detroit's coach and began absenting himself, forcing the Pistons to 
trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed up in San Antonio with his arms tattooed and his hair blond. 
Whatever he'd been doing, he didn't intend to stop. Whatever he was trying to 
escape, it was bigger than Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 What is he doing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Rodman says in the visitors' dressing room at the Forum, 
wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt, burgundy hair and a bemused expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to do. It's like I'm so tired of the traditional NBA standards. You 
have to do this. You have to do that. I'm tired. I'd rather just do my own 
thing and be the person I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He's been blowing up a lot. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "No, I haven't." Rodman says. "See, that's what people make a mistake in. I'm 
not blowing up. It's amazing how you perceive something when you see it. It's 
like, 'Oh hell, he just blew his cool.' I don't lose my cool. I'm just doing 
something that's showing my frustration, that's all. That's about it. Everybody 
blows off steam once in a while. I do it all the time. There may be something 
off the court I need to blow off on the court. That way I don't hurt nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he happy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm really making myself happy, 'cause I feel like my daughter is the 
most important thing to me. Nothing else really matters to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Is she still in Sacramento with his ex-wife? 
</P>
<P>
 "She's still in Sacramento. You read all these things -- 'Well, he can't see 
his kid, he's so disappointed, he's sad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 How often does he see her? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see her much at all. But I really don't bitch and complain about it. 
If I see her, fine. If I don't, there's nothing I can really do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 How long will he play? 
</P>
<P>
 "I could quit at the halfway point here. I don't give a damn. I don't care 
about the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's really close to Dennis Rodman. Everybody thinks that they know 
Dennis Rodman: 'Oh, I know him real well, we hung out and we had a great 
conversation.' 'What did he say?' 'Well, I really don't know. He's just a real 
wild guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who's his best friend on the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody. There's nobody in this room I'm best friends with. I'm friends with 
them, but I never get close with 'em, 'cause I won't. That's not my nature, you 
know. I care for everyone in this room, they're just like my brother. But I 
can't be best friends with them. I can't throw myself into this lullaby-type 
situation -- 'Well, OK, we all going to be together forever and ever.' But in 
my heart and my mind, they'll always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter clicks off his tape recorder, thanks Rodman and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman follows him to the door of the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think I'm crazy?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Put it this way: Who do you know who isn't? THE GREAT EXPERIMENT 
</P>
<P>
 How to make it work? 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs had a lot of guys who had to find their way back. Lucas knew the 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he says, "I felt what I was doing, working in my treatment center 
with my drug program, was a form of coaching, helping people through their 
pitfalls, trying to do what I term the simple ABCs of life: Accepting where 
they are, believing in who they are and something greater than themselves and 
then learning how to care about other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's so exciting to me about coaching, finding the hoops people are 
willing to jump through for their own success. Not for my success, not for the 
organization's success, but for their own success. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we acquired Dennis Rodman, I immediately put him in power. He and David 
Robinson, they empower our team. I had them take ownership and responsibility 
in where our team would go. And they've done a great job with that. I'm not the 
guy that gives this team the life that I used to be. They're feeding off each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there has been some give and take. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 2, Rodman was ejected from a game against the Lakers. He refused to 
leave, tore away from teammates and security personnel, threw a chair and was 
suspended by the NBA for a game. Without their best rebounder, the Spurs then 
lost to the Houston Rockets, who took two offensive rebounds, setting Vernon 
Maxwell up for the game-winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "After Dennis got suspended," Lucas said, "I stopped practice with 30 minutes 
to go and I said, 'I want a commitment that once you get thrown out of a game 
-- 'cause I know you're going to get thrown out again -- that you'll leave the 
floor. We don't want a repercussion that causes us to lose the next game. Now I 
got 30 minutes, you got to promise me that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rodman) says, 'I can't promise you that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I sat down on the floor. I said, 'Y'all might as well take a seat 
'cause I'm going to wait.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So all the guys are going, 'C'mon, man! C'mon, you know he's going to wait!' 
</P>
<P>
 "And then at the end, Dennis says, 'All right, I promise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman reformed completely, for a week. With the Spurs coasting to a victory 
at the Forum, Rodman began playing around, taking a late rebound and just 
walking off with it until the referees called traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Lucas said they couldn't stand for that, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue continues to this day, a work in progress, a flight of cuckoos 
soaring across the sky, looking for 12 salvations and an NBA title, getting 
warmer all the time.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; LEADING FIGURES COLLIDE; SKATING: BAIUL 
NEEDS STITCHES IN SHIN, SZEWCZENKO BRUISED AFTER CRASH IN PRACTICE. KERRIGAN IN 
CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed like a normal figure skating practice, the first in more than a week 
for Nancy Kerrigan. She was on the ice Thursday inside the Olympic 
Amphitheatre, rehearsing with the other medal contenders for tonight's decisive 
freestyle program in the Winter Olympic women's competition, and Tonya Harding 
was not present, having been relegated into a group of also-rans. 
</P>
<P>
 But although one Tonya had at least temporarily moved out of figure skating's 
epicenter, another was about to move into it. When she did, Tanja Szewczenko of 
Germany collided with Oksana Baiul of Ukraine, casting doubt on whether they 
will be able to perform at their best to-night, if at all. Baiul, con-sidered 
one of only three women with a chance to win the gold medal, appeared to be 
more severely injured. The 16-year-old world champion, who was second to 
Kerrigan after Wednesday night's technical program, needed three stitches to 
close a two-inch long, half-inch deep cut on her right shin, and also reported 
shoulder and lower back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old Szewczenko, a surprising fifth after the technical program in 
her big-time debut, had the wind knocked out of her and suffered a bruised 
right hip and right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were helped to their feet by two-time gold medalist Katarina Witt of 
Germany. Baiul remained on the ice for a few moments before discovering that 
her shin was bleeding and then departing to seek treatment. Szewczenko left 
immediately, returned nine minutes later, and then quit again because of an 
upset stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Salim Al-Bazaz, a German team physician who examined both women in the 
athletes' village Thursday night, said they will be evaluated again after a 
practice this morning. He predicted that they will have even more soreness when 
they return to the rink than when they left Thursday afternoon, but he was 
optimistic that they will be able to skate their four-minute freestyle programs 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see tomorrow," said 1992 men's gold medalist Viktor Petrenko, who 
trains with Baiul in Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehearsing her freestyle program to a medley of Neil Diamond music, Kerrigan 
was so intent that she did not even pause when the collision occurred less than 
20 feet from where she was skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul and Szewczenko were moving backward at full speed to set up triple jumps 
when they realized they were in each other's path. They each turned around and 
made a move to avoid an accident, but rotated in the same direction and hit 
head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kerrigan approached her coaches, Evy and Mary Scotvold, afterward, she 
told them she did not see the accident but heard it. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about it later by reporters, Kerrigan said: "Scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though practice sessions at major competitions involve six women who are 
not particularly familiar with each other's speed and routines skating at the 
same time, collisions are infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent such accident in a major competition involved Japan's Midori 
Ito and France's Laetitia Hubert during the warm-up for the technical program 
in the 1991 World Championships at Munich. Ito, the favorite, was so shaken 
that she stumbled over the sideboard after a triple jump in her technical 
program and never fully recovered, finishing fourth after the freestyle 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the year Kerrigan ascended to the victory stand at the international 
level, finishing third behind U.S. teammates Kristi Yamaguchi and Harding. One 
year later, in the 1992 Winter Olympics at Albertville, France, Kerrigan won 
the bronze medal behind Yamaguchi and Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., is poised to become the gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 She seemed relieved Thursday that the focus was on skaters other than herself 
and Harding for the first time in seven weeks. When she returned to practice 
two weeks after sustaining injuries in a Jan. 6 assault, reporters and 
photographers camped outside the Cape Cod rink where she trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage was even more intense here, especially after she and Harding 
began practicing in the same group for the week leading up to Wednesday's 
technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, however, the 24 skaters remaining in the competition were 
separated into groups based on their standings, and Harding, who is in 10th 
place, practiced earlier Thursday. Harding, as usual, skated her freestyle 
program in bits and pieces. She will perform to music from "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Kerrigan performed her freestyle program as flawlessly as she had her 
technical program the night before, when she won first-place marks from seven 
of nine judges. The other two judges preferred Baiul, while France's Surya 
Bonaly was in third place. 
</P>
<P>
 That was their order after the technical program in the 1993 World 
Championships at Prague. But Kerrigan, as has often happened in the past, 
folded in the freestyle program, landing only two triple jumps, and finished 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to die," Kerrigan told her coaches afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative, they suggested that she see a sports psychologist to help 
her overcome her nerves. The Scotvolds believe that was the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, she would lose her focus and wonder what was going on," Evy Scotvold 
said Thursday. "Now, she just digs in and keeps on going. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very confident in her freestyle program. For her, Friday is easier than 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 If she wins the freestyle program, which counts toward two-thirds of the final 
score, she will win the gold medal. But the same is true for Baiul or Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>

MIKE DOWNEY: LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; TURNER GETS GOLD, BUT NOT 
HANDSHAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As if ice skating needed more mayhem, America's Cathy Turner was mortified 
after winning the women's 500 meters in Olympic short-track speedskating 
Thursday night when the silver medalist from China refused to shake her hand 
while Chinese team leaders formally protested that Turner should give back the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also called "the dirtiest skater in skating" by a Canadian opponent after a 
preliminary race, Turner, 31, of Rochester, N.Y., was accused of fouling world 
record-holder Yanmei Zhang in the final. An unsmiling Zhang refused to 
acknowledge Turner on the victory stand, removed her silver medal as soon as 
she stepped down and dropped her floral bouquet on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later if Turner was a dirty skater, Zhang, 21, listened to a 
translator's interpretation of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes! Yes!" she said in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The translator said: "She absolutely agrees." 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Xiu Cheng Li, the Chinese team leader, made a long speech in which he 
claimed that after complaining to officials, then paying a fee to file a formal 
protest to have Turner's victory overturned, he was repeatedly ignored. Xiu 
said: "We are very, very upset. The American skater very obviously pushed our 
skater. She, Cathy Turner, should not be given the gold medal, and we strongly 
require a fair judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was shaken at first, then defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not taking my medal away," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody will. A Lillehammer Olympic official interrupted Turner at that point 
to say: "We have asked the referees for a statement and they have said there is 
no statement to be made. Ms. Turner's victory stands." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Turner thrust up both fists. 
</P>
<P>
 Her triumph, in the Olympic-record time of 45.98 seconds, gave consecutive 
gold medals to the colorful Turner -- she's a former lounge singer who once 
wrote a song called "Kinky, Sexy Tomboy" -- in this young but already chaotic 
sport. When short-track skating premiered in 1992, Zhang was disqualified in 
the first heat, and Turner collided in the next with Sylvie Daigle of Canada, 
who vilified Turner's methods afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Turner clicked skates in a preliminary with Canada's Nathalie 
Lambert, nearly causing both to wipe out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert lambasted her, not only calling Turner the dirtiest skater in skating 
but adding: "I hope she gets what she deserves -- something bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Were this a curse, then a three-skater pileup involving Turner in the 
semifinal appeared to be Lambert's revenge. Turner and two others went 
sprawling, and the accident could have been the American's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was Isabelle Charest of Canada who was disqualified. Of the four 
women in this heat, three, including Turner, were permitted to start over. 
Turner won the rerun to advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 There, trailing in the 4 1/2-lap race after three times around, Turner drifted 
outside like a race car, then dive-bombed toward the inside in what has been 
called her "kamikaze technique." She appeared to place a hand against Zhang's 
right shin as she passed her into first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang skated to all corners of the arena after the race, raising her right leg 
and pointing to the spot where Turner touched her. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said adamantly: "How could I have reached out and grabbed her when I 
was in front of her? I went in front of her and put my hand down. Maybe I hit 
her leg when I put my hand down on the ice, but I don't see how I could have 
reached out and grabbed her." 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the hubbub was a bronze medal for America's Amy Peterson, who also 
took a bronze with Turner here a few days ago in a relay event that ended with 
similar cries of outrage. In that one, China was disqualified from third place 
when a skater obstructed Nikki Ziegelmeyer, causing a crash. The American women 
learned 15 minutes after the race that they had been moved up to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner doesn't know how much wilder things can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a minute there, I was saying, 'I just want to go home,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering her news conference, a happier Turner was intercepted by a team 
official who warned her about what was being said by the Chinese, who were 
still in the room. Turner turned around and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her translator, an angry Zhang was saying: "I think a skater should 
use two legs, not three legs." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she and Turner traded places, Turner's first words were: "I'm a 
little scared right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked, "Of what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they're talking about taking away my medals. Then outside, (she) 
wouldn't even shake my hand or anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then the Canadian men were giving me the dirty looks before the final 
race, trying to intimidate me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do anything wrong. Those girls are always elbowing me and everybody 
else in the gut. I would never do that. And what was I supposed to say to 
Nathalie (Lambert), 'OK, Nathalie, you can go on ahead of me?' I am not about 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a dirty skater. I won, and I know I won, and I'm glad I won, and as 
far as I'm concerned, that's that."

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; ANALYSIS; TAYLOR NEVER LIT FLAME FOR U.S. 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What does it say, when the caliber of play in the Olympic hockey tournament is 
at an all-time low, and the competition more even, that the U.S. team has 
slipped from fourth place two years ago to no higher than seventh here? That an 
American team has not won a medal since 1980, its longest drought in Olympic 
competition? 
</P>
<P>
 It says that the United States, even though it is producing more skillful 
players than ever, still can't match the deep talent pools available to Russia, 
Sweden, Canada and Finland. And it says there's something lacking at the 
coaching level, too. 
</P>
<P>
 From Lou Vairo, who could barely stand on skates when he misled the 1984 team 
to a seventh-place finish at Sarajevo, through the rude defensiveness of Dave 
Peterson in 1988 and 1992 to Tim Taylor, who was incapable of moderating his 
team's emotional temperament, U.S. coaches have failed at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not even the most brilliant strategist could have compensated for all 
the talent lost to the NHL, and maybe the skill just isn't there on defense. 
But the shortcomings behind the bench made a difficult situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor is intelligent, articulate, loyal to his players and idealistic. Maybe 
too idealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 When Canada's offense proved punchless in pre-Olympic play, Coach Tom Renney 
sifted through half a dozen players until he found a mix that produced goals 
and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Finland added nine new players after a 6-2 loss to the United States at the 
Izvestia tournament two months ago and crushed the U.S. here, where it 
mattered, 6-1. Russia sifted through two teams before compiling a squad that's 
in the tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware all along that his team was young and impetuous and might react badly 
under Olympic pressure, Taylor still made only two late changes. The addition 
of forwards Ted Drury and Peter Ciavaglia was planned well in advance, but in 
Drury's case, it didn't help the team's maturity or add the on-ice leadership. 
The team never improved, never peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, Taylor was limited by his meager resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has to take responsibility for not being able to read or change his 
team's personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The players took their emotional cues from him. And Taylor stood there, 
barking commands without expression, arms folded across his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 1-0 lead over a good Swedish team in their fourth 
preliminary-round game, the U.S. players should have been flying. When they 
went flat instead, Taylor did nothing to rekindle the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 And his assistant, John Cunniff, also a clever strategist but as emotionless 
as Taylor, kept his hands in his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The players lost their edge -- and the game. 
</P>
<P>
 This team began dropping out of medal contention in its opener, when it 
couldn't hold leads of 1-0 and 2-1 over a bumbling French team and needed a 
late, two-goal rally to pull out a tie. Rallies against Slovakia and Canada 
continued to deplete the emotional resources of the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (France) was the key game," Ciavaglia said. "Instead of getting a big 
win and starting off in a confident way, it got us off balance and kept us off 
balance a little bit. The whole tournament, with the exception of the one game 
against Italy (a 7-1 victory), never went the way we had diagramed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor didn't do enough to turn the tide of undisciplined play, although the 
players' lack of self-control might have been one reason they were available to 
the Olympic team and not in the NHL. But the suspicion lingers that he simply 
didn't make the most of what he had, and that's the real pity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 5-3 loss to the Czech Republic on Thursday night, which means the 
United States can finish no better than seventh, Dave Ogrean, the executive 
director of USA Hockey -- the sport's national governing body -- said the 
organization does not fault Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there should be any second-guessing, and there certainly is no 
second-guessing internally," Ogrean said.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; THE CASE OF THE 'STOLEN' RUNNERS; BOBSLED: 
DESPITE CONTROVERSY, SHIMER WILL RENT ROSSELLI'S EQUIPMENT FOR FOUR-MAN RACES. 
</P>

<P>
 Dave Kurtz, an assistant U.S. bobsled coach and the team leader, calls it a 
farce "in the truest sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtz is also a lawyer, which seems appropriate, because U.S. drivers Brian 
Shimer and Jim Herberich won't have to look for one if they decide to sue 
fellow driver Bruce Rosselli for libel and defamation of character. Kurtz says 
they plan to do just that and he plans to join them in that suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, Shimer has agreed to rent Rosselli's runners -- the 
steel blades on which the bobsled rides -- for this weekend's four-man Olympic 
competition, even though: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rosselli has accused Shimer of theft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rosselli's runners didn't help their owner get through the U.S. trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this bizarre, or what?" Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a little complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with Rosselli's accusation that the U.S. bobsled federation 
conspired against him in the trials and that Shimer contributed to it by 
stealing runners that belonged to driver Chuck Leonowicz, who was not in the 
trials because he had not passed the physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli accused Shimer of giving the "stolen runners" to Herberich, who used 
them in qualifying for the U.S. team, along with Shimer and driver Randy Will. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, protesting that Herberich would not have beaten him without 
Leonowicz's runners, took the case to arbitration, where his conspiracy 
complaint was rejected. He then asked an Illinois state court to vacate that 
ruling, but was rejected again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli and attorney Bill Bock then sued in federal court, naming Shimer and 
seeking an injunction to prevent the U.S. team from participating here, but 
withdrew it just before the start of the Olympic two-man competition last 
weekend, when Bock and Rosselli arrived in Norway to pursue their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, they met with Ron Rowan, general counsel of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, then Wednesday breached what Rowan felt was the confidentiality of 
that meeting by distributing a statement saying the USOC had intervened to 
prevent use of the "stolen runners" here. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also said Rowan had confirmed that the federation was aware the 
"stolen runners" were being used in the trials, and that the USOC would seek 
Rosselli's advice in restructuring the bobsled selection process once the Games 
were over. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, the USOC's executive director, promptly responded with his 
own statement in which he mildly derided the Rosselli-Bock interpretation of 
their conversation with Rowan and said the USOC had taken no position on the 
ownership dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtz, disappointed with Schiller's response, was more vocal. He gave Rosselli 
and Bock 12 hours to withdraw allegations made in the statement they had 
distributed to the media, a deadline that passed here this morning without 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tolerated the insanity of these criminal allegations far too long and 
are now prepared to do what we have to do," Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Rosselli, "Everything we've explained is the truth. I'm not worried 
about (a suit)." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegedly stolen runners will not be used this weekend, although Kurtz 
said that Shimer and Leonowicz have indeed made an agreement on their use, if 
needed, and that the USOC has not and will not prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Shimer will use Rosselli's runners, the sled designers believing they 
best suit the conditions of the Olympic course, Kurtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herberich is not involved in this weekend's races because he was beaten by 
Shimer and Will in a race-off for the two U.S. berths in four-man. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosselli, who has failed in three attempts to make the U.S. Olympic team, will 
rent his runners for about $300, Kurtz said, suggesting that paying it is like 
giving the devil his due.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; NOTEBOOK; BLAIR'S GOAL-SETTING IS THE 
'USUAL' SECRET TO GOLDEN SUCCESS

<P>
 On the day after she became the most decorated U.S. woman Olympian, with five 
gold medals and six medals overall, speedskater Bonnie Blair was asked if there 
were unexplored secrets to her success. 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed, shook her head and said, "Just the usual." 
</P>
<P>
 The usual, she said, included an easy grasp of technique, a willingness to pay 
the price in training and a consistent mental approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the competition or what the training, I've always tried to 
find a goal and better it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to the line (in the 1,000 meters), I heard the announcer say I held the 
track record (established in December) and I was determined to beat it (and 
did). You have to have a goal or you're not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair will compete through the World Championships in Milwaukee next February. 
She will stay in Europe after the Olympics for World Cup races in Germany and 
Holland, but her next major goal is a subsequent meet in Calgary, where she 
will attempt to break her 500-meter world record of 39.1, set in the 1988 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking to get in the 38s," she said. "The Calgary ice is very 
fast. I think I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said the realization that the 1,000 was her last Olympic race hit her 
hardest on the victory stand when it came to her that she would never hear the 
national anthem again in the same context. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an emotional moment and very, very difficult," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair wore her two most recently earned gold medals for photographers 
Thursday. Two of her other Olympic medals are in a vault in Champaign, Ill., 
and the two others are in a vault in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some day I hope to be able to insure them and display them safely," she said. 
"There is something to be said for looking at them and holding them." ROSS

<P>
 It really doesn't take long for an American to start feeling at home here. For 
all of its Nordic differences, Norway comes off as a very Americanized country. 
</P>
<P>
 The English spoken here by nearly everyone is much closer to American than 
British, and although all of the national and regional Norwegian foods are 
served proudly, anyone with a homesick palate can indulge it with little or no 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot dogs are available at concession stands at the Olympic venues and at 
street stands in town, there are several nearby pizza joints -- one even 
delivers -- and casual restaurants all over the place advertise "American 
hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you don't quite trust that advertising, you can always head for the 
golden arches. 
</P>
<P>
 Right, if you deserve a break today, there's a McDonald's in Lillehammer. It 
has a gleaming copper roof, has been open for two months and is doing a booming 
business. In fact, there's a tent annex to handle the overflow Olympic crowds, 
complete with TV set tuned to one of the Olympic channels. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the meny shows most of the things Americans are used to -- Big Macs, 
Quarter Pounders, Quarter Pounders med ost -- right, that's with cheese -- 
Cokes, fries, even a salat.  
</P>
<P>
 And everything tastes just the way it does at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," says a supervisor. "It's the same all around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one concession to Norwegian tastes. There's the traditional 
Filet o' Fish sandwich just the same as the one offered in the States, but for 
NOK 26,50, as they say -- that's $3.60 American -- you can get a Norsk McLaks, 
or for 44,50 a Norsk McLaks Meny, or Value Meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Norsk McLaks? It's a salmon sandwich. Yup, the Norwegians have found yet 
another way to serve salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not something to make a gourmet drool, but for fast food, it's not bad. 
In fact, with fries and a Coke, it's pretty good. As it says on the meny , 100% 
cleaned and bone-free Norwegian salmon served on a bun with shredded lettuce, 
cucumber slices and dill dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing you know, McDonald's Norge will be sending people off to Laks U.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; THE ONES TO WATCH TONIGHT; FIGURE SKATING: 
KERRIGAN GOES EARLY, AND SHE SHOULD SET THE TONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If all the contenders in the women's figure skating competition perform their 
freestyle programs without significant errors tonight, who will win the gold 
medal? 
</P>
<P>
 That is a question nine judges will decide, no doubt after some disagreement, 
because figure skating is perhaps the most subjective of all Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the freestyle program, which accounts for two-thirds of the final score, 
judges award marks for technical merit and artistic impression. The winner 
usually is the one who best combines those elements in her four-minute routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two women's gold medalists, Germany's Katarina Witt in 1984 and 1988 
and the United States' Kristi Yamaguchi in 1992, are examples of all-around 
skaters preferred by the judges. Nancy Kerrigan is the woman in this year's 
competition whose style most closely resembles theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief analysis of the leading medal contenders' freestyle programs: NANCY 
KERRIGAN, 24 
</P>
<P>
 United States 
</P>
<P>
 In first place after the technical program, she has prepared a challenging 
freestyle program skated to a medley of Neil Diamond music. She plans six 
triple jumps, including two in combination. 
</P>
<P>
 But her jumps have been inconsistent in the past, and skating second in the 
last group of six women, she might opt for a more conservative approach. If she 
decreases the difficulty of her program and performs it cleanly, maintaining 
her usually high marks for artistic impression, it will cost her for technical 
merit but might put more pressure on those who follow. OKSANA BAIUL, 16 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine 
</P>
<P>
 The most gifted skater to come along artistically in decades, she can perform 
to "Ave Maria" and Michael Jackson and sell both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has only five triple jumps in her program and has been practicing 
four. When she chooses to do her triple salchow-double toe combination, she 
often misses. So she sometimes downsizes it to two double jumps. But her 
high-energy program to Broadway show tunes is bound to earn exceptional marks 
for artistic impression, and if the others cannot do their tricks, she will 
win. SURYA BONALY, 20 
</P>
<P>
 France 
</P>
<P>
 The four-time European champion, who placed third in the technical program, 
has the most demanding freestyle program with seven triple jumps planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kerrigan, she does two of them in combination. Her combination, however, 
is more difficult than Kerrigan's. And skating next-to-last in the last group, 
she can pump it up another notch if she feels she needs it. 
</P>
<P>
 But although she has improved artistically, as she is ready to show in her 
program to Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," she still sometimes bounces like the 
former gymnast that she is, instead of stroking the ice. CHEN LU, 17 
</P>
<P>
 China 
</P>
<P>
 She has to skate well and hope for significant mistakes by the three women 
ahead of her to rise from fourth place to win the gold medal. Her program is 
worthy technically, with seven triple jumps planned, although she has been 
practicing no true combinations. When she was required to do one in the 
technical program, she collided with the sideboard in a corner of the rink and 
almost lost her composure. 
</P>
<P>
 Her music, from the movie, "The Mission," suits her melancholy style. Some 
call it lifeless, but she is still learning. KATARINA WITT, 28 
</P>
<P>
 Germany 
</P>
<P>
 A program that was technically good enough, barely, six years ago to win her a 
second gold medal is no longer sufficient because of the gains women have made 
in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 She has places for five triple jumps but might do no more than three. She, 
however, made it to sixth place with an inferior technical program that she 
skated superbly, and she could climb even higher if she performs as flawlessly 
in her freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 As a memorial to Sarajevo, where she won her first gold medal in 1984, she 
will skate to Pete Seeger's anti-war song, "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" 
The last of the competitors to go on, she is guaranteed to bring down the house 
in the Olympic Amphitheatre.

 Things were getting a little slow in Mr. Robinson's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson had begun blending in, to a fault. People said he was too 
religious or suburban to relate to his teammates.One of his old coaches said he 
didn't really like the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend ended when John Lucas became the Spur coach and reminded Robinson 
it's not just a job, it's an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas let Robinson do it his way, dropping the constant injunction that he set 
up in the pivot. Now Robinson starts on the wing, where his quickness enables 
him to beat opponents into the lane. He's having a career year; at 28.5 points, 
his scoring average is up more than four points over last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent game, Robinson posted the first quadruple-double in four years -- 
34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 blocks -- and in another, he scored 50 
points, the season's top total. He has taken over from the Houston Rockets' 
Hakeem Olajuwon as the MVP front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson says of Lucas: "He's an incredible motivator of people. He gets guys 
to do more than they even think they can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I know pretty much what I'm capable of. I've always been thinking 
about, 'Hey, how do I make this team better, how do I get this team to win?' 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things he's focused in on is, 'Hey, you're the best player in the 
league, act like it. I want your numbers to reflect it and I want everybody 
else to think you're the best player in the league.' I never really cared if 
anybody thought I was the best player." MARK HEISLER

KEMPTON HAS YET TO CLICK; COLLEGE BASEBALL: CSUN PITCHER STILL LOOKING FOR FORM 
OF A YEAR AGO AS MATADORS BEGIN PLAY IN FOUR-TEAM TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

 His picture is on the front of the Cal State Northridge baseball pocket 
schedule. A different photo of him graces a Matador refrigerator magnet. A 
third shot features him on the team media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, senior right-hander Keven Kempton was expected to be the 
Northridge front man this season. So far, he has felt more like the caboose. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the three aforementioned live-action photos, Kempton wears a look 
of grim determination. Lately, his performances have been grim. Say cheese for 
the camera? Happy, he isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should I be?" he said. "(My performance is) not even close to what it ought 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He's the cover boy who's been driven for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton will be tested again this weekend when the Matadors (4-6) open play in 
the inaugural Gator Slug-Fest, a four-team, round-robin tournament at the 
University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In three 1994 starts, Kempton is 0-2 with an unsightly earned-run average of 
7.43. This after a 10-4 record and ERA of 3.99 last season, including a 4-2 
record against nationally ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is more perplexed than the pitcher himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," he said. "It's baffling." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play today against sixth-ranked Oklahoma State (6-1), then 
faces No. 22 Florida (9-1) on Saturday and No. 16 Ohio State (0-0) in a 
doubleheader Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton is expected to start against Florida, which routinely plays before 
crowds of 4,000 -- or about one ticket holder for each nagging voice in 
Kempton's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of possible explanations for his slow start have crossed his mind. 
Kempton, 23, said his velocity sometimes has varied considerably from inning to 
inning. He had his arm poked and prodded by a doctor. Everything checked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I too old?" he said. "What do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors have given Kempton ample run support. In his three starts, 
Northridge has scored 18 runs, more than enough by the pitcher's reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five runs should never beat me," he said. "Never. Five runs should be a walk 
in the park." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, he's walked the park. In 23 innings, he has walked 11 and allowed 29 
hits, an average of 1.74 baserunners an inning. Opponents have banged out eight 
extra-base hits and are batting a cumulative .299. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Kempton was a different man altogether. In Western Athletic 
Conference West Division play, he ranked fifth in fewest walks per nine innings 
(2.36), sixth in opposition batting average (.272) and eighth in fewest hits 
(9.89) per nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the rest of the Matador staff -- which was expected to carry the 
team this season -- has been generous as well. The Matadors have a cumulative 
ERA of 5.92. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Marco Contreras (1-2, 4.15 ERA) will start today's game 
against Oklahoma State. Sophomore right-hander Jason Bell (2-0), who has not 
allowed an earned run in 11 innings, is expected to start for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras turned in the Matadors' best outing of the season Saturday when he 
lost, 1-0, to third-ranked Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The unranked Matadors, who have played three consecutive games against 
nationally ranked competition, appear to be the tournament underdogs. Oklahoma 
State enters play today with a batting average of .316, 10 home runs, 14 stolen 
bases and an ERA of 2.90. Florida is batting .323 with 11 homers, 16 stolen 
bases and an ERA of 2.47. Ohio State will be playing for the first time today 
against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are batting .257 with five homers and six stolen bases. Freshman 
designated hitter Eric Gillespie, who is batting .300, has six of the team's 19 
extra-base hits and leads the team with 10 runs batted in.

CUBAN BALLPLAYERS QUIT MISSION TO EXPLORE PROFESSIONAL CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They didn't hang around long enough for even a cup of coffee, the Cuban kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week after joining the Mission College baseball team, two Cuban 
defectors who played on various national teams from the Caribbean island have 
left the squad to explore professional opportunities with major league 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a whirlwind," said John Klitsner, the Free Spirit coach. "I think they 
have something in the making about getting into professional baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The two players, left-handed pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez and left-handed 
outfielder-first baseman Luis Alvarez, played in only a few games for Mission 
but apparently impressed major league scouts, even after being virtually out of 
action since defecting in Curacao last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (6-feet-3, 220 pounds) got off to a flying start with Mission on Feb. 
15 with two home runs in a 7-3 nonconference victory over Pasadena City. 
Fernandez (6-1, 190) worked four innings and gave up two unearned runs in his 
only start, a 4-2 nonconference loss at Harbor the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubans, whom Klitsner said were "way better than the typical junior 
college ballplayer," had strengthened a solid Free Spirit team that is 8-3 and 
3-0 in the Southern California Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Klitsner said Fernandez and Alvarez decided to leave this week, partly in 
an attempt to sign with a professional team and partly because they found the 
$1,890 out-of-state tuition to attend Mission too steep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids really liked them and I liked them," Klitsner said. "There might 
have been a little resentment from some of our kids at first who thought these 
two guys were taking their spots, but we decided we were going to give them the 
chance they came to America for. That might sound corny, but that's how we 
felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Klitsner said he wasn't bothered by the Cubans' quick departure and is glad he 
was able to work with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel (betrayed) at all," Klitsner said. "We all knew they were here 
(in the United States) to play professional baseball. . . . We feel good about 
what we did."

BASEBALL; DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; KARROS GETS THREE-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ and MARYANN HUDSON

<P>
 In another indication of the Dodgers' commitment to youth, Eric Karros agreed 
to a three-year contract worth $6.15 million Thursday night in Vero Beach, Fla. 
Karros, who will be playing his third season as the team's first baseman, will 
make $650,000 this season, $2.35 million in 1995 and $3.15 million in 1996. As 
part of the contract, Karros is funding a full baseball scholarship at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited about it," Karros said. "I don't have to worry about my 
contract coming in each spring and, more importantly, it shows the direction 
the club is going with younger players." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had never offered a multi-year contract to a player with less than 
three years of service time until earlier this month, when they signed Mike 
Piazza to a three-year, $4.2 million contract. Fred Claire, Dodger executive 
vice president, said that besides being able to buy out two years of 
arbitration -- players are eligible after three years -- the club is sending a 
message to their younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows a commitment to the young players on this team that if they step 
forward and do the job, they will be rewarded," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, 26, struggled some last season, but hit 12 home runs the last two 
months to finish with 23 homers, 80 runs batted in and a .247 average. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman took a pitch on his left foot in the batting cage Thursday, and 
laughed about it later in the clubhouse at Vero Beach. Offerman, who will begin 
his third season as the Dodgers' shortstop, has been smiling a lot this spring, 
joking with teammates and feeling more comfortable than in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, he bulked up through a weightlifting program, increasing 
his weight 25 pounds to 190. But another noticeable change in Offerman this 
spring is his willingness to talk to the media and discuss his defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first year I have really lifted, and I feel good," Offerman said. 
"I played winter ball again for a while and I played real well, (my defense) is 
a lot better than last year. I think my experience has helped me play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman, whose errors at shortstop have made him the target of relentless 
criticism, said he worked hard on throwing during the winter. "I am throwing 
better, that was one of the points I had to work on and I really feel better 
about it right now," he said. "I think my experience has made me feel more 
confident." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Right-handed pitcher Greg Hansell's locker was moved into the corner next to 
that of Piazza's -- the two are good friends -- but it's still on what he calls 
"Death Row," where lockers for the rookies on the 40-man roster are placed. 
Hansell, from Kennedy High in La Palma, made some minor adjustments in winter 
ball while working with Luis Tiant and Joe Ferguson, and compiled a 4-3 record 
with a 2.19 earned-run average. . . . Dodger scout Gail Henley has been named 
the 1993 recipient of the Milton Richman Memorial Award by the Assn. of 
Professional Baseball Players of America, a group that helps former players who 
have fallen on hard times. The award is presented annually to honor those who 
have contributed to its success and have spread the good will of the 
association. . . . Sandy Koufax was a visitor at Dodgertown Thursday. . . . Tom 
Candiotti is helping to form the Knucklehead Club. Proceeds from the club will 
benefit the Orthopaedic Hospital in Los Angeles. . . . Park Chan Ho threw 
batting practice in the cages because the workout was rained out. "He threw 
hard -- the ball is lively with a fluid delivery," Dave Hansen said. MARYANN

FISCHER TAKES LEAP TO WISCONSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High, runner-up in the high jump in last year's 
state championships, has made a commitment to attend Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer took recruiting trips to Wisconsin, Indiana and Auburn before choosing 
the Badgers.He canceled trips to UCLA and Fresno State after making his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like everything about the school," Fischer said. "I like the facility, 
and I like (jumps coach Mark Napier). He's a great guy and he knows his stuff. 
. . . The Big Ten is a prestigious sports conference and I think it will be 
exciting to compete in it and be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A high-quality pre-med undergraduate program and the proximity if Madison, 
Wis., to Chicago -- where Fischer has relatives -- also influenced his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great school and it has everything I need," Fischer said. "I had those 
other two trips left, but I just said, 'Forget it.' I really like Wisconsin and 
that's where I want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 After raising his personal best to 6 feet 11 1/2 inches as a sophomore, 
Fischer became one of the most proficient high school jumpers in the nation 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He improved his personal best to 7-2 and cleared 7 feet or higher in 10 meets. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Southern Section Division I title, finished second in the state 
championships behind Jeff Nadeau of Monroe, and placed third in the USA Track & 
Field junior championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He is tied for fourth on the all-time region list in the high jump and the 
region record of 7-3 1/4 -- set by Lee Balkin of Glendale in 1979 -- seems well 
within his reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer is also a quality long jumper with a personal best of 22-1.

BASEBALL; DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LANGSTON SIGNS EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels signed All-Star starter Mark Langston to a three-year contract 
extension for $14 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, worked out during a 1 1/2-hour meeting between agent Arn Tellem 
and Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi at Tempe, Ariz., stipulates that Langston 
will be paid $5 million in 1995, $5 million in '96 and $4 million in '97. He 
also is eligible to earn $1 million in incentives in '97. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract not only prevents Langston from leaving as a free agent at the 
end of this season, it also significantly changes the perception of the Angels 
and their budgetary cutbacks. Perhaps they never again will spend freely in the 
free-agent marketplace, but they will pay to keep talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this sends a message to everyone on our club that they're just not 
going to let everyone go anymore," Langston said. "This is where I wanted to 
be, and they decided to keep me. I really want to see this thing through." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who signed a then-record five-year, $16-million contract after the 
1989 season, had no reason to believe he would remain with the Angels. Although 
he had a no-trade clause, he was told by then-club official Whitey Herzog last 
November to seek a contract with any team, and Herzog would work on making a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston discussed long-term contracts with the New York Yankees and the 
Chicago White Sox, but in his heart, he knew he wanted to pitch for the Angels. 
It was only after Herzog's resignation in January -- and the subsequent 
promotion of Bavasi -- that Langston knew he would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there hadn't been a change," Langston said, "I don't know if this is where 
I would have wanted to be. But that all changed when they made the moves in the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "To know I'll be here now for the next four years, that's a very comfortable 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Chili Davis, who said he was taking care of personal 
business, was the only no-show for the Angels' first full-squad workout. He is 
expected to arrive Saturday, three days before the reporting deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, holding a news conference for the Arizona media, had one request: 
"The first person that asks me about Michael Jordan, I'm kicking their . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is a friend of mine, and if you want to know something about Michael, 
go to Sarasota." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jackson still does not consider himself an everyday player, he 
expects to receive more playing time than last season, when he appeared in 85 
games and had 284 at-bats with the Chicago White Sox, batting .232 with 16 home 
runs and 45 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody came out and told me that I won't play more than I did last 
year," he said, "why would I want to keep playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels signed veteran Lee Guetterman to a triple-A contract after watching 
him work out for 20 minutes. Guetterman, 35, who was 3-3 with a 2.93 ERA in 40 
games last season with the St. Louis Cardinals, will be in camp today. He will 
earn $200,000 if he makes the opening-day roster. . . . Arthroscopic surgery 
has been scheduled March 3 for pitchers Paul Swingle and Colin Charland. BOB

BOGISON GOES AWOL FOR SHOT AT WEST POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people might say Brian Bogison could have waited to make such sacrifices. 
They might have advised him to stick around and have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bogison, 17, has a schedule to keep. Remaining for another semester at Oak 
Park High would not have been the best move in the interest of time management, 
a skill that will come in handy down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogison, a 6-foot-4, 200-pound backup center, left the Oak Park basketball 
team in the midst of a 22-2 season -- best in school history -- to graduate 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 He now takes 17 units at Pierce College in hopes of receiving an appointment 
to West Point by the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ultimate goal is to be an officer in the United States Army," Bogison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to get cracking. Bogison enrolled at Pierce early, in part, because his 
3.3 grade-point average at Oak Park was "substandard." One must carry a 3.5 to 
be considered for appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bogison decided to start fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision tormented him, but he's real motivated to do this," said Oak 
Park Coach Rob Hall, 30, who served two years in the Army. "We miss having him, 
but he made a real mature decision about his future." 
</P>
<P>
 Bogison was a first-year player whom Hall had hand-picked out of a physical 
education class. Bogison proved to be a key defensive player and one of the 
team's best outside shooters -- yet inexperience limited him to about six 
minutes per game. He averaged three points and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of performing in front of his classmates in a packed gym, Bogison 
has moved to his grandparents' home in Canoga Park, where he spends nights 
studying physics, geography, political science, history and anthropology in 
pursuit of a 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he was up to something, because he was always off doing his own 
thing," teammate Nick Rattray said. "We all assumed it was for a good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We miss him a little. He was a likable character and he hit three pointers 
like they were nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bogison never announced his decision to his teammates because he initially 
planned to do continue playing. He spent the first week of the spring semester 
taking classes at Pierce, taking elective classes at Oak Park and squeezing in 
basketball practice. But he didn't make it through the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to fulfill my obligations, but I couldn't balance the two," he said. 
"I didn't want to make anybody angry. I didn't want to let the team down."

WARY COACH TOOK OAK PARK JOB WITH MAJOR MISGIVINGS; HALL'S FEARS ALLAYED BY 
TEAM'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 When Oak Park High was courting Rob Hall four years ago and he found himself 
eager to say yes, he wondered if he was about to sabotage his coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Park basketball team had just completed an 0-20 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Against his better judgment, Hall took the job. He had no idea he would soon 
be riding the crest of a youth basketball craze running through the Agoura-Oak 
Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got here, everybody was predicting we would win," said Hall, who was 
an assistant at Santa Paula High before Fred Yamano, Oak Park's athletic 
director, recruited him.  
</P>
<P>
 "People were telling me how lucky I was to be the new coach. All I knew was 
Santa Paula beat Oak Park by 40 that year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's first team went 7-15. But, by the end of that 1991-92 season, Hall was 
sharing the future visions of all those people who called him "lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered sophomores Ryan Garth and Nick Rattray, who were part the first 
wave of good players coming from a new basketball pipeline in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Now seniors, Rattray averaged 10.5 points per game during the regular season; 
Garth averaged 12.2 points and seven rebounds. Garth exploded in the Eagles' 
84-70 victory over St. Joseph in the first round of the Southern Section 
Division IV-A playoffs last week with 37 points, seven rebounds, five steals 
and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall also laid eyes on four freshmen that first season: Shawn Williams, 
Brandon Creason, Darren Aherne and Brian McMullen. They were Oak Park's version 
of a "fab four." They were products of the burgeoning Agoura Youth Basketball 
Assn. and had played for a traveling team that once won 62 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall won't hesitate to admit two things: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Oak Park is good. The Eagles take a 22-2 record into tonight's Southern 
Section Division IV-A quarterfinal playoff game against Crossroads. They were 
undefeated in Tri-Valley League play, winning their first league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Yes, he is lucky. How often does a high-school basketball coach find a red 
carpet rolled out for him when he walks into a gym? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a beautiful situation," Hall said. "These kids all decided early on 
they wanted to be good basketball players and they've worked very, very hard 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park got good in a hurry. The Eagles finished 14-10, reached the playoffs 
and set a school record for victories in 1992-93, Hall's second season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant success, thanks mainly to six boys who started playing organized 
basketball when they were 9. As 10-year-olds, Williams, Aherne, Creason and 
McMullen launched their four-year, 72-2 run in a traveling league that pitted 
them against some of the toughest age-group competition in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The group boasts no superstars, just guys who play the game with textbook 
execution and appear to get along as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up together and we watched each other develop our games," Garth said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been good friends for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Not just on the court. Creason and McMullen, for example, camp and surf 
together at out-of-town beaches during the summer. And on the court, the Eagles 
play games within a game because their ability to communicate approaches the 
telepathic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Brandon (Creason), we're almost one," said Williams, a 6-3 
guard/forward. "We look at each other and know instantly what to do, whether 
it's an alley-oop, a cutter, a give-and-go. Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Creason: "Any guy on the team who has the ball, we can tell if he's going 
to drive or pass. And if he's going to pass, we know who the pass is going to. 
Shawn (Williams) knows all my moves and I know all his moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Creason, the team's point guard, ranks second on the team in scoring (12.5 
points per game) and leads in assists (six). Aherne, a 6-3 forward, leads in 
rebounds (8.6). 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a star in the group, it's Williams, a strong candidate for 
Tri-Valley League player of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams leads the team with a 16.2 scoring average, ranks second in rebounds 
(7.8 per game) and assists (three) and leads the team in steals (3.6). But 
Williams missed the playoff opener and will be out tonight because of 
mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody expected this from us," Williams said. "We've never backed 
down from anything. We've always known what it took to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years before Hall arrived as Oak Park's coach, the seeds to the Eagles' 
success were planted by parents such as Bob Philpot, an accountant; Rick 
Williams, a dress manufacturer; Ken Laibow, who develops and markets hot and 
cold athletic wraps, and Ed Corridori, Agoura city councilman. Corridori's sons 
were solid players for Agoura High. 
</P>
<P>
 None have substantial coaching experience, but all shared a desire to make 
basketball thrive in Agoura Hills. They've succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills, a city of less than 20,000, has built its youth program from 
about 200 participants to nearly 800. The growth of the league also has bred 
success at Agoura High, which finished the regular season at 17-7 and won a 
share of its first Marmonte League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's lineup includes Brian Laibow and Ben Richardson, who played with 
Williams, Creason, Aherne and McMullen on Ken Laibow's traveling team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give myself some credit," Ken Laibow said. "We really taught 
these boys how to play basketball. We took these kids to the toughest places in 
L.A. We played in L.A. tournaments. We played in the South Bay league." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success, Agoura might never be known as a breeding ground for 
Division I college players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get Marques Johnson's kids," said Philpot, whose son, Aaron, plays 
at Agoura. "We get book-smart, aggressive kids who might make Division III. But 
you can take that talent early on and mold it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shaun Williams: "Our class started the trend. The younger kids heard 
about us. They started coming to our games and following us. Then they wanted 
to follow in our footsteps." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the parents wonder how good Agoura High's team might be had Oak Park 
not opened 12 years ago and diluted the talent pool. Hall has wondered the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put (Agoura's team) together with mine and took the best 12. . . . I 
don't even want to talk about it," Hall said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hall feels like a charmed coach, but there are certainly times when he feels 
like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a 68-50 victory over Bishop Diego in Oak Park's final home game, 
after the Eagles cut down the nets in a championship celebration, Hall 
approached four senior players in a quiet corner. They were talking and 
embracing, and he noticed tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked over and talked to them a couple of minutes and I realized I was out 
of place," Hall said. "I said, 'Guys, stay as long as you want. You can sleep 
here if you want.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I feel like I'm just tagging along. But that's the way it probably 
should be."

O.C. POLICE TAKE HEAT FOR SELLING SEIZED GUNS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: DEPARTMENTS 
THAT ENGAGE IN THE PRACTICE FACE CONFLICTING ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC PRESSURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As guns-for-goods programs make headlines nationwide with promises to pull 
weapons off city streets, some Orange County police departments continue to 
quietly sell guns confiscated during arrests to private arms dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach and Orange are among those cities that sell seized guns for 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these economic times, we're kind of in a philosophical hard spot," said 
Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne. "We need the money -- it comes back to the 
general fund -- so we're selling weapons to legitimate, federally licensed gun 
dealers. We're not selling to the public, although I'm sure that is where they 
ultimately end up." 
</P>
<P>
 But at a time when a local hockey team is giving away tickets to get guns off 
the street, some cities, and even the federal government, are rethinking the 
sale of seized weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Santa Ana officials vowed to halt the sales and destroy all 
confiscated weapons -- as soon as their current contract with a Modesto-based 
auction house expires in July. Costa Mesa stopped selling seized guns last 
month. Huntington Beach officials will discuss the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will simply have all our confiscated guns destroyed in the future," said 
Santa Ana City Manager David N. Ream. "It's been an item of discussion amongst 
the council for quite some time. They just don't have an interest in being in 
the gun sale business." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's decision to halt the sales -- which netted nearly $50,000 last 
year -- came partly in response to persistent complaints from community 
activist John Raya. 
</P>
<P>
 Raya called it a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my desire to see this as a state mandate to all law enforcement 
agencies," he said. "We sell these weapons that are cheap secondhand guns, and 
they end up at pawnshops and places like that. An officer has already 
endangered his life once to take that gun off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous. We should not be out there selling guns that we've 
confiscated back to the gun dealers," Moreno said. "For $50,000 a year -- is 
that worth a life? A gun that we confiscated and sold might one day kill my 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
 While Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters said he respects his city's 
decision to stop selling the weapons, he cautioned that the decision will do 
little, if anything, to stem the crime problem, adding that he is comfortable 
with the practice of selling certain confiscated guns to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a limit on the number of firearms that can be made or sold. It's 
not like you're adding to the supply" by selling confiscated weapons, Walters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weapons that we're concerned about are these high-velocity, assault-type 
weapons that were supposedly banned years ago, but because of loopholes people 
are still supplying them. We're not turning those types of guns over to be 
sold. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orange County police departments either destroy all confiscated weapons 
or contract with the Orange County Sheriff's Department to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Those police departments include Garden Grove, Tustin, Irvine, Newport Beach, 
Westminster and Anaheim. Last Saturday, Anaheim police pulled in 104 guns in a 
one-day guns-for-goods trade-off that got participants a pair of tickets to a 
Mighty Ducks hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two Orange County cities -- Huntington Beach and Orange -- still 
contract with Modesto-based Roger Ernst & Associates to auction confiscated 
weapons, although all illegal and defective weapons are slated for destruction, 
police department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials will consider at a Tuesday staff meeting whether to 
destroy all guns taken from crime scenes, Huntington Beach Police Lt. Chuck Poe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the big push of having people trade in their guns, it doesn't make any 
sense for us to sell them and put them back on the streets," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, his department sold 48 weapons, collecting $3,281. The next year, 
police sold 65 weapons, for a $5,186 boost to the city's general fund. Figures 
for 1994 were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana began selling confiscated weapons in the mid-1980s, said Santa Ana 
Police Lt. Robert Helton, and from 1991 to 1993, the sale of 1,868 weapons 
contributed $147,839 to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange raised $15,919 in 1992 and 1993 from the sale of 286 weapons, Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police participated in the recent Aamco guns-for-goods program, and 
seven weapons were turned in and destroyed in exchange for Aamco services, 
Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said departments that promote guns-for-goods exchanges while selling 
confiscated weapons are talking out of both sides of their mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, it's hypocritical," said Hubert Williams, president of the 
nonprofit, Washington-based Police Foundation, which does research and 
consulting work for law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly have a proliferation of guns in this society, and anything the 
police departments can do to take these guns off the street they should do," he 
said. "All the real police obligations to the protection of life are blinked at 
when we become a part of the chain that puts these weapons back on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 If some lawmakers have their way, Santa Ana's recent choice would become a 
matter of law. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill authored by state Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San Diego) and now on the 
Senate floor would ban all law enforcement agencies in the state from selling 
confiscated guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's indefensible to flood the streets with cheap guns already used in the 
commission of a crime," said Gotch, who conceded that his is an uphill battle. 
He counts only 18 committed votes of the 21 he needs to get the bill through 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 His views, however, are shared by some top federal appointees, including the 
head of the General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, GSA Administrator Roger W. Johnson -- the CEO of Irvine's Western 
Digital Corp. before his appointment by President Clinton last July -- declared 
that federal law enforcement agencies would no longer be able to sell weapons 
to gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1981, agencies including the FBI, the U.S. Customs Service and the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have sold about 65,000 weapons to 
dealers with GSA permission, GSA spokesman Hap Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures came to Johnson's attention in October, and he did not like what 
he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started asking (Atty. Gen. Janet) Reno and other Administration officials 
what was going on. It just went against the grain of common sense, given what's 
going on in society," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very rarely does a criminal go to a dealer to buy a gun. They either steal 
them or they go to an out-of-state dealer," said Gerald Upholt, manager of 
legislative affairs for the Fullerton-based California Rifle and Pistol Assn. 
"The contention that (these sales) would have an impact on crime is just 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of law enforcement selling the guns really ought to be a 
non-issue," he added. "It does raise money for local government. The guns are 
only sold to licensed dealers, and people have to go through the 15-day waiting 
period in California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The heat to bring the practice to a stop has been so intense, however, that 
even the man who makes part of his living buying the confiscated guns says he 
has had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Ernst, whose Modesto-based auction house has contracted with many 
California police departments seeking to sell confiscated weapons, said he 
decided in December that he has had it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are out of the firearms market. It's all over," he said. "I don't want the 
heat, and I don't want the phone calls. It's too political. I'm not going to do 
it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst said he auctions only to licensed gun dealers and will honor his current 
contracts. He said his company, Roger Ernst & Associates, generated $10 million 
for law enforcement agencies over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can use that money! Everything we did was legal, and it was right and it 
was proper, and we were dealing with law enforcement agencies," he said, 
chiding critics for implying that weapons he auctioned could end up in the 
hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst & Associates contracts with 720 cities statewide to auction property 
seized in drug raids, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers E.J. Gong Jr. and Thuan Le contributed to this report. 
Confiscated Weapons 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County police departments destroy the guns they seize from 
suspects. Those departments include Garden Grove, Tustin, Irvine, Newport 
Beach, Westminster and Anaheim. Other agencies sell confiscated weapons to 
private dealers, destroying only those that are illegal or defective. Here's a 
sample of what some of those sales have netted in the past two years:

DEFIANT PAT NOLAN VOWS THEY WON'T 'SHUT ME UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still protesting his innocence a week after he pleaded guilty to racketeering 
charges, a tearful former Assemblyman Pat Nolan presented the case for his 
defense to a roomful of emotional supporters Thursday night, walking them 
through the FBI's own recorded evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by about 170 loyal backers who embraced him not only in his years 
of political glory but now, in his hour of disgrace, Nolan told the gathering 
at Burbank's Holiday Inn that, "I'm going to do my time, but they are not going 
to shut me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant despite the tears in his eyes at times, Nolan told the crowd that he 
had no regrets over his guilty plea because "I am now free to speak my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to spend his prison time writing a book about "the abuses of the 
federal judicial system," Nolan said. "I want to change it so other people 
don't have to go through this torment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've taken their best shot," Nolan said of federal prosecutors who secured 
indictments against him on six counts of racketeering, conspiracy, extortion 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've shot me and they've made me mad. Now I'm a wounded bull elephant." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a 33-month sentence -- instead of the eight years he might 
have faced had he gone to trial and lost -- Nolan pleaded guilty to one count 
of racketeering last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, he filed a sworn statement in U.S. District Court describing his 
Assembly office as a racketeering enterprise for extorting campaign 
contributions in 1988 from those who sought legislative favors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday night he said that admission was false. He admitted accepting the 
$20,000 in question -- which the FBI said were bribes -- but maintained he did 
so only to strengthen the Republican leadership, not to benefit himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of facing overzealous prosecutors and unfavorable courtroom odds 
-- not his conscience -- led him to plead guilty, Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to show how the FBI and U.S. attorneys fell short of proving he 
intended to sell his vote, Nolan passed out transcripts of the FBI's secretly 
recorded conversations with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In one session between Nolan and an undercover agent seeking assurances that 
Nolan would persuade the governor to sign a bill, Nolan is quoted as saying, 
"There's no way we can guarantee anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman also maintained that he did not bring up the subject of 
campaign contributions directly with the agent. He also played the FBI's 
secretly made videotape of a hotel room meeting in which an agent passed two 
checks for $5,000 apiece to Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 The low angle of the camera and the grainy black-and-white quality of the film 
was meant to give the tape a sinister appearance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan said he will spend the next month before he has to report to prison 
March 28 making arrangements for the support of his wife, Gail, and three young 
children, ages 5 and under. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to serve time in a federal prison in Pleasanton, he said, because it 
is only 1 1/2 hours away from his family's home in suburban Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 While he's in prison, supporters said, a trust fund being set up to receive 
donations will help Nolan's wife pay the household bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had fought the charges and received a stiffer sentence than the 33 
months he agreed to, Nolan said: "I couldn't take that time away from my 
family. I just couldn't face that." 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during his speech, a tearful Nolan had to stop to regain 
composure. "I'll be fine in a minute," he told supporters when he choked up 
while speaking of his children. "Just let me work through this." 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, burly, 43-year-old's presentation also moved to tears many in the 
crowd, which overflowed a ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 With tears welling in his eyes, Rand Brooks, a Glendale businessman and 
retired actor, said after the event: "He was framed, but good. When you read 
the actual transcript, you can't find anything wrong there. He's a 
straight-shooting honest guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Frank Barneburg, who runs a printing business in Burbank: "I came here 
looking for some answers. I already knew in my heart that he was innocent, but 
now I have proof."

COPTERS URGED FOR BATTLING O.C. WILDFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a comprehensive post-mortem of the wildfires that tore through Laguna Beach 
last October, Orange County fire officials have recommended that the county get 
new helicopters capable of dumping large quantities of water, portable pumps 
for firetrucks and an improved communication system. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, even a better equipped Fire Department will not be able 
to ward off another disaster without help from other segments of the community, 
said fire officials, who also called for new fire and building code standards 
in fire-hazard areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire service, the public, homeowners and landowners must build and 
develop a safer community to withstand the onslaught of fire that is going to 
come," said Larry J. Holmes, director of fire services. "Fire is a natural part 
of the environment in Southern California, and it's going to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-page report entitled "Firestorm 1993" analyzed the factors that 
contributed to the destruction or damage of 441 homes at a cost of $528 
million. It concluded that helicopters able to scoop water from nearby lakes 
probably could have extinguished the blaze long before it reached the developed 
areas of Laguna Beach from the brushy canyon where it was started. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also cited a lack of water pressure and a three-hour power failure 
at a pumping station of the Laguna Beach County Water District that seriously 
hampered the district's ability to keep water reservoirs at higher elevations 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that just one strike team of five fire engines will draw as 
much as 7,500 gallons per minute from water mains, while the district could 
only pump 4,400 gallons a minute to the reservoirs serving the hardest hit 
areas of Skyline and Mystic Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that rate," the report states, "supply was unable to keep up with demand." 
The report also noted that it took a mobile generator from a neighboring water 
district to restore power because the Laguna Beach County Water District had no 
backup power source. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials have maintained that the city's longtime refusal to 
go along with their plan to build a 3-million-gallon reservoir at the city's 
highest point was the single biggest reason why water virtually stopped flowing 
to firefighters as they battled the blazes in the hills overlooking the city 
center. They said that a more powerful pumping system would not have alleviated 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of recommendations to the County Board of Supervisors, fire 
officials have asked for permission to spend $1.25 million to obtain a 
helicopter before May, the beginning of the next fire season. Eventually, the 
Fire Department wants two helicopters on call in case a major fire occurs. Fire 
officials say the helicopters could be used to help other agencies and could 
bring in $129,260 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get firefighting resources to the fire in the first few 
minutes and attack a fire before it gets bigger or to head it into a different 
direction," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each helicopter would be able to drop about 4,000 gallons of water an hour, 
crucial in fighting a fire as fierce as the one that began north of Laguna 
Beach and swiftly swept into areas of the city, officials said. Experts say the 
fire had scorched only five acres in Laguna Canyon about 12 minutes into the 
blaze and could have been contained with helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although eight air tankers were requested from the state to fight the fire as 
it first developed east of Laguna Canyon Road, the support did not arrive until 
92 minutes after the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attempting to flank it right now, but it's burning hot and fast," an 
operations chief said by radio minutes after the initial request. "We're 
falling behind. You copy my request for initial attack air tankers, so we can 
knock the head out?" 
</P>
<P>
 The tankers were delayed because they had been used to fight other, earlier 
fires throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said Thursday that at best, the tankers would have arrived 20 to 30 
minutes after the first request but the helicopters would have been much more 
useful in trying to quell the initial blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed something that was critical to an early attack," he said. "We 
needed air resources that could reach areas where our firetrucks couldn't get 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the helicopters, fire officials have applied for a federal grant to 
improve firefighting capabilities in several areas: retrofitting fire equipment 
to allow foam to be sprayed as well as water, adding portable pumps to fire 
engines and upgrading the communications system, which was severely overloaded 
during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, Holmes said, is a movement to strengthen building and fire 
code standards in high-risk areas. A task force created after the October fires 
is to produce reports by July which will address ways to "make the county's 
wildlife-urban (areas) less vulnerable to the destructive forces of wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force consists of elected officials, fire administrators and 
representatives of water districts, environmental groups, development companies 
and insurance agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have complained that one of the greatest problems they 
encountered in fighting the Laguna fire was the prevalence of wood-frame houses 
surrounded by heavy brush that transported and stoked the flames. Although laws 
are in place that require homeowners to keep their land clear of such brush and 
make sure their roofs are fire-resistant, compliance is spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in these areas, you have some obligation to protect yourself," 
Holmes said. "You have to do everything you can so that firefighters have a 
chance. We shouldn't have to stand in the middle of all those burned-out homes 
again and ask why this happened. We know why it happened, and now we have to 
make some decisions."

ANGELS, BO SPRING BACK INTO ACTION; BASEBALL: OPTIMISM REIGNS AS USUAL ON FIRST 
DAY OF PRACTICE. TEAM HAS NEW NAMES, RENEWED HOPE. 
</P>

<P>
 Bo Jackson kept stealing glances at the clock in the Angel clubhouse Thursday 
morning until, able to wait no longer, he walked toward 92-year-old coach 
Jimmie Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time, Jimmie. You ready?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie nodded, and Bo offered his right arm as if he were escorting him to the 
senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been waiting for this all winter, Jimmie," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese: "Kid, I've been waiting for this all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Off they went together, one man who is spending his 72nd year in professional 
baseball and wants to die in his baseball uniform; the other an exceptional 
athlete who refuses to let an artificial hip stop him from playing the game he 
loves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People consider me an inspiration for those people with crutches, canes and 
wheelchairs," Jackson said. "Well, Jimmie is an inspiration to the entire game 
of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the opening day of spring training for the full Angel squad, and 4 
1/2 months since last donning baseball uniforms, they congregated for a 9:30 
a.m. team meeting on their practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are no different than most teams at this time of year, filled with 
great hopes and expectations, and seeing no reason why they can't at least 
compete in the American League West. The Angels have not won their division 
since 1986, but with only four teams remaining because of realignment, no team 
can be easily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 54 players who arrived in camp Thursday, but only 25 will be 
invited to remain with the team. Most of those rejected will be sent to the 
Angels' minor-league teams. Some will be traded to other teams. Others will be 
fired, or as they call it in baseball, released. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial reward for being a major league player can be lifetime security, 
with the average annual salary exceeding $1 million. But to some, the money is 
insignificant. They find their inspiration elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Kevin Flora is motivated by the memory of his wife, MaryAnn, 
who was killed in an automobile accident last year. Jackson is playing for his 
mother, who raised 10 kids by herself, and died of cancer. Frank Tanana, 40, 
continues to play because of his unadulterated love for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this same compassion for the game that attracted nearly 100 fans 
throughout the day to the Angels' workout. There will be no exhibition games 
played for another week, and the practices consist mostly of methodical drills, 
but that doesn't stop the fans from pressing their faces against the chain-link 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my favorite time of year," said Tom Lantz, 42, who brought along his 
10-year-old daughter, Jennifer. "You can't get close to the players during the 
season. This is our chance to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter just got Jimmie Reese's autograph, and she thinks he's the 
greatest thing in the world. The other players are nice, but Jimmie is her 
hero." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd has swelled this year at the Angels' camp, primarily because of Bo 
Jackson. He's a miracle of modern-day science. Everyone wants to catch a 
glimpse, trying to understood how a man with an artificial hip can still be a 
professional athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely incredible to see what he does," said Phil Couchee, 60, who 
underwent the same operation eight years ago. "I'm restricted what I can and 
can't do, but he's doing everything like he never had an operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's hard for me to take my eyes off him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's presence has brought the Angels national attention, and when he sat 
down for a press conference Thursday, it was attended by representatives from 
media outlets from San Diego to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to take a lot of things for granted," Jackson said, "but the 1 1/2 
years I spent in pain, the struggle of getting out of bed, really put things in 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's press conference had barely ended when Angel officials advised the 
media to stick around for another press conference. This one was a surprise. 
Starting pitcher Mark Langston had just signed a three-year, $14-million 
contract extension that will keep him with the Angels through the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how pleased and excited I am about this," said Langston, who 
will contribute $50,000 to an Angel charity earmarked for abused children. "We 
signed this thinking it will be my last contract, so I'll be retiring as an 
Angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, whose father allowed pitching great Nolan 
Ryan to leave as a free agent when he ran the Angels, didn't stop long enough 
to celebrate his first major signing. He headed back to his office to find out 
why designated hitter Chili Davis didn't show up for the first workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis informed the Angels he was taking care of personal business, and would 
be arriving Saturday. No problem, Bavasi said. He went back to his desk, looked 
out the window, and saw the sun starting to set on the baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 No sight is more beautiful.

MARKET BEAT: COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER; FACE IT, THIS WAS NEVER LOVE AT FIRST 
SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a watershed event for either the telecommunications industry or the stock 
market overall, there may be less than meets the eye in the failure of the 
TCI/Bell Atlantic Corp. merger. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wall Street vernacular, this isn't likely to be "UAL II." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, 1989, the termination of the planned mega-buyout of United Air 
Lines triggered a 190.58-point plunge in the Dow industrials and heralded the 
end of late-1980s junk bond boom. The junk market's demise, in turn, helped set 
the stage for the credit squeeze of 1990 and the bear market that ravaged 
stocks later that year. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Bell Atlantic's inability to reach a deal with Tele-Communications 
Inc. says plenty about the danger of over-hyping the development of the 
nation's information superhighway. But it says very little about the stock 
market or the long-term potential for takeovers in multimedia or other 
industries, Wall Streeters say. "It's not that they couldn't do this deal; it's 
that they didn't want to do the deal," noted one New York takeover-stock 
trader, or arbitrager. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies couldn't agree because Bell Atlantic's stock has been 
spiraling lower ever since the deal was announced in October -- from a peak of 
$69.125 then to a low this week of $52.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the deal's currency was a swap of Bell Atlantic shares for TCI, each 
drop in the phone company's stock reduced TCI holders' payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Bell Atlantic and TCI slapped much of the blame for the deal's 
collapse on the Federal Communications Commission. With Tuesday's order of 
another rollback in cable TV rates, the FCC in effect made it extraordinarily 
difficult for Bell Atlantic to put a value on TCI and thus hammer out final 
stock-swap terms, the two firms said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But the fact is, the market wasn't enamored of this deal from the 
start. If Bell Atlantic stock had held at even $60, TCI would have had a much 
harder time jilting its suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Why have investors treated Bell Atlantic stock so badly, when the marriage 
would have created the nation's leading telecommunications company? In part, 
this was a case of lousy timing: The deal was announced during the same October 
week that 30-year Treasury bond yields hit 5.79%, the lowest in 21 years. Since 
then, the economy's strength has helped pull bond yields back up to 6.73%. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates make it hard for stock prices in general to advance, 
because money market funds, bank CDs and bonds are tougher competition for 
stocks as yields go up. And of all stock groups, rising rates pose the biggest 
problem for utilities such as phone companies, because the main lure of those 
stocks is their dividend yield. 
</P>
<P>
 At last October's peak price of $69.125 for Bell Atlantic, the yield provided 
by its $2.68-a-share annual dividend was a mere 3.9%. Now, with competing 
interest rates sharply higher, Bell Atlantic's yield also is higher -- not 
because the company raised the dividend, but because the stock price has been 
pushed lower. With the shares at $54.50 today, the dividend yield is 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on a minute, though. When Bell Atlantic agreed to buy TCI, Wall Street 
was supposed to view the phone company in a different light from then on. This 
was no longer a stodgy, slow-growing utility; by marrying its 
telecommunications know-how with TCI's premier cable TV franchise, Bell 
Atlantic was on the verge of becoming a classic 1990s growth stock, many 
analysts argued. The dividend wouldn't matter anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so -- or at least not yet. "Wall Street has been reluctant to buy that 
story," admits Hobart Buppert, co-manager of the Flag Investors Telephone 
Income stock mutual fund in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have taken a sober second look at the information highway's 
potential since the mania that engulfed the telecommunications industry last 
fall. And for the phone companies in particular, Buppert says, "I think 
investors just aren't sure that there's going to be as high a growth rate in 
the future as some people originally made it out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism about the gigantic Baby Bell companies suddenly producing 15% to 20% 
annual earnings growth by swallowing cable TV companies was plainly 
unwarranted, Buppert says. More realistic then, and now, he says, is that the 
leading companies can gradually boost their current low 6% to 8% earnings 
growth rates to the 10% range. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news here is that the pressure on the phone titans to do something to 
enhance their growth prospects will remain intense. Inevitably, that will mean 
more deals between phone and cable companies and massive spending to upgrade 
phone and cable systems for the interactive world. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the current vicious selloff in telecommunications stocks may 
be a gift for long-term investors. Indeed, cable TV equipment maker General 
Instrument on Thursday said that even with a slowdown in cable company spending 
this year because of the FCC decision, it still expects to make analysts' 
earnings estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based money manager Morris Mark argues that the negative psychology 
toward the cable company stocks perversely means that "the environment will 
never be better as far as getting an attractive price on these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The risk, however, is that the FCC's cable rate rollback move marks the 
beginning of a long period of regulatory uncertainty for the players on the 
info highway, says David Shell, senior analyst at Eagle Asset Management in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to take a two- to three-year view of this industry, because you 
don't know what the (government) is doing," Shell fumes. He contends that 
unless Congress agrees soon on a framework for future telecommunications 
competition -- and unless the companies are allowed to earn decent returns on 
their investment -- the promised growth explosion in multimedia could be 
severely stunted. Trouble in Telecom

DOW SLUMPS 51 POINTS ON RATE FEARS; WALL STREET: ANOTHER JUMP IN BOND YIELDS 
CLIPS STOCK PRICES. COLLAPSE OF THE TCI/BELL ATLANTIC MERGER ADDS TO THE GLOOM. 
</P>

<P>
 Long-term interest rates surged Thursday to their highest levels in eight 
months, fueling another selloff on beleaguered Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The termination of the multibillion-dollar Tele-Communications Inc./Bell 
Atlantic Corp. merger also hurt the market, as investors dumped a host of 
stocks tied to the so-called information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials ended with a loss of 51.78 points at 3,839.90. Losers 
swamped winners by more than 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy 
volume of 343 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the major catalyst for Thursday's decline was another sharp jump 
in interest rates, on the heels of strong economic news. The 30-year Treasury 
bond yield rocketed to 6.73% from 6.65% on Wednesday after the government 
reported that durable goods orders in January were above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields have been surging since the Federal Reserve Board officially 
boosted short-term interest rates slightly on Feb. 4, for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's aim was to show it was serious about keeping economic growth 
moderate to restrain inflation. But instead of viewing the Fed's move in a 
positive light, many bond investors have bailed out, fearing that higher 
short-term interest rates will also push up long-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the durable goods report was announced, it spawned fears that the Fed 
will tighten credit again soon, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tense political situation in Russia that sent European stock markets into a 
retreat also hurt U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the 'three strikes you're out' thing," said Bob Walberg, market analyst 
at MMS International, citing the bond market, the canceled Bell Atlantic/TCI 
merger, and the Russian concerns. "It applies to baseball and crime but also to 
the markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors' fears weren't helped by the Treasury's auction of $11 billion 
in new five-year notes Thursday. Despite decent demand, the average yield of 
5.61% was the highest in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's real concern here about the rise in interest rates. The fear now is 
that this rise in interest rates will reduce the flow of money into mutual 
funds. If it does, then the market has real problems," said Michael Metz, a 
vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Big losers in the Dow included AlliedSignal, down 1 3/8 to 77; GE, off 2 to 
105 3/8; Chevron, down 1 3/8 to 87 1/4; Procter & Gamble, off 1 3/8 to 57, and 
DuPont, down 1 3/8 to 53 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many telecommunications stocks were slammed on disappointment over the Bell 
Atlantic/TCI merger's cancellation. Among cable TV issues, TCI sank 1 7/8 to 22 
3/8, Comcast A fell 1 to 19 1/2 and Cablevision Systems dove 5 1/4 to 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bell Atlantic gained 1 3/4 to 54 1/2 because it no longer faces immediate 
earnings dilution from the merger. Other phone stocks also edged up, though 
many have been trounced in recent months. GTE gained 1 1/4 to 33 3/8, 
Southwestern Bell added 1 1/4 to 38 3/4 and BellSouth inched up 3/8 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive stocks hurt by the latest rate rise included insurer 
SunAmerica, down 1 1/8 to 36; builder Kaufman & Broad, off 1 1/8 to 20 3/4; 
Merrill Lynch, down 2 1/8 to 40 1/8, and Travelers, off 1 to 37 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circus Circus eased 5/8 to 36 7/8. After the market closed, the casino 
company reported record quarterly earnings and also said CEO William Bennett 
was stepping aside. President Clyde Turner will take his place.  
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's few winners, Stac Electronics surged 2 1/8 to 6 1/2. On 
Wednesday, a federal jury awarded Stac $120 million from Microsoft for patent 
infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Russia's latest political troubles sparked deep losses in Europe. 
London's FTSE-100 index plunged 74.4 points to 3,267.5, and Frankfurt's DAX 
index skidded 37.38 points to 2,090.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, however, the Nikkei index rebounded 423.65 points to 19,765.48. And 
Mexico City's Bolsa index recouped early losses to close up 19.98 points at 
2,592.33. Other Markets

<P>
 The dollar dropped sharply, hurt by Wall Street's decline, more signs of 
inflation and fresh indications that the Clinton Administration wants the U.S. 
currency to weaken against the yen.

<P>
 In New York, the dollar ended at 104.85 Japanese yen, down from 105.55 on 
Wednesday. The U.S. currency also fell to 1.717 German marks from 1.729.

COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER; TCI RESUMES DEAL-FISHING IN MURKY WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John C. Malone is back from his fishing trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal-hungry chief executive of Denver cable TV giant Tele-Communications 
Inc., who said he was "going fishing" at the outset of the proposed merger with 
Bell Atlantic Corp. four months ago, appeared to be in buoyant spirits Thursday 
at the prospect of being back on the prowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone had taken a back seat to Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W. Smith, who 
seemed to relish his new role in the spotlight. But while Smith kept an 
unusually low profile the day after the merger collapsed, Malone was hooked up 
with 90 reporters in a conference call from his headquarters outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was used to being the 'captain of the cable industry,' " Malone said. "For 
the last five months, I've been wearing a different hat and not answering the 
phone to a whole bunch of people that wanted to do things with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The failed merger paves the way for TCI to pursue a wide range of options -- 
including absorbing smaller cable systems that may now be available at bargain 
prices -- but it also throws into question the rapid convergence of the cable 
TV and telephone industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The $33-billion TCI/Bell Atlantic marriage was supposed to be a model for how 
competing industries could work together to build the so-called information 
superhighway. But its failure points up the difficulties longtime adversaries 
may have in forging partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 In an illustration of the fragile cable-telephone relationship, Malone said it 
was "particularly insulting" that some Baby Bells supported the federal 
regulations cutting cable TV rates in what he said was an effort to drive down 
the value of cable companies so that they could be bought at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 "We represent the only real threat to the local telephony business," Malone 
said. "Taking $15 billion of capital out of our industry, that's a hell of an 
edge. I keep hearing that we're a monopolist. These guys have been monopolists 
for 20 years!" 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic and US West were the exceptions among the Baby Bells. With cable 
companies facing rate reductions, though, some feel phone companies may get a 
leg up in the technology race now. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Philadelphia, Bell Atlantic said its goal of 
delivering programming hasn't changed. But it said the failed merger will slow 
plans to offer cable TV outside its six-state service area. 
</P>
<P>
 One option for Bell Atlantic is to enter the market by purchasing small cable 
systems. Like TCI, the Baby Bell blamed the Federal Communications Commission 
for sinking the deal. But there were more than regulatory reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic's stock slipped 20% over the four-month course of the merger 
talks, due to shareholder concerns. On Thursday, its stock jumped $1.75 to 
$54.50, as the threat of earnings dilution because of the proposed stock-swap 
deal evaporated. TCI shares traded as low as $21.25 before rebounding to close 
at $22.375, down $1.875 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the failed deal, some industry executives concluded that Malone 
had a severe case of "seller's remorse." At 52, he had spoken unconvincingly of 
slipping out of the spotlight. "I think he was of two minds," one industry 
executive said. "Part of him said, 'Get out, spend more time with your wife, go 
fishing' -- and the other said, 'Build, drive, kill!' That side drove him to 
make the deal tougher and tougher" until it could not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cable TV executive concurred. "What he probably missed was the lack of 
action. He's an action junkie. He would have had to behave himself for a year" 
until the deal closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone said he will continue to seek alliances for TCI. Indeed, joint ventures 
may be the preferred way to go between cable TV operators and telephone 
companies in the wake of the FCC's action to further roll back cable TV rates. 
</P>
<P>
 While Malone refused to discuss specific options, he confirmed that he is back 
in conversations with QVC Network Inc. Chairman Barry Diller. Malone was one of 
Diller's initial backers in QVC's failed bid for Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to see more alliances," said John Waller, president of Waller 
Capital Corp., a New York investment banking firm specializing in cable deals. 
"The fact that TCI and Bell Atlantic couldn't reach an agreement doesn't mean 
others won't. These two industries need each other and want to get together." 
</P>
<P>
 Waller and other industry executives maintain that the future between the two 
industries lies in alliances such as US West's $2.5-billion investment for 
25.5% of Time Warner Entertainment, the second-largest cable TV operator in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies are developing one of the first "full service networks" at a 
test site in Orlando, Fla., that will allow customers to combine the use of 
their telephone and cable TV service, as well as providing such features as 
movies on demand, home shopping and banking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning programming from them and they are able to pull resources from 
us to help with the telecommunications part of the business," said Bob Fuehr, a 
vice president at US West. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone, who only a few months ago was predicting that a majority of consumers 
within five years would have access to the broad-band fiber-optic networks 
capable of delivering hundreds of channels and myriad interactive service into 
the home, is dampening expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI said this week that it would slash its capital expenditure program by $500 
million next year -- half its planned spending -- in the wake of the FCC's rate 
rollback action. The cable company had previously announced an ambitious 
program to upgrade its 13 million customers to fiber-optic systems over the 
next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Malone now says that while TCI customers -- and by extrapolation the 
cable industry -- may get additional services, it will take longer to receive 
two-way interactive and telephony service. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry estimates that the FCC rate rollback will cost nearly $3 
billion annually in revenue. Based on the industry's borrowing capacity, that 
would result in $15 billion less being available for capital expenditure to 
build high-tech cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has done more to push back the timetable of (an interactive digital 
world) than anything else," HBO Chairman Michael Fuchs said. "The Bell 
Atlantic/TCI implosion shows that this convergence will not be an easy one."

COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER; DON'T BLAME US; ADMINISTRATION SAYS INFORMATION 
HIGHWAY STILL ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials Thursday lashed out at claims that their 
regulatory policies contributed to the unraveling of the Tele-Communications 
Inc./Bell Atlantic Corp. merger, saying they remain committed to helping 
industry build a national information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of two companies merging -- granted, very large companies -- should 
not have a significant effect on the development of an information highway," 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry analysts had speculated that the decision to cancel the 
$33-billion merger agreement between the nation's largest cable company and the 
huge Philadelphia-based telephone concern might have been a gamble by the 
companies to embarrass the Administration into granting regulatory concessions 
to the beleaguered cable industry, which earlier this week was ordered by the 
government to roll back cable fees for the second time in a year.  
</P>
<P>
 But the head of the federal agency that oversees the industry said there will 
be no backtracking on cable regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not they can agree on price is not our concern; we are concerned 
with the public interest . . . and keeping cable prices at reasonable levels," 
said Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), a critic of the proposed merger 
who had threatened to introduce legislation to block it, said the deal's 
failure might even benefit cable TV and telephone company customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget what Bell Atlantic and TCI try to tell you; the collapse of their deal 
is great news for consumers," he said. "The end of their merger is . . . the 
beginning of a superhighway we can all afford to ride." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger's collapse will intensify debate over what role the federal 
government should play in overseeing an industry that the Administration has 
been encouraging to risk billions of dollars to build the so-called information 
superhighway. The Administration envisions a new technological infrastructure 
that would link individual Americans with schools, government and industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, among other Administration officials, has said that a 
national information superhighway would help create thousands of jobs and boost 
American competitiveness. He also said such a network would improve education, 
medical knowledge and scientific research by giving doctors, teachers, students 
and others in even the remotest and poorest communities of the nation 
electronic access to current data.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, TCI President John C. Malone and Bell Atlantic Chairman 
Raymond W. Smith told Capitol Hill lawmakers and Wall Street investors that 
they were willing to spend billions to build such a network. But they said they 
needed their combined financial resources to provide new telecommunications 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cable operators said Thursday that the failed merger was the starkest 
evidence yet that the Clinton Administration is not interested in backing up 
rhetoric about the information superhighway with political and regulatory 
support for industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two companies were among the most aggressive in espousing the wonders 
of the new communications superhighway and, to the extent the deal has fallen, 
I think you" have to blame government regulation, said Amos B. Hostetter, 
chairman of Boston-based Continental Cablevision, which has 2.8 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have an FCC chairman say that this will have no effect on investment 
spending" on the information highway "is shocking and naive," Hostetter said. 
"This is going to give the financial community real pause." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, backers of at least one other big cable-telephone 
marriage -- Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. and Southwestern Bell Corp. -- 
said they will proceed with their plans to complete a $4.9-billion 
telecommunications joint venture similar to the TCI/Bell Atlantic deal. They 
said the financial benefits of the proposal outweigh any regulatory 
restrictions on cable revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Enticed by predictions that Americans are prepared to spend tens of billions 
of dollars a year to watch movies, tap into databanks and video games and keep 
in touch by mobile phone, the telecommunications industry has been rushing to 
develop ground-breaking new technologies such as high-definition television, 
digital radio, satellite and wireless communications services.  
</P>
<P>
 The cellular phone industry, for example, is adding more than 1,000 customers 
a day. And Hughes Aircraft Co. and Hubbard Broadcasting have invested nearly $1 
billion in a satellite venture that, starting this spring, will allow American 
households to sign up to receive as many as 150 cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials privately expressed relief Thursday that the 
collapse of merger talks means they will not have to decide the fate of a 
complex marriage that, if approved, would have given two telecommunications 
behemoths access to nearly a quarter of American households.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, most experts say the financial rewards of the information superhighway 
remain too enticing to deter most entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of the information superhighway still looks bright because you now 
will have robust competition among three competitors" -- cable, telephone and 
wireless communications companies, said Anthony M. Rutkowski, former director 
of technology for Sprint Corp. who now serves as executive director of the 
Internet Society.

COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER; HOW THE DEAL CAME APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some blame the collapse of Bell Atlantic's plan to buy Tele-Communications 
Inc. on federal regulators, but market forces were the immediate cause: Wall 
Street became unenthused about the stocks, a trend made worse by rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "These two companies (TCI and Bell Atlantic) were among the most aggressive in 
espousing the wonders of the new communications superhighway and to the extent 
the deal has fallen I think you" have to blame government regulation."-- Amos 
B. Hostetter, chairman of Boston-based Continental Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal broke up because of all the uncertainties. They were unable to each 
an agreement on a price. You can't price an unknown. It will effect all the 
other deals being discussed. Certainly things have ground to a halt." -- 
Gustave Hauser, Chief Executive, Hauser Communications The Shares Have Slumped 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The stocks' prices began dropping shortly after Bell Atlantic and TCI 
announced the merger plan Oct. 12. Some investors believed Bell Atlantic was 
overpaying. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI shares, weekly closes except latest: Thursday: $22.375, down 1.875 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic shares, weekly closes except latest: Thursday: $54.50, up 1.74 . 
. . As Interest Rates Have Surged 
</P>
<P>
 Rising bond yields cause investors to turn away from high dividend stocks such 
as phone utilities in favor of bonds. So the surge in rates since October has 
helped clip Bell Atlantic's shares. 
</P>
<P>
 30-year Treasury bond yield Thursday: 6.73%

TENNECO CHIEF GIVES UP DUTIES DUE TO ILLNESS; EXECUTIVES: MICHAEL WALSH WILL 
STEP DOWN FROM THE HOUSTON-BASED CONGLOMERATE TO FOCUS FULL TIME ON DEFEATING 
CANCEROUS BRAIN TUMOR.

 Michael Walsh, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego credited with turning 
around Tenneco Inc. before falling victim to brain cancer, has relinquished his 
duties as the company's chief executive to focus on his treatment full time, 
the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Mead, 58, president and chief operating officer of the diversified 
industrial company, was elected chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as U.S. attorney in San Diego, Walsh was chief executive of the 
Union Pacific Railroad before joining Tenneco in September, 1991, amid heavy 
losses at the company's JI Case farm and construction equipment business. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh is credited with overseeing a $3-billion restructuring at the 
Houston-based conglomerate, which has businesses ranging from heavy equipment 
to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh instituted widespread layoffs and cost cutting, and slashed Tenneco's 
dividend 50%. In March, 1992, he selected Mead to become Tenneco's president. 
Mead was recruited from International Paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, Walsh was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor. He began a 
regimen of extensive chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and was forced to 
cut back on his rigorous work schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh announced in November that tests showed the tumor had stopped growing 
and had begun to break up. Late last month, he underwent surgery to remove dead 
tissue from the tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tenneco board said Thursday it understands and respects Walsh's decision, 
and hopes he will be able to resume an active role at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want Mike to continue to be a part of the Tenneco family and have urged 
him to take whatever time is necessary to treat the effects of the brain tumor 
which has afflicted him," said a statement issued by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead, who in September, 1992, also took over the helm of JI Case, Tenneco's 
most troublesome division, had been seen as Walsh's heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dana has been Mike Walsh's partner in leading Tenneco," said Peter T. Flawn, 
a Tenneco director. "They have been a team for the past two years. He knows the 
company inside and out, and we have full confidence that he will continue to 
lead Tenneco's successful transformation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said in a telephone interview that he plans little change in direction at 
the conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead described Walsh's resignation as "a tremendous loss for our company." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Walsh's decision came after the close of the stock market 
Thursday. Tenneco stock fell $1.375 per share, or almost 2.4%, to $56.625.

TESTING OF GM'S ELECTRIC CAR PUSHED BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public testing of the General Motors Corp. Impact electric car has been set 
back two months or more by production problems, GM and Southern California 
Edison confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get into manufacturing a vehicle, all kinds of things go wrong at 
volume," said Jean Crocker, spokeswoman for the company's electric car effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are experiencing at this point a shortage of some parts we need to finish 
assembling the vehicle, before we do durability tests," Crocker said. "The 
so-called parts shortage came about because this car, unlike others, has so 
much new to it." She declined to identify which parts, or subsystems, were the 
cause of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 GM is building 50 of the cars for a nationwide public testing program, in 
which the auto maker hopes to learn potential customer reaction to electric 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating electric utilities want to see how ordinary drivers use the 
cars, including when and how they recharge the batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocker said GM hopes to set a delivery date by early next week to provide 
cars to Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which will 
administer the volunteer test-driving in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison had expected delivery about April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Public reaction to electric vehicles is a major question in the controversy 
over electric cars, currently required in major auto makers' California 
showrooms by 1998 under the state Air Resources Board's low-emissions vehicle 
plan.

 Ford Ordered to Pay Bankrupt Dealer: A jury ruled that the auto maker must pay 
$10.5 million in damages for failing to provide a bankrupt Ford dealership with 
enough support under an incentive program for minority-owned businesses. Ford 
plans to appeal the verdict, delivered by a jury in Hayneville, Ala.Sam Foster, 
who is black, and Dee-Witt Sperau, who is white, were awarded a Ford dealership 
in Selma, Ala., under the incentive program in 1988 and claimed they were 
forced into bankruptcy in 1991 because of a lack of support from Ford. Ford 
argued that the River City Ford dealership in Selma, Ala., failed because the 
partners spent the business' money on personal expenses. The partners denied 
any wasteful spending.

 Sun Co. to Buy Chevron Refinery: The company said it signed a letter of intent 
to buy Chevron's Philadelphia facility for $170 million.Chevron said it expects 
to sell another refinery in Texas by early March. It announced in May that it 
was selling its refineries in Philadelphia and Port Arthur, Tex., as part of a 
strategy to focus on the South, Southwest and West. The Philadelphia refinery, 
which is owned by Chevron U.S.A. Products Co., a subsidiary of San 
Francisco-based Chevron Corp., has a 177,000-barrel-a-day capacity. Sun 
estimated the value of the inventory of oil products at the refinery at $100 
million. The plant produces gasoline, distillate fuel, low-sulfur residual fuel 
and petrochemicals.

 USDA to Propose Irradiation of Red Meat: The Agriculture Department will ask 
the Food and Drug Administration to review the safety of treating beef and 
other red meats with low-level doses of radiation to kill harmful bacteria, 
Secretary Mike Espy announced.Irradiation would kill such bacteria as the type 
that caused last year's mass outbreak of food poisoning linked to undercooked 
hamburgers. Espy's announcement brought an immediate outcry from opponents, who 
say irradiation involves the use of dangerous materials and poses its own risks 
to consumers and the environment. An FDA review would take up to 18 months.

 Lockheed Settles Simmons Lawsuit: The Calabasas-based aerospace concern agreed 
to pay $27 million to NL Industries Inc., a Houston chemicals firm controlled 
by investor Harold C. Simmons, to settle a suit stemming from Simmons' failed 
takeover bid for Lockheed in 1990. A federal jury in Los Angeles, after hearing 
NL's allegation that Lockheed failed to disclose critical information during 
the takeover fight in violation of U.S. securities laws, had awarded $30 
million to NL in late 1992. Lockheed, which appealed, said it still believes 
the verdict "was in error" but that it "was in the best interests of the 
company to resolve the longstanding dispute" for an amount less than the jury's 
award.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL TO BUY CELLULAR UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell Corp. said Thursday that it has agreed to buy the domestic 
cellular telephone business of Associated Communications Corp. in a 
$680-million stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will boost Southwestern Bell's cellular phone operations in Upstate 
New York, where the company recently said it would buy another batch of 
cellular properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition is in line with one of our major growth strategies, which is 
to expand wireless services into new national and international territories," 
said Edward Whitacre Jr., Southwestern Bell's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal includes Associated's properties in Buffalo, Rochester, Albany and 
Glen Falls, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Southwestern Bell agreed to buy adjacent cellular phone 
properties in Syracuse, Ithaca and Utica. Terms of that sale, which is pending, 
were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
 "This offers a very natural cluster of cellular markets," said Walter 
Patterson, spokesman for Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell's stock closed up $1.25 at $38.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, expected to close late this year, each share of Associated 
stock will be traded for a share of Southwestern Bell common stock worth more 
than $14.50. Associated stockholders will also receive shares of Spinco, a 
subsidiary composed of the assets Associated plans to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern Bell will also buy Associated's 35.7% interest in a cellular 
system Pittsburgh and 3% interest in a system in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is subject to the approval of Associated stockholders and regulatory 
agencies.

ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS JUMP 3.7% IN JANUARY; ECONOMY: AIRCRAFT, DEFENSE 
SECTORS PROVIDE MOST OF THE LIFT. WEEKLY JOBLESS CLAIMS RISE 25,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Factory orders for durable goods surged in January, fueled by a jump in the 
volatile aircraft and defense sectors, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts said the size of the increase may be misleading, and they stuck 
to forecasts that growth in manufacturing and the overall economy is slowing 
from the closing months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods jumped 3.7% last month, the 
Commerce Department said, marking the first time in 6 1/2 years that the 
indicator has climbed for six straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was the biggest for long-lasting items since orders rose 4.3% in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $147.9 billion, 
surpassing December's record $142.6 billion. Orders in December rose a revised 
2.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing 
first-time claims for jobless benefits shot up by 25,000 last week to 385,000, 
from a revised 360,000 during the week ended Feb. 12. Analysts attributed some 
of the increase to severe winter weather and the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said the two new government reports "suggest 
that the economy is losing some of the powerful momentum generated in the 
fourth quarter. Basically, recent indicators suggest that the economy is 
slowing to a sustainable, non-inflationary pace of growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The gross domestic product, the total of all goods and services produced in 
the United States, rose at a 5.9% annual rate in the last quarter of 1993, and 
the figure will probably be revised upward. Most economists predict economic 
expansion will slow to about 3% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The durable goods report took on added significance after Federal Reserve 
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before Congress this week that the Fed 
is keeping an eye on the indicator. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York said factory orders are 
too volatile to be a basis for adjusting short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed nudged short-term rates up a quarter of a point earlier this month, 
and Greenspan indicated this week that additional increases could be made to 
help keep the lid on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists had predicted only a 1% increase in durable goods orders for 
January, anticipating a meager rise in aircraft orders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Commerce Department said orders for transportation equipment jumped 
13.9% to $40.8 billion, all of it due to orders for civilian and military 
aircraft and parts. Excluding that transportation sector, orders increased a 
mere 0.3%, the eighth such consecutive increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense orders also were up sharply: 25.3% to $6.7 billion. Excluding defense, 
orders rose 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft actually declined 
6.7%. They had risen 10 times in the last 11 months. Those orders are often a 
gauge of business plans to expand and modernize. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the extreme winter weather in much of the nation and the 
Southern California earthquake probably slowed factory shipments but had little 
impact on orders. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in durable goods orders usually means busier factories and more 
jobs. Durable Goods:

 United Offers to Sweeten Pot for Flight Attendants: The airline said it is 
willing to make concessions to the union representing its flight attendants 
after their latest talks failed. The Flight Attendants Assn., with 18,000 
members at parent company UAL Corp., said it was unable to reach agreement with 
United that would have the union join an employee buyout of the airline. Unions 
representing pilots and machinists have already approved $5 billion in 
concessions for a 53% to 63% stake in the carrier.

 Judgment Against USAir Tossed Out: An appeals court in San Diego threw out the 
$2.1-million judgment in a lawsuit filed by a pilot against the carrier over 
injuries he claims he suffered when rain repellent seeped into the cockpit of 
the plane he was flying. The U.S. 4th District Court of Appeal reversed an 
August, 1990, jury award. The justices concluded that pilot Richard O'Harren's 
claim should have been handled through workers' compensation and that the 
judgment was not supported by evidence.

 30-Year Mortgage Rates Climb: Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.32% 
this week, up from 7.11% last week, according to a national survey released by 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The rates were the highest since June 24, 
when they averaged 7.34%.After dropping to a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, 
rates began to rise and have moved up and down in a relatively narrow range. 
Analysts do not expect fixed-rated mortgages to rise much above 7.5% this year. 
On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial 
rate of 4.25%, up from 4.18% last week. Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 6.80% 
this week, up from 6.64% a week earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees 
known as points.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: PLASTIC RECYCLING SYMBOL TARGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A movement is under way to throw out laws in 39 states requiring the "chasing 
arrows" recycling symbol to appear on plastic bags and containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that the symbol misleads consumers because most plastics are not 
recycled, a coalition of recyclers and environmentalists is seeking legislation 
in California and other states that would ban the use of the arrows on plastic 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is supported by attorneys general in 11 states, including 
California Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren. They say the arrows are confusing and 
have been inappropriately used as marketing tools by some plastics 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lance King, executive director of Californians Against Waste, the 
arrows are part of a numerical code devised by the industry to tell recyclers 
what kind of plastic a container is made of. The numerical code runs from 1 to 
7, although only plastics coded 1 or 2 are usually recycled. Thirty-nine states 
require use of this code in their recycling legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 King said confusion has arisen because consumers interpret the arrows as a 
sign that the container can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion is causing problems in curbside collection programs because some 
consumers mix non-recyclable containers, such as those for margarine or yogurt, 
with milk jugs or soda bottles, which can be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Solana Recyclers, which runs curbside collection programs in northern San 
Diego County, said the confusion drives up costs because the company must pay 
people to sort the plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We end up putting what we can't use in our trash bins, and we have to pay 
someone to haul it away," said Brooke Nash, the company's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 King said legislation eliminating the symbol has not yet been introduced in 
California, although he expects it will be within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the plastics industry said the industry is considering 
modifying its recycling code, including possible elimination of the arrows in 
states where the symbol is not required. Check it out: A Huntington Beach 
company is introducing a line of personal checks bearing autographed pictures 
of pro football star Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Paradon Industries USA, takes in $3 million annually from the 
sale of beauty products and designer personal checks, mostly through mail 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montana checks expand a lineup that includes checks aimed at golfers, 
nurses and aquarium lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks are available showing Montana wearing either his Kansas City Chiefs 
or San Francisco 49ers uniform -- absent a few details. Paradon marketing 
manager Ken Stark said the National Football League didn't give permission to 
reproduce the team insignias or player numbers. As a result, the checks depict 
Montana wearing a blank helmet and a jersey with an obscured number. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said the deal allows Montana to receive an unlimited supply of his own 
"signature checks" at no charge. No word on whether Montana plans to use them. 
Shaking up profits?: For $150, including shipping and handling, a Sherman Oaks 
company is selling earthquake property damage lists "with over 50,000 listings" 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When we called an advertised telephone number for the list, a clerk referred 
us to Peter Behman, president of Mortgage Money Investment Inc. Behman did not 
return calls seeking information about the list. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out the city of Los Angeles is also selling a list of damaged 
properties for $100. The city's list is available on paper or computer disk. 
The Van Nuys building and safety office alone has sold 90 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Usui of the city's Building and Safety Commission said it would be 
difficult for a private company to duplicate the four-week building inspection 
effort that went into compiling the city's list. While the city is not making 
money on its list, Usui said, there is no law preventing its resale for a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no copyright," he said. "It's a public document." Checking fees: 
Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based consumer group, said the state's leading 
financial institutions are paying between 1% and 2% on interest-bearing 
checking accounts, the lowest rates ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization surveyed 37 banks, savings and loans and credit unions to 
compare fees and rates on checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization said that if consumers aren't careful, monthly service fees, 
ranging from $3 to 12 depending on the financial institution, could wipe out 
any interest earned. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Consumer Action's survey, the minimum balance needed to avoid 
fees on interest-bearing accounts ranged from $9 at Home Savings of America to 
$1,500 at Bank of America and Wells Fargo and $2,000 at Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Home Savings doesn't pay interest on balances of less than $500. 
BofA, Wells Fargo and Sumitomo have no such restriction, the survey found.

STATE TO FORM TECHNOLOGY 'INCUBATORS'; ENVIRONMENT: PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WILL 
RECEIVE HELP IN ENTERING THE POLLUTION CLEANUP AND CONTROL BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To support California companies in the growing pollution cleanup and control 
business, the state is teaming with several cities, utilities and private 
companies to establish three new-technology "incubators," officials announced 
Thursday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, the state's secretary for environmental protection, and Julie 
M. Wright, secretary for trade and commerce, announced the incubators and other 
initiatives as they were flanked by members of the California Environmental 
Technology Partnership, a public-private group formed by Gov. Pete Wilson last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology centers will be low-cost business sites -- stocked with 
everything from office machines to financial advisers -- designed to help 
inventors and entrepreneurs set up their own companies. The first will open 
April 1 in San Jose. An incubator in Thousand Oaks will open in July, followed 
by one in Chula Vista in San Diego County by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental services "is a sunrise industry and one at which California 
should excel," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heyday of new environmental companies may have been the late 1980s, when 
industrywide growth was typically 20% annually. But California's industry can 
still expect growth of 6% to 7% in 1994 -- well ahead of the economy as a 
whole, said Grant Ferrier, a San Diego consultant who is co-chairman of the 
California Environmental Business Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier estimated that environmental services companies will create 9,000 jobs 
this year in California, which state officials say has lost 800,000 jobs in 
recent years. The state's industry records almost $20 billion a year in sales 
and employs nearly 200,000 people, directly and indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the golden savior," Ferrier said, "but it certainly is an area of 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets could hold much greater promise. Strock said California 
companies are positioned to do well in a potential world market worth $200 
billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But the race to enter the global market has attracted many players, he noted. 
New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts, as well as Germany and Japan, have 
already announced initiatives to promote their environmental service companies. 
</P>
<P>
 California's initiatives include an international conference and exposition to 
showcase the state's environmental technologies and services, to be held in San 
Diego in May. Sacramento also plans a campaign to persuade President Clinton to 
locate the offices of the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and North 
American Development Bank -- both mandated by the North American Free Trade 
Agreement -- in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The three incubators are intended to help small companies find capital, 
develop realistic business plans and commercialize their new products, Strock 
said. They will also help streamline permitting and other governmental 
processes.

FTC CLEARS WAY FOR THRIFY TO BUY PAYLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday said it has settled antitrust charges 
against TCH Corp., the owner of Los Angeles-based Thrifty Drug Stores, removing 
the only regulatory barrier to TCH's proposed $1.16-billion purchase of Kmart 
Corp.'s PayLess drugstore chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC had opposed the acquisition, contending that the merger would create a 
company that could control the drugstore market in five small communities in 
California, Washington and Oregon.TCH also owns the Bi-Mart drugstore chain, 
which operates 41 stores in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said Thrifty, Bi-Mart or PayLess dominate the five small markets and 
that competitors would not likely enter those communities after the two chains 
merged. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, TCH has agreed to sell five stores in those communities 
within a year after the deal is completed. TCH and its parent, Green Equity 
Investors, said they will sell Thrifty stores in the Central California 
communities of Bishop and Taft, as well as a store in Mt. Shasta in the 
northern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 TCH will also sell a Bi-Mart store in Florence, Ore., and a PayLess store in 
Ellensburg, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty has 497 stores -- all in California. PayLess, based in Wilsonville, 
Ore., has 578 stores in 12 western states.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: EUROPE TARGETS OVERSEAS DISTRIBUTOR; FILM: COMMISSIONER 
OPPOSES EXTENDING UNITED INTERNATIONAL PICTURES' ANTITRUST WAIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world of multibillion-dollar communications ventures, some realized and 
some not, nothing sounds more quaint than the business of physically delivering 
movies to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But foreign film distribution has become a hot-button issue in the new media 
world, as the same European executives grappling with plans for the information 
superhighway look for ways to stem the flow of Hollywood movies to their 
shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The first victory for audio visual representatives of the European Union 
(formerly known as the European Community) came last year, when they won a 
fight to exclude entertainment from the far-reaching General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. Now comes word that the group has set its sites on a 
specific American company: United International Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 UIP distributes movies overseas for Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and 
MGM/UA. The London-based joint venture, formed to save money on overhead, has 
existed in various configurations for more than 20 years. But its future has 
been thrown into jeopardy lately by Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European 
commissioner in charge of audiovisual issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinheiro, who's scheduled to address the American Film Market convention in 
Santa Monica on Tuesday, said this week that he opposes extending an antitrust 
waiver that was granted to UIP in 1989 and expired in July. One reason: 
Pinheiro charges that UIP has strong-armed European exhibitors into taking 
unpopular films in return for hits such as "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Any action against UIP would please European filmmakers. But for Hollywood, 
which receives about 50% of its box office revenue from overseas, such a move 
is regarded as a real threat. Universal Pictures Chairman Tom Pollock says the 
studios will go to the mat to protect UIP, but concedes that it could be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've just won a battle in GATT," Pollock said of the Europeans. 
"Obviously, it's not enough. That's one of the things we were worried about. If 
we couldn't get protected, things would get punitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some see UIP as an easy mark for the Europeans, since it's the only 
distribution company that represents the combined interests of three Hollywood 
studios. But it's also noteworthy that two of the studios aren't even 
American-owned. Universal is a unit of Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co., and MGM/UA is controlled by the French bank Credit Lyonnais. 
</P>
<P>
 UIP also says, with a surprising degree of candor, that it hasn't even done 
that well recently -- with MGM/UA and Paramount putting out comparatively few 
movies and Universal putting out few with European appeal except for "Jurassic 
Park." UIP controls roughly 18% of the European theatrical market, which in 
turn is 72%-controlled by Hollywood movies. Ironically, some feel that the 
company has already outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of talk about breaking it up," said one source. "One 
argument for that, as far as the studios are concerned, is that they don't 
really control the destiny of their product. They're basically turning it over 
to a third party." 
</P>
<P>
 As a UIP alternative, Universal, Paramount and MGM could start their own 
distribution companies or contract with outsiders. Each studio spends $20 
million a year on UIP -- roughly half the cost of running individual 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM and Paramount privately indicated that they will stand behind UIP. Pollock 
said the company still fulfills its mission. He said the Europeans are 
misguided if they think that breaking it up would reduce Hollywood's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "UIP doesn't introduce any movies into (the) European marketplace that 
wouldn't be introduced anyway," he said. "It simply allows for overhead to be 
shared among the three partners. If it was broken up, all of Universal's 
pictures would be distributed by Universal, and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Reilly, UIP's senior vice president and general counsel, says the 
company formally filed for a waiver extension in June, one month before the 
deadline. The Europeans have not responded. Reilly said he was "astonished" by 
Pinheiro's comments but noted that the EU competitiveness committee, not 
Pinheiro's audiovisual group, will ultimately decide the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The climate since June has been one in which the whole audiovisual sector 
became highly emotional and highly politicized," Reilly said. "But we feel that 
we have a good case." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinheiro was unavailable Thursday. Francisco da Silva, a member of his 
cabinet, acknowledged that the competitiveness committee will make the formal 
recommendation on UIP. But he added that Pinheiro intends to remain a powerful 
advocate for revoking its waiver. If that occurs, UIP's backers would have 
several months to reorganize their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pinheiro is against this exemption -- I'm putting it very plainly and 
clearly," Da Silva said. "He basically has stated his political line. We feel 
it distorts and disrupts the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Some still see hope for UIP, especially if it throws the European 
entertainment community some business by acquiring rights to films or 
co-financing productions. "They have to at least appear politically sensitive," 
said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Silva says it's premature to predict the outcome, but says the Europeans' 
resolve to protect and expand their own film industry shouldn't be 
underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not against American movies," Da Silva said. "But we do not want the 
market to be controlled by American movies. We also want a place of our own."

 * Exhibitors: AMC Entertainment Inc. said it raised $100 million selling 4 
million shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock at $25 a share.The 
offering was managed by underwriters Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities 
Corp.; Bear, Stearns & Co., and Smith Barney Shearson Inc. For the 39 weeks 
ended Dec. 30, AMC's revenue rose 46% to $448 million, thanks partly to summer 
box office hits such as "Jurassic Park" and "The Fugitive." Earnings climbed to 
$12.5 million from $2.6 million in the year-earlier period, including a 
$9.6-million gain from the sale of some assets. Kansas City-based AMC, which is 
headed by Chairman Stanley H. Durwood, was a pioneer in the development of the 
multiplex theater concept.

WIRELESS CABLE OPERATOR EYES L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an initiative that could do more to lower cable bills than the Federal 
Communications Commission's latest rate cut proposal, a wireless cable operator 
plans to offer 150 channels of programming by late next year in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country Wireless Inc., based in Riverside, has already signed up 42,000 
customers in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, prompting cable operators 
there to lower their rates and expand service to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The company transmits cable TV and broadcast channels into homes using 
microwaves, rooftop antennas and in-home converter boxes. It charges $18.95 a 
month for 26 broadcast and cable channels. Movie channels range from $4 to $7 
each. There is no installation fee. Those prices undercut local cable 
competitors by $3 to $5 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal drawback to the wireless system is that its signal cannot reach 
into some obstructed locations, such as canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 As it expands, Cross Country plans to offer 150 channels, with up to 40 of 
those dedicated to interactive classroom programs by participating colleges in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. Several stations would be dedicated to 
non-English programming, said Peter Frank, Cross Country president. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable, which has been around for 20 years, has been hampered by 
transmission technology problems and by limited access to programming. But with 
the development of digital technology, which compresses data so that a single 
broadcast channel can be turned into four or five, wireless is about to take 
off, its proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those true believers is Lowell Hussey, former senior vice president of 
marketing and programming for Time Warner Cable TV. He retired in 1990 at age 
37, promising himself that he wouldn't come back into the business until cable 
had a viable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed on eight months ago as operations director of Cross Country, which 
claims to be the largest privately held wireless company in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Aha! At last!' It's better than I thought it would be," said Hussey, 
who is on the road a lot these days, setting up expansion deals throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1992 Cable Act, Hussey said, the wireless industry was denied access 
to much programming. That hindrance, which had been encouraged by the powerful 
cable TV lobby, made it difficult for wireless companies to attract investors. 
The 1992 law made it illegal to withhold programming.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the six public wireless companies together have raised $500 million in 
the equity markets and are in the process of borrowing more, according to the 
Wireless Cable Assn. International in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country began offering service to the Inland Empire market by working 
with colleges and a church diocese in the area to apply to the Federal 
Communications Commission for a shared license. Some of the groups already had 
licenses to lease to Cross Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure anticipated an April, 1992, FCC freeze on new licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country plans a similar strategy in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
said company president Frank. He said the agreements are nearly completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cable competitors are also in the digital race. Pacific Bell and GTE 
California Inc. have said they will wire homes and schools for interactive 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 And DirectTV, a partnership between a division of Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
United States Satellite Broadcasting, said it will introduce small-dish 
satellite TV service as early as April. Cable Without Wires 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable television could enter the Orange and Los Angeles markets by 
next year to compete with cable companies. It would start service with 33 
channels, but with anticipated developments in digital and compression 
technology, could expand to 150. How wireless cable works: 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment building with MATV system. 
</P>
<P>
 Private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite receive station. 1. Programming is beamed via satellite to a 
receive/transmit station. 2. Signal is converted for multichannel, multi-point 
distribution. 3. Signal is transmitted via microwave. 4. Signal is picked up by 
antenna and converter and re-formed for TV reception. 5. Signal travels to a 
decoder box atop television, where it is unscrambled for viewing. Advantages * 
Less downgrading of signal in transmission. * Less equipment to malfunction and 
increase costs. Disadvantages * Microwaves travel in straight lines, so antenna 
must be placed in line of sight of transmitter. * Limited programming. Source:

 Forget the mud. The road to Woodstock's 25th anniversary concert is proving 
bumpy.Insiders say research favors "traditional" Woodstock era artists such as 
Crosby, Stills & Nash and the Grateful Dead. But there is also pressure to 
include contemporary bands. Chatter has the concert lasting two days and 
incorporating "classic" and contemporary acts. Offers in the $250,000 range are 
said to have gone out to several bands, including Guns N' Roses, Metallica, 
Nirvana and Soundgarden. Plans for a video, film and record deal have also 
complicated booking plans.

COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER; WIRELESS CABLE VENTURE IN O.C. COULD CUT BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Competition might do what Congress has had trouble pulling off -- lower cable 
television rates. 
</P>
<P>
 An Inland Empire company wants to offer so-called "wireless cable" programming 
of 150 channels by late next year in Orange and Los Angeles counties, a move 
that could cause cable operators to lower their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country Wireless Inc., based in Riverside, has signed up 42,000 
customers in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which has prompted cable 
operators there to lower rates and improve service to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 The company transmits cable TV and broadcast channels into homes using 
microwave, rooftop antennas and in-home converter boxes. It charges $18.95 for 
26 broadcast and cable channels. HBO costs another $7, while Showtime, Cinemax 
and the Disney Channel are $4 each. There is no installation fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Those prices undercut local competitors by $3 to $5 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest drawback to this wireless system is that its antenna towers cannot 
reach into some canyon areas or obstructed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As it expands westward, Cross Country plans to offer 150 channels, with up to 
40 of those offering interactive classroom programs by participating colleges 
in Orange and Los Angeles counties. And several stations would be devoted to 
non-English-language programming, said Peter Frank, Cross Country president. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable, which has been around for 20 years, has been hampered by 
transmission technology and by limited access to programming. With the 
development of digital technology, which compresses data so that a single 
broadcast channel can be turned into into four or five, wireless is about to 
take off, its proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these true believers is Lowell Hussey, former senior vice president of 
marketing and programming for Time-Warner Cable TV. He had retired in 1990 at 
age 37, and had promised himself that he wouldn't come back into the business 
until cable had a viable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed on eight months ago as operations director of Cross Country, which 
it says is the largest privately held wireless company in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Aha! At last!' It's better than I thought it would be," Hussey said 
from a hotel room. He is on the road a lot these days, setting up expansion 
deals throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the 1992 Cable Act, Hussey said, the wireless industry was denied access 
to much programming. The act made it illegal to withhold programming. That 
former hindrance, which was encouraged by a powerful cable TV lobby, had made 
it difficult for wireless companies to attract investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the six public wireless companies together have raised $500 million in 
the equity markets and are in the process of borrowing more, according to the 
Wireless Cable Assn. International in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country began offering service to the Inland Empire market by working 
with colleges and a church diocese in the area to apply to the Federal 
Communications Commission for a shared license. Some of the groups already had 
licenses to lease to Cross Country. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure anticipated an April, 1992, freeze on new licenses issued by the 
FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans a similar strategy in Orange and Los Angeles counties, said 
Cross Country President Frank. He said the agreements are nearly completed, but 
declined to identify schools with which he is negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital television technology, which several companies are now competing to 
bring to market, will allow wireless cable operators to compress signals and 
provide more channels. A wireless cable system is made up of as many as 33 
microwave frequencies. Cross Country plans to then use digital compressors to 
split them four or five times; thus, the 150-channel figure. 
</P>
<P>
 But other cable competitors may win the digital race. California's telephone 
companies, Pacific Bell and GTE California Inc., said recently that they will 
wire homes and schools for interactive programming. 
</P>
<P>
 And DirectTV, a partnership between a division of Hughes Aircraft Co. and 
United States Satellite Broadcasting, said it will produce small-dish satellite 
TV service as early as April. The dishes are to be priced around $800. The 
companies said they are planning 150 channels, sold in two packages costing $8 
to $35 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 On the proposed Cross County wireless system, the classroom programs from the 
schools would be interactive, according to Frank. In other words, a student 
could "raise" his or her electronic hand and be shown on a split screen with 
the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a major emphasis," said Frank from his office in Washington. 
"It's something we can offer that cable TV does not, for the most part." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Gordon, media resources director at UC Riverside, said the association 
with Cross Country has been beneficial. Revenue from the agreement has allowed 
the school to purchase new broadcasting equipment, though the public 
programming is still in its infancy. The university broadcasts one course per 
quarter but is planning to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of suspicion about whether it would come to pass," Gordon 
said. "But it has proven to have been a very wise decision on the university's 
part." Cross Country

 Satellite receive station. 1. Programming is beamed via satellite to a 
receive/transmit station. 2. Signal is converted for multichannel, multi-point 
distribution. 3. Signal is transmitted via microwave. 4. Signal is picked up by 
antenna and converter and re-formed for TV reception. 5. Signal travels to a 
decoder box atop television, where it is unscrambled for viewing. Advantages * 
Less downgrading of signal in transmission. * Less equipment to malfunction and 
increase costs. Disadvantages * Microwaves travel in straight lines, so antenna 
must be placed in line of sight of transmitter. * Limited programming. Source:

 BASF Cuts Emissions: BASF Corp. said that it has greatly reduced emissions of 
17 chemicals at its U.S. plants, including one in Anaheim. The giant 
Parsippany, N.J.-based chemical company cut emissions by 60% at seven plants 
around the nation as part of a project run by the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency. That exceeds the goal of the Industrial Toxics Project, 
better known as "33/50," which calls for a 50% reduction by 1995.

HYUNDAI LOOKS TO SCORE WITH BARKLEY; ADVERTISING: CAR MAKER HOPES NEW SONATA 
SPOT STARRING NBA TOUGH GUY WILL CHANGE WIMPY IMAGE.

 The Olympics are just about over, Tonya Harding is all but out of contention 
in women's figure skating and you're probably thinking you'll soon be able to 
turn on your TV without having another obnox . . . er, flamboyant athlete 
shoved in your face. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Late on the night of March 7 the glaring visage of basketball star Charles 
Barkley -- already a pitchman for Nike footwear and McDonald's hamburgers -- 
will blast forth from television screens across the land in a new campaign by 
Fountain Valley-based Hyundai Motor America. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second commercial shows a pickup basketball game in progress in a 
playground. A new car is parked in the lot. After establishing shots intended 
to make viewers think they're about to see another athletic shoe commercial, 
the camera cuts to the car, showing interior and exterior scenes as one of the 
players tosses a gym bag and basketball inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice-over, by actor Jeff Goldblum, reels off a list of features that 
include leather seats and "more room than a Lexus" and then announces that 
"it's a Sonata. From . . . Hyundai?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Barkley enters the scene, starts to climb inside and then stops, 
glares into the camera and demands: "You got a problem with that?" The thought 
of the hulking Barkley as spokesman for a Korean import may raise eyebrows, but 
Hyundai is banking on it also raising the driving public's consciousness about 
its newly remodeled Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad, developed for Hyundai by Backer Spielvogel Bates West in Irvine, 
debuts during the "Late Show With David Letterman" and then plays in prime time 
March 8 on "Roseanne" and the "John Larroquette Show," covering all three 
networks in two days. Subsequent airings will be on popular programs like 
"Seinfeld," "Coach" and "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai is hoping the ad will help establish an image that overrides its 
somewhat tarnished reputation as an inexpensive import with more than its share 
of mechanical troubles. Industry analysts say the car maker is producing better 
quality cars these days but hasn't been able to kill off the old image. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley could do that, said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, a 
Beverly Hills firm specializing in automotive advertising research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyundai could use some cachet," he said. "They really haven't any, and this 
might just put them into the limelight as the car that stands for an attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillson wonders, however, whether the "got a problem?" line might backfire by 
striking some consumers as too defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai officials say no. Barkley is meant to personify the car maker's new 
attitude, said N. Douglas Mazza, executive vice president and chief operating 
officer for Hyundai Motor America. "He's confident, straightforward and honest, 
just the right person to communicate the major strides Hyundai has achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton, who recently acknowledged that she 
didn't really eat Wheaties even though she touted them, Barkley does own a new 
1995 Hyundai Sonata. "He has the first one in the United States," said Hyundai 
spokesman Bill Wolfe. For the record, Barkley got his as part of the deal to do 
the ad campaign.

FIDELITY NATIONAL SAYS PROFIT MORE THAN DOUBLED IN 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Fidelity National Financial Inc., one of the nation's largest title insurance 
companies, said Thursday that its 1993 profit more than doubled to $36.3 
million, or $2.37 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with net income of $17.3 million, or $1.30 a share, a year 
earlier for the Irvine-based company.Revenues for the year rose 47% to $575.4 
million, compared to $392.3 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, president and chief executive, said in a statement that 
the company's underwriting subsidiaries, which provide title insurance to 
homeowners, benefited from a heavy wave of mortgage refinancing, a trend in 
which borrowers take advantage of lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank P. Willey, executive vice president and general counsel, added that 
corporate acquisitions and an increase in home resales, which produce higher 
premiums, also figured prominently in the record results. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company reported a 126% rise in earnings to $12 
million, or 76 cents a share, from $5.3 million, or 38 cents a share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly revenues were $163.5 million, up from $123.9 million a year earlier. 
Raymond Dirks, analyst at RAS Securities Corp., a New York research firm, said 
Fidelity has done well throughout the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said acquisitions of Security Title and Guaranty Co. in the first 
quarter of 1993 and Meridian Title Insurance Co. in 1992 added a combined 
$156.2 million in revenues and pretax earnings of $11.7 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dec. 31, the company reported cash and investment securities were $268.4 
million, up from $142.5 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity stock closed at $20.50 a share, up 25 cents. Foley led a private 
investment group that bought a controlling stake in Carl Karcher Enterprises 
Inc., the Anaheim fast-food chain, last December, which helped improve the 
personal finances of company founder Carl N. Karcher.

TOKOS POSTS $26-MILLION LOSS FOR 1993, CITES WRITE-OFFS 
</P>

 Tokos Medical Corp., a struggling maker of pregnancy monitors that recently 
cut 200 employees, Thursday reported an annual loss that included an $8-million 
charge against earnings for 1993. Tokos had a net loss of $26.4 million, or 
$1.35 a share, compared with net income of $6.5 million, or 37 cents a share, a 
year earlier. The loss included write-offs to cover the costs of layoffs, 
consolidating various administrative and manufacturing functions, and 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the company said it would cut back its use of staff who talk 
directly to patients using its pregnancy monitoring devices and eliminate 
in-house manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues for the fiscal year fell 24% to $120.8 million from $159.9 million a 
year earlier. For the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of $16.7 
million, or 98 cents a share, compared with net income of $698,000, or 4 cents 
a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues for the fourth quarter fell to $26.4 million from $39.2 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the restructuring charge, the company recorded a $4.3-million 
tax provision, or 25 cents per share, during the fourth quarter as an allowance 
for payment of possible future taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no surprises in this release," said Howard Rosencrans, analyst at 
HD Brous & Co., an investment bank in Great Neck, N.Y. "I think they have a 
bright future but are in a transitional phase now." Rosencrans remains upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
 He said a 17,000-patient study by researchers at the University of Mississippi 
indicated that 75% of women who are at risk of premature birth can be brought 
to full term through the use of Tokos' equipment. The study is due for 
publication in December in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said such a report could improve Tokos' reputation in the medical 
community, which has been skeptical because of poor results in previously 
published studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expected benefit from such a positive study, Rosencrans said he 
still expects Tokos to lose 50 cents a share in 1994. He said he did not rule 
out the possibility of a future merger with an industry rival. Joe Millsap, an 
analyst at investment bank Morgan Keegan & Co. in Memphis, Tenn., also was 
upbeat about Tokos' future, particularly as the company aggressively seeks new 
business with HMOs.

WESTERN NATIONAL PREPARING TO GO PUBLIC; FINANCE: APARTMENT GIANT HAS REQUESTED 
STATE APPROVAL TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PARTNERSHIPS TO FORM A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT 
TRUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Western National Group, the largest apartment developer and manager in Orange 
County, expects to go public with a real estate investment trust offering, 
according to documents filed with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A privately held company with more than $1 billion in assets and 26,909 
apartment units under management, Western National has asked the state for 
permission to consolidate the assets and liabilities of 65 existing 
partnerships -- its first step toward going public, according to the state 
Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 If the consolidation is approved, Western National would own and operate the 
various general and limited partnerships' portfolio of 71 apartment buildings 
and the company's headquarters building, all in Southern California, with a 
high concentration in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Western National Group . . . expects to qualify as a real estate investment 
trust, (and) will be the sole general partner of the operating partnership," 
the filing states. "The founders . . . have proposed the consolidation, the 
public offering and the refinancing primarily because these transactions would 
. . . (take) advantage of the currently favorable public market valuation of 
REIT equity securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Kozberg, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations, confirmed 
that the 30-year-old company has requested state approval to consolidate its 
partnerships, though a date for a public hearing on the matter has not been 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Western National hopes to sell its REIT this year and follow in the steps of 
the Irvine Co., which sold a portion of its apartment business to outside 
investors last year in a successful public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts have been popular recently on Wall Street; 
investors like their higher returns and the fact that REITs can pass most of 
their income to shareholders without being taxed, although the securities pose 
a higher risk to investors. Developers, often strapped for cash, view REITs as 
a way to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any public offering, the consolidation would have to be approved by 
enough of the limited partners to represent at least 70% of their total 
interests. It would also have to be approved by all of the general partners, 
the filing states. If the consolidation is approved, the general and limited 
partners, in exchange for giving up control, would receive units in the company 
that could be exchanged for stock in the REIT. 
</P>
<P>
 To go public with a REIT, the company would still have to file with the 
federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The dollar amount of the planned 
public offering, which would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, was not 
revealed in the state documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Western National, which employs 985 people, owns 10,489 apartment units in 
Southern California. Some it builds and operates for its own account; others it 
builds and manages under contract for clients like the Irvine Co. As of Jan. 3, 
its management company provided management services for 16,420 apartments in 90 
separate properties throughout California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Michael Hayde would not comment on the deal but in an 
earlier interview said his company had plans to start aggressively building 
apartments again. He said the credit crunch made construction and 
land-acquisition loans scarce last year, making it difficult to raise capital 
for building. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said in the March, 1993, interview that the company's future growth 
would be sparked by acquiring management companies, so Western National could 
be planning to use the REIT proceeds for such acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do this REIT, they have to consolidate their partnerships. Western 
National couldn't come to the public markets unless they did that," said Craig 
Leupold, an analyst with Green Street Advisors Inc. in Newport Beach, which 
advises institutional investors on REITs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to figure out how many units they are going to give to all these 
partnerships. From this point forward, it's hard to say how long it will take 
for them to get to the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Orange County by Merton Douglas, the company was initially called 
Income Property Services. In 1980, Douglas stepped down and a partnership group 
was formed to buy the company, which changed its name to Western National 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the company started building large apartment complexes throughout 
Orange County and formed partnerships with such entities as the William Lyon 
Co., the Santa Margarita Co. and Chevron Land & Development. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by the late 1980s, Western National was one of the first to recognize 
that a real estate downturn was coming and stopped buying land. Instead, the 
company survived the slowdown by doing work for others under contract. It 
became a major in-house contract apartment developer for the Irvine Co.'s 
apartment division, now a public company called Irvine Apartment Communities. 
In 1989, the company started a home building group, Western National Homes.

<P>
 Reacting to California's loss of defense industry jobs, the U.S. Bureau of 
Export Administration's western regional office in Newport Beach will set up 
seminars and workshops this year around the state to help steer companies into 
foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the seminars have been designed with defense-related firms in mind, 
commercial, non-defense firms can also benefit," said Commerce Secretary Ronald 
M. Brown in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects being covered range from coping with industrial spying to how to 
tap into federal research and development contracts. Each workshop is four 
hours and ranges in cost from $25 to $85. 
</P>
<P>
 Sites include Los Angeles, San Diego and Riverside. Only one session, however, 
is scheduled in Orange County. That workshop is on federal, state and private 
sector financial assistance and is slated for Sept. 8 in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people interested in more information on the program can call the 
regional office at (714) 660-1960.

VOTE PAVES WAY FOR QLOGIC SPINOFF FROM EMULEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emulex Corp. and its subsidiary QLogic Corp. will be split into two separate, 
publicly traded technology companies as a result of a shareholder vote on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders voted at a special meeting to approve a plan for a tax-free 
distribution of common stock for QLogic in a transaction known as a one-for-two 
reverse stock split. 
</P>
<P>
 In the deal, an Emulex shareholder who owns 100 shares would end up with 50 
shares of Emulex stock and 50 shares of QLogic stock. The approval opens the 
way for QLogic's spinoff.  
</P>
<P>
 The deal finally allows the companies, which have operated separately in 
anticipation of the spinoff, to go their own ways. Both firms already report 
separate financial results and occupy different buildings at the Emulex Corp.'s 
headquarters in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 QLogic has about 120 employees and makes computer chips based on the Small 
Computer System Interface, or SCSI (pronounced scuzzy ), standard for 
connecting devices, such as printers to personal computers. Emulex, meanwhile, 
will concentrate on the business of its other subsidiary, the Network Systems 
Division, which has 300 employees and focuses on making hardware and software 
that connect computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction is now awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the companies said. Both companies would trade on the Nasdaq 
exchange.

O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; CONDUCTOR LOOKS BEHIND THE NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the key players in an orchestral concert, according to one prominent 
conductor, sits in front of the stage, not on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience plays an enormous role in the success of a concert, but they 
never know that," Charles Dutoit, 57, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the public's concentration is great, you can take more time, feel more 
tension in the hall, which is always better for the performance. When the 
public is not concentrating, by coughing or turning pages, it disturbs us. We 
tend to become a little bit impatient and go faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutoit was speaking from his office in Montreal, where he has been music 
director of the Montreal Symphony since 1977. He became music director of the 
Orchestre National de France in 1991; it is the French group he is taking on an 
American tour, with stops in Costa Mesa on Sunday and in Cerritos on (March 4). 
</P>
<P>
 American audiences, unfortunately, "tend to be noisy," he said. "In Germany 
and Japan, it's the opposite, a religion almost. You have the public really 
listening because (a concert) is an important event. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan, audiences are very quiet -- partly because it's an event, but also 
because it's a discipline and they don't want to disturb others." 
</P>
<P>
 Under any circumstances, though, "a concert is always a compromise," Dutoit 
said, quickly adding that " compromise is much too strong a word. But it is 
true one has to come in with strong ideas of what to do and how to make your 
message come through. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, though, I do not try to be an 'original' interpreter. I try to see 
what is behind the notes, what is the truth, to digest that without having the 
pretensions of claiming, 'I have the truth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It bothers Dutoit to hear anyone claim they have found "the truth" about 
music. In this regard, he feels that period-practice specialists have been 
helpful. They rejected the earlier "German tradition of the later 19th Century, 
(which) was so heavy on certain works. And critics (then) were saying (of this 
approach), 'This is the truth. This is the reference for this music,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, the fact that the German tradition was very heavy doesn't mean it 
was wrong. No one is arguing about the profound understanding of (Wilhelm 
Furtwangler and such) people. When I was a kid, I heard Furtwangler conducting. 
It was very impressive. It was extremely impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we just talk about interpretation, about style, and also about music 
being a living art, then there is room for different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately now, people are trying to fight these traditions and restore the 
music of the early 19th Century in its color, not in the post-Wagerian color, 
but genuine color of the 1820s, whose models were very classical. Not with that 
German heaviness and sickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the wheel has come full circle, and this movement itself has 
succumbed to orthodoxy. "It's useful as long as (period practitioners) are not 
pretentious, saying, 'This was the way it was played,' " Dutoit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some critics (today) just freeze these interpretations, saying it's 
impossible to play Haydn and Mozart unless it's played on period instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutoit demonstrates his attitude toward such rigidity by taking a gun -- 
literally -- to several Canadian music critics in a recently videotaped 
recording of Prokofiev's "Classical Symphony" with the Montreal orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke -- a divertissement, " he said. "The musicians are in 
hairdresser's salon. I'm holding a gun at the end and kill three critics who 
were yawning at the concert. Funny enough, the three critics on this film are 
real critics. They had a good sense of humor. They came to be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Prokofiev's symphony, he made other experimental videos and 
laser discs, including one of Ravel's "Bolero" in which he appears as "the Pope 
and the Devil at the end. . . . This one I like less because it's a bit much." 
</P>
<P>
 He is doubtful, though, whether any such technological innovations will draw 
new audiences to concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our audience, which made our life so beautiful in the last two or three 
decades, is aging," he said, "and younger people have so much to do, not only 
TV and interactive TV, there are lots of things they have to learn. It is a 
completely different attitude than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the time being, we can compromise. We can find more popular programs and 
at least adjust slowly. But in the long term, in the final analysis, this may 
not be a good move -- going too much toward the public. You just dig your grave 
a little more, and contact with other (more difficult) music is going to be 
more and more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I don't know what the symphony orchestra is going to become in the 
21st Century. All of us are asking the same questions. We all understand the 
situation. No one has found the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles Dutoit will conduct the Orchestre National de France in music by 
Ravel, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky (as arranged by Ravel) on Sunday at 3 p.m. at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Vladimir Spivakov will be the soloist in Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. The 
program is sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. $15 to $47. 
(714) 553-2422.  
</P>
<P>
 Dutoit will also conduct the orchestra in works by Berlioz and Debussy on 
March 4 at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center Court 
Drive, Cerritos. $35 to $47. (800) 300-4345.

TV RATING EASILY BEATS PAST OLYMPICS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Surpassing predictions by advertising and television executives, CBS' coverage 
of Wednesday's Winter Olympics drew the third-highest rating for any sporting 
event and the eighth-largest total audience of any sponsored program in U.S. 
television history. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecast, which included Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding in the women's 
figure skating technical program competition, attracted 64% of the prime-time 
audience, with an estimated 110,530,000 people watching at least part of the 
three-hour presentation from Norway, according to figures released Thursday by 
the A.C. Nielsen Co.  
</P>
<P>
 CBS got a 48.5 rating for the broadcast (the rating is a percentage of the 
number of U.S. TV households that are tuned in). CBS' coverage of Super Bowl 
XVI in 1982, between the Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers, 
remains the highest rated sports event with a 49.1. Super Bowl XVII the 
following year on NBC is second with a 48.6. The highest-rated program of all 
time is the final episode of "MASH," which got a 60.2 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics telecast, which also included coverage of Bonnie Blair's victory 
in the women's 1,000-meter speedskating and of the men's giant slalom ski race, 
easily beat the previous Olympic record -- a 33.3 on Sept. 4, 1972, on ABC, 
which featured swimmer Mark Spitz winning his unprecedented seventh gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-area ratings surpassed the national figures, with KCBS-TV Channel 
2 drawing a 49.4 rating and 65% of the audience. The station's 11 p.m. 
newscast, which immediately followed the skating, had a 26 rating, which 
station officials said they believed was its highest since the 26.8 it had Feb. 
28, 1983, following the final episode of "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
 The long-anticipated showdown between Kerrigan and Harding also helped 
television viewing levels soar throughout the nation. An average of 71.4 
million of the 94.2 million households with televisions -- 75.8% -- had their 
televisions on during prime time. That marked a 12.3% increase over the 
previous Wednesday and a 13.5% leap over Feb. 9, the last Wednesday before the 
start of the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the prime-time figure of 76.4% surpassed that of coverage of 
two recent cataclysmic events to hit the region: the first full day of civil 
unrest on April 30, 1992, (71%) and the first round of Southern California 
wildfires last Oct. 27 (67%).

'93 SALES BREAK SOUND BARRIER; POP MUSIC: ALBUM AND VIDEO SALES HIT A RECORD 
$10 BILLION, BUT SOME SAY THAT MAY BE INFLATED BECAUSE STATISTICS MEASURE 
PRODUCTS SHIPPED -- NOT ACTUALLY SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Annual record and music video sales broke the $10-billion barrier for the 
first time ever in 1993, the Recording Assn. of America announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally reached the milestone," said Jay Berman, chief executive officer 
of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the Washington-based trade group 
that represents all the major record companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that made 1993 such an amazing year was the diverse cross section 
of strong albums the industry released. We aren't just relying on a few 
superstars anymore. We've got a bunch of new artists out there now selling 
millions of albums. That's a really healthy sign for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The new record -- which had been expected, following the year-end sales surge 
-- represented a sales gain for record companies of 11.3% over 
association-reported sales in 1992. Overall unit shipments increased almost 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic dollar volume increase in 1993 can be attributed primarily to a 
22% leap in compact disc sales, which are priced significantly higher than 
cassettes. According to the association, consumers spent $6.5 billion for 495.4 
million CDs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassette sales continued to take a back seat to CDs in 1993, accounting for 
about $2.9 billion in revenue. Music video sales grossed an estimated $213 
million while single recordings in CD, cassette and vinyl formats generated 
more than $400 million, according to the association. All figures are 
calculated at suggested list price. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade group's sales statistics are based on company shipments of 955.6 
million compact discs, cassettes, vinyl recordings and music videos -- up from 
895.5 million units in 1992. The statistics measure products shipped to stores 
-- not actually sold to customers -- including items shipped directly through 
record clubs and mail-order catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some record store owners, however, question whether the $10-billion figure was 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the industry is expanding and I think just about all record retailers 
had a good year in 1993, I would guess that the total (dollar) number would be 
less if it was based on the actual price that records are sold for in stores," 
said Lew Garrett, vice president of purchasing at the Canton, Ohio-based 
396-outlet Camelot Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Because American consumers are reluctant to pay full price for compact discs, 
merchants said they often discount CDs significantly -- sometimes as low as $5 
off the $16.98 or $17.98 suggested retail price tag. Record companies charge 
merchants about $10.70 for top-of-the-line CDs, which cost less than $6 to make 
and distribute, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers also suggested that the association may have overestimated revenues 
generated from product shipped to an increasing number of discount houses such 
as Target and Circuit City, some of which sell Top 40 compact discs below cost 
at $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest complaint voiced by merchants, however, focused on the surge in 
record club and mail-order sales -- accounting for more than $1.5 billion in 
1993 from which they reaped no income. Lawyers who represent recording artists 
have also privately voiced concern over the rise in record club sales because 
artists and composers lose a significant portion of their earnings on such 
transactions.

FARRAKHAN APPEARANCE ON 'ARSENIO' SPARKS FUROR; TELEVISION: PROTESTERS FEAR 
NATION OF ISLAM LEADER, A GUEST ON TONIGHT'S SHOW, WILL BE GIVEN AN UNCONTESTED 
FORUM TO PUT FORTH HIS CONTROVERSIAL VIEWS.

<P>
 The scheduled appearance tonight of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show" has sparked protests from religious and gay 
organizations who fear Farrakhan will be given an uncontested forum to put 
forth his controversial views on whites, Jews and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simon Wiesenthal Center has urged KCOP-TV Channel 13 and other stations 
around the country not to broadcast the program. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, 
associate dean of the Los Angeles-based center, said in a letter to the 
stations that "we do not believe that an entertainer hosting an entertainment 
program should provide Louis Farrakhan a comfortable, cozy and legitimizing 
platform at a time when Farrakhan and his followers are busy spreading their 
divisive rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League, the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and the Gay and 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/L.A. also criticized the appearance in a 
full-page ad in Thursday's Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ad featured inflammatory quotes from Farrakhan on a variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 KCOP-TV officials say they will run Hall's show in its regular 11:30 p.m. 
slot, but with a disclaimer saying that the station does not necessarily 
endorse the views expressed on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hall's producers said they plan to feature pre-taped questions and 
statements during the show from those who wish to comment on Farrakhan's views. 
Among those who taped segments this week was Jewish Defense League leader Irv 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement last week, Hall said, "As always, I feel a strong 
responsibility to not only use my late-night arena for entertainment, but also 
as a vehicle to open dialogue as we strive for peace and harmony in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The protests largely stem from Farrakhan's recent refusal to denounce an 
anti-Semitic remark from one of his aides last November. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech given at Kean College in Union, N.J., aide Khalid Abdul Muhammad 
attacked Jews as "the bloodsuckers of the black nation," praised Hitler as 
"wickedly great" and characterized the Pope as "a cracker." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan earlier this month suspended Muhammad after the Congressional Black 
Caucus and the U.S. Senate proclaimed their disapproval of the remarks. But 
Farrakhan added, "I stand by the truths that he spoke." He also accused the 
Anti-Defamation League and Vice President Al Gore, who both criticized 
Muhammad's statements, of being anti-black.

AN APPRECIATION; WHEREVER THE FOUR WINDS BLOW, DINAH SHORE WILL BE MISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A greatly talented generation of performers, their numbers now sadly 
diminished, rode the waves of radio to early acclaim and enduring popularity. 
There are those of us who first encountered the mellow and lilting voice of 
Dinah Shore on those 15-minute early evening broadcasts that were one of the 
glories of radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore, who died on Thursday at 76 after a brief illness, was from early days 
different from most of the other vocalists of her time. She was not simply an 
easily identifiable voice, which lent a sweet melancholy to "Blues in the 
Night," the establishing hit of her career; she was also a personality. 
</P>
<P>
 From her Tennessee origins, she retained a charming hint of accent that seemed 
to reflect perfectly an open, sunny, amusing, relaxed and beguiling nature. She 
talked as well as she sang, with the same inviting warmth. She adorned and sang 
her way through a number of movies, none really memorable, but her finest hours 
belonged to television, where she could in a real sense be herself, taking an 
unfeigned delight in the talents of her guests. 
</P>
<P>
 (The disappearance of the variety show from television is one of the 
impoverishments of our day, and the death of Dinah Shore is not least a 
reminder of how expert and enjoyable her Sunday-night Chevy show was for all 
those years, all those years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her charm extended to print as well. She loved to cook and, inspired by her 
mother, cooked very tastily indeed. "The Dinah Shore Cook Book" (Doubleday, 
1983), with her autobiographical introduction, is remarkable in its 
conversational intimacy. Fanny Farmer is not a lot of laughs, very 
schoolmarm-like in fact; Dinah Shore is a gracious hostess, swapping recipes 
and hints after a really good meal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her hints, to keep the food from getting cold at a buffet dinner, was 
to command the ladies to take two plates, one for the gent on their left, or 
for the gents to do the same for the adjoining ladies. She employed the system 
one night when I was among her visitors, and what she also knew was that the 
system was a great ice-breaker for guests who were perhaps just getting 
acquainted. (Her circle of friends was wide and amazingly various.) 
</P>
<P>
 A car radio, in a far different day for the medium, gave me the news that 
Dinah Shore had left us, and I found myself remembering what it had been like, 
in a small and distant town, to be in the listening audience in those 
pre-television days, linked to the larger world by all those extraordinary 
voices: Jack Benny and Fred Allen, Elmer Davis and Edward R. Murrow, and, 
inviting us to hear the whistle blowing its own blues in the night, the 
wonderful, irreplaceable Dinah Shore.

CARLENE CARTER'S AT HOME NOW IN COUNTRY MUSIC; POP MUSIC: ONCE THE SINGER 
THOUGHT HER BLEND OF STYLES MADE HER A MISFIT. THEN THE ESTABLISHMENT CHANGED, 
AND NOW 'I DON'T HAVE TO COMPROMISE MYSELF TO FIT IN,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Carlene Carter finally found a niche on the country music charts in 1990, 
it was billed as the prodigal daughter's return. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Carter sees it, it was less a case of her repenting the profligate ways 
of a rowdy rocker than of the country establishment's realizing that country 
and rock can form a circle that need not be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's heritage is as country as you can get: the Carter Family, from which 
she sprang, started recording in 1927, making it literally the first family of 
country music. Carlene's mother, June Carter Cash, is a lifelong country 
trouper. Her father, Carl Smith, was a honky-tonk singer who had dozens of hits 
in the 1950s and '60s. Johnny Cash is her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Carter got her chance to make records in the late '70s, she heard 
London calling, not Nashville. She moved to England and fell in with some of 
Britain's best rock musicians, including guitarist Dave Edmunds, Graham 
Parker's band the Rumour, and her then-husband Nick Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, Carter had built a cult following and a reputation as a lively, brash 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was having deep doubts whether her blend of rock, pop and country 
influences could fit anywhere in the music industry's marketing spectrum. She 
considered giving up her recording career and retreating to a Tennessee farm 
where she would raise horses and concentrate on writing songs for other 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely wasn't country enough for the country market then," Carter said 
in her friendly twang during a recent lunch interview at a Beverly Hills burger 
house. "If you listened to country radio then, nothing I did fit in." By the 
late '80s, though, "I started listening to it and familiarizing myself with 
what was going on. I felt, 'It's not that different from what I do. Maybe 
there's a place for me now. I don't have to compromise myself to fit in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her career revival began in 1988, when she hooked up with bassist Howie 
Epstein of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers. They began working on songs at Epstein's 
home studio in Beverly Hills. The result was Carter's 1990 comeback album, "I 
Fell in Love." The zestful title song celebrated the romance that blossomed 
from the couple's working partnership, and it proved to be the single that 
established Carter as a country music contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and Epstein worked slowly and painstakingly on her current album, 
"Little Love Letters." They came up with as richly varied and formula-resistant 
an album as mainstream country music can accommodate, but the resulting 
three-year lapse between releases was far more than Carter's label, Giant 
Records, would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record company was saying, 'It's done,' and Howie and I were both saying, 
'It's not done,' " Carter recalled. "We stuck to our guns, and it caused a lot 
of friction, business-wise. (In terms of) planning my career, it wasn't the 
best thing to do, but I would have had a much inferior record to this one. It's 
better to have something that people are going to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 The album, like "I Fell in Love," has been a moderate success. Its first 
single, "Every Little Thing," hit No. 3 on the Billboard country singles chart 
last year, but the follow-up, the ballad "Unbreakable Heart," failed to crack 
the Top 50. The new single, "I Love You 'Cause I Want To," finds the 
38-year-old mother of two at her sassiest, augmented by an R&B-style horn 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter is determined not to allow three years to lapse between albums again. 
With Epstein committed to producing an album for John Prine and touring with 
Petty, she will look toward Nashville for the first time, working with James 
Stroud, a hot producer whose credits include Clint Black, Tracy Lawrence, John 
Anderson and Merle Haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of excited to see what kind of record I'll make with someone who's 
in the wheel in Nashville," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter isn't bashful about voicing ambitions that run toward gold albums 
(something she hasn't yet achieved) and awards nominations. At the same time, 
she maintains the sense of perspective of a performer who six years ago had 
thought her career as a recording artist was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Her primary motivation, she said, is "to be an entertainer, not somebody who 
topped the charts or won female vocalist of the year. I would just like to be 
able to pay my bills, get my kids through college."

SHE'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL NIGHT OWL; POP MUSIC: ANDREA 'ENTHAL, KPFK'S '12 O'CLOCK 
ROCK' HOST FOR 13 YEARS, PLAYS THE MUSIC YOU WON'T HEAR ON KROQ, KLOS OR KNAC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Every Saturday night from midnight to 6 a.m., Andrea 'Enthal spins the latest 
underground rock records as host of "12 O'Clock Rock" on KPFK-FM (90.7). With 
her becalmed voice and unpretentious aura of hip authority, she seems 
tailor-made for the late-night FM airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reality, 'Enthal is anything but your typical rock 'n' roll night owl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm usually in bed by 10 o'clock!" she says with a laugh. "I tend to fake 
being a night person. On Sunday and Monday I go through jet lag. . . . When I'm 
driving home (from the station in Studio City to Agoura Hills) after the show, 
there's this service station that I sometimes pull behind to take a nap." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat amazingly, 'Enthal has been sacrificing her preferred Saturday 
evening bedtime for the past 13 years. That's 13 years without getting paid by 
the publicly supported radio station and sans an extended vacation from "12 
O'Clock Rock." 'Enthal says she hosts the program 50 to 51 weeks out of the 
year. Even her rare Saturday night off is usually due to being preempted rather 
than personal choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I haven't been too sick on a Saturday night to do the show," she 
says. "I realize that if I'm going to bother to do the program, I should do it 
and not farm it out." 
</P>
<P>
 "12 O'Clock Rock" is clearly a labor of love for 'Enthal, 39. (She legally 
shortened her name from Rosenthal.) The program allows her the opportunity to 
expose music that has virtually no chance of getting commercial air play. 
</P>
<P>
 Working within KPFK's relatively unfettered creative atmosphere, 'Enthal 
presents artists who are usually recognizable to only the most ardent 
underground rock fan. The program is composed mostly of unknown, do-it-yourself 
bands such as Drag King, Polvo and Totem Pole of Losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many college and public-radio stations that program rock music, 'Enthal 
rarely plays records associated with major labels. The only big label record to 
infiltrate "12 O'Clock Rock" in 1993 was a disc by the Butthole Surfers, a 
former independent-label band now signed to Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not choosing these records to be 'indie' (elitist)," 'Enthal says. "There 
is no great shame in being on a major label. Just because nine other records 
that (label) put out before you sucked doesn't mean your record sucks because 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there is a conscious decision to play music that cannot otherwise be 
heard. Some people feel that if they listen to (alternative rock station) KROQ, 
(mainstream-classic rock station) KLOS and (heavy-metal oriented) KNAC, that 
they've heard all the music out there. But maybe only 12 (new) records are 
being played on each of those stations (at a given time). Last year I received 
2,507 records that didn't get played on KROQ, KLOS or KNAC." 
</P>
<P>
 'Enthal is one of the few remaining rock radio hosts who staunchly support the 
vinyl record format. "12 O'Clock Rock" only occasionally features music on 
compact disc, which she finds sterile sounding and lacking the warmth of vinyl 
records. 'Enthal also believes the higher price of CDs discourages consumers 
from taking a chance on new, unpublicized bands. "Nobody is going to pay $15 
for an unknown band," she complains. "(The record buyer) is channeled to buy 
the old Beatle album which they've already heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Vinyl records may be nearly extinct on a major market level. But according to 
'Enthal, vinyl singles are flourishing in the rock underground. Since 1991, the 
number of 7-inch singles she's received from independent bands in locations as 
diverse as Indiana and Slovenia has increased by more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 'Enthal likens the current explosion of garage bands making self-financed 
records to the grass-roots punk rock explosion of the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems every band in every garage in America has sprouted a label in order 
to release their own singles," says 'Enthal, who also works as a free-lance 
rock journalist. "It frustrates the hell out of me that the mainstream (media) 
only sees Nirvana and hasn't picked up on this whole explosion of 40,000 other 
bands. They saw (punk rock) in '77, but they can't see that this is even bigger 
than '77. This involves (many more bands)." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Pennsylvania, 'Enthal grew up with a minimal interest in popular 
music. But after hearing the iconoclastic group Pere Ubu during the height of 
the punk movement, she was hooked by this new wave of revolutionary bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years of hosting "12 O'Clock Rock" hasn't dulled any of 'Enthal's 
enthusiasm for underground rock. "I'm excited to find each of these bands," she 
says. "That's where the (spirit) of rock really is -- it's somebody in a garage 
having a good time playing for their 12 friends and giving it up after three 
years to go live the rest of their lives. That's the reality of music. The 
reality isn't about being a drugged-out rock star any more than the reality of 
playing basketball means everybody is going to be in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
 As for 'Enthal, she's clearly not ready for a life without "12 O'Clock Rock." 
She's very willing to host the show into her doddering old age. "Assuming no 
big diseases get me and they don't throw me out, yes, I will be bringing my 
rocking chair," she says.

SHOUTING NEWS OF A SPOKEN-WORD RENAISSANCE; POETRY: JUMPING ON AN EXPLOSION OF 
INTEREST, MTV OFFERS 'FIGHTIN' WORDZ,' HAS MADE YOUNG BARDS THE ONLY 
NON-MUSICAL FOCUS OF AN 'UNPLUGGED' SHOW AND IS SPONSORING A NATIONAL 'FREE 
YOUR MIND' TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER CATLIN, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MTV, with its incessant music videos, was expected to lower literary 
aspirations of our youth, dumb 'em down, extracting them from the linear world 
of words once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of MTV is "Beavis and Butt-head" (where Butt-head snarls at any 
rock videos with written words: "If I wanted to read, I'd go to school"). 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping on the explosion of spoken-word performance and poetry slams, MTV has 
produced commercial-sized bites of "Fightin' Wordz" from young poets. It also 
made the young bards the only non-musical focus of an "Unplugged" show and is 
sponsoring a national "Free Your Mind" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Music does find its way into the tour, of course. Amplifiers may be more 
common than lecterns in this poetry swing. One of the three poets, John S. 
Hall, may be better known as front man for his band King Missile but he 
performs on the current tour without music. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other poets who have been seen on MTV spots and on "Unplugged," however, 
will add musicians to their usual solo stand-up readings. Reg E. Gaines, known 
for his powerful poem "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans," will have some 
musical backing, and poet Maggie Estep will be backed by her full band, I Love 
Everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tour stops have been enhanced by bigger-name recording artists, including 
Speech from Arrested Development, rapper MC Lyte and spoken-word ground-breaker 
Gil-Scott Heron as well as the MTV VJ Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 For King Missile's Hall, the spoken-word tour is a return to something that 
preceded his band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always considered what I've done with Missile half spoken word and half 
song," he says from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, some of the New York band's best-known material from "Detachable 
Penis" and "Martin Scorsese" was nothing more than spoken rants over music, 
done with a passion that takes them out of the realm of mere readings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was going to poetry readings in New York 10 years ago," Hall says, 
"there was a lot of great writing, but there weren't great readers, and they 
weren't particularly interested in how they were presenting their work. I saw 
this as an opportunity. I could go and maybe not write so well, but I could 
scream or have some urgency to my delivery that could get some kind of 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of people complimented my writing. But mostly it's a matter of being 
noticed. Presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as visual presentation is half the effect of an MTV video, so is it an 
important part of the spoken-word artist. Says Estep, also calling from 
Florida, "For me, there are some incredible writers who just can't hold an 
audience's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Estep, who represents the new poetry-slam generation as covergirl on the 
current High Times magazine, says her brand of delivery is "some sort of hybrid 
of rap, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of the new-style poets, the actual literary artifact -- the book -- 
comes last. "It's ironic, when I was starting out," she says, "I just wrote and 
wasn't doing readings or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Too shy to get up on stage, she had to be talked into doing a reading. "It was 
a fluke," she says. "I was writing and someone dragged me to an open-mike 
situation. I read and did really well. I seemed to have an immediate affinity 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of how my performance style developed. I was so scared. I was 
very introverted, very shy. I got so nervous, I'd just rush through things and 
just pace. It evolved into my signature." 
</P>
<P>
 And once she did, she found she could plug into a new personality perfectly 
suited for the poetry-slam world. Since then, she has been featured in the PBS 
special "Words in Your Face," been part of New York's four-person team at last 
year's National Poetry Slam, and has gone on the Nuyorican Poets Live tour 
(after the Nuyorican Poets Cafe) before the current "Free Your Mind" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, the publishers are coming to me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cover on High Times, where she is declared "leader of the 
spoken-word pack," Estep says, "I've kept it hidden from Mom. It's funny 
because I haven't smoked pot in years. I think their writers were a little 
disgruntled with us. They kept asking us, 'Do you all get high to write?' Only 
one guy drank beer." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a downside to being trendy -- bad poets, audiences more interested in 
the nuevo-beatnik scene than the words, exploiters right and left. But it has 
helped the poets involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it's great," Estep says. "It means I'm making a living doing something 
that's almost unheard of. I'm very lucky it got trendy. I don't have a problem 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Hall: "If television can be a part of a trend that opens up the field a 
bit, it's fine by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall says "there's a football field of overlap" between what spoken-word 
artists do and the work of performance artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people read from pieces of paper, we tend to call them poets," he says. 
"When some people memorize their stuff, we call them performance artists." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hall's mind, the spoken-word world would include anyone from Spalding Gray 
and Lydia Lunch to Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone who has played to rock audiences and the poetry crowds, Hall 
notices that on the current tour, "the audiences are quieter, they're listening 
to the words. At the same time, they don't respond as boisterously. The 
response is enthusiastic, but they're not screaming and yelling, 'Encore! 
encore!' It's respectful receptivity, more than it is a party." 
</P>
<P>
 And certainly, there's no moshing at these poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the changes, however, have to do with the fact that nothing stronger 
than coffee is served at these performances. "I noticed that not as many women 
flirt with me after the show," Hall notes, "and I figured it out: They're not 
drunk."

THEATER / RICK VANDERKNYFF; MAKING IT UP AS HE GOES ALONG; DIRECTOR, PLAYWRIGHT 
AND ACTING INSTRUCTOR GREG ATKINS HAPPENED INTO WRITING A BOOK ON IMPROV 
</P>

<P>
 T wo old friends are waiting for a bus in Miami. A bee buzzes around them. 
Then another. Then another. Now a swarm of bees surrounds them.  
</P>
<P>
 Although this may read like the setup for a scene from "America's Funniest 
Home Videos," it's actually an exercise from "Improv! A Handbook for the Actor" 
(Heinemann, $13.95), by Greg Atkins, an active playwright, director and acting 
instructor in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested scenario is from "Bus Stop," a playwriting exercise for two 
actors that forces performers to create their own scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Foreign Film," an exercise for four actors, two actors create a scene from 
an imaginary foreign-language film, speaking only gibberish, while the two 
remaining actors translate the scene into English. In "Age Walk," a group of 
actors walks in a circle; as someone calls out a series of ages, the actors 
become that age. 
</P>
<P>
 "My students tend to be very open to trying anything," Atkins said during an 
interview in the Costa Mesa courtyard outside South Coast Repertory, where he 
teaches in the conservatory programs for both young and adult actors. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the exercises, he explained, is to "liberate spontaneity," to 
help actors lose their fear, make decisions and "think quickly on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Many actors, he said, spend a lot of time on the physical aspects of 
performing but not enough on the mental: "This book breaks down the acting 
process to the basic components." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins has taught improvisation and other topics related to acting for 13 
years at SCR. In that time, he's developed an approach to improvisation that he 
expands in the book, his first. Diane Doyle, founder and director of the Young 
Conservatory, "literally gave me a playground here to explore," Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach works to improve several aspects of acting, he said, but it also 
works with students who may never act on stage, who take his classes to gain 
poise and confidence in other professions and in their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Improv, Atkins said, is the "jazz of theater. . . . You're up there jamming, 
creating." Improvisation can be an end in itself -- more than one improv group 
has been born in Atkins' classes -- but also, and perhaps more important, it 
sharpens general performing and writing skills and the ability to cope in 
audition situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the improv I do really helps me as a playwright," Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakewood resident has written several children's plays that he has 
directed on Orange County stages, including the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove, 
the Irvine Barclay Theatre and SCR. 
</P>
<P>
 He also works as a consultant with Disney, helping to create stage shows for 
Disneyland. He co-wrote and directed "Aladdin's Oasis," which just premiered at 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one of his plays, "Rep" -- about the travails of a struggling 
repertory theater company -- will get its premiere at the Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins said he had been mulling the idea for a book on improv and mentioned it 
to his play publisher. A half-hour later, someone from Heinemann (an 
educational-book publishing house in New Hampshire) called and said, "So I hear 
you're writing an improv book." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the interest, Atkins began working on the book but found it more 
difficult than writing a play. 
</P>
<P>
 "To write a play is so easy, because the characters speak to you," he said. 
"This could be a deadly dull book. . . . If it comes across as an educational 
book, then I'm in a lot of trouble. It's got to come across as fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins, an exuberant talker whose enthusiasm for the stage comes across in 
person, said he was challenged by the task of translating his feelings into 
print. "Theater is about passion. How do I put that onto the printed page? I 
want to believe that it's in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Editors at Heinemann apparently thought so -- they published the book late 
last year. Response has been good, he said. It has even brought him some fan 
mail and has opened some professional doors that had been closed to him before 
he was a published author. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, if you write a book, suddenly you know what you're doing," 
Atkins joked. 
</P>
<P>
 After an introduction, the book outlines about 150 exercises that Atkins has 
devised. The book is geared for actors from the junior-high level up to adults 
and can be used in classrooms or by actors working in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins warns that improv can be addictive. He said one of his student, a 
lawyer, decided to drop his practice to become an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get into it, it's hard to get rid of," he said. "There are a lot of 
mental aerobics that are going on; that's the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He likens acting to a baseball team: The team works together as an ensemble, 
"but when you're at bat, it's your turn. No one can help you."

SHEARING OFF THE YEARS; A PONYTAILED URBAN SOPHISTICATE DECIDES TO SWEEP AWAY 
AN IMAGE, AN ATTITUDE -- A FASHION STATEMENT THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS TO GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, when I was younger, skinnier and a lot more of a whiner, I 
perched in the big leather chair at John the Barber's shop on Front Street in 
Vestal, N. Y., and cried my eyes out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was haircut day, and my mother had brought 6-year-old me, kicking and 
screaming, into the shop for a trim. It wasn't so much that the haircut hurt 
(other than getting a few flying red locks in my eyes); it was just such a 
mystery to me. All this attention by these serious-looking adults with pointy 
objects in their hands. I felt like a lawn that was about to be mowed. And it 
scared me. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, I sat in the chair of Mitchell Field's Headlines hair salon in 
Burbank -- balding, 36-year-old, ponytailed me, looking at myself in the 
mirror, feeling like crying those little-boy tears all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 See, I was going under the stylist's scissors for the first time in more than 
five years. I was about to have part of me cut, swept and thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 But I knew that I was about to lose a lot more than hair. I would be parting 
with an image of myself as a hip urban sophisticate who dared to go long-haired 
in a world of short-cropped, middle-of-the-roaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was there for another reason -- I'm a changeling. Every so often, I like 
to create some sort of new slant to my look. I grow a beard. I shave it off. 
Then I grow it back shorter, like Yasser Arafat. Then it's a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 This haircut action, however, was going to be one humdinger of a change. 
Unlike my scrub-weed beard, my long hair wouldn't grow back overnight. My hair 
was like a tree that had grown wild for more than 60 months, or 2,000 days. 
Five years! Anything that took so long to grow should not be disposed of 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, though, I was growing tired of the ponytail look. Around my 
office, it's something slightly off the beaten path because most of the men I 
work with look as if they walked out of some button-down IBM office. 
Squaresville. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the streets of Los Angeles, ponytails are like palm trees -- there's 
two or three to every block. Anything this common ceases to be different. In my 
eyes, the look was becoming Cro-Magnon. It was old, tired, outdated. Like 
looking into the mirror every day and seeing yourself in bell-bottoms and a 
bolo tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, my hair didn't even look that great ponytailed. It was as if I 
were hiding something, compensating for my oncoming baldness. So I had this 
ponytail to convince myself that I could still get away with wearing the same 
hairstyle as those 20-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all its length, I rarely, if ever, wore my hair down. One friend 
told me that with my thinning red crop flying in the breeze, I looked "vaguely 
Hasidic." 
</P>
<P>
 For one, I didn't take care of my hair. Conditioner? Never touched the stuff, 
even if my 'do was full of tangly snarls. See, I rarely combed my hair out. It 
was frizzy and fly-by-night. 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't care. I just strapped it back in a ponytail and went on my bleary 
way. I didn't have to look at the back of my head. It wasn't my problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning, I dumped on a few handfuls of mousse and then some stiffening 
spray. For years, my hair lived underneath an ocean of chemicals, as hard as a 
vinyl hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
 So there I was in the chair. I had chosen Mitchell Field after consulting with 
several writers and editors who cover fashion, who recommended him from 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I took an immediate dislike to the salon, a fruity-smelling place where women 
sitting under hair dryers called each other "sweetheart" and "hon" and had 
their nails done. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lady Fate, well, she's a cruel mistress. The day of my cut, I saw all 
these great-looking ponytails. The men looked so happy, so hip, so L. A. In the 
morning, I stopped to get coffee, and this woman said to me: "Oh, I just love 
your ponytail!" 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "You're joking, right? I'm having this sucker cut off today." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't do it," she responded. "My friend and I were just talking about 
your ponytail the other day. It's so . . . red and so curly. We both agreed 
that ponytails still turned us on." 
</P>
<P>
 Great. After six years, I learned that my ponytail was a sexual magnet for 
plump, 45-year-old women with poodles. Get me to the chair. Quick! 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing Mitch Field was gentle with a scaredy-cat like me. In his smooth 
British accent, he advised me that I was making the right decision. He had cut 
his own tail off six years ago. They were as de rigueur as, well, brush cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And so he did it. He gathered my tail in a rubber band and he cut it off. No 
messing around with Mitch. No snip-snipping here and there. One second it was 
there and the next it was gone, resting in his hand like some sort of wet rat. 
Like some greasy sea creature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be cathartic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, I felt lighter, newer, sleeker. My tears dried right away. I was a 
new man. I thought that I'd be traumatized. I wasn't. I was 10 years younger -- 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Once severed, that ponytail looked less like some counterculture image than a 
crutch, an alibi to take attention away from my Jimmy Durante nose and oblong 
forehead, making me look like one of the crazies in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest." 
</P>
<P>
 When my man Mitchell was done, I hopped out of the chair and ran my hands 
through my new, spiky hairdo. It was short on the sides. Short on top. Short in 
the back. And no tail. I wanted to hug the guy. He hadn't just given me a 
haircut. For $35, he had given me hair therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a souvenir, he even gave me back my ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what I'm going to do with the thing. Frame it, perhaps. Or maybe 
glue it to a piece of Velcro so that I can wear it around if I ever got 
nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the response to my new 'do has ranged from "You really are ugly" to 
"You look a lot better, a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 But the question remains: Can a wanna-be hipster lounge-lizard kind of guy 
like me survive in this city without his tail? Can you still be an alternative 
character with short hair and a Honda Accord? 
</P>
<P>
 You bet you can.

PARK AND PLAY; * EVERY WEEK, A CITY MOBILE UNIT VISITS NEIGHBORHOODS TO GET 
KIDS INVOLVED IN SOCCER, RELAY RACES, CRAFTS AND ALL SORTS OF FUN AND GAMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Each Monday afternoon, the children of East Newhall don't have to go to the 
park. The park comes to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the area has no play grounds nearby, the Santa Clarita Parks and 
Recreation Department's Parkmobile, a staffed mobile unit providing equipment, 
games and activities, makes a weekly trip to the neighborhood. A group of 25 to 
30 children usually flock to the white truck. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dirt lot blocked off in the Newhall neighborhood, smaller children play 
with toys in one corner, while another group of older boys plays soccer in an 
open area. At a table set up by Parkmobile staff, a crowd of boys and girls 
string beads to make necklaces that they can keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Noe Reyes, 12, of Newhall said he comes to the Parkmobile sessions every 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to do a lot of the projects," he said. "I get to talk to people I've 
never met and become friends. The older people on staff can help you with 
different problems. It's nice of them to come out here, because a lot of kids' 
parents can't take them anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parkmobile provides not only soccer but such activities as hockey, 
foursquare, relay races, football throwing and jump rope, along with crafts and 
games. It visits areas in Saugus, Canyon Country and Valencia from 3 to 5 p.m. 
every weekday for a month. It has been visiting the East Newhall location each 
week for about four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Grisel Hernandez, 8, of Newhall said she enjoys the Parkmobile's art projects. 
"I want to be an artist. We get to paint, color, and make beaded necklaces and 
rings." 
</P>
<P>
 Fermin Guerra, 13, said his favorite Parkmobile activity is soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a chance to run and get good practice," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Parkmobile is usually staffed with three to five people who supervise the 
activities and trouble-shoot any potential safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff member Rory Maus, who has worked with the program for the last three 
years, said: "It's different from a normal job. The kids make it fun. It's 
never the same every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Community members request Parkmobile services by writing or calling the Parks 
and Recreation Department and submitting an application. It takes two to three 
months to fulfill a request. 
</P>
<P>
 The site must meet certain guidelines besides being beyond an easy walk from a 
local park. For example, the site must be within Santa Clarita city limits and 
on a flat street with minimal traffic (ideally, a cul-de-sac). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It must have the potential to attract 15 or more children, and not be 
connected to any private roads, block any construction sites, or be covered by 
sand, gravel or dangerous debris. All residents on a cul-de-sac or block must 
agree to allow the Parkmobile on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Robertson, a Canyon Country resident, said she contacts the Parks and 
Recreation Department frequently to request the Parkmobile for her two 
children, ages 6 and 7, and other youngsters in the neighborhood. She said the 
turnout is large. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for the kids. They really enjoy it, and it's something they look 
forward to," Robertson said. "I'm happy I found out about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parkmobile parks in front of Robertson's house, a convenient location for 
the children, and its staff can use the home's electrical outlets for certain 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any way I can help them out, I'll do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, who grew up in Maine, said, "Out here on the West Coast, I'm afraid 
to let my children out to play in the front yard. (But) when they are 
participating in the Parkmobile, I feel like it's safe for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Parkmobile program began in 1990 after several years of planning, said 
Jonathan Skinner, who headed the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea originated with Lions Club members, who provided a donation to 
purchase the van and recreational equipment, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making its weekly visits, the Parkmobile offers special events, 
such as a visit from Santa Claus each Christmas in East Newhall; a Fourth of 
July party at Newhall Park; a Halloween pumpkin raffle at each site; a child 
safety fair every spring, jointly sponsored with other groups, at Saugus 
Speedway; and free dental exams at various churches. WHERE TO GO 
</P>
<P>
 What: Parkmobile visits to Santa Clarita neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 3 to 5 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Free. Requests to visit specific neighborhoods take two to three months 
to fill.

THE SKILLS OF SUCCESS; * THE WOODLAND HILLS REC CENTER WILL TEACH PARENTS 
TECHNIQUES FOR COACHING THEIR KIDS TO BECOME BETTER ATHLETES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Michael Szymanski writes regularly 
for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Feinberg, 11, of West Hills is already an all-star athlete. He's on a 
trophy-winning Little League team and he's a burgeoning basketball talent. Yet 
he has a little difficulty with some simple hand-eye coordination. When he 
masters that, his game will be even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Feinberg, David's father, has spent $1,000 on private batting and 
pitching lessons for his son. But soon he plans to start helping David himself, 
using techniques he learns in a unique coaching class offered by the Woodland 
Hills Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three evening sessions of the program -- created by the center's 
senior coach, Ed Bates -- adults will learn how to teach baseball fundamentals. 
They also will learn skills applicable to any sport. These include a range of 
physical and mental exercises and tips on child psychology and building team 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the classes different from those offered by the center in the past 
is their emphasis on reaching any Mom or Dad with an athletically inclined 
child -- not just grown-ups who coach. "They're open to any parent who wants to 
teach their child a sport," Bates says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates will be trying out a 10-year-old program called Brain Gym for Sports, 
which will be taught at the rec center by Sharon Jeffers and Michael Allen 
Moore. A set of simple techniques developed by Dr. Paul E. Dennison of Ventura, 
this approach aims to improve coordination and concentration, quicken reflexes 
and increase energy and self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffers and Moore plan to teach parents these techniques so they can pass them 
on to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching and hitting drills will be conducted by Rich Taylor of Calabasas, 
director of player development at the center. Taylor, a former pitching coach 
for Pepperdine University, scout for the Kansas City Royals and a founder of 
the West Coast Baseball School, often invites major league players to the 
center to talk to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said effective teaching can sometimes be a simple matter of taking a 
novel approach. "For example," he says, "instead of telling a kid to swing 
level when batting, say, 'Do it like a karate chop,' and then they get it." 
</P>
<P>
 The point of all this, he adds, is not to have "our kids all go into the major 
leagues. We want them to be friends and make friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the importance placed on organized sports by both parents and 
kids, competition can get in the way of enjoying -- and even succeeding at -- a 
game. During the sessions, parents learn not to emphasize rivalry so much as 
camaraderie and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The playing field doesn't need to be so cutthroat," says Jeffers.  
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters may not be the only ones to experience a confidence boost in the 
wake of these classes. Insecurity over their ability to coach their children 
may be the primary reason adults sign up in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 "They could be the best doctor, lawyer or insurance guy around but they can't 
teach basic fundamental skills," Bates says. "That's what this class is all 
about. And it's so great to watch them get it; it's like a light bulb going 
on." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Baseball the Right Way." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Woodland Hills Recreation Center, 5858 Shoup Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 7 to 9 p.m. beginning March 3 and continuing on Thursday nights, March 
10 and 17. 
</P>

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PIGS IN A BANQUET; * OLD HICKORY BBQ, DESPITE THE NAME, 
DOESN'T COOK WITH HICKORY. BUT IT STILL SERVES UP A TASTY BARBECUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Old Hickory BBQ inadvertently proves how important a good hardwood like 
hickory is in the barbecue equation. That's be cause meats here are grilled 
over charcoal, rather than barbecued over smoking embers -- a critical 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 I just returned from a trip through the Carolinas, where barbecue is 
synonymous with pork shoulder cooked up to 10 hours over smoking hickory logs. 
The chef at Old Hickory got a little defensive when I asked him whether he used 
real hickory. "Don't judge us until you taste our food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough, I thought, ordering up some baby backs, barbecued chicken and hot 
links. The meats came up perfectly charred and very well sauced. Although there 
is no substitute, to my mind, for the use of wood, which imparts complex, 
almost magical flavors to certain meats, Old Hickory BBQ is a solid 
neighborhood restaurant, with lots of tasty entrees and side dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tiny, crowded place with a counter and a handful of high tables and 
oversize stools, so it is no wonder that most of the business is takeout. 
Perhaps you shouldn't visit when you are in a hurry: There is often a logjam at 
the small counter, since much of the menu is prepared to order. One Saturday 
evening, one of the few other seated parties remarked to us, rather wryly, that 
we would have time to go home, shower and shave before the food arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Start off with the restaurant's Louisiana gumbo, a murky broth simmered for an 
entire day. This is one of the San Fernando Valley's best gumbos, chock full of 
shrimp, corn, okra, spicy rice and sliced sausage, plus a heavy pinch of bay 
leaf. Half a pint, the smallest portion sold here, goes further than you might 
think, making a hearty appetizer for two. 
</P>
<P>
 Most entrees come with a choice of good side dishes. The fine, slightly lumpy 
mashed potatoes are doused with a russet-colored gravy. Soft, sweet collard 
greens are cooked with bits of smoked ham -- moist, fresh-tasting and 
relatively free of bitterness. Corn on the cob comes up piping hot and 
perfectly cooked. There are also starchy black-eyed peas, staring up at you 
from little paper cups. Even the hush puppies will please you -- these fried 
cornmeal golf balls, studded with bits of onion, explode with a burst of steam 
when you bite into them. 
</P>
<P>
 The best barbecue dish here is the one featuring baby back ribs, even if the 
ribs Old Hickory BBQ uses look larger than you might expect from a "baby" pig. 
These are fall-off-the-bone tender ribs, with a bit of dark red sauce cooked 
into the meat. And you just may want to smother them with the sweet-tart, oddly 
spiced barbecue sauce that owner Leon Meade has concocted. It's one of the most 
unusual and distinctive sauces I've tasted.

 Chicken, the meat that misses hardwood barbecuing the least, is another good 
bet. Being more delicate than pork, chicken can absorb too much wood flavor 
when barbecued over hickory. In Meade's hands, charcoal-grilled chicken is 
masterful: moist, juicy and artfully blackened.  
</P>
<P>
 The big disappointment here has to be the hot links. They remind me of 
ordinary hot dogs that have been cooked in spicy sauce before being blackened 
on a grill. They're a far cry from the crumbly, spicy sausages you get at the 
better L.A. barbecues, such as Bennie's, and not even up to the hot links you 
can buy at any supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the fried chicken and catfish are excellent. The former is simply a 
great example of Southern fried chicken: moist, soft meat beneath a crunchy, 
peppery batter, just as you'd get in a genteel tearoom somewhere in the Deep 
South. The catfish has a different crunchy batter, this one made from cornmeal. 
It's a generous portion, too, about three large fillets to an order. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can eat dessert after eating barbecue, Old Hickory BBQ has two 
available. Both are homey, Southern and as sweet as the law allows. The runny 
peach cobbler, served in a paper cup, looks like a fruit soup with bits of 
baking powder-rich biscuit and sliced peach bobbing up and down in it. The 
sweet potato pie is a simple, smoothly pureed filling on a flaky crust. To me, 
it's the best dessert after eating pig, barbecued or grilled. WHERE AND WHEN
