 LITERARY TALK: The Orange County African-American Literary Society, a group of 
about 15 book lovers, meets monthly in Santa Ana. Says Larry Brown, a real 
estate appraiser who started the group a year ago: "We primarily are just 
seeking to expand our knowledge in the area of black literature. And not just 
literature, but subjects pertaining to black people or how to improve ourselves 
as people." . . . Brown is compiling a list of what he calls "100 Books That 
Every Black Person Should Read."

<P>
 SUCCESS SECRET: Costa Mesa author Jo-Ann Mapson, whose second novel, "Blue 
Rodeo," is due out in May, will participate in Authorfest at Orange Coast 
College Tuesday. The event is titled "Success Secrets of Writers." Says Mapson, 
who had one unpublished early effort make the rounds for two years: 
"Persistence is the main thing." It takes hard work too, she says. "I just got 
back from a conference in Arizona and I brought my computer and everybody 
laughed at me. But at night I went to my room and worked for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 HEFTY SUM: Laguna Niguel author Nancy Taylor Rosenberg, whose first four-book 
contract with Dutton was for $3 million, recently signed a new, five-book deal 
for what she says is "substantially more." Four of the five books will be in 
the legal thriller vein of her best-seller "Mitigating Circumstances." But the 
fifth, which will be published under the name Nancy Taylor, will have the 
flavor of "It's a Wonderful Life." It's titled "California Angel," she says. 
"It's about a living angel. I think California needs one, so I invented one." 
</P>
<P>
 WACKY GUY: Ten years ago, Jordan Young of Anaheim wrote "Spike Jones and His 
City Slickers." Now he's back with "Spike Jones Off the Record: The Man Who 
Murdered Music." "I think you get a much fuller picture of him," says Young, 
who calls the zany music legend "a dead-serious musician in a funny suit." 
Young compares Jones to the Wizard of Oz: "He's a straight-faced guy behind the 
curtain operating all this machinery and special effects -- flashing lights and 
gimmicks and nutty stuff."

 STREET SMART: A favorite joke among cyclists goes like this: There are two 
types of bike riders. Those who have fallen. And, those who will. . . . A 
common accident occurs when cars make a right turn, veering into a bike lane 
too early or without regard for bike riders (B1). "I've seen too many of them," 
said Mike Cicchi, who lectures on bicycle safety at east county schools. He 
suggests that cyclists ride defensively: "Slow down and let the car get out of 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 STINKING BUSINESS: American trash disposal companies have joined a global 
competition to help Taiwan build garbage incinerators in a deal worth as much 
as $1 billion (D1). . . . The potential for profit has inspired a renewed waste 
disposal venture in Ventura County. Taconic Resources begins gathering 
signatures this week for a ballot initiative that would authorize a dump in 
Weldon Canyon. "There is an awful lot of money at stake here," Ojai 
Councilwoman Nina Shelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 TONYA'S TALE: Just when you thought that it was safe to go back on the ice, 
NBC is set to come out with "Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story." The 
made-for-TV movie, scheduled to air April 30, features Thousand Oaks High grad 
Tisha Walker as the skating-double for the actress playing Harding. Walker, 19, 
an alternate to the 1992 Olympics who recently turned pro, resembles Tonya. "I 
have a blond pony tail and I'm short," Walker said. Although actress Alexandra 
Powers does some skating, Walker said, "I do all of the jumps and spins." 
</P>
<P>
 A FAIR THEME: With only four months to go before the Ferris wheel spins, 
Ventura County Fair officials have settled on a theme for this August's event: 
"California Country." The theme lends direction and sometimes inspiration to 
contestants assembling theme gardens, cakes and other entries. Contestants love 
this year's concept because it is so wide open, fair promoter Teri Raley says. 
"The possibilities are endless: surfing with spurs on, a little kid hanging out 
at the beach in cowboy boots. . . ."

RON VAWTER; ACCLAIMED STAGE, FILM ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Vawter, avant-garde stage actor seen in such mainstream films as 
"Philadelphia" and "Silence of the Lambs" but best remembered for a one-man 
show about two opposites on the issue of homosexuality, has died. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter, who had suffered from AIDS since 1991, died of a heart attack Saturday 
while flying from Zurich to New York, his agent, Philip Carlson, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, who lived in New York's Greenwich Village, had been performing a 
play about Sophocles in Brussels, Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter was recently seen as a colleague of Academy Award-winner Tom Hanks, who 
portrayed an attorney dying of AIDS in "Philadelphia." Vawter's stentorian 
voice earlier earned him roles as a psychiatrist in "sex, lies and videotape," 
as hero Andy Garcia's boss in "Internal Affairs" and as a Justice Department 
official in "Silence of the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I generally get to play these Establishment types who have some sort of 
corruption of the soul," Vawter said in a Times interview in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But he earned his greatest critical reviews for the one-man show "Roy 
Cohn/Jack Smith." The show, for which Vawter won an Obie award, was about Cohn, 
a lawyer who worked for redbaiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy, and Smith, a New York 
performance artist. Cohn denied being homosexual but Smith flaunted it, and 
both died of AIDS in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Vawter did the show at the Museum of Contemporary Art's Ahmanson Auditorium in 
Los Angeles in 1992, as well as in New York, San Francisco, and cities in Ohio 
and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were both products of a society who continually told them that what they 
were, in the very depth of their being, was bad, wrong, immoral, twisted. It's 
little wonder they grew up warped," Vawter said of Cohn and Smith. "I'm always 
amazed that we homosexuals are doing as well as we are. Despite those signals 
from society, whatever is there is going to come out, either in a healthy way 
or in a destructive way. I just pray to God that it will be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Born to a military family in Albany, N.Y., Vawter enlisted in the Army on his 
17th birthday and set out to become a chaplain for the Green Berets. But after 
studying theology and literature, he became an Army recruiting officer in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 He veered quite literally into theater because of the intriguing voices he 
heard coming from the Performing Garage, which he passed as he walked to and 
from work. When the actors said they needed an administrator, Vawter left the 
military and ran the theater group's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving into acting in the late 1970s, he helped his new colleagues found the 
Wooster Group, the experimental theater collective which spawned such noted 
performers as Spalding Gray and Willem Dafoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a time when you didn't have to know anything in order to step onto a 
stage. I learned acting by doing it," Vawter said later. "And although I had 
never taken an acting class, it didn't take long to learn how to be on the 
stage. All you have to do is be humiliated in front of an audience a few times. 
If you don't like being humiliated publicly, you learn how to act."

GEORGE RAMOS: IN WAR, THEY DON'T ASK WHAT RACE YOU ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reporter knows when a difficult interview is about to occur. Sometimes, you 
can sense it from the subject matter or the interviewee's attitude and 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew instantly that Eddie Morin would be tough for me to interview. When I 
met him the other day at Fourth Street School in East L.A., where he was 
painting a mural for the library, I learned he has a calming presence and a 
knack for asking questions quietly and thoughtfully. 
</P>
<P>
 I was hoping I could interview him without him turning the tables on me. But 
it didn't work. I sat there, for more than two hours, grappling with pain that 
I wish would just go away. 
</P>
<P>
 He got me to talk about Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I went to interview Morin because he has decided to do a sequel to his 
father's book, "Among the Valiant." It wasn't a best-seller at the time of its 
release, but it became an oft-quoted source on the contributions Mexican 
Americans made while serving in the U.S. armed forces during World War II and 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Morin was outraged because he felt Mexican Americans were being taken for 
granted. He wrote the book, published in 1963, to prove that Americans of 
Mexican descent were as patriotic as their countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he revealed in his book that Mexican Americans earned more 
Medals of Honor -- 17 -- than any other ethnic group in the U.S. military 
during World War II and the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel just as proud of the Colin Kelleys, the Dobbie Millers and the Sadio 
Munemoris," Raul Morin wrote of Medal of Honor recipients, "as we are of the 
Martinezes, Garcias and Rodriguezes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All America should know of the great contributions made by the Mexican 
American soldiers. . . . In this way they can better understand today's brother 
American and lessen the few remaining stigmas harbored against the 
Spanish-speaking people to help promote a better democracy for all who live in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he never got to write a sequel. A disabled veteran from East L.A. who 
fought in Europe with the Army's 79th Infantry Division, he died in 1967 at age 
54. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eddie decided last summer to write a sequel, believing the public has 
ignored the contributions of Chicanos and other Latinos in later wars, 
particularly Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of discrimination against our people," he says, "especially now 
with all the immigrant bashing going on. When there's a war going on, they 
don't ask what race you are. They just want you to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that in Latino homes throughout the Southwest, a focal point is the 
place where the military photos of a family's sons and daughters are displayed. 
"Just about every home has such a place," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Morin told me of the veterans he had tracked down for his book. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Chicano from Bakersfield who saved his squad from annihilation 
during a firefight in 1966. He was part of a detail of the 1st Infantry 
Division to help rescue a platoon under attack by a North Vietnamese army unit 
near Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 He was told by his platoon leader to hold his position to prevent his squad 
from being overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 He did so, killing an unspecified number of North Vietnamese regulars with a 
machine gun he picked up during the close-quarter fighting. Wounded in the 
face, shoulder and foot, the Chicano, now 48, shrugged off the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never told anybody about it," he says, adding his involvement may have been 
overlooked because some incorrectly assumed he had been killed in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 He later discovered that at least two members of his unit, including his 
platoon leader, received the Silver Star, the Army's second highest military 
award, for bravery. 
</P>
<P>
 He is asking the Army for a Silver Star for his actions near the village of Di 
An, but he's afraid of the spotlight. He refuses to speak publicly about his 
experience or have his name published while he seeks the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for people like him," Eddie says, "that I'm doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie's eyes narrowed on me when I told him I served with the Americal 
Division as a young artillery lieutenant in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for my fear of interviewing him was apparent because now the tables 
were turned. I talked of how I felt about the people I had killed in combat and 
my angry reaction to anti-war protesters, the very people I had agreed with on 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taking notes, occasionally taking off his glasses to nod his head, as I 
told him about 35 GIs who were killed in 1971 when a firebase named Mary Ann 
was overrun and what I had to do in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the toughest interview I've ever given.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
LYNWOOD: CITY TRIES TO PULL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times researcher Catherine Gottlieb and Patricia A. Konley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 2, Lynwood grocer Michael Kim, owner of Charles Market, chased and 
shot a 14-year-old boy for reportedly taking a bag of cookies and then reaching 
for what Kim thought was a weapon. The teen has been released from the hospital 
and the case is still under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the grocer is a Korean American and the victim is a Latino, 
comparisons have been made with the 1991 fatal shooting of Latasha Harlins, the 
15-year-old African American killed by a Korean merchant who said she thought 
the girl was stealing orange juice. Some say Kim's response was extreme and a 
coalition of Latino and African American leaders have demanded that he be 
prosecuted.  
</P>
<P>
 But while many outside Lynwood have suggested the incident was racially 
motivated, many living within city limits say the ethnic backgrounds of the 
grocer and teen-ager are not the issue; it is the growing crisis of violence in 
our community that affects all of us, regardless of race. The city has been 
galvanized to work together to prevent racial divisiveness over this incident, 
and, as a result, has launched a community peace campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of views from concerned citizens: PAUL RICHARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor of Lynwood 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the incident we put into effect our multi-point response. This 
was announced immediately -- the day of the incident. It consisted of: 
</P>
<P>
 * Calling for a full and fair investigation of the incident by the sheriff and 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reactivating race relations task force. 
</P>
<P>
 * Initiating a hot line for people to call into the city to offer information 
or suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Organizing a Korean merchant outreach effort. The Lynwood Korean Business 
Assn., the Asian Pacific Dispute Resolution Center and others have come forward 
to announce their support. 
</P>
<P>
 * Getting the clergy involved to ask parishioners in Lynwood and the 
surrounding area to pray for peace.  
</P>
<P>
 * Kicking off of a green ribbon campaign, a community peace effort. Green 
ribbons alone won't do anything, (but) we've distributed thousands of them to 
help raise the level of consciousness in the community.  
</P>
<P>
 * Offering an open line to the media to provide information as just as quickly 
as it is available to the city and at the same time asking the media to 
cooperate and promote our city peace effort. (The day after the shooting) there 
was very little in the media about Lynwood's cry for help to the greater 
community in sustaining calm and a whole lot about a shark that washed up on 
the beach. Everyone wants to come out and cover that a Latino youth was shot by 
a Korean merchant, and that's news, but the bigger issue is violence in our 
community and how do we maintain calm and respond. 
</P>
<P>
 We have to resist the temptation to draw comparisons with the Latasha Harlins 
case. The big issue is 'Why is a person quick to use a gun?' not 'Why is a 
Korean person quick to use a gun?' 
</P>
<P>
 ARMANDO REA 
</P>
<P>
 City councilman, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy for 15 years 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another council member and I disagreed with the decision to go ahead with the 
news conference. There was no point to go to the news. It was simply another 
crime in our city to become a part of the statistics on violent crime in L.A. 
County and that was to be dealt with by the sheriff and the district attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Once (political leaders) bring out the issue of color, folks will believe 
that. It can cause division and separation.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a crime of opportunity on one part and a crime of anger and frustration 
on the other part. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that the incident is about race is flatly wrong. But now, when 
events like this hit the news, they tend to fall into (the category of) show 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL RUELAS 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, Vista High School 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some older people say Kim should have shot the kid. But kids are saying that 
it's not right. He shouldn't have shot him over a bag of cookies. It would have 
been understandable if the kid had a gun too, but he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 People aren't saying it's racially motivated. I think (others) are assuming 
that it is because they try to find an excuse for everything and that's the No. 
1 excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 CHAN HO 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, B&C Liquor 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We met with the city. Everybody likes peace, they don't want violence. The 
city tries to help but it's pretty hard. There are too many things involved.  
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, things have cooled down. Right after, I heard from a lot of 
customers about it. But not so much now. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants have had a meeting. They are worried. We have to have good relations 
with the community. We're trying to do more talking.  
</P>
<P>
 DANNY SMITH 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Sheriff's Department detective, one of original investigators of the 
shooting 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The community has been very supportive of Mr. Kim. Some politicians would have 
you believe otherwise but the only ones who have made any hostile overtures are 
the gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 I did a walk-through of the area from the market to the point of the shooting 
with Mr. Kim. It's a couple of blocks. People of every race, color, sex and age 
group came up and told him to hang in. Overwhelmingly, they said Mr. and Mrs. 
Kim were nice, polite, friendly people. They said she would often let them take 
groceries without paying the full amount. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no issue of color here, not from people in the community.  
</P>
<P>
 ARTURO REYES 
</P>
<P>
 Resident of Lynwood for eight years 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richards overreacted. It was not a racial issue. It was just another 
crime. The police and the district attorney have to do their job and get to the 
bottom of this without any political interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Kim is well-liked by the community. I go by his store everyday. The victim 
is a Latino, and I'm a Latino. It's very easy to claim racial discrimination 
when, in fact, there should be more police out on the streets and then crime 
would go down. When people don't see the police around they're going to take 
advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 These people who say it's racial don't live in the city. They should speak to 
the community first instead of trying to make this a racial issue. LORNA 
HAWKINS 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood resident for 22 years, president of Drive by Agony, an organization 
for victims of violent crimes 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Too many people want to put their two cents into this situation, and they 
don't even know what they're talking about. I think the city officials 
responded quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 If people learn where others are coming from things might change. If I say I 
want to start a store and I come from a country where we don't smile and other 
people come into the store and smile, I'm going to want to know why they're 
smiling. I think it's about that simple. We're not used to each other. And we 
should want to learn about each other. 
</P>
<P>
 RACHEL CHAVEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Member of the Lynwood school board 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think the city reacted quickly to keep cooler heads prevailing and so far, 
so good. People are passing the green ribbons to proclaim that we're going to 
work together and that we're against violence.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm with those who say it wasn't anything racial. It was just a sign of our 
times. We can't condone theft, and I personally can't condone guns being used 
to solve problems. If we had to take a stand on something it would have to be 
against violence.  
</P>
<P>
 I see how hard the Korean merchants work and when their businesses get going I 
see that they do hire people from the community.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago last month, the Saturday stillness in South-Central Los 
Angeles was shattered by the sound of a pistol that took the life of an African 
American teen-ager named Latasha Harlins. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting by Soon Ja Du, a Korean immigrant minding her husband's store, 
over Harlins' alleged attempt to steal a bottle of juice enraged the African 
American community and escalated neighborhood tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 When Korean American grocer Michael Kim shot a Latino teen-ager earlier this 
month -- reportedly over a stolen bag of cookies -- community leaders feared 
another outpouring of anger and hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact opposite, however, appears to have happened. In the weeks since the 
April 2 shooting in Lynwood, community residents and leaders have been working 
together to defuse any racial conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood residents, responding in today's In the Neighborhood, try to put the 
shooting into perspective and dispel any notions that it was racially 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to some observers, it is race and racial stereotypes that prompts 
otherwise law-abiding citizens to commit acts of violence. 
</P>

 "It's a sign of our times that people are being beaten and killed over 
comparative trivialities," says Halford Fairchild, professor of psychology and 
black studies at Pitzer College. "It is symptomatic of the depravity of 
American society that values life in such a negative manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild, who focuses primarily on the African American community, says that 
the only way to change those stereotypes is through education and the media. 
"We must change the way in which we project images in the popular culture," 
says Fairchild.  
</P>
<P>
 That has been the sentiment of many African Americans who recently previewed 
two new television shows that focus on life in their community: Fox's "South 
Central" and "704 Hauser" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in a special on TV and Stereotypes, residents of South-Central are 
divided on the authenticity of the show that bears the name of their 
neighborhood, although many say they related to the complex problems facing the 
single mother struggling to raise her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrie Mazingo, chair of broadcast journalism at USC's School of Journalism, 
criticizes many television portrayals of the black community, saying, "They 
still predominantly feature African Americans as comedic characters and 
basically objects of ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
 Mazingo contends that the only reason the new shows exist is to appeal to 
viewer demographics. In fact, Nielson Media Research, which monitors the 
nation's television viewing habits, reports that African Americans do tend to 
watch more TV than the general population.  
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, sees negatives in TV programming directed at African 
Americans viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sign of maturity that there can be so many shows and there can be so 
many viewpoints," says Nick Brown, professor of film and television studies at 
UCLA. "I don't think any show has to be a demographic replica of a community. 
It's a work of fiction and should not be held to statistical accuracy."

 Three years ago, Los Angeles father Reginald Brass formed My Child Says Daddy, 
a support and advocacy group for divorced fathers who want an active role in 
the upbringing of their children. The group features guest speakers and 
seminars to promote parental responsibility, payment of child support and 
increased visitation and custody roles for fathers. In recent months, the group 
has sought to address difficulties faced by fathers within the court system, 
which is geared to deal with "deadbeat dads" but has few provisions for those 
who do pay child support and who want to be actively involved in rearing their 
children. Brass was interviewed by Jill Stewart.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Who has joined "My Child Says Daddy" and what exactly are they 
seeking? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Every other Monday, anywhere from 20 to 40 people come to our 
meetings. We deal with fathers, from teen-agers all the way to 60-year-old men, 
of all races. Some gave up on their children at one time. Our key warning is 
don't give up on your child's life and don't neglect your child-support 
payments because that's the worst thing you can do. Most fathers come to us 
because they can't see their child, have been pushed out of their child's life 
and the court has sided with the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your group's philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That a strong father presence is needed in the American family. If not, the 
white and Latino communities will start experiencing the same family breakdown 
that my own black community is experiencing, which stems from the absence of 
the father. We believe fathers must share responsibility in raising their 
children. The fact is that 70% of all juvenile delinquents come from fatherless 
homes, according to the Justice Department. So let's put the father back in 
these children's lives to curb this.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see the courts as failing fathers and families? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They put fathers in one big pot and stereotype us. This becomes a gender 
problem of men against women and fails to address the best interests of the 
child. Fathers who seek us out usually tell us that their ex-wife lied about 
abuse or neglect to prevent them from seeing the child. We try to help fathers 
understand what they're up against in trying to remain active in their child's 
life. We find that most men are intimidated by the court system because 
everybody looks at it as a win-lose situation where the women always win. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the single biggest complaint you hear from fathers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When the woman breaks the court order, she is not punished. For instance, 
when it's your day to see your child and she refuses, you have to drag her back 
to court and the judge invariably says, "Don't do it again, ma'am." Typically, 
there is no penalty against the mother for cutting the father out, so the 
mother repeats the pattern at will.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can legislation strengthen the role divorced fathers play? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We supported Senate Bill 2930 in 1992 by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles), which would have helped protect parents from false accusations of 
abuse or neglect in child custody cases. Any parent found lying to keep another 
parent away would have to pay attorney costs andcould lose custody of the 
child. The legislation was knocked down. Assemblywoman Moore plans to 
reintroduce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you getting any support from other political leaders? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Gov. Pete Wilson has assigned someone in his office to work with us. I met 
with Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, and he gave our organization a lot 
of praise because he'd never seen a father-based group that wants to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What obstacle to active fatherhood could be fixed most easily? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The way the district attorney's office doesn't work hand-in-hand with the 
family law courts. One of our members hasn't been able to see his child for 11 
years, even though child support money is being taken out of his check. The 
district attorney's office knows where the child is, but they don't get 
involved in custody disputes and won't tell him the address. He has never been 
accused of any neglect or abuse, but he's helpless. If he goes to court to get 
an order to see his child, he can't serve his ex-wife the papers because he 
cannot get her address. It's a tragic Catch-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you change California's custody or visitation laws? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We want an open schedule for custody. For instance, if the father works 
days and the mother works nights, the father could have custody for the 
half-day that he is free, and the mother for the other half-day. The court 
would create as much time as possible with both parents, much more customized. 
Right now the courts approach it backward, starting with as little as two hours 
every other week for the father and forcing the father to fight for more. Q: 
Are you trying to reach out to teen-age and unwed fathers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. We feel if we get into high schools and teach young fathers how to be 
responsible men while the mother is pregnant, there's a good chance for 
healthier, happier children. We've spoken to kids at high schools in Los 
Angeles. We have spoken at St. Anne's Maternity Home for unwed girls (in Los 
Angeles) who are wards of the court. I've spoken to at least 500 kids since we 
started, and to several thousand parents. We get good responses from kids. Q: 
What are your plans? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We will give a free seminar for parents on how to deal with the court 
system and parental rights. We have some family law attorneys committed to 
speaking to us, and we hope to have some judges speak. We hope to arrange it 
for just before Father's Day.

 Two new TV shows about black life -- "South Central" and producer Norman 
Lear's new "704 Hauser Street" -- are causing a stir. Are the portrayals 
realistic or just more stereotyping? Teens, people in the entertainment 
industry, community leaders and people from outside the area give their 
impressions.

 "South Central" was a great show. It shows a real South-Central Los Angeles 
family. My own family is kind of like that. I especially liked how the mother 
dealt with a lot of situations. You could tell that they were a close family, 
that there was a lot of love and friendship. That was very positive. I liked 
the mother the best. I appreciated the fact that she was a strong black mother 
doing her best.

 "South Central" was good, except the the scene where the daughter said 
something about smelling gunpowder in the morning. But overall, I liked the 
whole show. "704 Hauser" was interesting too, and pretty funny. I enjoyed it. 
Everyone had different points of view, and they were all interesting, 
especially the son and his white girlfriend. But I liked "South Central" 
better, because I understood it more. For me, it was real: I know that a beeper 
can cause problems. I would like to see a show that would bring together both 
types of people -- middle class and lower class. The way they make TV shows now 
is out of date. We need something different.

 The show was nothing like South-Central Los Angeles. Everybody had metal doors 
and made it seem dangerous, but we leave our doors open all the time where I 
live, near 68th Street and San Pedro Avenue. The acting was OK, but I just 
don't know any people like that. Also, it made fun of Hispanics in the scene 
with the checker in the grocery store. I don't know anyone who acts like that.

 I really didn't like "South Central." It seemed very degrading to black 
people. The kids were very disrespectful to their parents, particularly the way 
they referred to their father. There are a lot of black men raising kids out 
there, but all the men played very weak parts. I live with my mom and dad. The 
son was real, but a person like him shouldn't be shown to America. We should do 
more positive things, have role models that black kids could look up to like 
"Doogie Howser." Just something besides gangs and drugs.

 I liked "704 Hauser." It was funny but realistic at the same time. The way 
everyone disapproved of each other was good. It was different than a show like 
"Cosby," which was a perfect family. This one had problems, and argued, but 
they still cared about each other. It really showed the father and son 
relationship. I didn't like "South Central" because it tried to stereotype 
low-income families. I don't know anybody like that, kids who talk back to 
their mothers. I would like to see more shows like "Martin"; Martin is not 
trying to show people from the neighborhood, he's just himself. I'd like to 
combine a comedy like that with realism, put it on one show. That's something 
you don't see.

 "South Central" really explained life, and how people struggle. It got to me 
when I watched it. "704 Hauser" was realistic in a different way. Everyone knew 
the roles they were playing, and weren't afraid to say what was on their minds. 
But I didn't agree with the father and how he only saw skin color. That was 
wrong. But I understand that TV goes overboard sometimes because it's 
entertainment.

 I don't want to criticize shows I haven't seen; but one of the problems in 
television is that, historically, African Americans have been portrayed 
primarily in comedic or criminal roles. There needs to be a broader range when 
it comes to a depiction of all people of color. Although some sitcoms such as 
"Roc" do a very good job within their genre dealing with serious issues, the 
problem is that they are tackling issues that need to be explored in the 
context of a one-hour drama. Right now, unfortunately, there doesn't exist the 
willingness to explore developing serious and entertaining one-hour dramas 
about the African American experience.

<P>
 Not having seen either "South Central" or "704 Hauser" I really can't comment 
specifically about the characterizations on those shows. However, from an 
historical standpoint the root of the problem is the same as in the early 1970s 
when "Julia" first premiered and J.J. on the show "Good Times" first said, 
"Dynamite!" There was a backlash to those shows and it's the same today. The 
problem is twofold: first, the lack of African American roles and characters 
that are represented on the small screen; and, second, the limitations of the 
sitcom format that African Americans seem to fall into on a traditional basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the cost factor, sponsors and networks have lessened the time a 
show has to prove itself on the air in the first place; and it makes it 
extremely difficult to cultivate, nurture and develop any characters within 
that show with the kind of complex arc you would expect when telling the story 
of a human being.

<P>
 While certain media critics laud the show for its so-called realism, one must 
ask the question, whose reality are they writing about? Most South-Central 
residents (teen-agers included) are not involved in gangs or drugs. Even though 
unemployment is twice that of the white community, most are employed or seeking 
employment and profanity rarely finds its way into conversation, especially 
between children and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal is for the media to reflect people in our society as they really 
are: good and bad. Unfortunately, too much attention has been paid to the bad 
when it comes to African Americans in particular and people of color in 
general.

 The black viewing public (should) express its concerns, (but) temper its 
criticism. Give "South Central" a chance. If it doesn't improve fast enough, 
give the producers suggestions; don't arbitrarily ask that it be canceled. What 
you need to demand is that if a show is about minorities the creative staff 
should be comprised of a majority of that race.

 I know black actors have to have jobs; but I'm almost to the point that I 
would rather they didn't accept parts like those in "South Central." There's 
nothing tender about the way (these characters) communicate. They talk to each 
other in putdowns.

 I thought ("South Central") was excellent. I know the critics (complained) 
there wasn't a strong black male image in the family; but then that's a 
reflection of life. The number of single-parent families has grown so greatly 
over the years. I come from a single-parent home and very few of my friends 
live with both parents. It was realistic to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I think people aren't realizing the show is not a serious melodrama. It's a 
situation comedy and that's part of their job to be humorous and take things 
and make you laugh at them. There are people who wake up to gunshots. They go 
to sleep to it. They dodge them coming to and from school, going to and from 
work. It was just taking something that's serious and making a joke of it 
because it's real. But I don't think that's offensive. The show's a comedy -- a 
comedic opinion on part of life here.

 As a single parent of two boys, I related (to) the mother (in "South Central") 
and the problems she went through because I recently lost my job. Having decent 
kids and having to say no to your children, going to the supermarket and not 
having enough money to pay for your groceries -- I've been through that and I 
felt her pain. It's an experience people really don't want others to know about 
because they're ashamed. It's really nothing to be ashamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm still trying to form an opinion on "704 Hauser." There again it was very 
true to life as far as how we feel when our children's views are so different 
from ours -- marrying outside the race, (for example,) is a real issue and some 
minorities don't want that.

 Shows like "South Central" are good for people like me. Because I'm so 
isolated from that way of life, the only perception I get of South-Central Los 
Angeles is from the news reports. And based on that, it seems the area is like 
some killing field where people are in constant fear. And I understand that no 
show, especially a half-hour show, is going to begin to capture the real life 
dramas that exist in that area. But at least for someone like me, who'd be the 
first to admit lives a sheltered life, it helps me better understand this 
culture.

 I usually don't watch much TV but I did watch this because of the articles I 
read. I personally liked it. I have no idea what it must be like to live in a 
place like South-Central Los Angeles. This show afforded me a little glimpse 
into a world I have no clue about.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GRIPE; 'I'D LOVE TO 
PAY TAXES AGAIN' 
</P>

 Lydia Duncan, 39, of Los Angeles worked for four years for a major Downtown 
hotel before she was fired over what she calls a misunderstanding with her 
supervisor. With her education and work experience , she expected the time 
between jobs to be short. Instead, she's been unemployed for two years. Despite 
vigorous efforts to find work, Duncan's search has proved fruitless and she has 
been forced to support herself through a general relief program that pays $212 
a month for six days of labor with a county work crew. She was interviewed by 
Times staff writer Kevin Baxter:  
</P>
<P>
 Tax time is a burden on those who have to pay taxes. Everybody dreads April 
15th. But I'd like to know what it is to pay taxes again. I'd like to feel that 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years I've been looking for a job. And I believe there are jobs. But 
this is ridiculous! I never thought I'd be on general relief for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 I work six days a month. It gives me a reason to get up and not be lazy and 
just take something from the taxpayer. For that, I get $212 a month plus food 
stamps. But I'm looking for a real job. One that pays you every two weeks. I've 
even been to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll bus tables. I'll sweep. I'll go outside and wash down the windows. Just 
give me a little dignity, give me a little respect and let me have a job. 
That's all I'm asking. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm articulate. I'm intelligent. And I know how to follow instructions. I 
mean, who takes a resume to McDonald's and Taco Bell? I do. Because I want 
those people to know that I've worked, I know what work is, and I have 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as if things aren't tough enough, I find out I can't get hired 
because of my credit rating. I applied for one job and got a form letter back 
saying they couldn't consider me on the basis of a consumer credit report. They 
were talking about a student loan I had back in 1988 for a computer school that 
folded.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how long that's supposed to stay on your record, but it feels 
like modern-day slavery. They want you to pay the bills before you can get a 
job, but you can't pay the bills until you have a job.  
</P>
<P>
 Right now it's easier to stand out on a street corner and beg than it is to do 
things honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 You know those panhandlers you see out on the street every morning? If they 
can get up early enough to meet you in front of your office to beg for that 
quarter, then they can get up early enough to go out and look for a job. 
They're eating better than I am. Which makes me wonder whatever happened to 
welfare reform. Gov. (Pete)Wilson and President Clinton keep talking about it, 
but when's it going to happen? I know I'm ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to ask our elected officials where they they think these crack babies 
come from. Do they think they just fall out of the sky? The welfare mothers, 
what do they do with their checks? They either go buy drugs with it, or they go 
get their fingernails painted, or go get their hair done. They should be doing 
the same thing we're doing -- getting up early and going to work for their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Any reform would help. Open up some training centers. Take these aerospace 
workers, the highly trained people who have been laid off, and turn them into 
instructors. Open up centers and have them teach us. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorry for the people in Bosnia; their life is hell. But stop for a 
little while and look in our own back yard. Let those people take care of their 
problems for one year and let's clean up our back yard first. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to go out and live a life of crime. I've never been in jail and I 
don't think I want to go there. But I feel like going out and looking for the 
biggest drug dealer around and offering to sell drugs or something. Maybe with 
my luck, I'll get shot by one of the gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is the justice? Instead of pouncing on me because I'm on relief, pounce 
on the government for forcing me to stay there. Give me a job and let me pay 
taxes instead of taking your tax dollars every month.

SO UNFAIR IT'S ALMOST A CRIME; STATES' HUGE COST OF INCARCERATING ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IS TARGET OF CRIME BILL AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the House debates the all-important crime bill this week, every member of 
the California delegation should support an amendment that would require the 
federal government to either reimburse state and local governments for the cost 
of incarcerating illegal immigrants who have committed felonies or take the 
prisoners into federal custody. Washington created this burden and should 
provide relief.

 The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) and Karen L. 
Thurman, a Florida Democrat, wouldn't become mandatory until 1998. That delay 
would give Washington time to gain better control of U.S. borders. The delay 
also would allow Congress time to find the money. Finding money for new federal 
spending is always a challenge because of competing political and geographical 
priorities -- not to mention the huge federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Reimbursing states is not a new idea. The Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 (IRCA) authorizes Washington to reimburse states for much of the 
expense generated by immigration. But that act is meaningless without a 
significant appropriation. So far, not enough dollars have been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants is estimated at $600 million 
annually. That figure is based on an estimate of 30,000 undocumented immigrants 
incarcerated at a cost of $20,000 each per year. That's a huge expense for 
states to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Although absolute numbers are hard to come by, Gov. Pete Wilson estimates that 
California will spend $403 million from the fiscal 1995 budget to imprison more 
than 18,000 illegal immigrant felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, New York and Texas shoulder similar financial loads. These states' 
large congressional delegations also should strongly support this amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The California delegation rarely finds consensus because of the extreme 
political differences among its members, but certainly every member can agree 
that Washington must take on the costs of immigration, which is ultimately a 
federal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeing up the millions that California spends on jailing illegal non-citizens 
would allow the state to spend more on law enforcement and, just as important, 
on crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now it's almost a crime that the states are forced to unfairly bear the 
costs of federal neglect of immigration policy.

HANDS THAT ROCK THE CRADLE; ALL AMERICANS MUST REACH OUT TO HELP THE NATION'S 
YOUNGEST POOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America treats many of its youngest children shamefully. Trapped in 
unstimulating environments that stunt intellectual growth or in violent 
environments that harm emotional development, they have only a limited chance 
of maturing into healthy, responsible and productive adults. Blame the decline 
of our most vulnerable citizens on broken families, runaway poverty, inadequate 
health care and poor child care. But these need not be permanent conditions. 
They are reversible, and indeed must be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the findings of a Carnegie Corp. report, "Starting Points: Meeting 
the Needs of Our Youngest Children." The three-year study quantifies much of 
what America knew: More than 25% of babies are born to unmarried women; 25% of 
pregnant women get little or no prenatal care; babies account for one out of 
three victims of child abuse, and infants are the fastest-growing category of 
children entering foster care. These depressing statistics must challenge every 
American.  
</P>
<P>
 Government cannot raise children, but it can do something. Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) would provide an additional $1 billion for five proven, successful 
programs without inflating federal deficits. Boxer's amendment to the budget 
resolution -- an amendment that recently passed the Senate by a huge margin -- 
would provide $120 million for Head Start to make room for 24,000 additional 
poor children; $100 million for the important Women, Infants and Children (WIC) 
program, which provides nutrition for poor pregnant women, their infants and 
their other children; $200 million to provide child care for approximately 
44,000 youngsters; $200 million to help state-run programs ease infant 
mortality and reduce births of low-weight babies; $200 million to immunize 2 
million children. 
</P>
<P>
 This new and needed help would be funded through cuts in travel budgets for 
federal employees. It belongs in the final budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Start currently accepts poor children starting at 3 and 4 years old. That 
may be too late. New research indicates that critical development of the brain 
takes place during the first three years. To address the shortcoming, Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) would allocate an additional $1 billion to expand 
Head Start to begin at birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Business also should help by making good, affordable child care available to 
working parents; the majority of mothers with children over the age of 1 work.  
</P>
<P>
 Authors Lisbeth B. Schorr and Daniel Schorr a few years ago wrote an important 
book about breaking the cycle of disadvantage, "Within Our Reach." The Carnegie 
report documents that America's youngest poor children are indeed within our 
reach but steadily are slipping away.

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "I-10 Is Reopened -- but Spans Need Retrofitting," April 12: 
</P>
<P>
 The early reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway has been heralded as an 
example of the government's use of market incentives to benefit society. 
Supposedly, the $200,000 bonus for each day the project came in ahead of the 
deadline was a small price to pay when compared to the $1 million in economic 
losses caused each day by the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 But take a look at the actual analysis and a different story comes out. Almost 
90% of the $1-million-a-day price tag is attributed to "wage losses" caused by 
commuter delays. These losses, however, are imaginary, since commuters either 
learned to leave a few minutes earlier, or worked a little later. Yet it is 
these very same losses that Gov. Pete Wilson used to justify shelling out an 
additional $14.5 million; nearly doubling the total cost of the project. I may 
not be an economist, but spending real money to prevent imaginary losses 
doesn't seem to make good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the outcome of this marriage of business and government? Contractor 
Clinton Myers plans on buying himself a "bigger airplane" with the profits, 
while the rest of us taxpayers are left with just another example of wasteful 
government spending. 
</P>

 * I am amazed at the critics who wrote letters about the Santa Monica Freeway 
repair costs (April 12). Where were these concerned people when the contracts 
were being bid and let? If they preferred the Santa Monica Freeway repair to 
take the full nine months, why didn't they speak out in January against the 
contract targets? If they disagree with the Caltrans cost estimate to L.A. of 
$1 million each day the Santa Monica Freeway was closed, why wait until now to 
wake up and complain? Incredible.

 * In your story about the need to now retrofit the newly rebuilt Santa Monica 
Freeway bridges, Frieder Seible, chairman of a Caltrans advisory committee of, 
ahem, outside experts, says, "If we have a big earthquake, then yes, there can 
be serious damage to the extent where the bridge structure would have to be 
closed temporarily for that damage to be repaired." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, gee, Frieder, a big, uh, earthquake. Do you mean something along the lines 
of a, uh . . . oh, say a 6.8?  
</P>
<P>
 And politicians wonder why the voting public thinks they're all knuckleheads. 
Geez.

 * We are writing in protest of the decision not to retain the car-pool lanes 
on the reopened Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 When car-pool lanes were instituted on the 10 in the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake, thousands of us created car-pools -- almost 1,800 per hour 
according to one published report. We rearranged our schedules and overcame our 
L.A.-engendered fear of not having our cars with us at all times. Given proper 
incentives, we did the right thing, thereby reducing the number of cars on the 
road, the emissions released into our air, and the wear and tear on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to eliminate the car-pool lanes will not only anger the 
neo-car-poolers but also will send a message to other drivers that because the 
freeway is now whole, it is OK to go back to the one-person, one-car dictum. 
This is wrong! Bring back the car-pool lanes on the 10! 
</P>

<P>
 * It seems to me that there is something missing with people in the greater 
Los Angeles area when it comes to car-pooling, car-pool lanes, or ride-sharing 
in general, as it pertains to governmental involvement. The point is not that 
government is coming down on people and mandating fines to those who drive 
illegally in the car-pool lanes to prove that people must submit to the will of 
the government. The point is that we have lousy, rotten air that needs to be 
cleaned up! Period! 
</P>
<P>
 Car-pool lanes, it is hoped, encourage those who would otherwise drive alone 
to car/van-pool. Traffic congestion is only a secondary consideration to the 
air quality regulators, since the air is still further polluted by cars parked 
on the freeways. Opening car-pool lanes on weekends and holidays, and during 
non-rush-hour times is a viable option, and must be permitted by Caltrans. It 
is done in other metropolitan areas.  
</P>
<P>
 And ask any physical education teacher in the area about their kids' endurance 
and lung capacity. The EPA has statistics clearly showing breathing 
difficulties among children and seniors in this area versus the rest of the 
U.S. Any effort by any one person can make a difference. It's up to us. Now!

 * The rapid repair of the freeway shows what the people and government of 
California can do when they want to. It is all too easy to see that the people 
and government do not share a similar commitment to crime (all it would take is 
funding more police on the beat) or education. But, then, driving to the beach 
is so much more important than saving lives and educating children.

FISHERMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As an individual many years retired from hunting and fishing, I keep 
wondering from the daily news why hunters as a group are so much smarter and 
more intelligent than fisherman as a group. Hunters learned a 100 years ago 
when they reduced the plentiful beaver and buffalo almost to extinction and did 
kill off the last of our many billions of passenger pigeons that men just 
cannot go out and slaughter every wild thing in sight or reach with no thought 
of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Over much of the world varieties of fish, once diet staples, have disappeared 
from the waters by as much as 90%. Fisherman still do not get the idea that 
fish as a resource is finite. Fishermen, the professional ones, have to go 
farther and work harder. Fish prices go up while boat owners cry the blues. 
Greed still dominates and seemingly will until all sources of fish, even the 
least desirable, are exhausted. The handwriting is on the wall for all to see, 
if they can only read.

JUSTICE IN SINGAPORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "Singapore: What Price Justice?" (April 2) has certain factual 
errors and omissions. These are: 
</P>
<P>
 In referring to the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which empowers 
the authorities to detain secret society members and criminals like drug 
traffickers, your article states that "the accused is not allowed to present a 
defense." This is incorrect. Your reporter was informed during an interview 
with Singapore officials on March 28 that the accused person "can also be 
represented by counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 The article went on to say that "one man has spent 13 years and 9 months in 
detention for gang activity." It omitted the fact that he was being held for 
several cases of firearm robbery and murder in connection with his gang 
activity.  
</P>
<P>
 On an accused person's right to counsel, your article states that this is 
"limited to those who can afford a lawyer, as the state does not provide 
lawyers to the poor." This statement does not accurately convey the whole 
picture. For all capital cases, the state provides two defense lawyers to any 
accused person who cannot afford his own counsel, or who so chooses to be 
represented by state-assigned counsel. For most other non-capital cases, 
low-income earners can seek legal aid through a scheme provided by the Law 
Society. In short, the poor are not abandoned to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 You also cited the case where the chief justice, on hearing the appeal of an 
"educationally subnormal" Singaporean convicted of molesting a woman in a lift, 
increased a lower court's six months' sentence to include three strokes of the 
cane as well. But you failed to mention that the chief justice subsequently 
remitted the caning sentence after the head of the prison medical unit 
certified the man to be "not in a fit state of health" to undergo caning. In 
his ruling, the chief justice also cited medical authority to conclude that the 
man could not be considered educationally subnormal.

HELP THE PARENT, BUT NOT AT CHILD'S EXPENSE; WELFARE: REFORM MUST INCLUDE GOOD 
CHILD CARE, ALLOW FOR PART-TIME WORK AND EXEMPT MOTHERS OF INFANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISBETH B. SCHORR, Lisbeth B. Schorr, a lecturer in social medicine at 
Harvard University, was a member of the Carnegie Task Force on Young Children. 
She is working on a book about the large-scale implementation of successful 
social programs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welfare is supposed to be about aid to dependent children. You wouldn't know 
it from studying the plans of the welfare reformers, which are all about 
changing the behavior of adults -- sometimes at the expense of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform seems headed toward trading off a long-term national interest 
in the hope of immediate political gain. The intention is to deliver on 
President Clinton's promise of ending "welfare as we know it," but the skimpy 
resources available are not even enough to prepare unskilled, alienated adults 
for mainstream employment, much less to prepare their children for a 
self-sufficient adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting mothers to work while neglecting the needs of their children is out of 
sync with the nation's overriding concern about crime and violence. Police 
chiefs tell of their despair in trying to control crime and violence among 
adolescents and young adults whose early development was neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientific evidence documenting the early roots of crime and violence is 
overwhelming. A major report by a Carnegie Corp. task force, released last week 
at a conference featuring First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno, provides the latest substantiation of the central role of early 
childhood. It demonstrates that society pays dearly when the fundamental 
building blocks of healthy development are not put in place during the infant 
and toddler years. The Carnegie group found that in America, early childhood 
has "become a time of peril and loss," that very young children are "society's 
most neglected age group," even though "new evidence confirms that these years 
lay the foundation for all that follows." 
</P>
<P>
 It is remarkable how much unchallenged knowledge about the importance of the 
early years the welfare reformers, federal and state, are managing to ignore. 
It is now accepted knowledge that, during their first three years, young 
children need familiar adults who respond to their basic needs, care for them, 
protect them and act in predictable ways. Remove the loving adults who make 
them feel special and valued and you remove the foundation for empathy, a sense 
of right and wrong and even a good chance to succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of the importance of those early years, pediatricians and child 
development experts now urge parents to spend more time with their babies, to 
arrange part-time work and high-quality child care if they need to work outside 
the home, and not to allow marketplace demands to rob young children of 
parental attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-class parents are heeding this advice: They are being selective about 
child care; fathers spend more time at home, and more mothers are working 
part-time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poor mother? Under current plans for welfare reform, she would be told 
by her government that she must go to work or school, even if that means 
leaving her baby in care of dubious quality. There is no recognition of the 
need to achieve a reasonable balance between work expectations and parenting 
responsibilities. Some proposals call for mothers to leave infants as young as 
12 weeks in the care of others. What are the policy-makers saying to American 
parents? That middle-class children need parental time and attention to get a 
decent start on life, but that poor children do not? That the poor mother's 
role in laying a solid foundation for her children's schooling and future 
prospects is inconsequential, because the rest of society cares only that she 
works to earn a minimum wage? That quality child care will be reserved for 
those with the personal resources to pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
 Does it make sense to be devising welfare reforms to socialize adults to the 
world of work while dooming a generation of children by denying them the 
presence of caring adults, both at home and in child-care settings? 
</P>
<P>
 The "family day care" that is the most widely used form of child care for 
young children was found by a new study released earlier this month to be 
"barely adequate" on average, and possibly harmful to more than a third of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not envy the reformers operating in a financial straitjacket as they 
strive to make fundamental changes. Keeping people on the dole is relatively 
cheap. Preparing adults for work is more expensive. Helping parents to put 
children on the road to success in life may be even more expensive, but only 
using the most short-sighted calculation. If welfare reforms are to achieve 
improved outcomes, they must include quality child care (for current welfare 
recipients and the working poor), assurance that part-time work will meet the 
work requirement for mothers of young children, exemption of mothers of the 
youngest children from requirements to leave their children in the care of 
others and protection of families with young children from extreme deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforming welfare so that the journey from dependency to self-sufficiency will 
be made by not one but two generations is the soundest fiscal, social and moral 
investment that we can make for a better future for all Americans.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY; THERE'S PLENTY OF HYPOCRISY, BUT 
WHITEWATER IS NOT THE KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LERNER, Michael Lerner is the editor of Tikkun: A Bimonthly Jewish 
Critique of Politics, Culture and Society, and the author of The Politics of 
Meaning, to be published next year by Viking Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the Clintons didn't do anything illegal, several reporters on the 
Whitewater beat told me recently, but still they are guilty of massive 
hypocrisy. Since I am credited by the media with having inspired Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's "politics of meaning" speech a year ago, surely I should see that the 
Clintons were hypocrites for denouncing the selfishness of the Reagan-Bush 
years only to be revealed as immersed in that same profit frenzy.  
</P>
<P>
 To understand why this is misguided, one has to think deeply about politics in 
a way normally prohibited by sound bites. The essence of the politics of 
meaning is its critique of the way contemporary economic, political and social 
institutions foster selfishness and cynicism. Although we imagine that we can 
overcome the corrosive effects of public selfishness through private religious 
devotion or ethical commitment, the "me first" ways of the competitive market 
gradually corrode private life. Even our families and friendships are weakened 
because everyone has learned that this is a society in which "looking out for 
No. 1" is the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 The epidemic of selfishness shapes every area of our lives. Corporations 
deplete the Earth's resources with abandon. Their justification? Profit. This 
rip-off mentality pervades the middle class; tens of millions of Americans 
spent last week conjuring up reasons to pay less in income taxes, imagining 
that anything they could get away with was justified since "everyone else is 
doing it." Then, both the wealthy and the middle class turn to the poor to 
embody a higher ethic and are shocked when the same mentality leads the less 
advantaged to condone the kind of looting on the street level that corporations 
engage in on the planetary level. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of meaning suggests that we need to challenge this ethos of 
selfishness. But it rejects the assumption that those who are doing the 
challenging will necessarily be on a higher level. Quite the contrary -- the 
point of this kind of societal critique is that the corrosive dynamic affects 
everyone, including the reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how it has always been and must necessarily be. Those who advocate a 
higher moral ideal will always be less than the ideal they advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Our social reformers will always be "wounded healers," people who do not yet 
fully embody the ideals to which they aspire. Judaism and Christianity both 
recognize this in their holy texts. The Israelites, recent beneficiaries of 
liberation from Egypt and recipients of God's revelation, revert to building a 
golden calf. Instead of destroying them, God reveals to Moses the need for 
compassion. The New Testament tells a similar story about the very "rock" on 
which the church will be built, Peter -- who three times before the cock crows 
denies his association with Jesus. Would we say that these religions should 
never have started and that their adherents are hypocrites because they 
articulated ideals they could not fully live?  
</P>
<P>
 Yet somehow, Americans have got it in their heads that their leaders must be 
on a higher moral plane than everyone else. This insistence guarantees that our 
leaders will be liars who learn to hide who they really are because we demand 
that they appear flawless. And when the inevitable flaws come to light, we feel 
shocked and disappointed and so retreat to cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this process serves best the protectors of the status quo. They 
will always look less hypocritical because they openly advocate the very 
cynicism and selfishness that they also live. 
</P>
<P>
 But are we really well served by this? Would America have been better off if 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s romances had been exposed, his credibility decreased 
and his ability to lead a moral crusade for civil rights compromised? Would it 
have been better had John F. Kennedy been shown to be a philanderer before he 
could inspire a generation to ask what they could do for their country? And if 
the Clintons are politically crippled by a focus on the minor-league role they 
may have played in the selfishness of the 1980s, will the country really 
benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an argument for a blank check for our political leaders. If they 
commit crimes, they should be prosecuted. And there is hypocrisy worth publicly 
attacking -- namely, the disparity between their public pronouncements and the 
policies they support. If someone wants to critique the Clintons for failing to 
embody a politics of meaning in the way they've dealt with Bosnia, Haiti or the 
homeless, then we could have a reasonable discussion. What is unreasonable is 
to fault them for being self-interested in their private lives. In this 
society, everybody is. 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't that what they wanted to change? Yes, and there was nothing 
hypocritical in saying that. If they had said, "We want Americans to become 
like us because we have magically managed to transcend the selfish dynamic of 
this society," then the criticisms would make sense. This elitist attitude, 
embedded in Jimmy Carter's "malaise" speech, produced widespread antipathy 
since in Carter's case he seemed to be saying he was on a higher moral plane 
than most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 A politics of meaning does not fault people for being motivated by 
self-interest. Each of us has a part of ourselves that wants to transcend the 
selfishness and live according to our highest values and a part that thinks 
that unrealistic. To the extent that we believe everyone else will be motivated 
by selfishness, it is harder for anyone to move toward idealism.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons could address this complicated moral issue by saying: "Yes, we 
were part of the same dynamics that we were criticizing, and that was our 
point. In a society that rewards selfishness, everyone is going to act like 
that. By advocating a politics of meaning, we were advocating a change in the 
dynamic that we could only make together as a nation. Without that change, no 
matter how idealistic people are, they will get caught, as we did, in the 
pursuit of self-interest. It was because we recognized that, not because we 
thought we were more moral than anyone else, that we decided to challenge the 
dominant selfishness." 
</P>
<P>
 This level of honesty is precluded by our collective fantasy that our 
politicians must be morally better than we are. And it is precluded by cynical 
media that will interpret this as merely another bit of Clinton self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Whitewater remains the relentless and ferocious assault on the 
Clintons by all those forces that resist change in America. The Clintons were 
naive to not explicitly critique media cynicism before it got out of hand and 
talk more honestly about their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet nothing they could have done would have fully protected them from ruling 
elites terrified of substantial change. The military-industrial complex, wary 
of a progressive Democrat presiding over what it feared would become 
substantial pressure for a "peace dividend"; industrial and agricultural 
conglomerates worried about environmental sanity cutting into their profits, 
insurance and drug industries fearful of health reform -- all would inevitably 
gang up on Bill Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor could anyone fully withstand the wrath of media angered that a President's 
wife could challenge their fundamental belief that no one can be motivated by 
anything other than self-interest. By casting the change agents as 
self-promoters, the media serve the status-quo interests of those who own the 
means of mass communication and wish to discredit any change that might 
question their right to put selfish interests above the common good. The media 
are truly consistent: They both advocate and embody cynicism.  
</P>
<P>
 It is still not too late for Clinton to save his presidency. If he could 
consistently embrace a politics of meaning or any other unifying principle, 
reframe most of his agenda around that principle and then persuade people of 
its legitimacy and of how his programs flow from it, he would have a better 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's precisely what he has not done with health care. One has no idea how 
the parts of his program flow from central principle. His supporters are left 
with nothing more to say than that we want universal coverage -- a fine point, 
but one that provides little basis to respond to the other plans that also 
claim that.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the details of the Clinton plan do not flow from a politics of 
meaning, but rather from the Clintons' alleged "realism" that led them to adopt 
a pro-insurance plan. If they thought that could avoid savage assault from the 
Republicans and the special interests, the Clintons must have had a rude 
awakening. What they have endured was no less gentle than had they adopted a 
principled stand and fought for the kind of single-payer plan that Sen. Paul 
Wellstone (D-Minn.) has outlined.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the hypocrisy worth criticizing -- not what happened in the Clintons' 
personal finances years ago, but what they are doing in public policy now. It 
is here that Americans have been most disappointed, suspecting that the 
Clintons have not produced policies that embody a consistent politics of 
meaning. Taunted by the Republicans for this failure, supporters feel unable to 
explain what the Clintons are really about. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent town-hall meeting, audience members asked President Clinton, "Why 
should we trust you?" Some in the media interpreted that as a reference to 
Whitewater. But what participants were trying to say was this: "You act in such 
a compromising way that we don't believe we can trust you. You don't really 
level with us about your principles and you don't seem to fight for them."  
</P>
<P>
 It's this inability to follow through on principles, reflected as much in the 
health-care plan as in the ill-conceived way we relate to the slaughter in 
Bosnia or Haiti, that makes Clinton so vulnerable when the media and the 
privileged gang up on him as they have been doing on Whitewater.

NEXT YEAR, 'THE BROTHERS BALDWIN' BY ALEXANDER SOLZHENITSYN; CULTURE: A 
SOLUTION TO ITS DECLINE AND FALL IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, Chris Goodrich is writing a book about building a sports car 
from a kit and plans to publish it under the name Paul Newman. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Novelist Carole Maso proclaimed at a March conference sponsored by the 
National Book Critics Circle that "there is no room in commercial publishing 
for the ambitious goals of the serious writer. It is now an entertainment 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 She was prophetic: Later that month, at the Academy Awards, Kirk Douglas was 
introduced as a "bestselling novelist."  
</P>
<P>
 I haven't read Douglas' novel, so perhaps it's right up there with "Moby 
Dick." But regardless of its quality, the fact that actors now seem to be 
writing novels as well as optioning them suggests a solution to the decline in 
U.S. literary culture.  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it obvious? Celebrities, from Douglas to Ivana Trump, Kathie Lee Gifford 
to Patti Davis, want to be known as people with brains and hearts as well as 
pretty faces. Serious writers, from Nobel recipients Patrick White and Joseph 
Brodsky to Pulitzer winners Peter Taylor and Alison Lurie, want readers, yet 
have trouble selling more than few thousand copies of their work. It's a 
classic case of pent-up demand waiting to meet oversupply. All that's needed is 
a clearinghouse teaming the Brodskys with the Trumps: one writes, the other 
lends the name.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Carrie Fisher writes well, and Umberto Eco actually sells well, but 
they're exceptions. For most celebrities and writers, the leasing of famous 
names makes perfect sense, freeing writers from worrying about sales and 
celebrities from having to waste time at the keyboard.  
</P>
<P>
 There are kinks in this idea, but nothing that can't be worked out. If Burt 
Reynolds is going to tell Jay and Arsenio how he came to write a sequel to "A 
Frolic of His Own," William Gaddis will have to offer him some coaching -- and 
stress that when he used the term frolic, he had an un-Hollywood definition in 
mind.

ANGELS IN THE CLOUDS EVEN AFTER 5-4 DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one threw a chair or broke a bat over his knee. No one screamed in rage at 
the outcome of yet another taut game Sunday before 35,518 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, these are the feel-good Angels and even a 5-4, 10-inning loss to 
the Toronto Blue Jays wasn't going to ruin their enthusiasm on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Finley gave up two home runs in the first four innings, but didn't seem 
particularly downcast later. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Joe Grahe struggled in the pivotal 10th inning, giving up what turned 
out to be the winning run on Ed Sprague's blooper that first baseman Eduardo 
Perez misjudged. But Grahe took it in stride, saying he was happy with his 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson struck out not once, not twice but thrice. But he also hit a 
towering home run to left-center field that tied the score, 4-4, in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis hit a three-run homer that gave the Angels a short-lived 3-1 lead 
in the third inning. So far, the Angel designated hitter doesn't appear to be 
doing anything wrong, batting .388 with three homers and 12 runs batted in in 
13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina came up with runners on second and third and two out 
in the 10th, but sent a lazy fly ball to center fielder Devon White to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers took all this into consideration and declared Sunday, and 
indeed the Angels' first home stand, a rousing success. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the Angels were swept in three games by the Cleveland Indians 
and split four games against the two-time defending world champion Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we came out of this series with the feeling we can compete with the 
big boys," Rodgers said. "We played our tails off in this series." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged his concern for the bullpen, which faltered for the third 
consecutive game. But even that couldn't erase all of the positives. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, 0-2 with a 4.91 earned-run average, relieved Finley to start the ninth 
and immediately got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't field Roberto Alomar's chopper, which resulted in an infield 
single. After retiring Paul Molitor, he gave up a ground-rule double to Joe 
Carter. He then walked John Olerud intentionally to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 With the infield in, Sprague hit a flutter ball toward Perez, who simply 
mistimed his leap on what could have been an easy out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers didn't fault Perez, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's hit right on the handle, on a full swing like that, it's easy to 
misjudge," Rodgers said. "It's like a changeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar raced home nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though things aren't working out for me right now, I'm happy with the 
way I'm throwing the ball," Grahe said. "If I were going out and running 
3-and-1 counts on everybody and they were hitting rocket shots . . . but that's 
not happening right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, who gave up four runs and six hits with six strikeouts and three walks 
in nine innings, saw Sunday as a measure of progress. On a scale of one to 10, 
he gave himself a seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe seven and a half," he said. "I don't really like giving up four runs a 
game like I have been. Everything seems to be getting easier. If I can keep my 
run total down, I can give us a better chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 With Jackson and Davis around, there are always possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Angels trailing, 4-3, entering the eighth, Jackson slammed a 3-and-2 
pitch from reliever Tony Castillo far over the 386-foot sign on the wall in 
left-center. He seemed overmatched by every pitch Castillo had thrown until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo's Bo," Rodgers said, breaking into a wide smile. "What you see is what you 
get. He doesn't do anything in a small way. He'll give you the most god-awful 
at-bat, then come right back and hit the ball 500 feet."

NBA ROUNDUP; MAGIC STOPS BULLS' WIN STREAK AT 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal had 32 points, 14 rebounds and two blocked shots as the 
Orlando Magic ended the Chicago Bulls' winning streak at 10 with a 118-101 
victory Sunday at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen led the Bulls with 34 points, but none of them came in the 
final quarter. Horace Grant had 17 points, and made another point during a 
halftime interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant told NBC's Peter Vecsey that he is "totally committed to leaving" the 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "If they really wanted me to be a Chicago Bull for the rest of my life, they 
would have signed me," said Grant, who said he would like to play for the 
Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, if I'm not mistaken, Shaq said publicly that (they) need a power 
forward like Horace Grant. And he's the man down there. So talk to 'em, Shaq." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 107, New York 91 -- Larry Johnson scored 22 points at Charlotte for 
the Hornets, who kept their playoff hopes alive despite the absence of 
suspended Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Nets 110, Miami 103 -- Benoit Benjamin scored a season-high 26 
against Detroit Friday night and came back with 25 in this victory at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 142, Boston 100 -- The Bullets waited six months to play their best 
game of the season, handing the Boston Celtics had their worst loss in more 
than 15 years with this victory at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 104, Detroit 99 -- Former Laker Byron Scott scored nine of his 16 
points in the fourth quarter, leading the Pacers to a victory at Auburn Hills, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 99, Minnesota 88 -- The Nuggets, seeking their first winning season 
since 1989-90, improved to 39-39 with this victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockets 119, Trail Blazers 110 -- Vernon Maxwell and Kenny Smith became the 
first two players to have four-point plays in the same game and the Rockets 
broke the NBA record for most three-pointers in a season with 406 during the 
victory at Portland. Maxwell made six of his team's 10 three-pointers.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOT THE USUAL STARTING BLOCKS FOR CARL LEWIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sprinter Carl Lewis is about to appear on billboards across Europe in an 
unusual pose: poised as if to start a race and wearing, of all things, a pair 
of red stiletto heels. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph is part of a new advertising campaign by the Italian tire 
company Pirelli. The slogan for the ad: "Power Is Nothing Without Control." 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that, no matter how good you are, you can be let down without 
the proper equipment," a Pirelli spokeswoman said. "This will remind drivers 
all over Europe of the importance of using the right tires to ensure better 
safety on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure it will.

 Trivia time: What is the oldest UCLA track and field record? 
</P>
<P>
 That's show biz: Jim Leyland is widely respected as manager of the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, but in 1984, Houston General Manager Dick Wagner decided against 
hiring Leyland, then a coach with the Chicago White Sox, because he didn't like 
the way he dressed in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted Johnny Carson," Leyland said, "but he wasn't interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Absentee: From Tom Weir of USA Today: "Just for the record, was Tonya 
Harding's non-invitation to the White House bash for Winter Olympians the first 
issue she hasn't filed suit on?"

 Cold: Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe doesn't sympathize with Mario 
Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who complained recently about officiating 
in the NHL, among others things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some advice for Mario Lemieux," Dupont wrote. "Just play, baby. And the 
emphasis is on 'baby.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shrewd investment: David Letterman on Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to 
Wrigley Field in Chicago to throw out the first ball:  
</P>
<P>
 "At one point during the game, she was getting a hot dog and a Coke. She 
passed a $20 bill down the row to the vendor. She got back $500."

 Hook hitter: Heavyweight Michael Moorer, training for Friday's title fight 
with Evander Holyfield, on why he would have made a perfect Detroit Piston:  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a pretty good basketball player. I can knock guys out on the court as 
well as I can in the ring. I've been keeping busy playing a little ball in

 Superwoman: Gabrielle Reece, the 6-foot-3 supermodel and professional beach 
volleyball player, on dating:

 "Most men wouldn't approach me on a romantic level," she told Sun magazine.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What if an NBA game were scheduled and neither team showed up? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I thought it might happen Saturday night at the Sports Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After all, hadn't the Clippers and Lakers already packed it in for the season? 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it turned out to be a delightful couple of hours, Dominique Wilkins 
giving a recital of his skills and the Lakers slashing the Clippers' lead to 
one point after trailing by 20 with 10 minutes left. . . . The lame duck coach, 
Magic Johnson, said he couldn't complain about the Lakers' attitude this time. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the loss was their sixth in a row. So much for the magic. The euphoria 
wore off less than halfway through Johnson's coaching career after his Lakers 
won five of their first six. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lack of talent, more than lack of effort, caught up with them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Magic's successor is going to need patience, a free agent such as Horace Grant 
or Danny Manning, and a productive draft pick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is no secret that Jerry West covets Rick Pitino of Kentucky, who coached 
the New York Knicks to the Atlantic Division title in his second and final NBA 
season of 1988-89. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 College coaches who impress West, but don't have NBA experience, are Roy 
Williams of Kansas, Gary Williams of Maryland and Bob Huggins of Cincinnati. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Laker assistants Michael Cooper and Larry Drew are longshots. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers might also make a change, but owner Donald Sterling can't be 
eager to eat the remaining two years on Bob Weiss' three-year contract. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, who would want to occupy that hot seat? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny.Lenny Wilkens nearly signs with the Clippers, but, instead, moves from 
Cleveland to Atlanta to replace Weiss and becomes the leading candidate for NBA 
coach of the year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Kings' most disappointing season ever, Barry Melrose, 
who coached them to their most surprising season ever the year before, deserves 
another chance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He also deserves a general manager who is on the same page with him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to L.A., but not the playoffs. This is the first time since the Lakers 
moved from Minneapolis in 1960 and the Kings began operations in 1967 that no 
postseason NBA or NHL games will be played here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Spring football practice isn't the same any more, according to John Robinson. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed a lot," Robinson said after the conclusion of the second 
spring of his second stint at USC. "The academic schedule is a lot more 
demanding. Five or six kids have missed practice each day because of afternoon 
classes." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Improving our ability to run the football is a goal," he said. "But we can't 
and don't want to go back to being a dominating running team. In the old days, 
teams stayed in the same defense and let you run them into the ground. Now 
they'll put nine guys on the line of scrimmage and force you to pass." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojan opener is still set for Sept. 3 against Washington at the Coliseum, 
where officials say earthquake damage repair is on schedule. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The cover of the USC spring brochure billed quarterback Rob Johnson as a 
Heisman Trophy candidate. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "That's no distraction," Robinson said. "I wish I had seven Heisman Trophy 
candidates. I've gone to the banquet in New York twice and would love to go a 
third time." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Junior college transfers who caught the coach's eye during the spring were 
defensive end Marcus Bonds, outside linebacker Israel Ifeanyi, inside 
linebacker Errick Herrin and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former two-time lightweight champion Mando Ramos of Long Beach will become the 
first inductee into the Olympic Auditorium Boxing Hall of Fame during 
ceremonies before the Hector Lopez-Rod Sequenen fight Saturday night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy McKinney's decision victory over Welcome Ncita Saturday on ABC

ENGLAND'S STEVE ROBERTSON DEFENDS INDY LIGHTS TITLE; HEARN WINS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Englishman Steve Robertson and Richie Hearn of Arcadia won supporting races 
Sunday at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, becoming the first driver to score consecutive victories here in 
the Indy Lights series, moved into the lead when teammate Eddie Lawson took 
himself out of it -- and the race -- in a solo accident, then turned back a 
challenge by Canadian Greg Moore in the 47-lap race for Buick-powered 
Indy-style cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn moved into the lead in the Toyota Atlantic race -- for open-wheel cars 
with Toyota engines -- late in the race after leader Greg Ray had tangled with 
David Empiringham, taking both cars out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Indy Light drivers blamed a dirty track for a series of accidents that made 
the morning race more an exercise in yellow-flag driving than competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very slippery," said Robertson, who nearly put himself into the wall 
on one of the restarts after caution periods. "The track was so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Pedro Chaves of Portugal, the third-place finisher, agreed, Chaves 
pointing out that the main trouble spots were the first and second turns. 
Lawson, the motorcycle champion-turned-auto racer, offered living proof of 
that. He was running seven seconds ahead of the pack when he lost control 
coming out of Turn 2 and hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 David Pook, son of Long Beach Grand Prix promoter Chris Pook, finished 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn beat out another Southland driver, Steve O'Hara of Laguna Hills, in the 
Toyota Atlantic race. Robby Carville of Johnstown, N.Y., was third. MIKE KUPPER

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; A DIFFERENT REARDON, BUT RESULTS THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The beard is gone, and Sunday the knuckleball disappeared, too. Yet there was 
no mistaking Jeff Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon pitched a perfect ninth inning for his second save and the New York 
Yankees defeated the Tigers, 8-6, at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always go right after hitters," Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. But he's not accustomed to having someone else warming up in the 
bullpen while he is pitching. This time, the Yankees had Steve Howe getting 
ready. That means Reardon isn't "the man" anymore, and he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got pumped up when (Yankee Manager) Buck (Showalter) told me I had the 
ninth inning," said Reardon, who the Yankees signed just before spring training 
to bolster their suspect bullpen. "In years past, I knew that was automatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he's not complaining. He has 367 major league saves, and at 38 he knows 
the years are catching up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, there is no margin for error," Reardon said. "I knew Steve Howe was down 
there. Before, when I went out there, I was either going to win it or lose it. 
But maybe that will help us. Who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be out there. He wants to be out there. That's not all bad. It 
certainly is good for this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Williams ignited the four-run eighth with a sacrifice fly and Luis 
Polonia singled in two runs in the rally that enabled the Yankees to win two of 
three games from the Tigers, concluding a .500 trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 5, Minnesota 1 -- Ron Darling, coming off two shaky starts, limited 
the Twins to three hits in eight innings at Oakland and Mark McGwire homered 
for the third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling (2-1) had given up nine runs in nine innings in his two previous 
outings before putting it together against the Twins. He struck out eight 
before giving way to Billy Taylor, who pitched a perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 McGwire led off Oakland's fifth with his fourth home run of the season to make 
the score 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Boston 4 -- Outfielder Darrin Jackson homered off the light 
standard above the left-field wall in Fenway Park, singled, reached on an error 
and grabbed a potential homer over the right-field fence to lead the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Frank Thomas hit solo homers in the fourth inning, and Lance 
Johnson added two RBI singles. Scott Sanderson (1-0), making his first 
appearance for Chicago, gave up one run and six hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 8, Cleveland 3 -- Five days after the worst start of his career, 
Kevin Appier pitched seven strong innings for the Royals at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie designated hitter Bob Hamelin homered and doubled, driving in three 
runs and now has eight RBIs in his last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian McRae had four hits, matching his career high for Kansas City, which 
completed its first sweep in Cleveland since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier (1-2) came into the game with a 13.50 ERA after giving up nine runs in 
three innings of a 22-11 loss to Boston last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 8, Milwaukee 3 -- Ken Griffey Jr. and Torey Lovullo each had three 
hits for the Mariners at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle broke out of a 16-inning scoreless streak with the five-run outburst 
against Milwaukee starter Jaime Navarro in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Texas 5 -- Reliever Lee Smith came on in the ninth inning to shut 
down a Ranger uprising and give the Orioles a victory at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 6-2, Texas began its comeback when Juan Gonzalez and Jose Canseco 
opened the bottom of the ninth with consecutive home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alan Mills, who had come on to pitch the ninth for Baltimore, gave up a 
single to Dean Palmer, Smith took the mound and allowed only only one more run.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BRAVES, REAL ROAD WARRIORS, WIN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Smoltz is among those who think the Atlanta Braves are going to have an 
easy time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we're ever going to lose two in a row," he said after a 4-2 
victory over the Cubs Sunday at Chicago enabled the Braves to tie the team 
record with their 10th consecutive victory on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz (2-1) gave up five hits in seven innings, struck out eight and walked 
two. Atlanta, with the best record in baseball at 12-1, also won 10 in a row on 
the road in July of 1992. Including the end of the 1993 season, the Braves have 
won 12 consecutive road games. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many things we can do when we have a lead," Smoltz said. "Now 
that we're 12-1, we don't feel there is any team that can catch us." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz, who had 208 strikeouts last season, has the National League lead with 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pitching since day one has been sensational," Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox 
said. "As for Smoltz, he's been around for a long time. He has great stuff. 
Both his fastball and curveball were working well." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 9, Florida 8 -- Barry Bonds and Matt Williams hit two-run homers 
to help the Giants take a 9-2 lead at Miami before the Marlins fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 An RBI double by Chuck Carr and Gary Sheffield's two-run homer in the seventh 
cut the Giants' margin to 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 To start the eighth, Kevin Rogers relieved Mark Portugal, who won his 14th 
consecutive decision. Rogers' second pitch brushed back Benito Santiago, who 
then charged the mound and was tackled by the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's instinct," Santiago said. "It's just something that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rogers: "Elbows were flying, bodies were flying, punches were being 
thrown. It was wild out there. I'm a little claustrophobic to begin with, and 
it was scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Because both teams had previously been warned about brush-back pitches, Giant 
Manager Dusty Baker was ejected. So were Santiago and Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago's anger seemed to inspire the Marlins. A double, three walks and Dave 
Magadan's two-run single trimmed San Francisco's lead to a single run. Mike 
Jackson then struck out Sheffield with two on to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 6, Montreal 5 -- Ellis Burks homered with two out in the 10th inning 
at Denver, leading the Rockies to their sixth victory in 11 games, putting them 
above .500 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado has won four consecutive games and also has won six consecutive 
extra-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks, who started the day as the NL's second-leading hitter at .438, hit his 
fifth homer of the season, against Gil Heredia (0-2), Montreal's sixth pitcher. 
Montreal closer John Wetteland left the game one at-bat earlier because of an 
undisclosed injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Munoz (1-1), Colorado's sixth pitcher, threw a one-hit 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, Philadelphia 0 -- The Reds' Tom Browning pitched a two-hitter at 
Philadelphia to win for the first time since last July 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning (1-0), who sat out the final three months of 1993 because of a broken 
finger, struck out four and walked two in his first complete game this year. It 
was his 12th career shutout, his first since May 7, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, San Diego 0 -- Geromino Pena homered from both sides of the plate 
to lead the Cardinals over the struggling Padres at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, playing only because of an injury to second baseman Luis Alicea, homered 
left-handed in the third and right-handed in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Arocha rebounded from two poor starts with a five-hitter as the Cardinals 
won for the fourth time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Houston 2 -- Jeff Kent hit two more home runs, including a two-run 
shot in the eighth inning, to lead the Mets at New York. Kent has six home runs 
and 13 RBIs in his last six games.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton finished its three-game Big West Conference series against 
Nevada Las Vegas with a 3-0 victory Sunday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Titans didn't pound Las Vegas as in the previous two games, they got 
a lift from Dante Powell, who had a triple and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans have swept UNLV in their last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan pitcher Dan Ricabal (4-0), who went the distance, had nine strikeouts 
and gave up five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is alone atop the Big West with a 9-3 conference record (31-8 
overall). UNLV (23-20, 5-7) is second in conference.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; RANGERS SHOW ISLANDERS WHO'S BOSS, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Round one of the battle of New York went to the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 On an early knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went right for us, especially in the second period," defenseman 
Brian Leetch said after the Rangers defeated the Islanders, 6-0, Sunday at 
Madison Square Garden in the opener of their NHL playoff series. "You try to 
set the tone in the first game and this was really a good win." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst margin of defeat for the Islanders in 215 playoff games. They 
have lost by five goals on six occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Messier had a goal and two assists and led a decisive four-goal second 
period as the Rangers dominated the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers led, 2-0, after the first period and 6-0 after two, making it easy 
for goaltender Mike Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter made 21 saves in recording his third playoff shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 5, St. Louis 3 -- Coach Bob Gainey gambled and won, using Darcy Wakaluk 
in goal instead of veteran Andy Moog, as the Stars won their first playoff game 
at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakaluk stopped 33 shots in his first playoff game and Grant Ledyard and Trent 
Klatt scored late third-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was not too difficult to make because I felt I couldn't go 
wrong," Gainey said. "I have confidence in both. Darcy has been playing very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 2, New Jersey 0 -- In this playoff opener at East Rutherford, N.J., 
Dominik Hasek gave the Sabres just what they expected -- great goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 And Todd Simon provided the unexpected -- a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasek, who had a 1.95 goals-against average during the regular season, stopped 
30 shots, and the seldom-used Simon provided his first NHL goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good season, that's why I feel confident now," said Hasek, who 
stopped a league-high 93 percent of the shots he faced this past season. "I 
think I saw every shot except one in the third. Fortunately it hit me in my 
pad." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, who played only 15 games with the Sabres after spending most of the 
season in the AHL, put the Sabres ahead on his first shift of the game with 11 
seconds left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the edge of the goalie's crease, Simon deflected a Dale Hawerchuk 
shot from the right point into Devils goalie Martin Brodeur. The puck came out 
and Simon pushed the rebound back into the goalie only to be stopped again. On 
his third try, he chipped it over the prone goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- The Capitals wore down the Penguins with 
patience and defensive pressure, sealing the playoff victory at Pittsburgh on 
Joe Juneau's breakaway goal at 10:34 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about playing abrasive, aggressive hockey and we did," Capitals 
coach Jim Schoenfeld said. "We were aggressive defensively, but we were also 
aggressive offensively by attacking the net. You've got to play intelligently 
against a team with the firepower they have, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins responded with the same passive, mistake-prone style that led to 
their second-round playoff series loss to the New York Islanders last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little flat, and we didn't have the intensity we should have had 
from everybody," said Mario Lemieux, who scored twice.

MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP; SENNA SPINS OUT AGAIN AND SCHUMACHER WINS

<P>
 Michael Schumacher took the lead when pole-sitter Ayrton Senna spun out 
seconds after the start and held on to win the Pacific Grand Prix Formula One 
race Sunday at Aida, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Senna spun out as the cars approached the initial curve and his 
Williams-Renault was sideswiped by the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini. Neither 
driver was hurt but both cars were finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the second in as many races for Schumacher, who guided his 
Benetton-Ford to victory last month in Brazil after Senna had spun. Sunday, 
Schumacher completed the 83-lap race in 1 hour, 46 minutes at an average speed 
of 108.69 mph.  
</P>
<P>
 Gerhard Berger of Austria, driving a Ferrari, finished second, 1 minute, 
15.300 seconds behind. Rubens Barrichello of Brazil, driving for Jordan-Hart, 
was one lap back in third. Only 11 of the 26 starters finished the race, the 
first Formula One event ever held in Aida.

<P>
 Ferrari made a successful return to international sports car racing Sunday 
when Jay Cochran led a Ferrari 333 SP one-two finish at the IMSA Grand Prix of 
Atlanta EXXON World Sports Car Championship race at Braselton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory came in Ferrari's first international sports car race in more than 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Averaging 116.040 m.p.h., Cochran, from Palm Beach, Fla., finished a full lap 
ahead of the second-place Ferrari driven by Gianpiero Moretti and Eliseo 
Salazar.

 Terry Labonte ended a five-year absence from victory lane, overtaking Rusty 
Wallace with 28 laps to go Sunday to win the First Union 400 by four seconds at 
North Wilkesboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Labonte last won a Winston Cup event on July 30, 1989, a streak of 135 races. 
That day, he took the Diehard 500 at Talladega, Ala.

<P>
 Ernie Irvan had appeared on the verge of a $91,200 bonus for winning a Winston 
Cup race but dropped back to fifth after a late pit stop by the leaders. Irvan 
finished third.

ANN CONWAY: SHOWCASE IS MUSIC TO EARS OF ARTS PATRON

 Don't go looking for social catalyst Arlene Cheng to stage a ball on behalf of 
the Chinese American community in Orange County. She says gatherings shot with 
sparkle and splash just wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask me why the Chinese don't like balls, " says Cheng, who came to the 
United States from Malaysia in 1956. "I'm so Americanized; I'm still learning 
the Chinese way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 But do watch for the Newport Beach arts philanthropist to build her "baby" -- 
the Showcase of Young Musicians at the Irvine Barclay Theatre -- into a 
national contest. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the three young winners of the second annual competition will 
perform in Cheng Hall (named after Arlene and her husband, George, an 
ophthalmologist, when they made a $750,000 donation to the Barclay in 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 music lovers -- many of them Chinese -- are expected to attend 
the concert, which will feature the Pacific Symphony Orchestra and Showcase 
winners Jennifer Bai, 21, a violinist, and pianists Brenda Lee Jones, 15, and 
Tiffany Kuo, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The three musicians competed earlier this year in a field of 14 contestants 
from Southern California. Bai, who is from Los Angeles, will perform 
Vieuxtemps' Violin Concerto No.5. Jones, a resident of Yorba Linda, will play 
Chopin's Piano Concerto No.1. And Kuo, who is from Claremont, will perform 
Liszt's "Hungarian Fantasy." Each was awarded a $1,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheng hopes to take the competition, which is sponsored by the orchestra's 
Chinese-American League, statewide in two years. "And maybe nationwide in about 
five to seven years," says Cheng, who is a member of the orchestra board. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dream, she admits, but a realistic one. "The Chinese have a love of 
classical music and they love to get their children into music. They know it 
gives them joy and discipline," Cheng says. "We need to build a solid 
foundation of support before we can go national. And we are still learning. But 
there is nothing like it in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hallmarks of the Chinese culture is a "great belief in education," 
says Ken Goldman, the orchestra's outgoing development director. "The Chinese 
are very proud of their young people and their skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Lin of North Tustin agrees. "Music is an important part of life," says 
Lin, whose husband, Dr. Fitz Lin, is a professor at UCI Medical Center. She 
joined the Chinese-American League to help boost children with musical talent. 
"If we don't encourage them, who will?" she asks. "These days, people are 
always thinking about kids getting into science and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these kids (with musical talent) are the ones who really need our support 
and encouragement. If we don't give it to this generation, there will be less 
music in the world for the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra was quick to recognize how Orange County's Chinese community 
might become a valuable resource in terms of audience support. "The symphony 
understands that Orange County is changing -- that there are large and new 
population segments that are coming into prominence," Goldman says. "The 
Chinese American community is one of them. A great many Chinese live in Irvine 
and Newport Beach. We are trying to make them feel welcome and part of the 
symphony." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 3:30 p.m. concert, guests who have donated a minimum of $75 to the 
Showcase (tickets to the performance range from $15-$25) will gather backstage 
to dine on fare from Tsuru restaurant of Newport Beach and toast Dorothy and 
Henry Hwang of Pasadena, the event's honorary chairmen. Henry Hwang is 
president and CEO of Far East Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 With a generous donation ("They would be too modest to want you to know how 
much," Cheng says) the Hwangs have sponsored this year's Showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, guests will participate in a karaoke fest. "The Chinese like 
karaoke," Cheng says. "They are crazy over it! It's very strong in Taiwan. And 
in Pasadena (where Cheng also has a home) they have karaoke parties. People 
build a social gathering around it in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she sing karaoke backstage at the Barclay? "Oh, they've asked me to," 
says Cheng, a pianist. "They're trying hard to get me to sing. I told them if 
they don't mind hearing me croak, it's OK."

JACK SMITH: A SCHOOL FULL OF STAR PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My Hollywood friend, Duke Russell, called the other day to ask if I'd like to 
see the Hollywood High School Alumni Museum. I had no great desire to see it, 
being a Belmont High School alumnus, but Duke is such a dedicated Hollywood 
alumnus (Class of '44) that I hated to show a lack of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke is a man of heartfelt loyalties. Last year, on Lincoln's birthday, he 
read Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in an almost empty Hollywood Bowl. His only 
auditors were me and his daughter, Colleen, who photographed this historic 
event. Duke noted that the city was doing nothing to celebrate Old Abe's 
birthday and he took it upon himself to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke picked me up and drove me to Hollywood High. It was a school day and the 
classrooms were in business. We went to the school library, where we met the 
librarian, Beverly Taylor, and were soon joined by the principal, Dr. Jeanne 
Hon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Taylor was instructing several students working at word processing 
machines. The library's woodwork had been newly finished, and a great mural 
spread across one wall. It had the look of one of the many paintings done in 
public places by artists working for the Works Progress Administration during 
the Depression. Ms. Taylor said the mural had indeed been painted by Haldane 
Douglas in the 1930s. It was a treasure and I was glad to see that the school 
respected it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hon turned out to be a bright and amiable woman who was obviously having a 
busy day, but she showed us into the new museum. As one might expect, the 
museum consisted mainly of photographs of movie stars who had attended 
Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them were caught in campus garb, although most of the pictures had the 
touch of studio glamour. Dr. Hon pointed to a picture of Lana Turner and noted 
that she had been rather flat chested. I thought Lana looked very well endowed. 
Perhaps too much was expected of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Massey, assistant principal and curator of the museum, pointed out that 
Miss Turner was not discovered in Schwab's drugstore, as the legend has it, but 
in a malt shop across the street from the school. (I had previously heard this 
version from Miss Turner herself.) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is just as well that Schwab's no longer exists. Tour guides would 
not be able to point it out as the place where Lana was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other famous faces smiled at us from the walls. I recognized, with some 
prompting, Mickey Rooney, Alexis Smith, Sally Kellerman, Anita Louise, Ricky 
Nelson, Judy Garland, Mary Brian, Carol Burnett, James Garner, Marie Windsor, 
Fay Wray and Tuesday Weld. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the famous faces were movie stars. Among them were Warren Christopher, 
secretary of state, and Norman Chandler, late publisher of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 How could a Belmont boy compete with that illustrious gallery? 
</P>
<P>
 I tried going over the names of some of my more promising classmates, but I 
found few who had distinguished themselves in any field. Only a handful I could 
think of had achieved any celebrity at all. 
</P>
<P>
 One had to count Jack Webb, star and producer of the "Dragnet" series. Carl 
Hartnack had become president of the Security First National Bank, with an 
office Downtown overlooking the Belmont playing field (he started out as a 
teller at $18 a week). Mort Sahl had become a famous comedian and political 
satirist. John Beradino had become a major league baseball player and later a 
star of the "General Hospital" series. There was also my lawyer, Manya Bertram. 
</P>
<P>
 Have I forgotten anyone? What ever became of Charles Kelley, everybody's nice 
guy? Whatever became of Kellogg Burnham, the poet? What about Virginia Moranti? 
She was pretty enough to be a movie star. She was my girlfriend for a while but 
she dropped me for a pole vaulter. Whatever happened to him? (I've forgotten 
his name.) 
</P>
<P>
 Why did so many Hollywood High School kids become movie stars? Did just living 
in Hollywood incline them to that profession? Did they live in Hollywood so 
they could be close to the studios? 
</P>
<P>
 Located at Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, the school is within walking 
distance of many Hollywood landmarks -- the Grauman's (now Mann's) Chinese 
Theater, the Egyptian Theater, the Hollywood Bowl, Frederick's of Hollywood, 
the Musso & Frank Grill, and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke and I had lunch at the Roosevelt. Recently remodeled, it retains a look 
of '30s Hollywood glamour. It was the scene of the first Academy Awards. It is 
also now the new home of the Greater Los Angeles Press Club, a fitting location 
for that honorable organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont is on Crown Hill, only a few miles east of Hollywood High. Conceivably 
I could have gone to Hollywood instead of Belmont. Who knows? I might have 
given Anita Louise her first kiss.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WADING INTO THE WATERY GRAVE OF LEFT-WING POLITICS; THE 
TAKING OF THE WATERS BY JOHN SHANNON ; JOHN BROWN BOOKS $13, 403 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Historical fact: Los Angeles stole the Owens Valley's water. Nobody argues 
otherwise. Even Hollywood, one of the indirect beneficiaries of the crime, 
lifted it out of history and into the popular imagination with "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a crime so huge seems beyond rectifying. Who would dismantle the city to 
make the desert green again? We can't spit out what the L.A. oligarchy -- 
including The Times -- did in the 1920s, any more than we can swallow it. It 
sticks in our craw. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shannon describes the "taking of the waters" in the first part of this 
novel about three generations of left-wing activists. He also uses it as an 
overall metaphor for the drying up of radical politics in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a big subject that has been explored remarkably little in recent 
years. After E.L. Doctorow's 1971 novel "The Book of Daniel" and Warren 
Beatty's movie "Reds," the list gets thin indeed. Hardly anybody has told the 
story in the straightforward way Shannon has here. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Shannon, a San Pedro native who had three novels published in England, 
couldn't find a major publisher for "The Taking of the Waters," despite its 
thoughtfulness, its wit, its well-rounded characters and its lean, readable 
prose. (Copies can be obtained from John Brown Books, P.O. Box 2355, Culver 
City, Calif. 90231; (310) 836-6583.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon's shrewdest tactic is to have a foreigner, German journalist Dieter 
Sachs, narrate the story. What he loses in plausibility -- the framework 
sometimes creaks -- he gains in tone. America seems off-center and bizarre to 
Sachs; seeing things as he does, we are moved to reconsider them. 
</P>
<P>
 At first with a wry, almost anthropological detachment, then with mounting 
anxiety, Sachs accompanies his American friend and counterpart, Clay Trumbull, 
on a doomed last crusade into the Owens Valley. Later, in researching Clay's 
family, he traces the deep, dusty channel where the American Left once flowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay's grandmother, Maxi, a New York muckraker and feminist, arrives in the 
valley when its farmers are making a final stand against the L.A. water barons. 
She falls in love with Kiel Everett, a leader of the farmers, and helps him 
rally his neighbors to an inspiring -- if temporary -- victory. Then force and 
financial chicanery prevail and she dies in a despairing attempt to dynamite 
the Los Angeles Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxi's son, Slim, remembers Everett telling him: "Not everything that wins is 
honorable, but to be honorable you have to win " -- because it's the winners 
who write history. 
</P>
<P>
 So Slim Trumbull dedicates his life to winning. A hard-line Communist labor 
organizer, he leads a landmark strike at a tractor plant in Michigan, braving 
management goons and National Guard tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers do win. But the Communists lose. The Cold War drives them 
underground and wipes out public memory of any good they have done. 
Khrushchev's 1956 "secret speech" about Stalin's atrocities tells die-hards 
such as Slim that they have wasted their lives -- a disillusionment that drives 
his wife, Myra, to suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 80, Slim clings stubbornly to socialism, but he can't answer Sachs' 
question: "Tell me why so much horror was done in (its) name. . . . And why it 
failed." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan to discuss the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cambodia, then. Genocide, for Christ sake. " 
</P>
<P>
 Disillusionment also haunts Slim's son, Clay, a New Left journalist reduced to 
a sullen, Harley-riding parody of Hunter S. Thompson. His crusade in the Owens 
Valley -- against a Mafia-run porno film studio -- doesn't even pretend to 
counter the main thrust of electron-swift, media-savvy, post-industrial 
capitalism, and he knows it. He also knows that he has little hope of winning. 
But in defiance of Everett's dictum, he insists on salvaging a measure of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Shannon's intention, too. He reminds us that the American Left has 
often been on the side of the angels. Its partial victories humanized 
capitalism; its defeat, the negation of so much courage and hope, Sachs warns, 
is breeding "gangrene . . . corruption, complacency and a world order without 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 This is an unpopular conclusion these days. Many will refuse to swallow it, 
but few who read "The Taking of the Waters" will be able to spit it out, 
either. It sticks in Shannon's craw; he makes sure that it sticks in ours as 
well.

SHIP SUSPECTED OF SMUGGLING IMMIGRANTS SEIZED; HIGH SEAS: TAIWANESE FISHING 
VESSEL WITH 121 PEOPLE ABOARD IS INTERCEPTED BY COAST GUARD OFF THE COAST OF 
MEXICO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coast Guard found 121 people on a Taiwanese fishing vessel seized in the 
Pacific off Mexico after shadowing it for days as a suspected immigrant 
smuggler, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding party found 10 women, 101 men and 10 crewmen aboard the 168-foot 
Jin Yinn No. 1, and all appeared to be healthy, according to a statement issued 
from the Coast Guard district headquarters in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel was apparently being escorted by Coast Guard cutters to Mexican 
waters, as was done in a similar case last summer, but U.S. authorities would 
not confirm the destination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard referred queries to the State Department, but a duty officer 
in Washington said there would be no information available until today. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Coast has experienced a flurry of attempts to land undocumented 
Chinese from oceangoing vessels. There have been similar incidents on the East 
Coast, including a grounding off New York in which eight immigrants died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jin Yinn No. 1 was spotted April 9 by a Coast Guard aircraft 400 miles 
southwest of San Diego. It was trailed for five days before being boarded about 
12:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement teams from the cutters Sherman and Active boarded it about 890 
miles southwest of San Diego, the Coast Guard statement said, adding that the 
Jin Yinn No. 1 was being "escorted eastward to shorten the logistic trail." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that direction from the point of seizure indicated the vessel was 
being taken to Mexico, Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer John Hollis said he 
could not confirm that, or say which country all those aboard were from. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had permission from Taiwan authorities to board and take control of the 
vessel, which is what we've done," Hollis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jin Yinn No. 1 had a 10-day supply of food when it was boarded, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the Coast Guard intercepted more than 650 would-be immigrants from 
China on three boats floating in international waters off Mexico. After 13 days 
in limbo, the boats were allowed to dock in Baja California, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people on the boat were granted requests to seek asylum in the United 
States but the rest were deported from Mexico to China. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has tried to keep smuggled immigrants from landing in this 
country because asylum-seekers can stay for years while their requests are 
resolved. Mexico, however, can repatriate immigrants immediately.

PALL OF DISBELIEF AT SERVICE FOR 26 COPTER VICTIMS; TURKEY: U.S. PILOTS' 
MISTAKEN SHOOT-DOWN OF TWO HELICOPTERS OVER IRAQ DRAWS ANGER, SORROW AT 
MEMORIAL ON AIR BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The home air base for U.S. planes flying over northern Iraq held a memorial 
service Sunday for the 26 people killed Thursday when U.S. jets mistakenly 
destroyed two U.S. helicopters over Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Turks here expressed a mix of anger and sorrow over the deaths of three 
Turkish officers and American, British, French and Iraqi Kurdish passengers. 
The service at Incirlik Air Base was closed to journalists. Civilians there 
said by telephone that the accident had cast a pall of disbelief over the 
community of 5,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal of sadness," said Don Torrey, principal of the base's 
high school. "This morning the chaplain gave a very sorrowful prayer for the 
victims, for the people at the base, for the people who were part of it and for 
the investigating team." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are at a loss as to how it could possibly happen," said Mary Davis, 
director of the elementary school. "Didn't (the Blackhawk helicopters) have 
U.S. markings? It's just absolutely mind-boggling that it could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Turks in the neighboring city of Adana, "everyone is sad and mad," said 
a man who would identify himself only as Yildren. "Americans have such high 
technology, it's hard to believe that you can make that kind of mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The widow of the senior Turkish officer killed Thursday, Col. Hikmet Alp, told 
the Turkish daily Hurriyet that she would sue the United States if the American 
pilots were found to have erred in the incident, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in two years that Turkish soldiers have died from a 
U.S. military blunder. In October, 1992, the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga 
mistakenly fired two missiles into a Turkish destroyer, killing five and nearly 
sinking the ship. Some Turks later expressed resentment when the U.S. Navy did 
not court-martial those held responsible.

STREET SMART: THERE ARE WAYS TO BYPASS VEHICLE STALLED IN THE CAR-POOL LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I recently came upon an interesting situation on the northbound San Diego 
Freeway. A CHP officer had a vehicle stopped in the car-pool lane with a single 
person in the car. He had his emergency lights on and was out of his vehicle 
talking to the single occupant. I was in the third lane and not involved with 
this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: If I were in the car-pool lane and came upon this scene, what are my 
options? Do I pull out (safely) and cross the double yellow lines into the No. 
1 lane and proceed around them, or must I stop and wait until the officer is 
through with the action he has taken? 
</P>
<P>
 William Huber, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 What you witnessed was unusual, said Steve Kohler, a spokesman for the 
California Highway Patrol in Sacramento. It may have been that the officer did 
not stop the vehicle in the middle of the lane, but that the vehicle stopped 
there of its own accord, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had been traveling in the car-pool lane and come upon this situation, 
you would be correct in stopping 300 feet or more behind the officer and 
waiting for the officer to direct you into another lane of traffic, Kohler 
said. If you were to come upon a disabled vehicle or some other obstacle in the 
car-pool lane, and there was no officer present, it would be permissible for 
you to cross over the double yellow lines and proceed with caution into the No. 
1 lane, he said. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, on Pacific Coast Highway and Del Obispo Street and the entrance 
to Harbor Drive, there are no street signs. I live off of Del Obispo farther 
north, and friends of ours have a hard time finding our street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike J. Siminuk, Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 If you look closely, you will see street names painted on the curbs in your 
neighborhood. But I agree -- that does not butter a lot of parsley when people 
are trying to find your house and they have to keep their eyes glued to street 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart. A citywide program in Dana Point is now in progress to install 
overhead street signs where they are lacking and replace old signs with snazzy 
new ones. Signs for Harbor Drive, Pacific Coast Highway and Del Obispo Street 
are included, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the signs began in January, with each street given a priority, 
said Jerry Gonzalez, traffic engineer for Dana Point. Most of Dana Point's 
major intersections already have been outfitted with new overhead street signs 
and work on residential streets will begin within the next couple of weeks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the signage program includes a face lift. The new signs will be blue 
and white and include the city's logo, Gonzalez said. All existing 
green-and-white signs also will be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire program, including residential areas, probably will not be 
completed for at least another year, Gonzalez said. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart:

<P>
 Are there plans to extend the Century Freeway from its present end at the San 
Gabriel River Freeway 1 1/2 miles east to the Santa Ana Freeway? Why or why 
not? 
</P>
<P>
 Brian D. Bowski, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, when the Century Freeway (formally known as the Glenn M. 
Anderson Freeway) was in the planning stages, Norwalk residents balked at the 
idea of yet another freeway slicing through their city, said Jill Anderson, 
senior management assistant for Norwalk. The Santa Ana and San Gabriel River 
freeways already separated the community geographically. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of these community concerns and objections, the Century Freeway was 
not designed to connect with the Santa Ana Freeway, she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority has scheduled a public hearing for 
9 a.m. April 25 to discuss proposed changes in bus fares and transfer fees. The 
hearing will be held at the County of Orange Planning Commission Hearing Room, 
Hall of Administration, 10 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes include offering a new discounted fare coupon providing 
10 rides for $9; issuing transfers at no charge (currently the transfer for 
full cash fares is 5 cents, with seniors and people with disabilities receiving 
transfers at no charge), and extending the time in which transfers can be used 
from 1 1/2 hours to two hours (while also limiting the number of transfers to 
two times within the OCTA system). 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations include keeping the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * $1 full cash fare; 
</P>
<P>
 * 45-cent fares for peak hours and 15 cents for off-peak hours for seniors and 
people with disabilities; 
</P>
<P>
 * Monthly passes of $37.50 for residents, $33.50 for students and $18.50 for 
seniors and disabled people; 
</P>
<P>
 * Fare exemptions for up to three children, 6 years and under, who ride with a 
fare-paying passenger.

CRAYON TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In as much as it was our laboratory that first detected the presence of lead 
in crayons and chalk, I read with interest your editorial on the same subject, 
"Crayons That Don't Put You in a Box" (April 11). The editorial referred to 
parents trying to decipher gibberish, specifically "conforms to ASTM D-4236" to 
try and determine if the product is safe for their children.Well, they can 
decipher all they want but it won't help much. 
</P>
<P>
 The current ASTM D-4236 (American Society for Testing and Materials), and 
anyone familiar with it will agree, does not necessarily mean that the crayons 
or chalk were actually tested for anything. In essence, ASTM D-4236 means that 
the listed ingredients of a product would be subjected to a toxicological 
review of the scientific literature. The purpose of this is to determine the 
presence of harmful ingredients as listed by the manufacturer; if none are so 
listed the statement may be applied. 
</P>
<P>
 We have analyzed numerous samples of crayons in our laboratory and never once, 
as expected, was lead listed as an ingredient. In fact we have actually 
detected lead in samples that carried the ASTM statement on the package.

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: TAXING JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES BATES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Friday's tax deadline was particularly painful for big wage earners 
subjected to the Clinton Administration's retroactive tax increase on families 
earning $200,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who moved relatively recently into the category are three of the 
state's best-known politicians, according to information in the latest 
California Lawyer magazine. Each is now making rain at Los Angeles law offices. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the magazine, former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's pay has 
jumped from $117,884 as mayor to an estimated $400,000 as senior counsel at 
Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Gov. George Deukmejian now makes an estimated $700,000 as a partner at 
Sidley & Austin, according to the magazine, compared to $120,000 as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Also doing well is Mel Levine, the former Westside congressman who now is a 
corporate partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. The magazine estimates Levine 
earns $750,000 annually, according to the magazine, compared to $133,000 as a 
congressman. On the Block? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the higher-profile Southern California real estate properties taxpayers 
have been stuck with as a result of the nation's savings and loan mess may soon 
be for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate sources say the federal Resolution Trust Corp. is close to putting 
up for sale the Hyatt Newporter in Newport Beach, a resort it inherited when 
regulators seized the now-defunct Columbia Savings & Loan in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The asking price will probably be in the $20-million range, sources estimate, 
a far cry from the $70 million or so Columbia executives sank into the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old resort does boast a bit of history that might help with the 
sales pitch. In 1969, a villa at the hotel served briefly as a summer office 
for then-President Richard Nixon. Seeing Isn't Believing 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the national press is coming around to the idea that California's 
economy is finally on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a handful of people still think it never was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 A just-published survey of California bankers taken in January by the 
accounting firm Grant Thornton found that 2% believed "we never were in a 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it's a minority opinion. Some 77% of the bankers polled in January 
said the region still is in a recession, while 31% said a recovery is just 
starting. Briefly. . . 
</P>

 Competition for "101 Dalmatians": A Tennessee company is selling a two-hour 
video "covering the facts and fallacies surrounding the Doberman." . . . 
Improving his defense: Texas Rangers slugger Jose Canseco is a spokesman for a

SHOP TALK: WORKSTATION PINUPS MAY BE SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shop Talk is a forum for readers to ask questions about on-the-job 
situations and get answers from specialists on workplace issues. This week's 
experts are Ron Riggio, professor of industrial and organizational psychology 
at Cal State Fullerton, and Tom Mayes, professor of management at Cal State 
Fullerton.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I work part time and don't have a desk of my own. When I'm in the 
office, I sit at a colleague's desk and use his computer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm uncomfortable because he has taped up several magazine cutouts of women in 
various poses and states of undress. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been taking the pictures down while I'm working, then taping them back 
up when I leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But my colleague has started complaining about that and making snide remarks 
about me. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.B., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Speak with your supervisor about the situation as soon as possible and 
try to resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are required to share a desk with your colleague, then it is a common 
working area. You are entitled to an environment that is conducive to you 
getting your work done without distractions.  
</P>
<P>
 The presence of pictures that you find offensive can constitute sexual 
harassment, and your supervisor should step in and rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great deal of debate about just what constitutes sexual harassment. 
Although definitions are not always cut and dried, most interpretations define 
it as unwanted behavior of a sexual nature. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find the pictures posted in your work area sexually offensive and you 
are being forced or even encouraged to look at them, then your colleague needs 
to be informed by a supervisor that his behavior is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, although you did not specify the nature of your colleague's remarks, 
they too could be construed as sexual harassment. 
</P>

 Question: I deliver pizzas for a small independent pizza shop using my own 
car, and I am not compensated for mileage.  
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't the company reimburse me for gas and oil? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.B., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Which expenses your employer reimburses depends on what you both agreed to 
when you were hired. Also, you didn't say whether you are an employee of the 
pizza company or an independent contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are an employee, the provisions of your employment agreement would 
determine whether you get reimbursed for gas and oil. If you are an independent 
contractor, you are not a pizza company employee, so you are responsible for 
all of the costs associated with the service you provide. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to tell if you are an employee or an independent contractor is whether 
the pizza company has control over the way you do your work. If it does, you 
are probably classified as an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 As a next step, I would suggest that you have a reasonable discussion with the 
pizza shop manager. Try to explain your need for expense reimbursement by 
showing how the costs you incur affect the amount of pay you eventually 
receive. Also, try to show with examples how your delivery performance has 
improved pizza sales or customer satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you appeal to your manager's sense of fairness, it may 
work. 
</P>

contributed to this answer.)  
</P>
<P>
 COUNTERPOINT 
</P>
<P>
 The use of the word salaried in the answer to the question of comp time versus 
overtime could be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 While salaried has traditionally been equated with exempt personnel, it is 
important to note that many companies still use this term with non-exempt 
employees and still quote pay in weekly or monthly terms, rather than hourly. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, the word salaried is not recommended. For greater clarity, 
the terms exempt and non-exempt only are preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Labor Standards Act provides guidelines to employers regarding exempt 
and non-exempt employees. The word salaried does not appear in those 
guidelines. The California Labor Code provides similar guidelines.

IRVINE'S AST TAKES ADVANCES A STEP FURTHER; COMPUTERS: NEW PCS WILL STORE, 
RECORD AND FORWARD VOICE MESSAGES AND FAXES. AND NEW LOOK ON SCREEN MAKES IT 
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE PROGRAMS ARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One personal computer maker recently increased its sales to consumers by 
adding the functions of a telephone answering machine. Another created a look 
on the screen that makes it easier to understand where programs are. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, AST Research Inc. in Irvine will begin selling new PCs in its Advantage 
line that combine and advance both achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the world's fifth-largest PC company for the first time moves 
ahead of competitors in the capabilities its products offer to consumers at 
prices they're used to paying. 
</P>
<P>
 The new AST computers rely heavily on multimedia, high-quality sound and video 
stored on a compact disc known as a CD-ROM. The technology has been driven by 
consumers, particularly parents of school-age children, because it makes 
possible easy-to-use computerized encyclopedias and books and richly detailed 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The new machines contain software called AST Works, which brings a simpler 
appearance to the screen than the normal icons that represent programs. Packard 
Bell Inc. made a similar change to its models two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But AST Works has more features, including video explanations from its 
technicians for running the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really at a relatively early stage with these interfaces, but AST has 
done a good job," said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, head of PC research at 
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. "They've taken advantage of the 
technology they have and looked at the competition. This should deliver a good 
image for them in the marketplace and greater sales for their systems." 
</P>
<P>
 AST has also included telephone features not previously seen as a standard 
feature in PCs. With AST Works, the new PCs will store, record and forward both 
voice messages and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A family can even create separate answering systems for each person. For 
example, a caller would be told to "Press 1 for John," "Press 2 for Mary," 
"Press 3 for Sally" and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone away from home could call in, listen to the voice messages, get the 
computer to describe the fax messages and forward the faxes to another number. 
</P>
<P>
 And, working with the Organizer program of Lotus Development Corp., the 
computer can automatically dial telephone numbers and store information from 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to link the phone, message and database system will be most 
important to people who run businesses from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the capabilities the system provides, you can give the impression that 
you're a Fortune 500 company when in fact you're a one- or two-person 
operation," said Dennis Cox, director of marketing for AST's consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 The incorporation of the simple interface and telephone management features 
reflects the need for big PC makers to distinguish themselves in ways other 
than chip speed and price. 
</P>
<P>
 It also signifies a drive in the industry to make the PC an "information 
appliance" that is central to many homes. 
</P>
<P>
 While such efforts had been underway for some time, they gained prominence 
last summer when Compaq Computer Corp. announced its Presario line for 
consumers, incorporating telephone answering capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the German PC maker Vobis began packaging software to run 
security, heating, lighting and other household equipment in its PCs for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 People who buy PCs for home use are still worried about technical features 
like the speed of the microprocessor and modem and size of the hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But, AST's Cox noted, "They're less interested in the bits and bytes 
underlying the computer and more interested in what it can do for them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to AST Works, the new machines are equipped with MS-DOS, Windows, 
Phoenix Fax and Microsoft Works, an integrated word processing, spreadsheet and 
database program.

TACO BELL POISED TO ANNOUNCE WHETHER IT WILL MOVE TO TEXAS; JOBS: THE 
IRVINE-BASED FIRM IS PONDERING A LAST-MINUTE PITCH BY CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. is expected to announce as early as this week whether it will 
expand its corporate headquarters in Orange County or move to the suburbs of 
Dallas, resolving a high-stakes bidding war between California and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, the Irvine-based fast-food chain appeared to be ready to 
announce a move to Texas, but an 11th-hour pitch by local and state officials 
-- offering tax credits and other enticements -- persuaded Taco Bell officials 
to hold off on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell's is a pivotal decision," said Terry Hartman, president of the 
Irvine Chamber of Commerce. "If they leave, we've lost a major effort to retain 
somebody. If they stay, we've got a major win that we could use to anchor down 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are 1,000 jobs and the economic, social and philanthropic benefits to 
Orange County -- as well as the efforts of local and state politicians to 
persuade corporate leaders that California is again becoming a good place for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Gov. Wilson has lobbied Taco Bell heavily. Assembly Speaker 
Willie L. Brown Jr. (D-San Francisco) has weighed in with personal entreaties 
and promised legislation to ease the tax burden and other restrictions on 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Billionaire Don Bren, chairman of Irvine Co., is involved, as are committees 
of local officials and business boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, a unit of Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc., is financially sound 
and not being forced by economic considerations to seek a cheaper locale. It 
represents the very kind of company California thought it could always attract 
and keep: a non-polluting service firm with hundreds of white-collar and 
clerical jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The import of Taco Bell's decision is not lost on state and local politicians 
or community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes, taxes and more taxes. That's what it's all about," said Orange County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. He is a member of the so-called red team of local 
and state officials and business leaders that is trying to persuade the company 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Mexican-style fast-food chain was "this close" to moving to 
the Dallas area, Chief Executive John E. Martin said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In a March 28 meeting with the red team, the company asked the state for tax 
credits for new wages that result from expansion, for wages created by 
construction jobs and for construction costs and land purchases, a state 
government source said. It also sought relief from car-pooling rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The red team presented its "best and final offer" of tax incentives and 
inducements to keep the company here, and Taco Bell postponed the announcement 
of its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, they have got new religion, and it's come only within the last 
two or three weeks, quite honestly," Martin said of state officials. Even Riley 
conceded that local leaders "haven't had the support from the state that we've 
had recently." 
</P>
<P>
 That Taco Bell is considering moving "points up the need for more 
business-retention effort by the state, never mind efforts to attract new 
businesses," said Bob Hagel, vice president of business consulting for Premier 
Relocations Services in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin acknowledged that California, with its high cost of living and 
restrictive business and environmental laws, can't compete economically with 
Texas. The Lone Star state has cheap land, a lower cost of living and no 
corporate or personal income taxes. It also has pockets deep enough to offer 
Taco Bell $10 million in tax incentives, training grants and low-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The company told California officials, the government source said, that the 
inducements Texas offers include about $4.5 million in property tax relief over 
10 years and the suspension of permit and developer fees. In addition, Taco 
Bell employees and their families who moved to Texas would not have to pay 
non-resident tuition to attend state colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell would not comment on the offer or the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the economic benefits in Texas, Martin said, "my druthers would 
be to stay in California." He said he values the "creative and intellectual 
capital" in the state, as well as the "energy and access to the Pacific Rim." 
Evaluating such intangible assets, however, has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the value of a big idea?" he said. "In our case, a big idea could add 
$600 million to $700 million in sales in one year." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the county may be a victim of Taco Bell's success. Under 
Martin's leadership, the chain has grown from a regional operation to a 
nationwide one. Executives who must travel frequently to the East Coast have 
said that a central location would be more sensible. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Taco Bell has been working closely with another PepsiCo unit, 
Frito-Lay Inc., on a line of products for grocery stores. Frito-Lay is based in 
Plano, a north Dallas suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Jon P. Goodman, a professor and director of USC's Entrepreneur 
Center, the real question is whether a decision to move to Texas represents a 
rejection of Southern California or persuasion from parent PepsiCo to 
consolidate some operations in Plano. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell executives have maintained previously that the decision to move was 
theirs to make and that PepsiCo has not interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers John O'Dell and Ann Conway contributed to this report.

BUILDING TAIWAN; COMPETITION AT THE CENTER OF ASIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE GOLD RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a burning issue in Taiwan, pitting the United States and Europe against 
Japan in a global competition that speaks volumes about business in the 
high-stakes political minefields of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: Who will have the privilege of burning garbage in this cash-rich 
island state? 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese got off to a head start three years ago, claiming they were 
uniquely qualified for the job because they share with Taiwan a basic garbage 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian garbage is "wet" compared to Western trash, the argument went, and that 
supposedly made Japan's incinerator technology the kind best suited to the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Americans trying to wrest away a few good public-works 
contracts from the Japanese, who so far have dominated Taiwan's growing market 
for municipal incinerators. Garbage viscosity is a lame excuse, they said, for 
keeping a chokehold on the lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is far more than the $1 billion worth of waste incinerator contracts 
Taiwan will award this year alone. Foreign contractors are also competing here 
for power plants, telecommunications gear and mass-transit projects -- all 
parts of Taiwan's $300-billion, six-year plan to develop a modern 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget has been scaled back somewhat since this ambitious building 
bonanza was announced, with considerable hoopla, in 1991. And, since a series 
of snafus involving land speculation and corruption, it appears that very 
little work will have been completed by year six of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taipei is still Fat City in an Asian infrastructure gold rush that extends 
from Hong Kong to Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 After about a third of the infrastructure budget goes to land acquisition and 
another third is paid to local contractors, Taiwan's market will yield some $60 
billion to $80 billion in contracts to international bidders, according to U.S. 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen estimates that Asian countries will 
spend $1 trillion on infrastructure in the next decade. That figure doesn't 
count Japan's market, until recently closed to foreigners.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's 18 Santa Monica Freeway projects every day," Bentsen said in Los 
Angeles last month. "If I were 30 years younger, I know what market I'd want to 
be in." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all easy money. Taiwan's trash scene, for one, illustrates the 
convoluted reality of doing business in the trenches of Asia's public-works 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incinerator thing has been one big frustration," said Gregory Stevens, 
an American environmental business consultant based in Taipei. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of things, Taiwan's central government couldn't be more 
accommodating to European and U.S. firms.  
</P>
<P>
 Taipei's dusty streets are torn up now for a sprawling light-rail project that 
has been parceled off in so many segments to so many foreign joint ventures 
that local wags call it "the United Nations subway system." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynical observers say the government, bucking its diplomatic pariah status as 
pretender to China's throne, is trying to buy some respect on the international 
stage with its public-works program. Others allege that civilian contracts in 
some cases have been used as bait for foreign arms deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, one of Taipei's most audacious strategies is its official policy of 
discrimination against Japan in awarding the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taipei, distressed by a $15-billion bilateral trade deficit with Japan, has 
retaliated by raising import barriers and nominally banning Japanese companies 
from bidding for public-works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the official ban hasn't stopped Japanese-controlled firms from grabbing 
a piece of the pie. They've bidden through overseas subsidiaries or local joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 On a section of the Taipei subway where Boise, Ida.-based Morrison Knudsen has 
a contract, price-competitive Komatsu backhoes are ripping up the asphalt. The 
roads are clogged with supposedly verboten Japanese autos -- assembled in local 
screwdriver plants or imported from the United States to circumvent high 
tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Fords popular in this former Japanese colony are made by Mazda, 
lamented Ying Price, chief of the commercial section for the American Institute 
in Taiwan, the unofficial embassy. "Taiwan was occupied by Japan for 50 years," 
she said. "Maybe the troops left, but Japan's business practices are still 
deeply rooted." 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of incinerators, as in other sectors, the Japanese competitive 
grip begins with the "specs," or engineering specifications. Typically, whoever 
drafts the specs for an international tender has a decisive advantage in the 
competitive bidding. It's smart business. And in Taiwan, Japanese consultants 
initially set the specs for Taiwan's incinerators -- thereby perpetrating that 
myth that their technology was "designed to treat Asian garbage," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say the Japanese construction industry's time-honored practice 
of dango , or bid rigging, has traveled to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese contractors behave as collusive bidders," said Chi Schive, vice 
chairman of the government's Economic Planning and Development Council. "They 
join as a group to bid, and they try to monopolize the market here." 
</P>
<P>
 When a European or U.S. company bids on a project, Schive said, the Japanese 
firms typically "lower their bids so no one can make a profit. In the second 
round, there are no Europeans or Americans left, and they raise their bids." 
</P>
<P>
 Schive didn't say which bidding he was talking about, but other observers 
claim that's exactly what happened in the first round of eight incinerators put 
to bid in 1991. Six of those projects went to Japanese-affiliated companies. 
Japanese industry sources deny wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two went to Volund, a Danish firm, and its local partner, Chung 
Hsin. The Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's ruling party, is a major shareholder in 
Chung Hsin, industry sources say. (The KMT controls an extensive network of 
companies in Taiwan, but it flatly dismissed criticism that its involvement in 
business poses any conflict of interest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Taiwanese authorities, in their zeal to stack the deck against the 
Japanese, decided to retain U.S. consultants to guide local officials in 
setting incinerator specifications in the second and future rounds of bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 And Taiwan's Environmental Protection Agency, which funds the municipal 
projects, now requires that foreign companies involved in the bidding own their 
original technology.  
</P>
<P>
 That rule burned all but one Japanese player, Takuma Co. of Osaka, which won 
two incinerator contracts in 1991. The others were licensing European 
technology, notwithstanding their claims of special expertise in Asian trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule change strengthened the hand of the Europeans, who excel at burning 
trash. It also eliminated all but three American companies: WMX Technologies, 
the former Waste Management Inc., of Oakbrook, Ill.; Pittsburgh-based 
Westinghouse Electric, and Foster Wheeler of Clinton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough market, but we think we can compete," said Katsihiko Senga, 
general manager of Takuma's overseas department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were accused of collusion by the newspapers because of a misunderstanding 
about budget overruns," Senga said. "But it's not true. The whole atmosphere of 
discrimination is unfair to Japanese vendors. It's all because of the trade 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet bidding on the second round, for six incinerators, was delayed until early 
this year. Taiwanese companies lobbied to join the fray as prime contractors, 
reversing roles in their alliances with the international firms by using 
foreign technology partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the political situation here, your technical qualifications aren't 
as important as your political clout," said a representative of a foreign 
environmental company in Taipei. "In the first round, you had Japanese 
collusion, but now there's political collusion."

 One man's sun room is another man's smoking shelter. So discovered Albert 
Miller, whose business took off when he hung a sign that read "Smoking shelter" 
on one of his slow-selling insulated sun rooms.Miller's inspiration came about 
three years ago when he drove by the Veterans Administration Hospital in Allen 
Park. There he saw a group of smokers, huddled inside a bus shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to market his sun rooms as smoking shelters, and business turned 
around for Duo-Gard Industries Inc., which Miller founded 10 years ago to make 
and sell energy-saving window insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has sold hundreds of smoking shelters in 43 states to customers such as 
PPG Industries Inc., General Motors Corp., the University of Louisville and 
hospitals. Shelters come in 45 sizes, ranging from 4 feet by 4 feet for about 
$1,400 to 12 feet by 25 feet for about $9,800. Depending on options, 
installation costs add from $1,500 to $3,000 to the package. Options include 
lights, heat, benches and fans.

HOW 3 U.S. FIRMS SOLVED THE JAPAN ENIGMA; TRADE: A WILLINGNESS TO EXAMINE THEIR 
FAULTS HELPED APPLE, DOW AND THE LITTLE-KNOWN JMDS SUCCEED IN A TOUGH MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Apple Computer Inc. first ventured into the Japanese market in 1977, its 
name recognition was so low and management coordination so poor that its first 
shipment of "Apples" was met by a refrigerated truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Chemical Co. faced the opposite problem when it proposed 20 years ago to 
build a caustic soda plant here. The well-known Dow name terrified Japanese 
chemical companies. "We must suppress Dow, a world seller with its massive 
capital and technology, before it lands in Japan," a panic-stricken Kaname 
Kashima, director of the Japan Soda Industry Assn., declared on a 1974 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Chemical persevered, steadily developing relations with Japanese firms and 
taking advantage of cracks in the barriers to foreign investment. The company 
currently has seven units in Japan -- some wholly owned subsidiaries and others 
joint ventures -- that operate in industries ranging from construction to 
pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 And Apple now ranks second in Japan's fiercely competitive personal computer 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not just famous companies that are finding ways to overcome the 
difficulties of doing business in Japan. Among the little-known successes is 
Japan Marketing Data Systems Ltd., which conducts a lucrative business helping 
bigger firms -- including Apple -- make direct-mail end runs around Japan's 
complex distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 As Washington and Tokyo face off over contentious trade issues that could 
spiral into a tit-for-tat trade war, the experiences of these three very 
different companies demonstrate both the depth and limitations of change here. 
Their experiences also show that U.S. firms willing to examine their own faults 
can become winners in what is still one of the toughest markets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 During Apple's first decade in Japan, the Cupertino, Calif.-based firm seemed 
to do almost everything wrong, from illogical distribution routes to trying to 
sell computers with user manuals and software available only in English to 
installing managers who didn't speak Japanese or understand the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple is an example of "how not to succeed in Japan," a U.S. State Department 
official said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "People called us a laughingstock," Apple President Michael H. Spindler noted 
during a recent visit to Tokyo. The challenge, he added, was: "Get the product 
right so people can use it. Price it right so people can buy it. Then build a 
distribution system so people can find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Apple's turnaround began in 1989, when it put on the market Japanese-language 
software for its products. That was the same year it hired Shigechika Takeuchi, 
a highly respected Toshiba Corp. executive, to head Apple Japan. He quickly 
broadened Apple's distribution networks and cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple sold about 300,000 Macintosh computers in Japan last year, carving out a 
13.4% share in Japan's intensely competitive personal computer market, up from 
8.1% in 1992. That consolidated its position as second only to long-dominant 
NEC Corp., whose share slipped from 52% in 1992 to 49% last year. Company 
officials predict a 20% Apple market share next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Takeuchi stepped down as president late last year and his successor 
has not yet been named, Apple seems well on its way to achieving its goal of $1 
billion in annual sales in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dow Chemical, the key to winning in Japan was seeking opportunities in 
many market segments and looking for joint ventures and other ways to serve 
Japanese companies after its initial plan to enter the market was barred. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow's determination paid off as trade barriers fell and other market forces 
made the company more acceptable. For example, Japan's three-year recession has 
prompted more companies to consider Dow's lower-priced products. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Quality at any price' is no longer acceptable to the local consumer or 
manufacturer," said James W. Harris, president of Dow Chemical Japan Ltd. "A 
lower-cost (foreign) product is (an option) now, even if it means they have to 
break relationships with somebody they've been doing business with for a very 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Chemical's worldwide presence has also helped it sell itself as Japanese 
companies themselves have become more global. 
</P>
<P>
 "A global company that can supply Toyota in Japan, Toyota in North America and 
Toyota in Europe with a common product, made any place and delivered to meet 
their needs at the lowest cost-to-serve, is going to win," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumitomo Dow Ltd., a 50-50 joint venture, will open Japan's largest plant for 
manufacture of polycarbonate plastics, a key material for the automotive and 
consumer electronics industries. The venture pairs Dow's technology with 
Sumitomo's customer network, Harris said. Dow is also building an aluminum 
nitride plant in Michigan for production aimed primarily at the Japanese 
computer chip manufacturing market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow has a staff of five here whose sole responsibility is to help Japanese 
companies ensure a match between their new products and Dow materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan Marketing Data Systems' success is due to its ability to facilitate 
direct marketing to get past a key obstacle to foreign firms doing business in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's infamous multilayered distribution system not only jacks up prices by 
30% or more, due to profit taking at each level of the network, but it also 
ends up blocking foreign manufacturers from contact with their customer base, 
said Charles T. Luebker, founder and president of JMDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct mail and related telemarketing operations overcome such problems by 
delivering goods directly to consumers and also providing manufacturers with 
information about what kind of people buy their products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 JMDS, with $10 million in revenue last year, has doubled its business every 
year for the past five as a result of increased demand for its services by 
foreign firms that don't know how, or have no mechanisms, to reach Japanese 
consumers directly, said Marc D. Fuoti, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 JMDS clients include L.L. Bean, Philip Morris Cos., Cigna Corp. and Apple. A 
key JMDS function is to act as its clients' agent in Japan, Luebker said. For 
L.L. Bean, JMDS handles requests for catalogues and other customer queries. For 
Cigna, it channels insurance applications to Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple sells software upgrades to existing customers in Japan only through 
telephone orders made to a JMDS number, Luebker said. When Apple relied on 
Japanese distributors for sales in the 1980s, it "had virtually no contact with 
the people who were actually using Apple computers," Luebker said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Apple needed to be in touch with a sample of its user base "in order to 
know what's happening in the market," he said. By selling software upgrades 
through JMDS, Apple now has a data base of customers it can survey to learn 
what can be done to sell still more in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Apple, Dow and JMDS said pressure from Washington has helped win 
more access for foreign products in Japan. But they also expressed fear that 
the United States might overplay its hand.

 Anti-Redlining Law Proposed: Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) campaigned in 
Los Angeles on Friday for his proposed federal legislation to require insurers 
to supply data showing how they serve inner-city neighborhoods.Just as the 
federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has exposed and helped eliminate 
discriminatory bank lending practices, Kennedy said, extending such 
requirements to the insurance industry would pressure carriers to improve their 
sales efforts in urban areas. Kennedy and state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi alleged in a public hearing that insurers discriminate against, or 
redline, certain poorer, minority sections of Los Angeles. Industry 
representatives countered that low sales reflect low income, not 
discrimination.

J.D. POWER TO MOVE SURVEY INTO EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 J.D. Power and Associates, the influential U.S. market research firm that can 
make or break car makers' reputations, said Friday it is moving into Europe 
with its car customer satisfaction surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 But rules on data protection are making it difficult for the company, founded 
in 1966 by former car industry executive Dave Power, to build up the databases 
it needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, it teamed up with Top Gear, a BBC TV program and magazine, for a 
survey of 16,250 users of cars from August, 1991, to July, 1992 -- and found 
that Toyota Motor Corp. topped the satisfaction league. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main conclusions of the British survey was that Japanese and other 
Asian manufacturers had scores well over the industry average, while U.S. 
companies such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp scored well below 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power measures a Customer Satisfaction Index based on how the customer 
perceives a car's performance, quality and after-sales service. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of its surveys are used by car buyers as guidance in purchase 
decisions and by car companies, which pay substantial amounts for detailed 
information, to improve their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power is in talks with the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency, which does 
have the addresses of motorists in Britain, to get indirect access to their 
database. 
</P>
<P>
 In France and Germany, it is now looking for TV programs similar to Top Gear 
to kick-start a survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The company tried once before to start up in Europe with a 1988 study of 
Belgium for six clients but the venture was unprofitable.

KIDDER FIRES EXEC OVER PHANTOM TRADES; WALL STREET: DISCOVERY OF SCHEME FORCES 
THE BROKERAGE TO TAKE A $210-MILLION CHARGE AGAINST FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street brokerage Kidder Peabody said Sunday that it has fired the head of 
its government trading desk after the firm uncovered a scheme that created 
phantom trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage, owned by General Electric Co., said that although the scheme 
had no impact on Kidder's cash position, it will result in a $210-million, 
after-tax, onetime, non-cash charge against first-quarter earnings, resulting 
in a loss for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 GE, which plans to release its first-quarter results this week, said it had 
been preparing to announce record earnings but that because of the loss, it 
will instead report results "close to 1993's first-quarter ongoing net earnings 
of $1.085 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidder Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Carpenter said in a statement that 
the phantom trades occurred totally within the firm and involved no customers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the trader involved, Joseph Jett, was dismissed from his position as 
managing director and head of Kidder's government trading desk. Jett, 36, had 
almost three years of service at the firm.

 "This has all the appearance of someone, Joseph Jett, developing a trading 
scheme to improve the appearance of his performance," Carpenter said. "And it 
worked for him. His performance-based compensation for 1993 was over $9 
million, one of the highest at the firm." Attempts to reach Jett for comment 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other employees in Kidder's operations and fixed-income units were 
relieved of their duties and placed on special assignment pending further 
investigation, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said the $210-million charge reflects the reversal of phantom 
profits and does not relate to Kidder's activities in mortgages or derivatives 
or to market conditions in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the scheme "an isolated incident that happened despite the diligent 
efforts the company has made to make its controls, compliance procedures and 
risk management systems state-of-the-art." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate statement, GE Chairman Jack Welch said, "Having this 
reprehensible scheme . . . break our more-than-decade-long string of 'no 
surprises' has all of us damn mad -- both at the violation and at its impact on 
our share owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-two hours ago, this company was preparing to announce record 
first-quarter earnings based on the strong fundamental global strengths of its 
operating businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage said that after the scheme was discovered, it retained Gary 
Lynch, former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
now at the Davis, Polk & Wardwell law firm, to head an investigation of the 
incident and recommend steps to prevent a recurrence. Kidder said it will 
pursue legal measures against Jett.

 Farmers Raises Quake Loss Estimate: Like nearly every other large California 
insurer, Farmers Insurance Group has raised its estimate of claims from the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake.Farmers, which initially estimated its gross 
claims losses at up to $600 million, now says a better estimate is between $600 
million and $800 million, according to a statement by BAT Industries, Farmers' 
British-based parent company. State Farm Insurance Group, Allstate Insurance 
Co. and 20th Century Insurance Co. have also raised their quake loss estimates 
recently. The industry's official estimate of total insured damage leaped from 
$2.5 billion to $4.5 billion last week, and many analysts believe that still 
understates the toll.

 Westside Bank Closed; Depositors to Be Repaid: The Resolution Trust Corp. 
decided to pay off deposits to people with accounts at Westside Bank in Los 
Angeles when it could not find a suitable buyer to take over the institution. 
The bank, which has $72.1 million in assets and $71.4 million in liabilities, 
was closed Friday by the Office of Thrift Supervision, the RTC said in a 
statement.The RTC invited 2,050 potential buyers to an informal meeting of 
bidders, but no acceptable bids were received. The RTC said it will return 
$38.4 million to the holders of 1,700 accounts in the form of checks, which 
were to be mailed over the weekend. It will recover part of its cost through 
liquidation of the bank's assets.

 Companies Recant Environmental Claims: Two makers of transparent tape and 
plastic tableware have agreed to stop making environmental claims for their 
products.LePage's Inc. of Pittsburgh agreed to settle a Federal Trade 
Commission challenge of its claims that its tape is biodegradable and that the 
plastic tape dispenser and its cardboard backing are recyclable, the FTC said. 
The company claimed that its tape, made from wood pulp, would break down and 
return to nature in a short time, which the commission contends is not true. 
Oak Hill Industries Corp. of New York faced similar problems with its claim 
that its plastic plates, bowls and utensils could be recycled.

MERRY-GO-ROUND PUTS A NEW SPIN ON AD CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<P>
 Merry-Go-Round Enterprises is banking on the most primal of emotions to spur 
its turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 The flashy clothing retailer, now reorganizing in bankruptcy court, has 
unveiled a sexy new ad campaign aimed at the libido of its young customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Introducing the newest clothes for men and women from the Merry-Go-Round. 
Clothes as fun to take off as they are to put on," says a voice-over for the 
risque commercial targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second spot, produced by Ohio-based Ron Foth Advertising, features a 
steamy young couple cavorting around an apartment, pulling at each other's 
clothes. It began airing on MTV, VH-1 and the E! cable networks last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturating these networks . . . acknowledges the music and entertainment 
culture that defines fashion for the 'MTV Generation,' " the company said in a 
written statement last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts blamed the company's financial problems and its January 
bankruptcy filing on the fact that it fell out of step with its client base of 
teen-agers and young adults and thus made poor fashion choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry-Go-Round lost $45.6 million last year, largely because of a 
$35.1-million write-off to clear its inventory of unfashionable clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad campaign "is a very good move. Merry-Go-Round has taken hard hits from 
a PR standpoint," said Roger Gray, president of Gray Kirk-Van Sant Advertising 
in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people feel they have their own identity to deal with. It's an 
effective way of saying 'This is for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Merry-Go-Round is not going to put its head in the sand through the Chapter 
11 proceedings," said Leonard (Boogie) Weinglass, the company's pony-tailed 
chairman and chief executive officer. "We plan to market our way back to 
profitability." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the commercial prove successful, company officials say, they will 
consider similar campaigns for other divisions of the company. Merry-Go-Round 
also owns the Dejaiz and Chess King retail chains.

SINGLE CURRENCY IS POSSIBLE BY 1999, EU COMMISSIONER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Union could introduce a single currency before 1999 even though 
member countries are currently experiencing economic problems like bulging 
public deficits, said European Commission Vice-President Henning 
Christophersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our models show that with reasonable economic growth and some efforts by 
member states, a majority of member states will comply with the criteria 
concerning public finances in 1998," Christophersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU's 12 member countries can decide to create a single currency between 
1997 and 1999, according to the timetable set by the Maastricht Treaty on 
political and monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
 They must first meet a number of criteria, including low inflation and low 
budget deficits, which are currently satisfied only by the tiny grand-duchy of 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too soon to conclude from the present state of member states' public 
finances" that the EU won't establish a single currency before 1999, he said at 
a meeting on European monetary union. "We've seen too many examples of rapid 
improvement for that," he said, citing Ireland and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maastricht Treaty says a country's budget deficit mustn't exceed 3% of its 
gross domestic product. The economic slowdown affecting most of the EU has 
curtailed state revenue and increased deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the same conference, French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery 
said the treaty was "very flexible" about a core group of countries moving 
separately toward a single currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an institutional problem," said Alphandery. "The Treaty in that 
respect is very flexible."

matter will be discussed during a visit next month to Oregon, Utah, Alabama, 
Kansas and Washington, D.C. Those are considered likely sites for the plant. 
The prototype of the commuter plane, the N-250, is being designed by Nusantara 
and is expected to be completed in November. Habibie did not say how much

 Plans for Travel to China Canceled: About 10,000 Taiwanese have backed out of 
tours following the mysterious death of 24 Taiwanese tourists in China, a 
spokesman for local travel agents said Friday. About 450 group tours have been 
canceled, costing travel agents about $11.4 million, a spokesman for the Taipei 
Assn. of Travel Agents said.Taiwan announced last week that all group tours to 
China will be suspended from May 1 over the Chinese authorities' handling of a 
March 31 boat fire on Qiandao Lake in the central-eastern Chinese province of 
Zhejiang that killed 24 Taiwanese tourists and eight mainlanders. Chinese 
officials estimate that more than a million Taiwanese travelers last year 
pumped at least $589 million into China's economy. Taiwan eased a four-decade 
ban on travel to China in 1987.

 $1.28-Billion Trade Deficit Posted: The deficit for the first quarter occurred 
even though the export growth rate exceeded that of imports for the first time 
in two years, a state-run newspaper reported.In the first three months of 1994, 
China exported $19.11 billion worth of goods, up 18.7% from the same period 
last year. It imported $20.39 billion, up 18.2%, the China Daily said. China 
last year registered its first trade deficit in four years, $12.8 billion, and 
experts have warned that another deficit is likely this year.

 Mary Hornbuckle's role as a preschool director may seem a striking contrast to 
her position as a City Council member and former mayor of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hornbuckle sees similarities. "Both involve people and caring about the 
community," she said. "And knowing how to handle 3-year-olds comes in handy 
when settling city-government disputes sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornbuckle, 51, was involved in early childhood education long before she was 
in city government. She became director of Community Pre-School six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The field is one she has always loved, she said. "You have to like children. 
Even more importantly, you have to understand them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the job satisfaction of nurturing children and watching them grow, and 
the fact that her field is expanding, Hornbuckle concedes that the pay is low. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it difficult to attract and keep well-qualified teachers such as 
Kathie Fisher, who has worked at Hornbuckle's center for three years. Fisher, 
49, attended USC but left school to marry and raise a family. Years later, she 
enrolled in a university-level child development program and eventually 
transferred to Orange Coast College's two-year early childhood education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted to teach preschool," Fisher said. "I would like to encourage 
more people to go that route. Preschoolers need lots of encouragement. . . . 
You (have) to be creative in finding ways to allow them to explore and develop 
individually, and to set standards for each child, not for the entire class." 
CERTIFIED CHILD-CARE WORKER 
</P>
<P>
 * Name: Mary Hornbuckle 
</P>
<P>
 * Company: Community Pre-School  
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Certified child-care workers take care of infants, toddlers 
and preschool children. Some may also provide after-school care for older 
children. The job may include feeding and diapering infants, supervising play 
periods and helping children develop initial math, reading and art skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Licensed preschool teachers are required by state law to 
have completed at least 12 units of early childhood education courses. A 
preschool aide must have completed six units. Pediatric CPR and emergency 
medical training are required by most centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: Among the fast-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The number of child-care jobs is expected to increase 13% by 1998, 
according to Orange County projections by the state Employment Development 
Department. In 1992, there were 1,690 such positions in the county. That number 
is expected to reach 1,910 by 1998 -- a net gain of 220 positions. (Figures do 
not include uncertified care givers or licensed family day care providers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $4.25 to $7.75 an hour for aides; $8 to $11 an hour for staff 
teachers; $20,000 to $40,000 a year for center directors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Opportunities to nurture youngsters and help them develop basic 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Low pay compared to other care-giving fields, and high responsibility. 
Child care requires great empathy and patience, and the job can be emotionally 
taxing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: An experienced child-care aide may advance to staff teacher 
after completing additional course work. Aides and teachers may specialize in 
caring for either infants and toddlers or older children. After several years' 
experience, staff teachers may become assistant directors and then directors, 
or open their own centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "The rewards are not monetary, but they are many. The work is very 
important to the community and essential for improving children's lives."

CARL'S DISCOUNTS; FINALLY JOINING THE COMPETITION, CHAIN TURNS TO LOWER-PRICED 
FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's no big secret that the Carl's Jr. chain was slow to respond several years 
ago when fast-food customers began to clamor for better values. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as fast-food leader Taco Bell pushed its menu prices down, Anaheim-based 
Carl Karcher Enterprises continued to rely on the company's longstanding 
reputation for high-quality food at somewhat higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy hurt the fast-food company as customers began viewing Carl's Jr. 
as a costlier alternative. But starting today, Carl's Jr. will be shouting 
about value in a multimedia advertising campaign that will promote the 650-unit 
chain as offering good food that costs less. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited campaign is drawing praise from food industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unquestionably, Carl's Jr. has to do this," said Laurie Lively Smith, a 
restaurant industry analyst with Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "All they're 
really doing is entering a level playing field with their competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Menu boards at the company's restaurants have been changed to reflect the new 
emphasis on value. Some menu items -- including the slower-selling "deluxe" 
hamburger -- have been dropped. Prices are being cut on other items, including 
an "all you can eat" salad bar that moves to $2.49 from $3.49. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is delivering to the fast-food customers what they've come 
to expect, which is value," said Karen Eadon, Karcher Enterprises' vice 
president of marketing. "We've always had an outstanding reputation for 
quality, but in the past few years, the value part of the equation got a little 
out of whack as competitors lowered prices and we didn't keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises reported a $3.7 million profit on $460.4 million in 
revenue for its fiscal 1994, which ended Jan. 31. For the previous 12 months, 
the company had posted a loss of $5.5 million on revenue of $502.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company completed a restructuring early in 1993 that slashed corporate 
overhead costs at the 650-unit chain. But the restructuring didn't stop a 
three-year slide in same-store revenue -- sales at units open for more than a 
year. That is an important measure of how fast-food companies do on a 
year-to-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The new menu and advertising campaigns are designed to reverse that slide in 
same-store revenue. 
</P>

 Karcher Enterprises President Donald E. Doyle said it will take time to show 
that the value menu is working.

 "I don't know exactly how long it will take to get to the break-even point," 
Doyle said. "But the positive thing about being in the quick-service restaurant

 Restaurant industry observers said Karcher Enterprises is taking a necessary

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: LEARNING THE A, B, C AND DS OF BROKER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think there are too many numbers for mutual fund investors to keep 
track of, be aware that the letters aren't much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, you will find that many broker-sold funds use the letters A, B, C 
or D in their names. Each letter is used to describe the sales charge that 
applies to that portfolio, but a recent survey indicates that the letters are 
being used inconsistently throughout the industry. Such variation raises the 
danger of investor confusion and makes it harder to compare apples to apples. 
</P>
<P>
 It could also foreshadow slightly higher costs for investors if regulators 
ever decide to force certain funds to change their names, prospectuses, 
marketing literature and shareholder records to conform to standard 
nomenclature.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always like this. In simpler times, up until the early 1980s, 
investors either did or didn't pay a front-end "load" or sales charge when 
purchasing a mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission-free or no-load funds are still around, of course, but the load end 
of the business has become much more complex, as news ways have been devised to 
make sales charges more palatable to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, you will find plenty of front-end load funds, along with these other 
important categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * Portfolios that combine "asset-based sales charges," also called 12b-1 fees, 
and a back-end load. The back-end load phases out over three to six years, so 
investors don't pay it unless they sell out within that period. The asset-based 
charges, however, are ongoing expenses of up to 1% a year, though some funds 
will stop or at least trim them after a certain number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Portfolios that charge a "level load" of up to 1% a year, for as long as a 
shareholder stays. This type of arrangement might have a small back-end charge 
of up to 1%, but only for redemptions within the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds that charge front-end loads have come to be known as A shares. Funds 
with the 12b-1 and back-end load combination usually have been designated the B 
shares. Those of the level-load variety are commonly known as C or D shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But a survey of more than 1,600 multi-class portfolios offered by 54 fund 
families, conducted by Dalbar Publishing of Boston, showed that not all load 
groups adhere to this nomenclature. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, only 48% of the funds with C shares charged a level load. Another 
22% were no-loads designed for large institutional investors, 16% had 12b-1 and 
back-end loads, and the remainder had other pricing options. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the D-share funds Dalbar examined, 46% had level loads and 36% had the 
12b-1 and back-end combination. Institutional no-loads accounted for the 
remainder of this group. 
</P>
<P>
 Class A shares are mostly used to designate funds with front-end sales 
charges, but some firms also apply the label for no-loads, Dalbar found. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the B shares are used mostly for the 12b-1 and back-end combination, 
they're also being applied to all of the other pricing options. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that there was confusion about level loads being used with both C and 
D shares, but we discovered there are many more twists and turns," says Louis 
S. Harvey, president of Dalbar Publishing. "The worst sin is when the A shares 
have different meanings within the same fund family." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're perplexed by these different share labels, you're not alone. 
"There's massive confusion among the public, the media and the industry 
itself," says Peter F. Muratore, president of the New York-based Quest for 
Value fund family. 
</P>
<P>
 Quest for Value was one of eight fund groups cited by Dalbar for straying from 
the common nomenclature, although Muratore denies it. The others were 
Nicholas-Applegate, PaineWebber, SEI Financial, Seligman, Van Kampen Merritt, 
Wells Fargo and Zweig. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers themselves are sometimes confused by the various pricing strategies, 
and for this reason they may be reluctant to deal with more than a few fund 
families, says Greg Ellston, manager of the mutual fund department at brokerage 
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed fears in recent months 
that a good many investors don't realize that mutual funds are not federally 
insured against loss. That's an important subject, but it's also a simple topic 
compared to the much more complex issue of how load funds are priced. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey holds the SEC partly to blame for allowing the confusing nomenclature 
to spread. One of the agency's duties, he notes, is to prevent fund companies 
from adopting misleading names. 
</P>
<P>
 Some measure of help might be on the way if a proposal being considered by the 
Washington-based Investment Company Institute is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 While details still have to be worked out, the plan would allow some 
standardization of A, B, C and D shares, while creating a class of no-load X 
shares for institutional investors and no-load Z shares for employees of fund 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that plan would still allow flexibility on how fund groups can 
designate their pricing structures. At any rate, it's expected to be a 
voluntary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it might be a while before the various share classifications are 
clearly linked to specific sales charges. Until then, investors will have to 
carefully read the prospectus sections on expenses and how to buy shares -- or 
hope their brokers have. Fund Charges, From A to Z 
</P>
<P>
 Many broker-sold mutual funds include an A, B, C or D in their names. These 
letters are intended to indicate what type of sales charge applies to the fund, 
but the letters aren't being used in a uniform manner throughout the industry 
-- creating the potential for investor confusion. A proposal being considered 
by the Investment Company Institute, the Washington-based trade organization 
for the fund business, would create the following standards. Even if approved, 
however, they would probably be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 * A shares: 
</P>
<P>
 Front-end load -- Yes 
</P>
<P>
 Back-end load -- No 
</P>

RENTING OUT A SECOND HOME? KNOW RULES FIRST; REAL ESTATE: LEASING IS ONE WAY TO 
HOLD ON TO PROPERTY, BUT IT INVOLVES A NEW SET OF RESPONSIBILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They were status symbols in the '80s: a pied-a-terre in the city, a house in 
the country, a bungalow near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now many of those prized properties are symbols of financial frustration for 
families that can no longer comfortably afford a second home. 
</P>
<P>
 One way out, short of selling, is to lease the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Leasing helps offset mortgage or maintenance expenses, but it also presents a 
new set of problems to people unfamiliar with the legal and tax consequences of 
being a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landlords are small-business owners," said Ralph Warner, co-author of the 
first volume of "The Landlord's Law Book," a self-help book published by Nolo 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any other business these days, you've got to take it seriously and 
understand the rules," he said. "If you don't, you're going to get creamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding the rules means knowing landlord responsibilities, such as 
taking care of repairs in a timely manner and adhering to landlord-tenant laws 
against discrimination, as well as knowing the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The first decision property owners have to make, though, is whether to take 
care of the rental business themselves or hire professionals to do all or part 
of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really boils down to the individual," said Jonathan Pond, a Boston-based 
financial planner who has advised clients on the subject. "A lot of people 
don't have the stomach to be a landlord, in which case they need to find a 
local firm that handles rental properties." 
</P>
<P>
 Property management companies, which act as independent contractors, can get 
the ball rolling by handling the initial leasing arrangements. They'll find and 
screen prospective tenants, negotiate the amount of rent, collect the deposit 
and get the lease signed. 
</P>
<P>
 They can also collect the rent and see that the property is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners who live far from their rented property often need this kind of help to 
locate good plumbers, electricians or carpenters for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other obvious advantages. Good property managers know the 
marketplace and, therefore, the going rate for rentals. (And it's to their 
advantage get the maximum rent, since their fees are often a percentage of 
what's collected.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, though, a property manager can screen applicants and deal with 
tenants in a detached way. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McCreary, owner of McCreary Realty Management in Marietta, Ga., says 
he checks applicants' credit and employment histories and contacts their 
previous landlords. Property owners can do the same, though most will be unable 
to gain access to credit reports, which are also useful for cross-checking 
information on past jobs and residences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past actions are the only indication of their future actions," said 
McCreary, who is also a member of the Institute of Real Estate Management, a 
Chicago-based trade group that can provide names of certified property 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The big drawback to hiring a professional manager is the expense. For taking 
care of the leasing arrangements alone, property managers may charge as much as 
one month's rent. To handle monthly maintenance and collect rents, the going 
rate is usually between 5% and 15% of the rent each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many property owners are not landlords by choice. Often they're 
leasing property they couldn't sell or maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed information on this market segment is hard to obtain. The most recent 
data from the National Assn. of Homebuilders in Washington shows that about 4% 
of the nation's households owned approximately 5.2 million second homes in 
1990. Increases are predicted each year through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people backed into being landlords. The market fell and a lot of 
people got stuck," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Landlord's Law Book" focuses on California law, but it's geared to all 
landlords. It advises owners first to adopt a plan and stick with it. "If you 
don't treat all tenants more or less equal . . . you can fairly easily be 
accused of discriminatory conduct."

LEASING, TENANT TIPS FOR THE RELUCTANT LANDLORD; REAL ESTATE: A SELF-HELP BOOK 
EXPLAINS THE LAWS, RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGING RENTAL PROPERTIES.

 They were status symbols of the '80s: A pied-a-terre in the city, a house in 
the country, a bungalow near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now many of those prized properties are symbols of financial frustration for 
families who can no longer comfortably maintain a second home due to changes in 
the economy or within their own households. 
</P>
<P>
 One way out, short of selling, is to lease the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But while leasing will help offset mortgage or maintenance expenses, it also 
presents a new set of problems to those unfamiliar with the legal and tax 
consequences of becoming a landlord. 
</P>

and get the lease signed. 
</P>
<P>
 They can stay on afterward to collect rent and help maintain the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Most long-distance owners often need this kind of help to locate good 
plumbers, electricians or carpenters for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other obvious advantages. Good property managers know the 
marketplace, and therefore, know the going rate for rentals. (And it's to their

</P>
<P>

in a detached way. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McCreary, owner of the McCreary Realty Management in Marietta, Ga.,

prior landlords. Property owners can do the same, though most will be unable to 
personally gain access to credit reports, which are also useful for 
cross-checking information on past jobs and residences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past actions are the only indication of their future actions," said 
McCreary, who is also a member of the Institute of Real Estate Management, a 
Chicago-based trade group that can provide names of certified property 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing you can gauge a person on for renting properties is their 
ability to pay and take care of the property. That's the only thing you can 
discriminate against." 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants who lie or make important omissions are automatically rejected, 
McCreary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fall prey to a tenant's sob story," he said. "You have to say 'no' 
to a prospect if they don't qualify. (And) you've got to be able to tell these 
people to get the hell out if they're tearing the place up." 
</P>
<P>
 The big drawback to hiring a professional manager is the expense. To take care 
of the leasing arrangements alone, property managers charge as much as a full 
month's rent. To handle monthly maintenance and collect rent, the going rate 
usually is between 5% and 15% of the rent each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the owner of a one-bedroom condo that rents for $500 a month could 
give up as much as $900 in income the first year: $500 for the leasing service 
and $75 each month. Repair work expenses also would come from the owner's 
portion of the rent proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for vacation rentals are significantly higher -- more often between 20% 
and 30% of the take -- because of the huge turnover of renters during a season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're lucky, you can carry your property taxes and maintenance, but in 
many instances forget about the mortgage," Pond said. "A lot of people buy 
vacation homes with the idea that they can rent them. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) one thing I always caution those who are thinking about a second home 
is to always assume you're going to get zero rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, many property owners are not landlords by choice. More often, 
they're leasing property they couldn't sell or maintain for whatever reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed information on this market segment is hard to obtain. The most recent 
data from the National Assn. of Homebuilders in Washington said about 4% of the 
nation's households owned approximately 5.2 million second homes in 1990. It 
expected increases each year through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people backed into being landlords. The market fell and a lot of 
people got stuck," said Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental demand often reflects the overall market for real estate. When prices 
are soft, especially if there's a building glut, it's tougher to find tenants, 
experts say. But like all real estate, location is key. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a two-bedroom cottage five blocks from the ocean on the 
northeastern coast of North Carolina might rent for $500 a week, according to 
Jim Perry, who runs Jim Perry and Co. in Kill Devil Hills, N.C. That same 
cottage would fetch $800 a week on the bay and up to $2,000 a week on the 
ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner says many property owners can handle their own rental arrangements if 
they'll invest some time. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Landlord's Law Book" -- which focuses on California law but is geared to 
all landlords -- advises owners to first adopt a plan and to stick with it. "If 
you don't treat all tenants more or less equal . . . you can fairly easily be 
accused of discriminatory conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan should include some basic decisions, like how much rent to charge, 
when it is payable, whether to offer a fixed-term lease or a month-to-month 
tenancy, and how much of a security deposit to require. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it might be helpful to "shop the market" by reading ads of similar 
properties offered for rent and even visiting a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner says it's also important to check with an accountant or a good 
reference book on applicable tax laws and to obtain a copy of a state's 
landlord-tenant law. Co-op owners may also need to review the governing rules 
of a building. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other suggestions in his book: Advertise the property in an honest, 
non-discriminatory manner; verify everything on an application; keep records of 
the screening process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think of it as a lot of common sense," Warner said.

EXPRESS AIR FREIGHT CALLED CONDUIT FOR DRUGS, ARMS, PORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's fast, it's efficient and it travels the world -- it's express air 
freight, and some of its biggest fans are drug dealers who increasingly use it 
to conduct multimillion-dollar deals, security officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do criminals use express freight systems? As well as being fast, 
efficient and reliable, it reduces the danger of being caught with the goods," 
said Detective Inspector Chris Humphrey of Interpol. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why freight and mail systems are so vulnerable to criminals," he said 
at the sixth World Express and Mail Conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said a wide range of criminals use both conventional mail and freight 
and express air freight to send drugs, counterfeit money and documents, 
pornography and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "World trade in counterfeit goods alone is worth $100 billion per year -- 
that's 5% of all world trade. We're talking about very big business which moves 
around the world. Maybe your industry could unwittingly become a part of it," 
Humphrey told delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The illegal drugs market in the U.K. is worth 3.6 billion sterling ($5.3 
billion) per year," Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that last year 31% of all drug seizures and 21% of heroin seizures by 
customs officials were made by intercepting mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Watson, an official with the Customs & Excise Intelligence Division at 
London's Heathrow Airport, said in an interview that shipment of illegal goods 
by express freight carriers is a growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The express industry is carrying bigger parcels, so we're getting an 
explosion in the number of shipments and the weight of consignments. You can 
get up to one kilo of a Class A drug like heroin in one shipment," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they are well-hidden, sometimes not. Recently we found statues made 
entirely of cocaine paste and dipped in plastic coating . . . other times we've 
found drugs in the false bottoms of boxes or in computer discs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said airlines generally train staff well to spot suspicious-looking 
passengers. Customs officials are training airlines and freight agents to 
become just as effective at identifying suspicious freight. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at passengers there are clues which add up to a risk profile 
for a drugs carrier or a terrorist. The clues for identifying suspect freight 
are different but they are there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Key factors include the origin and destination of a shipment, whether the 
shipper is a regular importer or exporter and whether he has used a costly 
delivery service for a consignment of low-value goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticated electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in air freight provide 
detailed information about shipments that allows customs to check and even 
clear a shipment before a plane has landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said EDI helps to counter crime, but the toughest crime to crack is 
committed by criminals working inside the freight industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never be certain how much of this is going on because the shipments 
may never come near customs at all," he said.

BRITONS BUYING IN TO WAREHOUSE STORES; RETAIL: ONE REPORTS ABOUT 1,000 NEW 
MEMBERS A WEEK. SOME FIND THE TWO HEAVILY ADVERTISED OUTLETS A THREAT.

<P>
 Warehouse-style stores, popular in the United States, say they are finding 
ready acceptance with customers in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 A new low-price warehouse store, one of only two of its kind so far in 
Britain, is adding members at the rate of 1,000 a week and now has 23,800 
people signed up, the British company that runs the store said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale retail company Nurdin & Peacock Plc opened its Cargo Club warehouse 
store in a south London suburb in March, the first British competitor to the 
U.S. Costco Corp.'s warehouse outlet, which opened late last year east of 
London. 
</P>
<P>
 Both clubs opened in a blaze of publicity, threatening already 
recession-battered traditional retailers with their U.S.-style shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Members pay a membership fee, $36.87 in the case of Cargo Club, and benefit 
from shopping in bulk at reduced prices on a range of goods from food to 
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased to say that through advertising, television and radio, 
membership numbers are increasing every day," N&P's managing director David 
Poole told a news conference. Poole said members could save 15% on food, 25% on 
general merchandise and $147 on televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The group earlier reported a pretax profit for the year ended Dec. 31 of $47.3 
million, just up on 1992's $44.5 million. Revenues fell 3% to $2.07 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurdin is in the process of converting its core traditional cash-and-carry 
business to a new format that offers a wider range to its customers, 
independent shop operators. Opening the Cargo Club is part of this 
diversification, forced by the drastic decline in the number of independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has ambitious plans for its Cargo Club operation, despite some 
worries that U.S.-style shopping might not translate very well to Britain. 
N&P's warehouse store has tried to differentiate itself from Costco by focusing 
on the retailer angle with smaller minimum pack sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Poole said the group's aim for the south London warehouse store is membership 
of 60,000. It will open a second store in central England in the summer and a 
third one in the southwest English town of Bristol in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Another store is planned for northwest England next year with the aim being to 
have 30 in place by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But Poole said Cargo Club had come up against reluctance by some manufacturers 
to let it stock their products. He said Nurdin had been forced to complain to 
the British regulatory body, the Office of Fair Trading, over the refusal by 
Japanese electronics companies to sell it their televisions.

EX-TRANSIT OFFICIAL WINS SUIT; AWARD: JURY ORDERS L.A. COUNTY TO PAY $518,000 
TO A MAN WHO SAID HE LOST HIS JOB BECAUSE HE HAD UNCOVERED MISDEEDS BY 
CONTRACTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 A former county transit official has been awarded $518,000 by a Los Angeles 
Superior Court jury after a trial on his lawsuit alleging that he was fired for 
trying to ferret out contracting irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Inouye, whose job at the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission was to make sure that contractors complied with affirmative action 
and labor laws, lost his position in June, 1990.Inouye alleged that his 
superiors fired him in part because he had gone to the district attorney's 
office in December, 1989, with allegations that one contractor was not a bona 
fide minority firm and that another also committed irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye's employers learned of his whistle-blowing when a district attorney's 
investigator wrote a letter to the commission in March, 1990, reporting the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 After six days of deliberation, the jury voted 9 to 3 to award Inouye $418,000 
for lost earnings and benefits and $100,000 for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a message to the public and to all these agencies," said Inouye's 
lawyer, Brian M. Brown of Santa Ana. "He got fired for trying to make sure the 
laws were complied with." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing the transit agency -- which merged last year with the 
regional bus agency to form the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- said 
in closing arguments that Inouye lost his position because of a general 
reorganization, not out of retaliation. They could not be reached for comment 
after the jury's Friday verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye, who worked five years at the commission, had sought $3.6 million at 
his trial, overseen by Superior Court Commissioner Emilie H. Elias. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the (transit agency) really dodged a bullet," Brown said. "The jury 
could have hit them real big."

CONFRONTATIONAL CLERIC; PASTOR TAKES ON STREET CRIMINALS AND MIXES POLITICS 
WITH RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Holy man or holy terror, the Rev. Michael Jackson is raising a ruckus in 
Inglewood. Just last month, two pipe bombs exploded outside his ramshackle drug 
rehabilitation center on 102nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made, and police say the motive for the bombings is 
unknown. But the list of Jackson's critics is a long one. There are drug 
dealers, whom Jackson chases off the streets, and motel owners, whom he pickets 
over prostitution. There are also untold numbers of political adversaries, whom 
he infuriates with his stirring oratory at bitterly divided City Council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 If one of those detractors was sending a message to him, Jackson is not 
listening. "You have to speak louder than that to get my attention, because I'm 
not going to stop," the 45-year-old pastor declared with characteristic 
brusqueness. "We're going to go after them, and we're going to keep going after 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lean and bespectacled, Jackson has a scholarly appearance belying his 
in-your-face style of Christianity. Recuperating addicts -- about 60 reside at 
his Resurrection Ministries shelter near Hollywood Park -- hail him as a 
one-of-a-kind hero, a fearless agent of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great man, a great leader," said Freddie Hayes, 40, a recovering 
alcoholic who has lived for nine months in Jackson's vast, two-story apartment 
house, now threatened with closure in May if the city enforces a raft of code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's detractors have also swelled in number. The blunt-talking preacher 
has become a regular at City Hall, siding with Mayor Edward Vincent and a 
majority voting bloc in support of such secular causes as a proposed gun club 
and a newly built gambling casino. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor's high profile has added drama and rancor to a volatile political 
climate. Unlike other clerics who keep their religion and politics separate, 
Jackson seems to enjoy taking the spotlight, stirring up controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconventional? Sure. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a former cocaine user who now rousts the men and women at his rehab 
center at 6 a.m. each weekday for marching and calisthenics -- discipline 
training. He reads Islamic literature, studies Hebrew, preaches the Christian 
Gospel.  
</P>
<P>
 Fascinated with firearms, Jackson says he once owned a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic handgun and a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Having a gun 
means he would be ready if, say, another Hitler type rises to power, he said. 
He plans to buy a weapon soon, but outside California to avoid registration 
laws. "The West wasn't won with a registered gun," Jackson said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid to tell a gangbanger, 'Look, brother, this is not your turf. . 
. . It's either you or me,' " said Jackson, who talks with vigilante defiance, 
yet describes himself as a get-off-the-duff doer who knows the rules and works 
within the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was once defined as a left-wing radical Democrat," the cleric boasted, 
laughing again, "until everybody found out that I'm a Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson once dreamed of running for office. Years ago, he filled out papers to 
run for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council. But religion claimed him -- his 
mother, Helena, had prayed during her pregnancy that she would have a preacher. 
And Jackson, aware of the long odds against beating an incumbent, withdrew 
before the race began, alienated by what he perceived as corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians who had influence in minority communities at that time were 
bought and paid for by outside interests," Jackson said, his tone serious, 
almost angry. "Why be a politician when you can buy one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson established his rehabilitation ministry in Compton in the mid-1980s 
and at first kept his distance from City Hall. Then, last year, he moved to a 
larger shelter in Inglewood. Eventually, he began showing up at Inglewood 
council meetings with a dozen or more of his followers, teaching them politics, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By jumping into stormy debates, Jackson is seen by some critics as a spokesman 
for the mayor, a firebrand willing to express the views of the City Council 
majority in ways that elected officials dare not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackson's role is to do the mayor's dirty work," said activist Michael 
Triggs, 37, a former Inglewood school board member. "Whatever good works Rev. 
Jackson is doing are going to be overshadowed and ultimately harmed by his 
association with Ed Vincent." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agree. The Rev. M. M. Merriweather, an officer of the 250-member 
Inglewood Ministers Assn., noted that Vincent will be up for reelection this 
fall. "Mayor Vincent needs a minister's mouthpiece, and Rev. Jackson is the 
only one he can find," Merriweather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson countered: "Maybe the mayor and I agree on quite a bit . . . (but) I'm 
not tied up with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, who was fined $16,000 by the state's Fair Political Practices 
Commission for the misuse of campaign funds in the late 1980s, lashed out 
against the critics -- negative people who show up at meetings "to destroy this 
city," he said -- and lauded Jackson for feeding and housing recovering 
addicts, prostitutes and the homeless, all without government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where would those (addicts) be if they didn't have him?" Vincent asked. "We 
can all run our mouths at Tuesday nights' City Council meetings, but he's 
actually doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's activism at City Hall has been especially controversial because of 
the highly charged politics of Inglewood, a city with high crime and 
unemployment but also substantial revenues from Hollywood Park, the Forum and 
two major hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nearly all white in the 1960s, the city now contains more than 90% 
African American and Latino residents. Racial and political tensions are often 
intermingled, sometimes in surprising ways. One faction has accused Vincent, 
who is black, of favoring the interests of white absentee landlords and 
big-business owners over those of minority renters and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent denies favoring any group, but acknowledges encouraging investment by 
outside business interests. At recent council meetings, sniping has accompanied 
issues large and small: from a projected budget deficit to whether the audience 
should be permitted to applaud, which it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's critics say his comments at meetings are sometimes tactless and 
ill-conceived. On March 29, the pastor likened himself to a dictator. A week 
earlier, he rose to advocate the approval of a gun club to be operated by one 
of the mayor's friends and campaign supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why do we have drive-by shootings where people will come and spray 
(bullets) and everybody gets killed but the intended target?" Jackson demanded, 
pausing for drama before offering his own answer. "Because nobody really ever 
learned how to use a gun. Nobody really taught these people the purpose of 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 When a proposed casino at Hollywood Park became snagged in legal 
technicalities -- state law does not allow a corporation to run a card club -- 
Vincent accused Gov. Pete Wilson of placing excessive licensing requirements on 
a would-be employer in a predominantly minority community. Councilwoman Judy 
Dunlap objected, accusing Vincent of grandstanding to aid his reelection 
efforts and prompting a lecture from Jackson about prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a problem with white folk telling me about racism," Jackson began. 
What appears to be legal protocol to whites is often perceived as racism by 
blacks, he said. That was the case, Jackson continued, when a master whipped a 
slave, when Rosa Parks was ordered to the back of the bus, and it is the same 
now with the card club, which is expected to provide 3,000 jobs when, or if, it 
opens.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe right now in the city of Inglewood that you've (awakened) a 
sleeping giant," Jackson warned Dunlap at the March 8 meeting, referring to 
black voters. "I think you'd better check yourself. . . . You don't know what 
racism is because you've been on the wrong side of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the pipe bombs exploded at Jackson's shelter, he and his followers had 
begun confronting suspected drug dealers and picketing small motels that he 
accused of catering to prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bomb exploded about 9 p.m. March 19 in the wheel well of Jackson's 
1986 motor home, blowing apart two tires, punching a hole in the floor and 
scattering debris inside the vehicle. The second bomb, detonated two days 
later, apparently exploded in a driveway and caused no damage. Neither bomb 
caused injuries. Neither did they soften Jackson's hard-edged approach.  
</P>
<P>
 The preacher's latest target is the city bureaucracy. Inglewood inspectors, 
citing rotted beams, unrepaired fire damage and over-stressed second-floor 
walkways, have ordered the hulking, beige home of Resurrection Ministries to be 
fixed up or vacated by May 15. Further complicating the problem: The shelter 
does not comply with zoning codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be right," Jackson said. "But is it (acceptable) if I turn these 
people out and put them right back on the streets? (City inspectors) are saying 
. . . we're not allowed to teach. But if we wanted to sell drugs up and down 
the street, we can do that. It's zoned for that. . . . It's zoned for anything 
that you want to do but correct the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who estimated the cost for repair work at $400,000, has yet to begin. 
But Councilman Garland Hardeman, who called the pastor a miracle worker, has 
vowed to help resolve the zoning problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Vincent said he will do all he can to keep Jackson's ministry alive 
and in place. The mayor said he may try to extend the repair deadline and 
solicit contributions from big businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who trains his followers as office workers to keep down overhead 
costs, says he knows he has enemies. But then, he pointed out, so did Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They killed him," Jackson said. "Jesus' attitude was pretty nasty too. He was 
totally against the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 Turn the other cheek? Not Jackson. Hell no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not be the type of Christian that will allow you to kick me in the 
face," Jackson went on. "I may be the type of Christian that will confront you. 
If we're not going to challenge things, then nothing's going to change. And I'm 
going to challenge, and challenge, and challenge."

STREET SMART SHAWN HUBLER: AT LA CIENEGA BOULEVARD, JOY STILL HAS NO ON-RAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Attention, Santa Monica Freeway commuters. We interrupt your honking and 
cheering with a word from Dorene Desenberg and her Westside neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 While you are once again whipping in and out of traffic as if the dog days of 
the detour had never intruded upon your solo commute, it would be worthwhile to 
note that the freeway's "reopening" was a bit of an exaggeration in some parts 
of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been all this hullabaloo about the freeway being opened, but for me, 
there's nothing different from the last three months," groused Desenberg, who 
discovered last week that the on-ramp that ordinarily would get her on the 
freeway to Downtown will remain closed until late June for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is La Cienega Boulevard. Eastbound motorists still can't exit onto 
northbound La Cienega, and southbound drivers on La Cienega still have to find 
another on-ramp to the freeway's eastbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I was all set to write letters to my sister in Northern California and 
my friends, quoting Peter, Paul and Mary -- 'All my trials, Lord, soon be 
over,' " said Desenberg, a paralegal who lives near the La Cienega freeway 
exit. Instead, she said, the new, improved Santa Monica Freeway has meant only 
that her usual surface-street detour is a little less congested. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the article came out that the 10 was going to reopen, I even went over 
to Kinko's and made copies for all my family and friends," she mourned. "Now 
I've just tossed them in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to gloat about." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Caltrans, La Cienega access to and from the I-10 will be limited 
for at least the next three months because workers are only now beginning to 
repair the on- and off-ramps and the stretch of access road that connected them 
to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Taylor, resident engineer for the rebuilding of the Santa Monica, said 
the problem stems from the interim traffic routing Caltrans did after the Jan. 
17 earthquake, when the freeway access roads at La Cienega were drafted into 
service as a car-pool lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The section of road, Taylor said, "was damaged heavily during the quake, but 
we were able to shore it up" sufficiently to keep westbound traffic moving 
while the rest of the freeway was being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the freeway is fixed, he said, engineers can turn their attention to 
the La Cienega ramps, which will be demolished and replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is the only section of the quake-damaged freeway that remains 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the poor and not-so-poor souls who have relied on La Cienega to get 
them to and from the freeway, that's slim comfort indeed. One of the Westside's 
most heavily traveled streets, the boulevard is home, among other things, to 
the Beverly Center and Restaurant Row. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Taylor said, not long after last Tuesday's ribbon-cutting ceremony 
that marked the grand reopening of the freeway, he took his crew to lunch at 
Lawry's, the boulevard's landmark prime rib joint. 
</P>
<P>
 People who work at Lawry's "were real happy that the freeway was open, but 
they wanted to know, 'What about La Cienega?' " Taylor laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorene Desenberg is less than amused.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last 15 years, she said, she has lived in the same apartment, one mile 
north of the I-10, and she and her Toyota pickup have grown accustomed to being 
freeway-close to most of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, she has to take a detour just to get to her local Fedco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only people who are benefiting on this are the people who are heading to 
Santa Monica or Downtown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole business reminds her of the grand opening of the Golden State 
Freeway decades ago, when motorists found themselves blessed with a glorious 
thoroughfare but cursed with a shortage of gas stations.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, great, you've got this new freeway -- but you can't drive on it," 
she sighed.

SHARING COMMON GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alfonso Johnson, 7, came speeding up on his bicycle, churning up a cloud of 
dust. A mild panic crept into his voice as he noticed that some youngsters were 
already showing off their soccer skills -- passing, dribbling, penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be here!" he panted. "They came to my school." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso's hand darted into his jacket pocket and he pulled out a flyer 
announcing the event. Moments later, he was directed to a booth to pick up an 
entry form -- then he dashed away on his bike, rushing to get his mother's 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup came to Watts on Sunday, and Alfonso had no intention of missing 
it. More than 200 residents turned out at the athletic field in the Nickerson 
Gardens public housing project, where the Cup's Legacy Tour 94 sponsored a 
daylong series of competitions in soccer skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to generate interest in the sport and in the World Cup, which is 
coming to Los Angeles this summer. But Sunday's gathering may have done even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 While African Americans and Latinos live next door to each other in the 
housing project, they are often divided by language, culture and custom. For 
several hours on Sunday, however, they found common ground on a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 To promote Sunday's event, organizers teamed African American and Latino 
youngsters to go door to door through Nickerson Gardens, passing out flyers and 
encouraging parents to send their children to the free competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the black kids think this is a Hispanic sport," said Tonie Grooms, a 
Los Angeles Housing Authority police officer and deputy commissioner of the 
Watts Friendship sports league. To counter that notion, Grooms brought teams 
made up of immigrants from several African countries to Watts on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The events today will get a lot of children playing soccer," she said. "If 
you give these kids anything , they'll come out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legacy Tour also attracted eight volunteer coaches for the 1,200 
youngsters who play on 40 teams in Grooms' Watts league. 
</P>
<P>
 Her players routinely call her "Coach Mom," but she laughingly says they only 
do so "when they want me to take them to McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Grooms is something of a rarity -- an African American woman who is a soccer 
fanatic. She plays in a women's league in the San Fernando Valley and is an 
ambassador and a tireless promoter of the sport. She has 12 children ranging 
from 9 months to 30 years old (five are her husband's from a previous marriage) 
and all but the youngest and oldest play soccer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our family, soccer is a way of life," she said. "It's not just a sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's events kicked off with a parade winding its way from Will Rogers Park 
at 103rd Street and Central Avenue to the housing project. Dozens of 
neighborhood youngsters followed the procession to the playground, caught up in 
the rhythmic drumbeat of the Unfadeable High Steppers, a flamboyant, all-male 
precision drill team. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. rode in the city's official 
parade car -- a 1955 white Chrysler Imperial convertible that once belonged to 
President Dwight Eisenhower -- with "Striker," the dog-suited man who serves as 
World Cup mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Aparicio, a 16-year-old born in Mexico, marched with one of several 
soccer teams in the parade through the heart of Watts, where about half the 
population is Spanish speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born with a soccer ball in my hand," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 On the playing field at the Nickerson Gardens recreation center, San 
Diego-based Sportfloor U.S.A. Inc. has installed a 4,200-square-foot soccer 
skills court with an all-weather synthetic surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Inner-city playgrounds are legendary for all-day basketball games, where 
three-man teams wait hours for a chance to showcase their moves. But on Sunday, 
the action moved to the skills court, where four-man soccer teams impatiently 
waited to get into the action. 
</P>
<P>
 On another part of the playground, Alfredo Banuelos, 10, was trying penalty 
kicks. He carefully lined up a shot and nailed it into the upper left corner of 
the goal.

MOORHEAD, WAXMAN DO PARTISAN DUTY ON HEALTH BILL; POLITICS: AS LEGISLATION 
MOVES THROUGH ENERGY AND COMMERCE, VALLEY- AREA CONGRESSMEN'S MANEUVERING 
SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 For all the talk of bipartisanship, the nitty-gritty work of moving a 
health-care reform bill through the pivotal Energy and Commerce Committee has 
polarized Democratic and Republican members. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley-area Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of 
the panel's health and environment subcommittee, and Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale), the panel's senior Republican, are smack in the middle of the 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering as the process shifts into high gear this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman has joined forces with Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.) in trying to craft a politically viable alternative to President 
Clinton's controversial proposal. Waxman and Dingell are scrambling to round up 
more conservative Democratic members who are concerned about an overly 
bureaucratic approach and the burdens on small business. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, meanwhile, is part of a GOP effort to hold the line against what the 
conservative lawmaker calls "a totally socialized health bill." Dingell 
recently approached Moorhead to see if there were circumstances under which he 
could win Republican cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to know if we would work together on the Clinton plan," Moorhead 
said in an interview. "Of course, I told him that unless they were willing to 
make serious changes, it would be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Energy and Commerce is one of three key House committees devising alternatives 
to the Clinton plan that would retain the President's bottom-line goal of 
guaranteeing health coverage for all Americans. The others are the Ways and 
Means Committee and the Education and Labor Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy and Commerce is considered the most conservative of the three panels 
and perhaps the most representative of the entire House. If Dingell and Waxman 
can steer a bill to the floor, the committee's makeup could give their measure 
enhanced clout when the Democratic leadership and health-care powerbrokers 
eventually hammer out an amalgam of the various proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Dingell has circulated the outlines of a scaled-back plan that 
provides additional relief for small businesses and would discard the 
Administration's requirement that most Americans join a government-organized 
purchasing cooperative or alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 It meets Clinton's goal of universal coverage by requiring workers in smaller 
firms to buy their own health coverage if their employers do not. Government 
subsidies would be available to low-income people who could not afford their 
own insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The changes that we're proposing are geared to assuaging some of the concerns 
of members who are uneasy about the (Clinton) proposal," Waxman said last week. 
"The biggest concern I've heard is that people are afraid we're going to get 
too bureaucratic with the alliances. We're meeting that problem head on." 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell vows to bring his bill to the committee when he has enough votes to 
pass it. In the interim, Waxman, who will manage the bill in the full 
committee, is huddling with recalcitrant Democrats in Dingell's office to 
mollify their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Dingell expect that they will have to pass the measure with most of the 
committee's 27 Democrats because the 17 Republicans are uniformly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans on the committee have pretty much decided not to work with 
us, not to try to fashion a bipartisan bill that would provide universal health 
care coverage," Waxman said. "And we have some Democrats who are very, very 
conservative. We're not looking at a large margin to get our majority." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he remained upbeat about the measure's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic that we're going to pass legislation this year," the nine-term 
lawmaker said. "The President has staked a great deal on health care reform. 
He's been a fervent spokesman for the cause and I think most Americans want us 
to reform the system so that everyone is given health care security." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead agreed that the public wants to see some changes in health care, 
including steps to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to those 
who have pre-existing conditions or those who change jobs. He is a co-sponsor 
of a more gradualist Republican House plan that would require employers to 
offer -- but not necessarily pay for -- policies for their workers and allow 
employers to join health purchasing cooperatives to get lower rates from 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a standard acute-care benefit package without the 
prescription drug, dental, mental health and in-home care coverages that more 
sweeping Democratic-sponsored proposals are seeking. It would also allow 
families to contribute up to $5,000 a year into a tax-deductible "Medisave" 
account for health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead said that Dingell's proposal is too close to Clinton's to win his 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the Republicans who haven't been willing to work on something," 
insisted Moorhead, who had struck a more conciliatory posture earlier in the 
process. "We're not going to support something that gives our people a 
lower-quality health care program and mandates to them what they have to do and 
where they have to go and how to get there. I don't want to see people told 
they aren't going to have choice in their providers." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, "The biggest problem with most of these health care 
bills is that they're not properly financed. They say they're going to do a lot 
of things but they don't have the money in them to do it and that's going to 
bring about rationing of health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, in turn, have dismissed the Republican bill sponsored by House 
Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-Ill.) because they say it doesn't assure 
universal coverage or control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead appears to be emboldened in his attacks on Clinton's plan by a 
barrage of criticism leveled by the insurance industry and some health care 
providers in recent months. During a recent visit to his district, he said he 
did not hear any support for the Democratic President's plan. "They all had the 
same opinion," the 11-term legislator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman acknowledged that public support has eroded. After Clinton's election, 
he warned that if health care reform wasn't passed quickly, special interests 
would pick it apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that the public wants reform but (people) get nervous about the 
particular details because they've been hearing the propaganda on television 
paid for by the insurance industry, although many people don't realize it's the 
insurance companies' pitch," Waxman said. "Or they get concerned because health 
care is so important and they can't follow the details of a proposal that is 
pretty complicated. And, of course, the proposal is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the two Valley-area congressmen differed on whether the 
Whitewater matter and related disclosures have impaired the prognosis for the 
President and Hillary Rodham Clinton to deliver health care reform before 
Congress adjourns this fall to face the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shredding process, the destruction of evidence and all these new 
revelations -- big chunks of taxes they avoided paying in the past -- can't do 
them any good," said Moorhead, who was one of President Richard M. Nixon's 
staunchest defenders during the Watergate impeachment proceedings. "I don't 
think that's giving the American people a lot of confidence in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman put a contrasting, if idiosyncratic, slant on the same developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's been a detriment," the liberal Democrat said. "Ironically 
enough, it may even help us because members of Congress, as they see this 
Whitewater feeding frenzy by the media, get worried that we had better produce 
some worthwhile legislation or the public cynicism about government will be 
even greater, which is hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A scandal and gridlock is not going to be a good formula for electoral 
success in November for anybody who is in office."

A SHINING PAST; LEE CALTON, 82, THE SHOESHINE MAN AT BURBANK AIRPORT, HAS 
BUFFED MORE THAN A MILLION PAIRS, INCLUDING THOSE BELONGING TO EARLY HOLLYWOOD 
STARS, POLITICIANS AND GANGSTERS. TODAY, HIS IS A DYING PROFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes, during the depressingly long stretches between customers, Lee 
Calton sits in the big maroon highchair at the Burbank Airport and reminisces 
about the fast-stepping, spit-polished heyday of the professional shoeshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was back in the 1930s and 1940s, when Hollywood's elite -- the 
actors and producers, directors and agents, gangsters and politicians, athletes 
and jazz singers -- all stepped up to Calton's chair at Rothschild's 
haberdashery in Beverly Hills for a five-minute shine and a strong dose of 
street smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 His regulars were the likes of Bugsy Siegel, Al Capone, Mickey Cohen, Clark 
Gable, Spencer Tracy, Groucho Marx, Nelson Rockefeller and Cecil B. De Mille -- 
well-dressed men who, like Calton, appreciated the subtle aesthetics of the 
freshly polished shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 They were spanking, elegant times when Calton entertained customers by 
snapping an old cotton polish rag in perfect rhythm to the high-blown jazz and 
Big Band tunes that played on his portable radio -- laughing and scatting and 
making people smile and shake their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, when he wasn't working the door at the old Beverly Hills Tropics 
nightclub, a lean and wiry Calton would himself step out on the town, dressed 
in his dapper fedora, double-breasted suit, gold jewelry and the finest pair of 
brown-toned leather beauties money could buy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall behind his shine stand at the airport hangs a gallery of old 
black-and-white photographs showing a much younger Calton in his Cotton Club 
days, sharing a table with Nat King Cole -- always natty, always smiling, 
unmistakably full of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha! Ha! Ha! I sure spent some money in those days," he says, flashing the 
tattoo on his left forearm, the faded image of a nude woman coiled in a 
champagne glass. 
</P>
<P>
 But at age 82, Calton can no longer make a living from the job that bought him 
half a dozen new cars and paid for his one-story dream house. Still, he arrives 
each day at 5:45 a.m. at the airport barber shop -- not for what little he 
earns from the occasional $2 shine, but as a way to hold onto the 
cologne-scented atmosphere of the swirling shoe wax, saddle soap and friendly 
banter he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Calton gazes out the shop window and wonders how his lifelong profession 
became a vanishing job -- how his footlight parade of cigar-smoking customers 
dwindled to the chosen few still willing to sit for a shine and take an 
unhurried look back at yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that!" Calton scoffs, pointing to a group of passersby. "All you see 
today are sneakers. I tell you, men have just forgotten how to dress. They just 
don't care as much about their looks like they used to -- with all these 
ponytails and earrings. The day of the well-dressed man is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The result has put professionals like Calton right out of business. Once a 
staple of barber shops, men's stores and fine hotels in post-World War II 
America, shoe shining is a disappearing trade. 
</P>
<P>
 While statistics are hard to come by, shine stands like the wood-and-leather 
booth that Calton runs have become nearly extinct, except for airports and an 
occasional city street as leather has given way to cheap plastic and other 
synthetics that don't need shining. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoeshine profession is like a dinosaur, it's dying out before our eyes," 
said Jack Lavin, a spokesman for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
International Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason is that America's dress code has changed. Now it's gym shoes and 
blue jeans. The shiny-shoes-and-creased-pants look is gone. Gone forever. And 
the shoeshine is sure to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lone relay runner, Calton has no one to whom he can pass his shoeshine 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants this job," he says. "Kids today, they think it's demeaning to 
even think about shining somebody else's shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Calton's artful, polish-blackened hands still go proudly about 
their business day after day, a pair of wrinkled experts that over 70 years 
have known their way around more than a million pairs of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep shining shoes until the day I die, or my profession dies 
off," he says with a sigh. "Whichever comes first." 
</P>
<P>
 As he has since 1971, Calton caters to a handful of loyal businessman at 
Burbank Airport -- his soft-bristled brush gliding around a curved heel, the 
cloth rag snapping across yet another pair of tasseled loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows shoes like Calton. Standing at his chair, the white-haired 
Louisiana native spouts little wisdoms that have taken a career to compile: 
that Italian-made leather is the best bargain on the planet, that black wears 
better than brown and that it takes a really special polish to beat the baking 
heat of the western desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leather will last indefinitely if you take care of it," he says. "Yesiree, 
saddle soap is the closest thing to real animal oil that man has ever devised. 
Keep a little rubbed into your shoes and they'll last you forever, as if the 
animal were still living." 
</P>
<P>
 An eighth-grade dropout, Calton is a pure talker who has opinions on any 
subject, not just his passions: fishing, cars and the seasons he played in the 
old Negro Baseball League or the winters he shined shoes in east Texas during 
the oil boom of the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 And how he asked his wife, Burnice, to marry him -- just like that -- in 1942 
as they were driving across the Arizona desert in his brand new red-and-white 
Mercury Monterey with its red-and-white leather interior. Yes, those were the 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers seem to come back for the conversation as much as the shine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so surprising that a man who has shined shoes all his life is so 
knowledgeable about current affairs," said Jarman Holland, a computer salesman 
who has visited Calton for more than a decade. "I'm very political. So every 
time I sit in the chair, Lee's ready to talk turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we talked partisan politics, how these Republicans are ganging up on 
Clinton over Whitewater. Lee is opinionated and I find that refreshing. He has 
heart and spirit, and it makes you feel good when you leave his chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his eighth decade, Calton has the body of a man half his age, the taut 
frame of a boxer or gymnast -- flat stomach, muscular forearms. And the smile, 
it wins you. 
</P>
<P>
 And how Calton still likes to dress, still likes the image of himself in 
expensive suits and shiny shoes, a reminder of the days when his step was 
quicker, when he and his profession were young. 
</P>
<P>
 Calton came to California in 1934 shining shoes. He had left home in Arcadia, 
La., years earlier and hitched a ride on a freight train to the east Texas oil 
fields, where a friend taught him the shining trade. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summers, Calton recalls, he became a utility player with various 
teams in the Negro Baseball League -- the Kansas City Monarchs, Halstead Greys 
and American Giants out of Chicago -- teams that were the only game in town for 
black players when the big leagues were white preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had his most fun touring with the African Zulus, which back then was 
baseball's version of the Harlem Globetrotters. In fact, he says, the team was 
run by Abe Saperstein, the Globetrotters' owner, and they used the same touring 
bus as the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zulus sure raised some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd roll into town and conversations would stop in mid-word," Calton says. 
"All of us were barefooted, wearing these big wigs and grass skirts. We were 
supposed to be straight out of Africa and we played our games in these get-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "In small towns, we gave people heart attacks, scared them to death getting 
off that bus, ballyhooing at each other in this fake African dialect, 
'Who-bally-bally-who-ahhhh!' Later, we would just die laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Calton worked in Beverly Hills until the late 1940s, when he 
took a yearlong job as butler for Hollywood star Tyrone Power. After that, he 
spent 17 years at the Los Angeles Athletic Club shining shoes by day, working 
the door at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, those Beverly Hills days stick in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the time Bugsy Siegel arrived at the haberdashery with his entourage and 
caught Calton gawking at him through the barbershop window. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you looking at?" the gangster snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing, Mr. Siegel," Calton remembers responding. "It's just that you look 
like hell in that sports jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after a manicure, Siegel walked past Calton and threw the jacket on his 
lap: "I'll always remember how he looked at me and said, 'Here, you SOB, the 
jacket's yours now.' I wore that jacket for years and years." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the day he yanked Cecil B. De Mille from his chair with a panicked pull of 
his shine cloth. The director was discussing with a fellow customer his most 
recent project, which he mentioned had cost $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just never heard of that kind of money before," Calton recalls. "I was 
so shocked I pulled back on the cloth and he almost fell out of the chair. I 
apologized and told him that I couldn't imagine what $4 million even looked 
like. And he just tipped his head back and laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, with all the memories and their sweet retelling, shoeshine Lee 
Calton tips his own head back and he laughs, too.

PANEL URGES BALLOT TO DECIDE FUTURE OF AGUA DULCE AIR PARK; AVIATION: ADVISORY 
MEASURE WOULD ASK RESIDENTS IF THEY SUPPORT A SCALED-DOWN, COUNTY-OPERATED 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County should hold an election within the next 90 days to help 
settle the fate of Agua Dulce Air Park, an aviation advisory panel has 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old private facility is up for sale by its owner and various 
groups have divergent visions for the 208-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and many business leaders want a general aviation facility in 
the Santa Clarita Valley to serve the area's growing business community. Most 
residents would like to see the air park shut down or, at least, the property 
remain as it is -- with a small air park surrounded by undeveloped, rural land. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors appointed the advisory panel to determine 
whether the county should buy, lease or leave the air park alone, entering a 
decades-long debate over the small airport's possible expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots say a county buyout would keep the airport from closing and being 
turned into development property. But many residents of this rural community 
say county ownership would bring more planes, noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The aviation commission recommended an advisory election in a report 
distributed to the supervisors Friday. The report's conclusions are expected to 
be discussed by the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has dragged on long enough," said member Jim Burton. "People have the 
right to put this to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory ballot measure would ask residents if they support a scaled-down, 
county-operated airport with the county limiting expansion. About 70 acres 
would come under Los Angeles County ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory election is non-binding and estimated to cost between $8,000 and 
$10,000, to be paid by the county's Aviation Enterprise Fund, which collects 
airport fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommend holding an advisory vote and paying for it from the money we've 
made from other airports," Burton said. "In other words, it won't cost the 
county anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Many pilots who use the facility are concerned that an election open only to 
registered voters in the 2,100-member Agua Dulce community is too limited. They 
say the airport is an important site for emergency landings and transportation 
to and from the Santa Clarita area after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to look at the broader picture," said Al Shaver, manager of the 
airport. "It's the only airport between the Antelope Valley and below." 
</P>
<P>
 The facility was active after the Northridge earthquake, when the valley was 
virtually cut off from Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. A log of 
airport activities included in the report shows that 464 flights arrived at and 
departed the airport between Jan. 17 and Jan. 23, six times the airport's 
normal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind's eye, I believe the earthquake did have some impact (on the 
commission's report)," Burton said. The airport "provided a tremendous 
opportunity for lots of people. There were clearly some humanitarian flights." 
</P>
<P>
 The strip transported five law-enforcement officers from Santa Clarita to San 
Fernando and Santa Monica and several insurance adjusters into the valley. 
Utility company representatives arrived to check oil and telephone lines and 
private pilots gained access to family and friends difficult to reach by 
damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters hailed it as proof of the airport's value in an emergency. But that 
opinion isn't shared by some residents. Critics said nearly all of the flights 
after the quake were by helicopters -- which can take off and land without a 
runway.

 The oldest Protestant church in the San Fernando Valley sits on a cemetery 
knoll. It features a picturesque bell tower and classic New England church 
architecture. It originally stood at Topanga Boulevard near Devonshire Street 
and Western film stars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were active members in the 
1940s and 1950s. In 1965, after it was sold to the Chatsworth Historical 
Society, the church was moved to a private cemetery, which donated land. The 
congregation of St. Mary the Virgin Anglican Catholic Episcopal Church took up 
residence in the 75-seat building in 1981.

 This Episcopal church was erected as a memorial to British-born California 
landowner Alexander Robert Campbell-Johnston by his widow, Frances, in 1889. 
Designed by two British architects, it is set in a three-acre garden in a part 
of town once known as Garvanza, a name adapted from the garbanzo sweet pea. The 
church is built of sandstone hauled from quarries in the San Fernando Valley. A 
carved marble angel near the main entrance was a gift from construction 
workers.

<P>
 The oldest Protestant church in the San Gabriel Valley, this was also the 
first Episcopal church in Southern California. It features a post-World War II 
addition of a stained-glass window depicting a soldier in a tank and a bronze 
statue of a uniformed soldier stands in the courtyard. The unique testaments 
are to Gen. George S. Patton, whose family helped build the church.

 * 2808 Altura St. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Heights 
</P>
<P>
 An architectural jewel, this Episcopal church is in the middle of one of the 
city's first suburbs. Stone buttresses support a single gabled roof dominated 
by a large round window. The sparse interior houses a vintage organ with 
delicately hand-painted pipes.

 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest Buddhist temple in Los Angeles, this landmark brick building stands 
in the heart of Little Tokyo. It was built by some of Los Angeles' first 
Japanese immigrants after three Buddhist churches merged, forming a 
2,000-member congregation. The front of the temple on Central Avenue has a mix 
of Asian and Egyptian motifs. During World War II, it was a storehouse for the 
belongings of many of the Japanese Americans who were interned in camps. Now it 
is home to the Japanese American National Museum.

 * 535 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The mission-style Roman Catholic church, near Olvera Street in the center of 
old Downtown, is the city's oldest church. Construction funds were raised by 
auctioning seven barrels of brandy donated by the padres and 1,000 head of 
cattle. The original adobe structure was designed by Franciscan fathers and 
built by Native Americans in 1822. It was rebuilt in the Mission style in 1862. 
Its distinctive bell tower was erected in 1875 and the church itself was 
restored and enlarged in 1912.

<P>
 CHURCH (1925) 
</P>
<P>
 * 2412 Griffith Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 From humble beginnings in a stable near the old Downtown plaza near 
present-day Olvera Street, the church has been a significant force in the black 
community since its founding in 1885. The building was designed in the Lombard 
Romanesque style by Norman Marsh, who designed Abbott Kinney's Venice 
development, and by African American architect Paul R. Williams, who also 
designed Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills and the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 8. WELSH PRESBYTERIAN

<P>
 CHURCH (1909) 
</P>
<P>
 * 1153 S. Valencia St. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The first home of the Sinai Temple, the building became the Welsh Presbyterian 
Church when the synagogue moved in 1925. Still visible are the stars of David 
carved in stone in the side of the building. The Jewish congregation also left 
behind the original organ. 
</P>
<P>
 9. ANGELUS TEMPLE 
</P>
<P>
 (1922) * 1100 Glendale Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Echo Park 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s and 1930s, evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson preached her 
Foursquare Gospel within this circular building. Its design is based on the 
Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City. McPherson once explained that she was led 
by the Lord to the site "facing the entrance of peaceful Echo Park." 
</P>
<P>
 10. VEDANTA TEMPLE 
</P>
<P>
 (1938) 
</P>
<P>
 * 1946 Vedanta Place 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 The temple's fanciful facade features three onion-shaped domes topped with 
golden spires. In 1901, developer William Mead purchased four acres here as a 
rural retreat. Before he died in 1929, he deeded his property to the Vedanta 
Society of Southern California, founded as part of the older Ramakrishna Order 
of India. The temple is referred to by some as the "Little Taj." CECILIA

YOUTH STABBED AT THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old Pasadena boy was stabbed several times and another boy was 
robbed of $53 and his beeper in the parking lot at Six Flags Magic Mountain, 
sheriff's deputies said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths were assaulted shortly after 9 p.m. Saturday as they waited for a 
tram to take them to their car, said Sheriff's Deputy Diane Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old was stabbed in his shoulder, rib cage and ear and was taken to 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released Sunday, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other boy, 16, also from Pasadena, was taken to the same hospital and 
treated for minor injuries and released, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have no suspects in the incident and are not releasing the 
victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated incident at the theme park, a 17-year-old suspected gang 
member was arrested and charged with strong-arm robbery after allegedly 
shoplifting shirts from a souvenir store at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile was detained by Magic Mountain security officers around 9 p.m. 
Saturday, after initially resisting, Hecht said. The youth was turned over to 
sheriff's deputies and is being held at San Fernando Juvenile Hall in Sylmar.

MAN FOUND SHOT TO DEATH IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified man was shot to death in his car Sunday on Foothill Boulevard 
near the Hansen Park Dam, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, described as a young Latino male, was found by police who 
responded to reports from nearby residents of shots fired shortly after 6:40 
p.m., said Sgt. Gene Fretheim, of the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators ruled out initial reports that the killing was the 
result of a traffic dispute, saying instead it may be gang-related, Fretheim 
said. The incident took place in the 11800 block of Foothill Boulevard, he 
said.

MAN SPRAYED, STUNNED BY POLICE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Hollywood man who reportedly suffered from both AIDS and diabetes died 
shortly after Los Angeles police pepper-sprayed him and stunned him twice with 
a Taser gun when he attacked officers, a police spokesman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Don Cox said the identity of the man who died Saturday continued to 
be withheld Sunday because it was not confirmed that his next of kin had been 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred after officers went to an east Hollywood apartment 
Saturday afternoon up on receiving a report of a violent man, Cox said. When 
they arrived, the police spokesman said, they found a bleeding man, about 30 
years old, ripping apart bathroom fixtures and holding a pair of scissors. When 
he lunged at officers, they used pepper spray and then the Taser gun to take 
him into custody, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was subdued, police noticed that the man was having difficulty 
breathing and called paramedics, Cox said. An autopsy will be performed by the 
Los Angeles County coroner's office to determine the cause of death.

ARTICLE OFFENSIVE TO 'ART OF CLOWNING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found your article "Send in the Clowns . . . An Army of Evil in Oversized 
Shoes" (March 24) to be very offensive and negative to the -- yes -- "art of 
clowning." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the reporter wrote in response to how his audition went: bad.Maybe he's 
just not funny. At any rate, with an attitude like the one throughout the 
article, I doubt if the public would welcome him into the world of the clown. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a clown. I graduated from the very school in 1978 and have clowned in 
various circuses both here and in Europe, including Ringling Brothers and 
Barnum & Bailey. Many times, we gave tours with our hands to blind kids so they 
could "see" the elephants, gave signed tours for deaf kids so they could "hear" 
the laughter, poured out of vans as we flopped through hospitals to give a 
mini-show to kids we were told would not live to see the following week, or 
gave shows in prison to people who were so violent they were locked away for 
life and who laughed in sheer delight as one of their own got a pie in the 
face. Not to mention the public who pay their hard-earned money to see the 
thrill of it all for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The words of a very wise man named Solomon are found in the book of Proverbs: 
"A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the 
bones."

DON'T ASSUME ALL AT BATHHOUSE ARE GAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was thoroughly surprised by David Colker's article on a gay bathhouse in 
North Hollywood (Around the Valley, March 10). 
</P>
<P>
 It fell short of giving any in-depth information or insight, and it appeared 
that the who's and why's were based on assumptions rather than fact.I was left 
with more questions about the article than I ever cared to have. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, why would Colker assume that everyone at a male bathhouse is in 
fact gay? Certainly at this point in time we have a better understanding of 
human sexuality and its range of diversity. How are we to know that some, many, 
or most of the men aren't bisexual? How many are leading a double life and 
don't want to be seen in a public setting with other men? How many go home to 
wife and family? 
</P>
<P>
 Was the article supposed to question the existence of such a place during an 
epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases? Or was it a review of a male 
bathhouse as one would tour and rate a country inn for a travel magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps opinions and perspectives are best left to the editorial page.

TEST SCORES NO TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who and what are served by comparing California Learning Assessment Standards 
test scores? 
</P>
<P>
 Scores are predictable. High numbers of English as a second language students, 
transient populations, and cultures that do not give a high priority to 
education, always score lower. Schools do not get to pick the students they 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Low test scores inaccurately reflect the quality of the schools and teachers. 
When will a test score indicate success rather than failure? Taking an 
immigrant and teaching him or her to read and write in English -- even at a 
beginning level -- is a success.

MUDDLED THINKING ON WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't believe that your editorial "Drought of Clear Thinking About Water" 
(March 6) reflects clear thinking on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 You state that the city's water rate system was meant to penalize those using 
more water and reward those who use less.I don't believe this system really 
does that. I use more water than my neighbors, but I also have more land. It is 
entirely possible that I use less water per square foot than some of my 
neighbors with small lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 If my "extra" land were owned by someone else, the total amount of water used 
to keep vegetation alive would be the same, but because two different people 
owned the land, the rates to each would be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a millionaire, only a retired teacher who was lucky to get a good 
piece of land at a reasonable price 33 years ago. All of these years I have 
paid higher water bills than my neighbors because I used more water than they 
did. This was only fair. But to charge me more per unit of "extra" water is not 
fair or logical. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, do manufacturers and businesses pay higher rates for the more 
water they use? How does the volume of water used by homeowners compare with 
that of businesses and manufacturers?

PIERCE COLLEGE HAS SERVED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kudos to you for your editorial "Pierce College Deserves Community's Support" 
(March 27). I've been a college neighbor for 37 years, saw my wife and two sons 
graduate and/or serve Pierce in student government and on the athletic field.I 
also taught management and psychology at Pierce as a part-time instructor for 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A third son leads the West Valley Symphony, which performs with college music 
department cooperation at the Pierce main stage theater. My six Valley resident 
grandchildren are discovering the natural wonders of a campus so often explored 
by my sons when they were children. As a local homeowner association and Pierce 
College Foundation member, I have a very special place in my heart and mind for 
the campus and its service to the Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
 New college president Mary Lee needs broad community support, both in 
committed volunteers from the public and private sector, the Los Angeles 
Community College Board of Trustees and local political and economic power 
constituencies. The Los Angeles Times' timely leadership in addressing college 
needs and value to our community is welcomed and appreciated.

IDEA OF THE MELTING POT IS STILL VALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his March 27 commentary article, John G. Simmons objects to the demotion of 
Burbank High School Principal Keiko Hentell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Simmons uses his Burbank Human Relations Council presidency as a bully 
pulpit to imply an underlying motive of racism, yet he cites an evaluation of 
Ms. Hentell which states, "The decision-making process and relationships with 
the community at large need considerable improvement" and also that, in the 
course of her tenure, there was concern "that the traditional population is 
being overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both these points seem cause for action. 
</P>
<P>
 It concerns me greatly that apparently Mr. Simmons sanctions the type of 
leadership that focuses on special interest groups and overlooks others. Isn't 
this what the racism of the '50s, '60s and '70s was all about: one population 
overlooked and denied opportunities because of some inherent characteristic? 
Doesn't this continue segregation, only with a different group on top? 
Effective leadership would not foster divisiveness, as seems to have been done, 
but would encompass all groups. 
</P>
<P>
 I am becoming increasingly wary of liberal advocates who bend too far to the 
left to try to make up for society's wrongs of the past. Many of us liberals 
still believe in the melting pot where we appreciate and are enriched by our 
ethnic diversity but are united and equal as Americans.

SCHOOL PARKING LOT RIPE FOR CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in response to the story on the attempted car theft at El 
Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills (March 10). 
</P>
<P>
 I was in class at the time of the incident.When I heard of the shooting half 
an hour later, I was stunned. I had always believed that crime did not exist in 
our peaceful West Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
 After some thinking, I realized that our school is a perfect place for theft. 
Even after the administration insisted for the safety of students not to bring 
cellular phones, radios or beepers, kids still ignore these rules. Not only 
does bringing these items make theft appealing, but kids are also putting 
themselves in danger of being attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 By looking at our school parking lot, one can find brand-new expensive cars 
that do not usually appear on too many other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, kids are careless and leave their doors unlocked or their windows 
rolled down, making theft almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should then consider the responsibility of their children before 
purchasing an expensive item for them.

REINSTITUTE SENSIBLE TRAPPING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One heartening aspect of the coyote trapping debate last month was that 
neither side supported random trapping to eradicate coyotes. Those in favor of 
the ban testified as to the consequences of major reduction in the coyote 
presence. Frightened residents -- not only in the foothills, but far into 
densely populated parts of Encino, Tarzana and Reseda -- asked only for 
deterrent trapping to safeguard their families and pets from aggressive or 
"nuisance" coyotes who enter yards and garages, linger in driveways and stalk 
or attack small pets. So the controversy is clearly not the number of coyotes 
but their demeanor and location. 
</P>
<P>
 An animal expert (well-trained in canine identification) reported spotting a 
coyote crossing the busy intersection of Balboa and Roscoe boulevards at midday 
recently. And a resident of Silverlake, near downtown Los Angeles, recently saw 
two coyotes digging under her fence to reach her German shepherd, while five 
more watched nearby. The brushy abutments to our sprawling freeway system 
provide easy travel corridors for the coyote, and it is obvious that soon no 
one in this city will be able to remain dispassionate on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really good for the coyote to encourage it to lose its natural, 
protective avoidance of humans? Do we want coyotes with painful bullet wounds 
roaming our streets, dying slowly of toxemia? Is it kind to let them contract 
diseases to carry back to their dens? Is it truly humane for them to live 
freely in urban areas where they will be hit by cars, drag themselves into the 
brush areas by freeways (as do many companion dogs) and lie there with 
maggot-infested wounds, unreported until a transient stumbles over them and is 
bitten? 
</P>
<P>
 The coyote is not a domestic pet and will not be subject to any civilized 
regulation. It will receive no medical care, no inoculations, and will not be 
spayed or neutered. It will urinate and defecate in our streets (with resultant 
sanitation problems), cause traffic accidents and reproduce to fill an almost 
unlimited available space and food supply. It will breed freely with domestic 
dogs, causing additional animal control problems. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not have to be extreme to be humane. Let's try to keep the coyote from 
hurting itself and others by reinstituting a sensible trapping policy to 
encourage it to retreat to the wildlands. Let's assure we do not merely save 
its life, but that it stay where its life is worth living.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; EASLEY SAYS HE FINALLY IS PAIN-FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Third baseman Damion Easley woke up each morning during the off-season and 
hoped that would be the day the pain in his shins eased. 
</P>
<P>
 Three or four weeks into spring training, the discomfort began to fade -- and 
with it memories of shin splints that were eventually diagnosed as Tibial 
Stress Syndrome. Easley underwent surgery Aug. 24, and now he's feeling good 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's put me in a lot better mood, I'll tell you that," he said. "I'd 
forgotten what it feels like (to be pain-free)." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing only 73 games last season and batting .313, Easley hopes his 
shin problems are behind him. Manager Buck Rodgers wants to give Easley enough 
days off this season to thwart any flare-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Easley began Sunday's game on the bench, but was a pinch-hitter in the eighth 
inning, drawing a walk. Later, he made a superb stop and a strong throw on Pat 
Borders' hard smash with the bases loaded and two out in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've paid my dues for this," Easley said. "Let this be the only time 
I have a serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy, happy to be back doing my thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With standout relievers Danny Cox and Duane Ward on the disabled list, Toronto 
Manager Cito Gaston has made Todd Stottlemyre his closer. Stottlemyre took on 
the assignment willingly, but acknowledged that it can fray the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being the guy who comes in with the game on the line," said 
Stottlemyre, who pitched the ninth and 10th on Sunday, picking up his first 
victory of the season. "I've enjoyed it, but I've had my ups and downs. It's a 
roller-coaster ride, but that's the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers inserted Rex Hudler into the leadoff spot, moving Chad Curtis to 
second in the order. Spike Owen started at third base, but gave way to Easley 
in the eighth inning. . . . Former Angel Dick Schofield's single in the fifth 
inning gave him a hit against every American League club. . . . First baseman 
J.T. Snow is batting .286 with one home run and eight runs batted in at 
triple-A Vancouver. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

SANTA ANITA; MANDELLA GETS STAKES HAT TRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Multiple stakes victories on weekends are becoming somewhat routine for 
trainer Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 When Corrazona surged past Cargo to win the $154,000 Santa Anita Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup on Sunday, it was the third added-money success in a bit more 
than 24 hours for Mandella and the second of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, at Keeneland, Memo returned from a four-month layoff to easily win 
the $200,000 Commonwealth Breeders' Cup and, on Saturday, King's Blade overcame 
a slow start to win the $110,700 San Pedro Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by La Presle Farm, which sent Mandella Kotashaan and saw him eventually 
develop into the 1993 Horse of the Year, Corrazona has the look of a star 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after she easily defeated allowance rivals in her American debut, the 
4-year-old El Gran Senor filly stalked Cargo and Skimble for most of the mile, 
then came around those two entering the stretch and went on to win by 
three-quarters of a length in 1:34 3/5. Ridden by Chris McCarron, she paid 
$4.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Cargo, the third-longest shot in the field of six at 6-1, finished a length in 
front of 2-1 second choice Skimble. Island Orchid, Lyphard's Delta and Shooting 
The Moon completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of her first three starts in France, Corrazona went off form when she 
started to bleed and was sent to America so she could race on Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she came here, we gave her a little rest and brought her back slowly," 
Mandella said. "She's just getting better as she goes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter worked seven furlongs in 1:27 4/5 Sunday morning and is 
scheduled to ship to Kentucky tonight to run in Sunday's $125,000 Lexington 
Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 Scratched from the Santa Anita Derby because of a leg blister and bothered by 
a nagging quarter crack for several weeks, the Private Terms colt will go east 
if he comes out of the work in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everything's right, he'll leave (tonight) and will probably have one short 
blowout at Keeneland before the race," Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a fast work, just something to put a little air back into him. He 
galloped out (a mile) in 1:41 and he was a little tired afterward. But that 
will probably do him some good." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis, who sat out the entire week because of a deep cut on his right 
foot, will return Thursday, according to agent Harry Hacek. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Solis has relinquished the mount on Blumin Affair in Saturday's 
Arkansas Derby to Eddie Delahoussaye. Blumin Affair was a fast-finishing second 
behind Smilin Singin Sam in the Remington Park Derby on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the uncertainty of Alex's injury, we couldn't commit to riding 
Blumin Affair," Hacek said. "The main thing now is to get a good start at 
Hollywood Park (which begins April 27). That will be very important for Alex."

NELSON MAKES SACRIFICE AS CSUN BEATS HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Third baseman Tyler Nelson took one on the chin for the Cal State Northridge 
baseball team Sunday, then delivered a knockout punch of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson was asked to bunt in the sixth inning of the Matadors' Western Athletic 
Conference game against Hawaii, but his attempt bounced up and hit him in the 
chin. A moment later, with the bunt sign off, Nelson stroked a key single to 
help Northridge win, 7-3, in front of 2,475 at Rainbow Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge led, 3-1, and had two runners on when Nelson singled on a 1-and-2 
pitch. The Matadors (21-21, 9-6 in conference play) scored three times in the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to extend (the lead) right there at that point," Nelson said. "We 
needed to get out of here with another win." 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Marco Contreras (6-4) went the distance for the 10th time in 11 
starts. He held Hawaii (23-21, 5-10) to nine hits as the Matadors, who won two 
of three in the series, closed to within one-half game of first-place San Diego 
State (8-4) in WAC West Division play. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras struck out two and walked five. The game plan was rather simple in 
spacious Rainbow Stadium: Let the defense do its job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have ground balls than strikeouts any day," Contreras said. "It 
means less pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Five players drove in runs in the finale as the Matadors won only their second 
road series in two seasons of WAC competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying all year that you have to win one series on the road and 
then play well at home," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "I figure we need 
15 wins (in conference) to win this thing and we have nine games left. I guess 
we know what we need to do, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has home series remaining against Cal State Sacramento and San 
Diego State, then finishes the year at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii loaded the bases with one out in the sixth, but Contreras induced a 
double-play grounder from Chad Drown. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Howard had three hits to lead the offense. Jason Shanahan hit a two-run 
homer in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday night's 13-7 loss, four Northridge pitchers combined to allow 15 
hits and 10 walks.

TACO BELL WEIGHS STATE, O.C. PITCHES IN DECISION; BUSINESS: IF EFFORT TO KEEP 
IRVINE COMPANY ROOTED WORKS, OTHER FIRMS MAY FOLLOW. OFFICIALS WATCH AND WAIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Concluding a high-stakes bidding war between California and Texas, Taco Bell 
Corp. is expected to announce as early as this week whether it will expand its 
corporate headquarters in Orange County or move to the Dallas suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Only an 11th-hour pitch two weeks ago by local and state officials -- 
including talk of tax credits and other enticements -- persuaded Taco Bell 
officials to hold off on a decision. Chief Executive John E. Martin said 
afterward that the company was "this close" to announcing a move to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, it comes down to a decision I have to make, and this is a tough 
decision," said Martin, 48, a highly regarded fast-food executive who rose 
through the ranks at Burger King before being picked 10 years ago to head Taco 
Bell, a Pepsico Inc. subsidiary with 1,000 employees at its Irvine 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Gov. Pete Wilson has lobbied the company heavily. Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) has weighed in with personal entreaties 
and a promised package of legislation to ease the tax burden and other 
restrictions on all corporations. Billionaire Donald Bren, chairman of the 
Irvine Co., is involved, as well as committees of local government officials 
and business boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 While Taco Bell executives have played their negotiations close to the vest, 
those involved in discussions say that the decision seems to be narrowed to two 
sites: an industrial park in the Dallas suburb of Plano or a new headquarters 
in Orange County, probably in the Irvine Spectrum office park just north of the 
El Toro "Y" in the southern part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taco Bell's is a pivotal decision," said Terry Hartman, president of the 
Irvine Chamber of Commerce. "If they leave, we've lost a major effort to retain 
somebody. If they stay, we've got a major win that we could use to anchor down 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is not only 1,000 jobs and the economic, social and philanthropic 
benefits to Orange County, but also the very efforts of local and state 
politicians to convince the nation's corporate leaders that California is again 
becoming a good place for business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican-style, fast-food chain is only the second major company in 
California that has threatened to pull its headquarters out of the state, state 
officials said. The other one, Hughes Aircraft Co., decided last year to keep 
its headquarters in the state after the Legislature reformed workers' 
compensation laws. But it consolidated its California operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporate headquarters are symbolic in many ways," said Julie Meier Wright, 
secretary of the state Trade and Commerce Agency, about the importance of Taco 
Bell's continuing presence in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike so many companies that have fled the state in recent years, Taco Bell 
is a financially sound operation that is not being forced by economic 
considerations to seek a cheaper locale. Moreover, it represents the very kind 
of company that California thought it always could attract and keep in the 
state -- non-polluting service firms with hundreds of white-collar and clerical 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the company's decision is not lost on state and local 
politicians or community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taxes, taxes and more taxes. That's what it's all about," said Orange County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. He is a member of the so-called red team, a task 
force of local and state officials and local business leaders that is trying to 
persuade the company to remain here. 
</P>
<P>
 In a March 28 meeting with the red team at the Irvine City Hall, the company 
asked the state for tax credits on new wages created by expansion and 
construction jobs it generated and on construction costs and land purchases, a 
state government source said. It also sought relief from air quality car-pool 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The red team presented its "best and final offer" of tax incentives and 
inducements to keep the company here. Taco Bell responded by delaying the 
scheduled March 31 announcement of its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, they have got new religion, and it's come only within the last 
two or three weeks, quite honestly," Martin said about state officials. Even 
Riley conceded that local leaders "haven't had the support from the state that 
we've had recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin acknowledged that California, with its high cost of living and 
restrictive business and environmental laws, can't compete economically with 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lone Star State has cheap land, a lower cost of living and no corporate or 
personal income taxes. Yet it has pockets deep enough to offer Taco Bell $10 
million in tax incentives, training grants and low-cost loans that few states 
can match. 
</P>
<P>
 The company told California officials, the government source said, that the 
inducements Texas is offering include about $4.5 million in property tax relief 
over 10 years and the suspension of permit and developer fees. In addition, 
Taco Bell employees and their families who move to Texas would not have to pay 
out-of-state tuition if they enroll in state colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell won't comment on the offer or its negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of the economic benefits in Texas, Martin said in an earlier 
interview, "my druthers would be to stay in California. We're a California 
company." He said he values highly the "creative and intellectual capital" in 
the state and the "energy and access to the Pacific Rim." Evaluating such 
intangible assets, however, has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the value of a big idea?" he said. "In our case, a big idea could add 
$600 million to $700 million in sales in one year to our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and other executives insisted last week that they truly haven't made up 
their minds. Thus speculation has run rampant, both inside the company and 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 While many suspect Taco Bell will move to the Dallas area, others like Bren of 
the Irvine Co. believe that Taco Bell will remain in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the county may be a victim of Taco Bell's success. Under 
Martin's leadership, the fast-food chain has grown from a regional operation to 
a national concern, requiring executives to take long flights frequently to the 
East Coast. Company executives already have said that a central location makes 
more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Taco Bell has been working closely with sister company Frito-Lay 
Inc. on a line of products for grocery stores. Frito-Lay is based in Plano, 
Texas, and that North Dallas suburb is believed to be the city where Taco Bell 
might move. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Jon P. Goodman, a professor and director of USC's Entrepreneur 
Center, the real question is whether a decision to move to Texas represents a 
rejection of Southern California or persuasion from parent Pepsico to 
consolidate some operations in Plano. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell executives have maintained previously that the decision to move is 
theirs alone to make and that Pepsico has not interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists, like Adrian Sanchez at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, 
downplay any negative effect a Taco Bell relocation out of state might have on 
other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies make decisions to move based on their own long-term planning and 
interests, not on what other companies do," he said. "So this isn't going to 
start a mass exodus." 
</P>
<P>
 But other business leaders aren't so confident. Bob Hagel, vice president of 
business consulting for Premier Relocations Services in Irvine, said a decision 
to move to Texas would be a slap in the face to state efforts to keep the 
company here. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell "is a big enough name that its decision to move will say to the 
state that we are not capable of keeping a good solid corporate citizen here," 
he said. "It points up the need for more business retention efforts by the 
state, never mind efforts to attract new businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell eventually will have to move out of its current quarters, a 12-story 
mirrored office building near Jamboree Road and the San Diego Freeway. 
Employees already are crammed into 285,000 square feet, and the company is 
figuring that it will double in size by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Its lease expires in November, 1996, but the company would need two to three 
years to design and build its own corporate headquarters -- preferably a series 
of interconnecting low-rise buildings arranged in a campuslike atmosphere with 
room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Early last summer, the company gathered a team of experts, including Cushman 
Realty Corp. agents and Gensler & Associates architects to search the nation 
for a new headquarters site. 
</P>
<P>
 By late fall, the team was concentrating on sites in the Atlanta and 
Charlotte, N.C., areas as well as Orange County and Dallas-Ft. Worth locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County sites included the Irvine Spectrum and two locations on 
either side of UC Irvine, one promoted by UCI and the other by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI submitted a proposal to Taco Bell in February for a campuslike 
headquarters as part of a planned $150-million corporate park, which would 
include 300 homes. But a university spokeswoman said discussions with Taco Bell 
ended shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Business and political leaders in Atlanta and Charlotte tried hard to attract 
the company, but Taco Bell decided in early March to drop those areas and 
downtown Dallas from its list. Later, a Texas state official said, the company 
scratched the Circle T Ranch near Ft. Worth, a business and residential project 
owned by H. Ross Perot Jr., son of the presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of March, the search had been limited to the Irvine Spectrum and 
the Legacy business park in Plano, where Frito-Lay is located. Another Orange 
County site, South County land owned by the Mission Viejo Co., was a surprise 
addition to the short list under consideration, but it is unclear whether the 
site is still under consideration.

<P>
WHITE HOUSE TO PUSH TOUGHER VIEW OF MCLARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top Clinton Administration officials have mounted a quiet effort to counter 
perceptions that Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty lacks firm control over 
the White House staff or necessary knowledge of some policy debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that such views may reinforce Whitewater-fed perceptions of a White 
House in disarray, aides are trying to show off McLarty's firm side, increase 
his visibility and publicize support from his boyhood friend, President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty has always been more of a coordinator-in-chief than an autocratic 
taskmaster, in keeping with his boss's preference. But some recent events, 
including White House officials' response to the Whitewater controversy, have 
suggested that the former utility company executive is simply not in the loop 
on some key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, "reinforces this idea that the place has no focus," one White 
House official said. With the White House now needing to summon all its 
influence for looming fights on health care reform and other legislation, 
"that's not good for the President," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House allies on Capitol Hill say the matter points to a broader 
issue of whether the White House's decentralized organization is best suited to 
getting things done. They say that while the system may foster a free flow of 
policy ideas, it often makes it impossible for outsiders to pin down definitive 
Administration positions without talking to the President himself. Even 
congressional committee chairmen have sometimes felt the need to try to call 
Clinton, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 An outside adviser to the White House, saying aides have recently become more 
concerned about the perception of organizational drift, predicted that the 
effort to promote McLarty would be aggressive. Officials said these efforts 
have already been under way for a number of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides have been promoting news stories that portray McLarty as 
asserting stronger control over staff operations. When McLarty recently warned 
staff members in blunt terms not to meddle in the Whitewater probe, aides made 
sure the exchange was publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of the effort came during a photo session set up last Monday to 
record a meeting of the National Security Council and the White House senior 
staff. McLarty, who is seldom at the center of gatherings of senior foreign 
affairs staff, was seated next to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Events of recent weeks have brought repeated suggestions that McLarty was 
somewhat removed from White House deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 When questions surfaced last month about contacts between some senior White 
House staff members and the federal regulators overseeing Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan, the failed thrift at the center of the Whitewater case, McLarty 
turned out to be uninvolved. And he was not among the parade of top aides 
subpoenaed to talk to a federal grand jury about the conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, this reflected well on McLarty. But it also suggested that he was at 
a certain distance from one of the White House's primary preoccupations, some 
White House aides acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat the same impression was created by disclosures that about a third of 
White House aides had so far failed to arrange permanent White House passes, 
and that many had not received security clearances for access to secret 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not a major issue, McLarty had sent letters to some inquiring lawmakers 
over the previous half-year assuring them that efforts to complete the work 
were on time and following procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident suggested that McLarty had been unaware of a bottleneck in the 
White House counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty, unfailingly courteous and well-liked by the White House staff, has 
said from the beginning that his role is not to direct policy-making but to 
make sure that he knows of key events and to keep the process running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had a special role as chief White House emissary to corporate leaders 
and some senior members of Congress, especially conservative Democrats. He 
provides Clinton the benefit of his counsel, which last summer included a 
recommendation that David Gergen be hired to help lift the White House from the 
doldrums of its first rocky months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Lader, a deputy White House chief of staff, said that under McLarty's 
leadership, the White House has adopted a non-hierarchical management style 
that many businesses, such as software giant Microsoft Corp., have found to be 
the best way of coping with their fast-changing markets. 
</P>
<P>
 One White House adviser said that Harold M. Ickes, a deputy White House chief 
of staff, has begun helping McLarty run a more assertive command. 
</P>
<P>
 But others disputed this, insisting that there had been no operational change 
and that McLarty is doing precisely as the President wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the chief of staff's management has caused a division among White 
House aides. Several ventured the view that Clinton may sooner or later feel 
the need to bring in a different kind of chief. But many others doubted the 
President would consider such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, several agreed that the chances of any change would remain low 
during the course of the Whitewater matter because an ouster could be read by 
outsiders as an indication that the troubles were taking a heavy toll on the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials say the problem is complicated by McLarty's reluctance to take 
credit for what he does accomplish, a habit that tends to place him in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House advisers say the Administration's accomplishments show the 
issue of organization is irrelevant in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Bush had a very tightly disciplined, well-ordered White House," said 
Paul Begala, a political consultant and White House adviser. But, on domestic 
affairs, at least, "he didn't do anything."

ANTI-ABORTION ZEALOT'S GUN MAY HAVE WOUNDED ALLIES; PROTEST: SHELLY SHANNON 
SHOT A DOCTOR, THEN SHE SHOT OFF HER MOUTH. HER CASE HELPED SPUR RACKETEERING 
PROBES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rachelle Renee Shannon, a quiet, disheveled housewife from rural Oregon 
charged with shooting a doctor as he drove away from his Wichita abortion 
clinic last August, could hardly have made her attorney's job any harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the shooting, Shannon was arrested, had confessed to police 
and had written a jailhouse letter to her daughter detailing her crime. As she 
was led away by police in the early morning hours, she turned to the waiting 
media and asked, on camera: "Did I get him?" She added to a police officer: "If 
ever there was a justifiable homicide, this was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did she discover, to her dismay, that she had only wounded Dr. 
George Tiller in both arms and that he was back at work at his clinic the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelly Shannon, a self-described "puny wimp" and 38-year-old mother of 
two, simply couldn't keep her mouth shut, even when her court-appointed 
attorney told her to stop talking. 
</P>
<P>
 To her attorney's chagrin, she refused to plead not guilty by reason of 
insanity. No, she insisted, her mind had been clear. She knew what she was 
doing when she shot Tiller: She was a Christian attempting to stop a man who 
had made a career of murdering unborn babies. Shannon entered a plea of not 
guilty; in her mind, trying to kill a murderer is justifiable. And she wanted 
to get on the witness stand and tell the world what she had done. She was 
convicted March 25 and awaits sentencing on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 She used the months before her trial to tell anyone who would listen about her 
life as an anti-abortion zealot and her earlier, previously unknown involvement 
in a string of abortion clinic bombings across the country. Later she admitted 
that she hoped to make bail before her trial so she could "blow up Tiller's 
clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon's willingness to talk has done more than call attention to her cause 
and clinch her conviction. She inadvertently triggered the first serious 
federal investigation into the question of whether an organized underground 
network of extremists is responsible for the wave of anti-abortion violence 
that has swept the nation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, anti-abortion leaders have denied that they are behind the growing 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been a link between the violence and any responsible pro-life 
leader at all," said Patrick Mahoney, national spokesman for Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who openly support anti-abortion violence stress that they have had 
no involvement in any of it. "Violence is not my calling; I use the weapon of 
the spirit and pray for people like Shelly Shannon," said Paul Hill, founder of 
Defensive Action, a group that endorses anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 With little hard evidence, officials at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms generally tried to avoid the conspiracy issue for fear of 
getting caught in the political cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite years of prodding from feminist groups and abortion-rights advocates, 
federal authorities have tended to view each new incident of violence as an 
isolated crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the treasure trove of information provided by Shannon changed the 
equation. Although the ATF does not officially discuss ongoing investigations, 
prosecutors in Wichita and officials on both sides of the abortion battle said 
ATF agents are actively investigating Shannon's ties to anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they are said to be looking for evidence of a possible conspiracy 
behind past bombings, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Agents from ATF's 
Portland, Ore., field office have interviewed officials of anti-abortion groups 
in which Shannon was an active member and others affiliated with groups to 
which Shannon contributed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Her possible involvement in clinic attacks and other forms of anti-abortion 
violence could lead to federal racketeering charges against her and others 
under a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing the use of such statutes to 
prosecute abortion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Shannon case appears to offer investigators much more insight into 
the militant anti-abortion movement than did the more celebrated case of 
Michael Griffin, convicted earlier this year in the 1993 murder of Dr. David 
Gunn in Pensacola, Fla. Shannon, by all accounts, had far more extensive ties 
to anti-abortion extremist groups than did Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the case with the most documented evidence of a conspiracy we have 
ever seen," said Gina Shaw, a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Federation 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon's diaries and other evidence dug up from the back yard of her home in 
Grants Pass, Ore., seem to lend credence to such suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 Her diaries reveal that just days before she shot Tiller, she traveled to Ohio 
to visit two militant anti-abortion leaders being held in different prisons on 
charges stemming from clinic bombings and related vandalism. Both leaders 
openly advocate anti-abortion violence, and Shannon was an editor of a 
newsletter for one of their organizations. Her diary entries described each 
prison meeting as "awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a search of her home found paraphernalia, including bomb-making 
materials and manuals, that seemed to provide a road map to her secret past. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Shannon's emergence as a violent extremist so intriguing is that 
her background is typical of the thousands of evangelical Christians who began 
to flock to anti-abortion groups during the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other grass-roots volunteers, however, Shannon gradually let her life 
become consumed by the anti-abortion cause, testimony in her trial shows. And, 
like the deeply committed anti-war protesters of the 1960s who ended up in 
violent organizations such as the Weather Underground, Shannon ultimately moved 
from groups that merely wanted to protest and block access to abortion clinics 
to those advocating far more desperate measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, a Wisconsin native, was a single mother while still in high school 
and said she experimented with LSD as a teen-ager before becoming a born-again 
Christian while her husband was in the Marines in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her life in the anti-abortion movement began in 1988, when she began attending 
meetings in southern Oregon of the local chapter of Right to Life, a mainstream 
anti-abortion group that frowns upon civil disobedience and militant acts of 
protest or violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always known that abortion was wrong, and I believed that it was murder, 
but I didn't see any pictures of the babies or see any picketers or know that 
people were even trying to save their lives or anything like that until 1988," 
Shannon said during her trial. "I contacted Right to Life and told them I 
wanted to get involved, and the first thing I did was picket." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she quickly found Right to Life's emphasis on peaceful picketing 
and political lobbying stultifying and that she was frustrated by its refusal 
to take direct action against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 When members of a new anti-abortion group came to a meeting of her Right to 
Life chapter and asked for volunteers to blockade and shut down a clinic in 
Portland, Shannon quickly signed up. "I just kind of knew right away that I 
wanted to do that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon found herself on the ground floor of Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Randy Terry and a cadre of rebellious, deeply conservative evangelicals 
still in their 20s and 30s, Operation Rescue was committed to acts of civil 
disobedience outrageous enough to catch the media's attention. Founded in 1986, 
the group by 1988 was beginning to have a nationwide impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue's clinic blockades, called "rescues," and the mass arrests 
that inevitably followed, offered a rush of excitement and danger to a woman 
whose uneventful life had been circumscribed by her early marriage to an 
electronics technician from a small town who didn't share her religious beliefs 
or her outrage over abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Shannon was leaving her home in Grants Pass at every opportunity to join 
Operation Rescue blockades in Oregon, Northern California and eventually 
throughout the country, from Atlanta, Ga., to Fargo, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with thousands of others, she rode in car caravans to join in the 
biggest campaign in Operation Rescue's history, its "Summer of Mercy" in 1991, 
when the group poured all of its resources into Wichita in an effort to shut 
down Tiller's clinic, one of the few in the nation that conducts late-term 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids were still at home, and the housework would pile up and stuff, and 
there was always a struggle trying to decide whether to go, but I went pretty 
much every chance I had," Shannon testified. 
</P>
<P>
 As she and her husband grew more distant, Shannon said she increasingly 
identified with her new circle of fellow activists. Bonds of friendship were 
forged during frequent stints in jail following clinic blockades, and 
conversations revolved around radically conservative politics and evangelical 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue soon became wracked by internal disputes as its leadership 
fractured under the threat of ever-greater prison sentences and heavier 
financial penalties for the group's practice of violating court injunctions 
against blocking access to clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 As Operation Rescue's most radical leaders split off to form new 
ultra-rightist organizations that would not bend in the face of legal threats, 
Shannon followed them to the fringe of the anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined a group called the Lambs of Christ and became close to the leaders 
of another fringe group called Advocates for Life, led by defectors from 
Operation Rescue. Life Advocates, the magazine published by Advocates for Life, 
often focused on Tiller, who was dubbed "Tiller the Killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon said she still opposed the use of force after joining the splinter 
groups, even as more and more young anti-abortion demonstrators were arguing 
among themselves that it was time to change tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of one such debate in a Seattle jail cell, Shannon recalled that 
"I spoke up against that kind of thing; I told them that this was a spiritual 
battle, and we were nonviolent and we were not going to do anything like that. 
I wanted to stay nonviolent." 
</P>
<P>
 Her conversion came during a jail term in Fargo, following another clinic 
blockade. There, she said, she was given a book of letters from a German 
minister who became involved in an assassination plot against Adolf Hitler 
after realizing that prayer was not enough to stop the Nazis. She said reading 
the book persuaded her that her commitment to peaceable protest was a mistake 
and that violence was the only solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new views brought her in contact with John Brockhoeft, who had been 
convicted in connection with clinic bombings in Florida and Ohio. Shannon 
became so close to Brockhoeft that she began to edit his extremist newsletter 
while he was in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, law enforcement authorities believe, Shannon was participating in 
clinic bombings and arson attacks. ATF agents reportedly consider Shannon the 
prime suspect in the April, 1992, arson that destroyed the Catalina Medical 
Center in Ashland, Ore. Last January, Shannon wrote to police in Chico, Calif., 
from her jail cell in Wichita to confess to vandalism at a clinic there in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter she sent to a Wichita newspaper in February, Shannon said she was 
involved in a string of abortion clinic arsons across the nation and knows 
others who were involved in still more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure at least six different states, several places in some states," 
Shannon wrote. "That's what I get for traveling hither and yon, doing this, 
that and the other thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, Shannon said, she decided it was time to take action against 
the doctors performing abortions. After Griffin killed Gunn in Pensacola in 
March, 1993, Shannon decided that Griffin was her hero and eventually felt she 
had to emulate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the anti-abortion movement is reeling from the damage wrought by 
Shannon and Griffin. Fearful of new federal investigations into possible 
conspiracies, leaders are increasingly cautious about what they say to each 
other in meetings or whom they talk to on the telephone, Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is especially a concern that the Clinton Administration will use the 
ATF and the FBI against us," he said. "So now there is a reticence by those of 
us who don't endorse violence to even talk or meet with those who do." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-abortion movement, was once a "closely knit family," Mahoney said. 
"But this increased federal presence is severely testing those ties."

MANDELA'S CAMPAIGN FACES UPHILL BATTLE IN CAPE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Black, yellow and green balloons filled the crisp blue sky. Uncaged pigeons 
took flight over a sea of waving flags and fists. About 20,000 people cheered 
and chanted in wild adulation, surging forward with such force that three 
people were trampled to death and 21 were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the gruesome deaths at the soccer stadium rally here, Nelson 
Mandela's final campaign visit Sunday to the scenic Cape Town region, home of 
South Africa' first white settlement and last white Parliament, was typical of 
an astonishing race in which his victory as the first black president was 
assured from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical except for one other thing. Mandela is likely to lose the Western 
Cape, the only province where his African National Congress has actually 
engaged in a brutal, bare-knuckles political battle with its opponents in 
President Frederik W. de Klerk's ruling National Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cause of the ANC's uphill fight here holds a warning for what the 
future may hold. That's because the nation's first all-race elections next week 
appear to be breaking on distinctly racial lines, the result of decades of 
deliberate racial polarization and ethnic enmity under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite both parties' pleas for racial reconciliation, polls show that the ANC 
is expected to win nearly all the black votes and little else. And while the 
once-whites-only National Party will come in second, it is likely to win most 
of the white, Indian and mixed-race, or so-called Colored, votes in a broad 
anti-ANC coalition. Together they form a quarter of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Western Cape, the triangular southern tip of the country that ends at 
the rocky Cape of Good Hope, is the only province where blacks are actually a 
minority. Slightly more than half the estimated 2.3 million voters here are 
Colored, with blacks and whites splitting most of the rest. And Mandela's 
messianic appeal elsewhere counts for little among Colored voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a jailbird," snapped Nayuma Cloete, 31, a mixed-race woman who gathered 
with her children and neighbors to jeer passing ANC supporters near the stadium 
where the world's most famous former political prisoner had just held his 
rally. "And he will make us suffer. Whites gave us food, houses and education 
for our children. The blacks will give us nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The blacks will take revenge," worried Junaid Julius, 22, who held a poster 
of De Klerk. "One of these people told my wife, 'You're going to be my wife 
when this is finished.' She's afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 History here explains a lot. The Coloreds, the apartheid-era term for the 
cocoa-skinned, mixed-race offspring of European settlers, African natives and 
Asian immigrants, were given preference for jobs and housing over blacks in the 
Cape under the rigid segregationist rules of white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coloreds were also mistreated, of course. Many were evicted at gunpoint from 
their land and their homes, brutally bulldozed out of white communities and 
trucked to crowded townships. The indignities of racial tyranny included having 
bureaucrats run pencils through their hair to see if lighter-skinned Coloreds 
could qualify for jobs reserved for whites. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Coloreds adopted the Dutch Reformed Church that is favored by the 
ruling white minority and spoke the same Afrikaans language as whites. Most had 
access to better schools and jobs than blacks. And unlike blacks, Coloreds and 
Indians were given the vote for separate chambers of Parliament in 1983 in a 
National Party attempt to split opposition to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was the emergence of a prosperous Colored middle class that is now 
terrified of losing the relative status and privileges it enjoys. Many Coloreds 
openly fear and distrust blacks, who fought pitched battles against the white 
authorities and spread terror in many townships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Coloreds are more racist than the whites," said Trevor Jones, 32, a 
printer's assistant who waved an ANC flag at the Mandela rally. "My friends say 
the ANC is bad. They say the blacks are dangerous. And they hate Mandela." 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears have been exploited by the National Party with the crudest -- or 
perhaps shrewdest -- negative advertising and campaign tactics anywhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, for example, recently distributed 80,000 copies in the Cape of an 
Afrikaans-language comic book called "Winds of Change." It shows a Colored 
family being driven from its home by a 14-year-old black youth with an AK-47 
assault rifle. "You were our useful idiots," the boy says, while his dog adds, 
"Kill the Colored, kill the farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 After the ANC bitterly complained, the Independent Electoral Commission, the 
neutral group overseeing the April 26-28 elections, banned the comic as 
flagrantly racist and inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela angrily denounced the comic during his televised debate Thursday with 
De Klerk. And at his rally here, he complained: "At a time when the ANC is 
trying to be all-inclusive, the National Party issued the most vicious racist 
propaganda in order to turn one set of people against another." 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Party also ran an advertisement in local papers that had 
echoes of the Willie Horton commercials used by the Republicans against 
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988. Focusing on the 
ANC's call to give the vote to all prisoners, the ad shows a ghoulish, 
dark-skinned police composite picture of a since-captured serial killer suspect 
and asks: "Can you imagine the Cape Strangler having the vote?" 
</P>
<P>
 And should anyone doubt where the National Party stands, their candidate for 
provincial premier is Hernus Kriel. Known as "Mr. Tough," he is the 
government's minister for law and order and oversees an infamously ruthless 
police force that has long been used to suppress blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt Hamman, a member of Parliament who is the National Party's election 
strategist for the Cape, said voters have legitimate fears of ANC-inspired 
violence and intimidation. He says the ANC's complaints against the comic are 
"racist," designed to "exploit black-white confrontations" to mobilize black 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC leaders admit that the National Party tactics have worked. Recent internal 
tracking polls show the ANC with about 30% to the National Party's 38%, with 
most other voters either undecided or unwilling to discuss their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only region we think we could lose," said Sue de Villiers, the 
ANC spokeswoman in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a sense that the ANC is an African organization and there isn't 
a place for Coloreds in the ANC," she said. "People are very frightened. 
They're being told they're going to lose their homes and their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Hofmeyr, one of the ANC's chief election strategists, agreed that the 
ANC is on the defensive in Colored areas. "People don't like the National 
Party, but they'd rather have the devil they know than the devil they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, 
warned in a recent news conference in Cape Town that the divisive appeals to 
racism may create "a potentially explosive situation" after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people go into the new South Africa with deep resentments, it is going to 
undermine the possibility of a tremendous future," he said.

SERBS IGNORE U.N. TRUCE, SEND TANKS INTO BESIEGED CITY; BOSNIA: THE INVASION 
TRIGGERS PANIC IN GORAZDE, WHICH U.N. HAD DESIGNATED AS A PROTECTED AREA. 
ENCLAVE'S FALL COULD BE A CRUSHING BLOW TO WESTERN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb tanks thundered into the rapidly collapsing city of Gorazde on 
Sunday, just hours after U.N. officials had proclaimed victory in negotiating a 
cease-fire with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering mass panic in the largest government-held enclave in eastern 
Bosnia, the Serbian invasion pressed on despite a call by the U.N. Protection 
Force for more air strikes against Serbian heavy weaponry firing on the city 
designated a U.N.-protected safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 One official told the Associated Press that 21 people had been killed and at 
least 55 wounded by Bosnian Serbs in attacks that intensified in the afternoon 
and evening in Gorazde. The casualty report could not be independently 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilian chief of the U.N. mission, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, had announced 
shortly before the tanks rolled into Gorazde that he had won a cease-fire 
agreement that would allow deployment of 350 U.N. troops to the region and 
compel the Serbs to withdraw from a military exclusion zone extending 1.8 miles 
from the center of the besieged city. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid-deployment force of French, Ukrainian, British, Egyptian and 
Scandinavian troops had been on standby all day for dispatch to Gorazde, 35 
miles east of Sarajevo, but was dispersed after it became clear that the 
cease-fire was being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's events followed a familiar pattern drawn by Serbian rebels over the 
last two years of war: Political leader Radovan Karadzic strikes a conciliatory 
pose in negotiations while his hard-line military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
carries on with aggressive actions on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last week, Serbian gunmen have shot down a British Sea Harrier on a 
low flyover above Gorazde, taken more than 200 U.N. troops hostage, laid mines 
around weapons-containment sites and menaced peacekeeping operations in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde's fall, which U.N. military officials now concede could be imminent, 
could deal a crushing blow to the credibility of the U.N. mission here -- as 
well as Western policy on the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force's inability to halt the deadly assault on Gorazde also appeared 
to be encouraging Western leaders to look for an escape route from the volatile 
conflict as it seemed poised to escalate out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi had conceded a day earlier that it would be "meaningless" to continue 
operations in Bosnia unless the Serbian rebels abandoned their strategy of 
aggression and conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also seem to have sided with those who believe that nothing can 
be done here but retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles E. Redman, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, said there is little 
appetite among U.N.-member countries for changing the current mission mandate 
to allow broader use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hear any of these people asking for a more forceful mandate," Redman 
said when asked whether the U.S. government would support a pullout or a 
toughening of the rules of engagement. "How could they do that? They don't have 
the resources. They don't have the equipment. I don't want to speak for the 
U.N. . . . but I think they're thinking only of a pullout. I don't think they 
see a real force mandate as one they could even defend and argue for." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, the U.N. Security Council, in a non-binding statement, said the 
15-member body condemns "the escalating military activities by the Serb forces 
against Gorazde." It made no threat of force to enforce its condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, had called on 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes to seek out and destroy tanks 
threatening his troops and terrifying civilians in Gorazde on Sunday, but for 
the second day running the bombing raids were called off without the jets 
having fired their payloads. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi ordered the military arm of the mission to halt the bombing raid 
because he was sure that Bosnian Serb leaders were about to commit themselves 
to a broad peace settlement, a U.N. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Akashi told us that Karadzic had promised him everything but heaven, so 
we had to call it off," the official said, referring to the air strike sortie. 
"At the moment, everything is very confused." 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. A-10 aircraft was warned off after the U.N. forward air controller on 
the ground, who had been trying to guide the plane to one tank firing on the 
city, was forced to take cover inside a building because the Serbian armor 
began firing at him, a U.N. military source disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes were also called off Saturday when bad weather obscured the 
targets, and the civilian chief of the U.N. mission had vetoed Rose's request 
for "close air support" Friday after a British soldier was killed and Serbs 
intensified their bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers were helpless to evacuate or ease the plight of tens of 
thousands of Muslims fleeing the advance and thronging the U.N. office in 
desperate hope of rescue, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panic has broken out all over the city," Janowski said he was told by four 
agency staff members trapped in Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff members estimated the number of people uprooted by the onslaught as 
high as 30,000, or nearly half the population of the enclave the U.N. Security 
Council designated a safe area nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gorazde official reported via ham radio that Serbian attacks had intensified 
after nightfall and that government troops were having to fight hand to hand to 
hold off the invaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare here. Civilians who fled are now packed in the center with 
no place to go. They are sitting ducks," said Esad Ohranovic, head of the 
regional governing council. "It's very difficult to say how long we can go on 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic bitterly accused the international 
community of abandoning the victims of Serbian aggression after more than a 
year of engaging in "this ridiculous farce of protection zones." 
</P>
<P>
 Since NATO planes bombed Serbian positions near Gorazde for the first time a 
week ago, the rebels have waged a vicious campaign of retaliation and 
apparently intimidated the U.N. civilian bureaucracy from resorting to force 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen of the 200 U.N. soldiers held captive by the Serbs were released 
after Akashi arrived in the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale on Sunday, 
although the release of all U.N. hostages had been among his conditions for 
even meeting with the rebel leaders. The majority of the captives remained in 
Serbian hands even after the putative cease-fire.

TAFT WINS ITS 2ND ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In sweeping to their school's second national academic decathlon championship, 
the nine jubilant students from Taft High School declared Sunday a glorious day 
for their school, their school district, their city, their state -- heck, maybe 
even their planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the happiest girl in the world!" exulted 16-year-old Kimberly Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills students earned a score of 49,372, beating the next-closest 
team in the 13th annual battle of the brains by more than 2,000 points, and 
capturing more than half of the $30,000 in scholarships awarded to individual 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, also claimed the tournament's highest 
individual accolade, earning the top overall score and a $5,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put everything into it and we got everything out of it," Berdichevsky 
said. "Everything we've been trying to do for the past year is win the national 
championship, and we've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Taft's second national championship in the 10-event competition. The 
school took home a first-place prize in 1989 and second place last year. The 
sweetness of winning the prize for an embattled school district wasn't lost on 
some. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Jersey spends $12,000 per student," said Dan Isaacs, assistant 
superintendent of school operations for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, who was among the 68 parents and supporters in the Taft cheering 
section. "California spends just more than $4,600." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain View High School of Mesa, Ariz., took second place with 47,098 
points, and Oliver Wendell Holmes High School of San Antonio, Texas, came in 
third, at 46,885 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine Taft students began their arduous journey to the academic showdown 
over the summer, competing with classmates for a spot on the team, which 
includes students with A, B and C averages. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine took practice tests every day after school, studied over weekends and 
holidays, focusing on their work even as the Jan. 17 quake rocked their homes 
and school. It paid off when they made it to last month's state competition -- 
and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft also revived its secret weapon. Coach Arthur Berchin, who left the team 
after leading it to its earlier national title, returned for this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students went into the national finals with high expectations, 
they knew nothing was certain. Even Taft's tie for first place at Saturday's 
high-stakes Super Quiz, in which each student answers five oral questions 
before a partisan audience of students and parents, guaranteed only that the 
team was still in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores on the other nine tests were not revealed until Sunday's agonizingly 
long awards ceremony, where students were recognized for the highest scores in 
the 10 subjects: essay, speech, interview, math, fine arts, economics, science, 
literature, social studies and Super Quiz. Honors were also handed out for 
regional leaders, small-school high scorers, individual scholarship winners and 
highest-scoring students from each school. 
</P>
<P>
 As student after student marched through the hotel ballroom to receive a 
prize, the Taft team cheered its successes and twittered nervously each time a 
top competitor's name was called. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky, who also won four subject medals, hummed "O, Canada" -- the 
team's quirky adopted anthem -- to allay his nerves. Stephen Shaw, 16, who 
would take three subject medals, sat motionless, his hands clasped in his lap. 
Rebecca Rissman, 17, who eventually won three medals, tried to smile. And 
Michael Michrowski, 17, who won two medals, rested his face in his palms. 
Shapiro had the third-highest score in her division. 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft were Andrew Salter, 17, who took home four subject 
medals; Chris Huie, 17, with two individual medals; Sage Vaughn, 17, with one 
medal, and Sheldon Peregrino, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I not be nervous?" asked the gold medalist's mother, Rosie 
Berdichevsky, ungluing her eye from the lens of her video camera. "I put myself 
in his place and feel what he must be feeling. It's nice and it's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 But once the individual high scorers were announced, with California claiming 
five of nine awards, the teen-agers' grim expressions gave way to glee. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Shapiro said it: "I know we're going to win now. Girls know things 
that boys don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 As the outcome became obvious, coaches from other schools began to console 
their students. Coach Larry Minkoff, from Whitney Young Magnet School in 
Chicago, told his team members that they were all winners. Still, a downcast 
Chicago student, Tukoi Jarrett, who won a gold medal for speech, would have 
none of that. "Then how come I feel like a loser?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But all conversation in the ballroom was drowned by the screams of the Taft 
contingent when the school's name was finally called out as the finest academic 
team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like first place," Berchin said.

BROWN FOCUSES ON ECONOMY TO BOOST CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown tried to pump new vigor into her lackluster 
campaign for governor Sunday by focusing her message on the California economy 
and the goal of creating a million new jobs for the state over the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a potentially pivotal address to the Democratic State Convention, Brown 
acknowledged that critics have questioned what she stands for and why she wants 
to be governor, even though she has enjoyed comfortable leads in the opinion 
polls and in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'll tell you what I stand for," said Brown, adopting a crisper, more 
forceful personal style. "I stand for progress and for prosperity, for enduring 
values and a new vision . . . for building for the new century, the California 
century." 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates for the Democratic nomination for governor in the June 7 
primary addressed the nearly 2,000 delegates, with Brown followed to the podium 
by Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 But the focus was on the 48-year-old Brown for several reasons: because this 
was her first major appearance since she overhauled her campaign staff, because 
of criticism that she had failed to articulate a clear message, and because the 
primary campaign is entering a phase when voters are beginning to pay attention 
to election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also focused on the economy and jobs, as he has all year long. But 
he took a more populist approach by emphasizing his tactic of working alongside 
ordinary Californians in their jobs in all 58 counties. A governor must know 
the fears and problems of ordinary people if he or she expects to be able to 
exert the leadership required by the office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, 49, said he was not content to sit in a back room dialing for 
campaign dollars -- an apparent reference to Brown's greater fund-raising 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign, he added, is based on the premise that "action speaks louder 
than money or words." This is the only way to rebuild the bridge of trust 
between the people and their government, a trust that has been ruptured during 
the past 12 years of Republican governors, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden pursued his theme of campaign reform -- the major reason he launched a 
quixotic, late-starting campaign that he acknowledges he cannot win. Hayden was 
not only critical of Wilson's governorship, but threw barbs at both fellow 
Democrats, Brown and Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot bring change about by business-as-usual politics . . . by relying 
on contributions from the same lobbyists who already dominate Sacramento," 
Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches constituted the headline event of a 2 1/2-day party meeting at 
Downtown's Bonaventure Hotel, but they were largely symbolic and psychological 
in nature. The party can endorse candidates for the primary election, but 
decided not to do so in the governor's race this year because of the intraparty 
bitterness it might cause. 
</P>
<P>
 After she narrowly lost the governorship to Wilson four years ago, the 1990 
Democratic nominee, Dianne Feinstein, said her fight with John K. Van de Kamp 
-- including a protracted convention endorsement battle -- sapped her campaign 
coming out of the June primary. That put her at an instant disadvantage to 
Wilson, who had had no Republican opposition, said Feinstein, who won election 
to Wilson's old U.S. Senate seat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this past weekend, state party Chairman Bill Press sought to 
emphasize the theme of "Unity '94" and to keep the party activists focused on 
the primary goal of defeating Wilson's bid for a second term in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Press introduced each of the three in identical terms, as "a lifelong 
Democrat, and a real team player." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Friday and Saturday, the Brown and Garamendi camps had sparred over 
Garamendi charges that the Brown campaign attempted to buy the endorsement of 
the California Teachers Assn. with a $175,000 contribution to an independent 
political action committee run by a CTA official. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also claimed that CTA representatives fed Brown prospective answers 
to questions from teachers' union leaders. As it turned out, the CTA declined 
to endorse any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who gave conflicting answers to the charges over the past week, lashed 
back sharply during a news conference after the convention speech Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the allegations were "outrageous" and constituted "dirty politics." 
She got the same sort of briefing on major concerns of the CTA that she gets 
from any organization, Brown said, but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue is a dead issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi, at his own press conference from the same lectern a few minutes 
later, said the accusations are "the truth" and eventually will be documented. 
</P>
<P>
 In their speeches, at least, both candidates generally followed the unity 
theme, focusing on their own campaign proposals and on attacking Wilson's 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown speech differed from her past addresses primarily in style: shorter, 
less rambling and delivered with more punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Her jobs proposal was accompanied by a new brochure and signs carried by 
supporters that read: "One Million New Jobs for California." 
</P>
<P>
 And her speech was built around that specific theme, winding up when she 
declared: "Over the last few months, some opponents say they don't know what 
Kathleen Brown stands for. Well, I'll tell you what I stand for. I stand for 
progress and prosperity. For enduring values and a new vision. I stand for one 
million new jobs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to put Californians back to work. We are going to restore the 
California promise. We are going to reinvent the California dream." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fresh look to the Brown campaign appeared to be more in labeling and 
image than in substance. The jobs program is essentially the same one Brown 
announced in a major speech in San Francisco in January. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes proposals for tax credits for creation of new jobs, eliminating 
excessive regulations on business, a tax moratorium on new businesses and job 
training reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 She was asked again why she wanted to be governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have leaders who can see the future, who understand it and who are 
willing to invest in it, who are willing to fight for it, and who care what 
happens to average Californians. That is why I want to be governor, and I'm mad 
that this guy (Wilson) hasn't done the job for the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's new campaign team, led by consultant Clint Reilly, was delighted with 
her performance, and Brown herself was unusually buoyant when she appeared 
before reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi strategist Darry Sragow said, "It looked like the old Kathleen 
Brown . . . with a new slogan, new colors on her buttons and a slick brochure." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get any sense that she was igniting any passion," Sragow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garamendi campaign is at a different critical juncture now -- virtually 
broke after spending about $1 million on television ads, which have failed to 
give Garamendi a significant boost in recent opinion polls. On Saturday, 
Garamendi said he was now prepared to put some of his family's assets into the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi declined to say how much, although some sources said it would be 
well over $1 million. Sragow would only say there would be enough "to do what 
we have to do . . . to win the race."

6 ARRESTED AFTER PARAMILITARY FOREST ACTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They first popped up more than two months ago, these men dressed in camouflage 
who built military-style encampments in national forests around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 They built a long trench at one site, and an underground bunker made of wood, 
large enough to hold men and equipment, at another. 
</P>
<P>
 They carried guns as well -- pistols, shotguns and assault rifles -- although 
none were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But law enforcement officials who ran into them in the forests said their 
answers to questions didn't seem quite right, and once they passed themselves 
off as federal agents for something called the U.S. Enforcement Agency, which, 
as best anyone can tell, is not a government entity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were no confrontations with hikers or locals, there was one 
reported death threat against a sheriff's deputy who got too snoopy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then investigators found out that some of them had used aliases in the past, 
and at least one had a criminal record. They decided there was more to this 
than a bunch of paramilitary fanatics from the city using the wilderness to 
play war games, though they believed them to be that as well. 
</P>
<P>
 So, over the weekend, federal agents -- real federal agents -- made raids 
throughout the Los Angeles area, from the Simi Valley to Whittier, and arrested 
six men. A seventh was still at large Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 They were charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United 
States, false impersonation of a U.S. officer and destruction of federal 
property. One of the men also faces a charge of possession of a firearm by a 
felon. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being held Sunday at the Downtown Federal Detention Center, pending 
arraignment today in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But the identities of the men were still under seal and what they were really 
up to is still a mystery, even to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story, according to authorities, is that they were merely training for 
their work as security specialists, dealing with the likes of bail bond skips 
and auto recovery and VIP protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person I interviewed said this was to get them in better shape for other 
operations," said Ken Harp of the U.S. Forest Service. "He said they did a lot 
of running, hiking and other rigorous exercises to get in better shape." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harp also described them as "weekend warrior, paramilitary types" whose 
equipment filled an entire van and a couple of small trucks. Camouflage netting 
and sleeping bags and Kevlar helmets and the like. "Gobs and gobs of it," Harp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say we are not completely sure what their final agenda was," said 
Rita Mears, the Forest Service's resident special agent for the Angeles 
National Forest. "That's the real tenuous part now." 
</P>
<P>
 The first report of their strange activities came Feb. 5, in Sequoia National 
Forest, where Tulare County Deputy Sheriff Wayne Davis encountered a group of 
seven men who had dug a large trench and had weapons with them. No arrests were 
made, but Davis took down their names for his records, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 The story got stranger a few days later, this time in Los Padres National 
Forest, north of Santa Barbara. Deputy Sheriff Jeff Rigby got a call from Jerry 
Jackson, a local ranch manager, who told him five men dressed in fatigues had 
asked permission to climb a steep cliff on the ranch property. Jackson said he 
had told them no, but thought the Sheriff's Department should know about it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rigby followed in the direction the men had driven, he found two cars 
parked on the side of the road. When he approached the men, Rigby would later 
say in his report, one of them introduced himself with one name, though the 
identification he produced gave another. When asked about the discrepancy, the 
man said the first name was the one he used while a member of the French 
Foreign Legion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rigby's report, another of the men told the deputy that two 
former members of their group had outstanding arrest warrants against them. He 
said the pair had recently suggested they might kill a Tulare County deputy 
sheriff who was snooping around their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The group member said their operation included running back and forth to 
Mexico for training. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Davis in Tulare County, Rigby took down names. The deputy also said one 
of the men gave him the phone number of his "agency," the U.S. Enforcement 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That number, in turn, led to one Otis Cooper of Pomona, who said he used the 
U.S. Enforcement Agency name until last January -- for his bail bond work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I closed that business down," a startled Cooper recalled in an interview 
Sunday, adding that he may have trained one of the suspects to chase down 
fugitives who skipped bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line some of them decided they were going to be secret 
agents," he said. "They are not federal agents, no sir." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Forest Service officials said, the group showed up in the Angeles 
National Forest on March 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp said he got a call about some men in camouflage and went to check. He 
watched through binoculars from across the canyon and saw that they were 
building some kind of encampment. He then called Mears, who told him to get out 
of there quickly because the men were considered armed and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The word of the two previous encounters had spread south. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the men broke camp while, unknown to them, the investigation 
was heating up. The Forest Service was joined by other agencies, including the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Then the bust began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they just playing soldier? Were they just having fun by passing 
themselves off as federal agents and former soldiers of fortune? Mears said 
those questions remain to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The not-so-simple side," she said, "is that I can't say all they were doing 
is playing games."

CLINTON INSISTS ON DIPLOMACY AS CRITICISM RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As criticism of his Bosnian policy mounted Sunday, President Clinton insisted 
that diplomatic rather than military actions hold the key to defusing the 
renewed hostilities in the war-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with reporters Sunday, Clinton said that U.N. officials in Bosnia 
have concluded that further NATO air strikes would be ineffective against 
Bosnian Serb forces besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, and he stressed 
once more his hope of finding "a negotiated agreement" to the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a diplomatic role, and we are doing our best to fulfill it," Clinton 
said during a trip to Virginia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the President spoke, a senior official in the Bosnian government 
warned that any diplomatic agreement that left the Bosnian Serbs in control of 
conquered territory guaranteed continued hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to reverse the results of 'ethnic cleansing' if you want a stable 
peace," Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said on ABC's "This Week With David 
Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 That stark warning came as calls mounted for the United States and its North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to take firmer military action in response 
to the Bosnian Serb attacks over the last week on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and NATO have struggled to deter the renewed Serbian attacks without 
widening Western participation in the civil war or provoking an open break with 
Russia, which has generally supported Serbia and resisted military action. On 
Sunday, Clinton said the United States will respond to requests for additional 
military responses from U.N. commanders on the ground but added that the 
principal goal was "getting these peace talks back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the Administration had indicated a willingness to discuss with 
Russia the lifting of U.N. economic sanctions against Serbia as a way of 
stimulating the stalled peace talks but that the recent Bosnian Serb offensive 
has taken that option off the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continued Serb aggression on the ground, not only in Gorazde but everywhere 
else, is hardly an encouragement to discuss that," he said. "We can't even 
begin discussions in the environment which has existed for the last few days 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said he had spoken Sunday with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
but offered no details about the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, these statements suggest that the Administration remains 
committed to holding the line on its policy of using the minimum amount of 
force necessary to spur negotiations. But an array of senators and two former 
Republican secretaries of state insisted Sunday that the policy had 
demonstrably failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had planned it, I don't see how we could have gotten into a worse mess 
than we are now in," Lawrence S. Eagleburger, secretary of state under former 
President George Bush, said on CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a revealing display of the difficult choices facing Clinton, 
Eagleburger and the other critics diverged dramatically in their assessments of 
what the Administration should do next. 
</P>
<P>
 In talk-show appearances, Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) all called on Clinton to urge the United 
Nations to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims -- or to 
unilaterally ship arms to the Muslims if peace talks remain stalled.

<P>
 Biden, appearing on "Meet the Press," said that "if the Serbs don't move over 
the next month" the United Nations should remove its peacekeeping troops from 
Bosnia and arm the Muslims and Croats to escalate their operations against the 
Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's supply them with weapons and let them go after the Serbs," Biden said. 
"Let 'em fight, because that's the only way you're going to . . . end up with a 
genuine settlement on the ground, when the Serbs . . . understand nothing more 
can be gained by the use of force." 
</P>
<P>
 On the same program, Hatch echoed Biden's call for lifting the arms embargo 
and said the move should be reinforced with "surgical air strikes" to knock out 
Bosnian Serb "fuel supplies, their transportation lines, their ordnance depots, 
their ammunition dumps." 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials warned of expanding U.S. involvement or otherwise widening 
the war. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) criticized 
calls for a unilateral U.S. end to the arms embargo, saying such a move would 
"Americanize the entire war." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still do not think we should enter this war on the side of the Bosnian 
Muslims," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggested that events had rendered 
the anguished U.S. debate over how to proceed in Bosnia largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Serbs already have almost everything they want, and we are now 
engaging in a sort of a symbolic tit for tat in the closing phases of an 
operation that is more or less concluded," he said.

TAFT HIGH WINS 2ND ACADEMIC DECATHLON; EDUCATION: WOODLAND HILLS WONDER 
STUDENTS CAPTURE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP BY MORE THAN 2,000 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In taking top honors in the 13th annual U. S. Academic Decathlon, the nine 
jubilant students from Taft High School Sunday declared a glorious day for 
their school, their district, their city, their state -- heck, maybe even their 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills wonder students earned a score of 49,372, beating the 
closest team in the 10-event battle of the brains by more than 2,000 points and 
capturing more than half the $30,000 in scholarships awarded to individual 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft senior Daniel Berdichevsky, 17, also claimed the tournament's highest 
individual accolade, earning the top overall score and a $5,000 scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put everything into it and we got everything out of it," Daniel said. 
"Everything we've been trying to do for the past year is win the national 
championship and we've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Taft's second national championship. The school's team took home a 
first-place prize in 1989 and second-place honors last year. Although Taft is 
not the first school to walk off with top honors twice, the sweetness of 
winning the prize for an embattled public school district wasn't lost on the 
crowd present for the awards ceremony at the Robert Treat Hotel in downtown 
Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Jersey spends $12,000 per student," said Dan Isaacs, assistant 
superintendent of school operations for the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. "California spends just more than $4,600." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain View High School of Mesa, Ariz., took second place with 47,098 
points, and Oliver Wendell Holmes High School in San Antonio came in third with 
46,885 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine Taft students began their arduous journey to the academic showdown 
last summer by competing with their classmates for a spot on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 They took practice tests every day after school, studied over holidays and 
weekends to successfully wind their way through the local and then the state 
competition in Stockton last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The group arrived in New Jersey as the team to beat, having won the highest 
scores ever at the LAUSD contest and the best score among the 42 state 
competitions in country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft also revived their secret weapon: Coach Arthur Berchin, who left the team 
after leading it to its last national title, returned for this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students went into the national finals with high expectations, 
they knew nothing was certain; higher stakes meant a higher level of 
competition. The students in New Jersey this weekend, the Taft teen-agers 
pointed out, were among the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Taft's tie for first place at Saturday's high-stakes Super Quiz, in which 
each student answers five oral questions before an audience of peers and 
parents, assured only that the group was still in the running. Scores on the 
nine other tests were not revealed until Sunday's agonizingly long awards 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 After a light lunch, an announcer plodded through the list of 300-plus awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were recognized for the highest scores in each of the 10 subjects -- 
essay, speech, interview, math, fine arts, economics, science, literature, 
social studies and Super Quiz. There are also awards for regional leaders, 
small-school high scorers, individual scholarship winners and highest-scoring 
students from each school. 
</P>
<P>
 As student after student marched through the crowded hotel ballroom to receive 
a prize, the Taft team cheered their own successes and twittered nervously each 
time one of the other top teams' names was called. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, who also won four subject medals, hummed "O, Canada." Stephen Shaw, 
16, who would take three subject medals, sat motionless, with his hands clasped 
in his lap. Rebecca Rissman, 17, who won three medals, tried to smile. And 
Michael Michrowski, 17, who won two medals, rested his face in his palms. Also 
competing for Taft was Andrew Salter, 17, who took home four subject medals; 
Chris Huie, 17, with two individual medals; Sage Vaughn, 17, with one medal, 
and Sheldon Peregrino, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents and supporters, 68 in all, moved closer and closer to the 
children as the tension grew. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can I not be nervous?" asked Daniel's mother, Rosie Berdichevsky, when 
she unglued her eye from the lens of her camcorder. "I put myself in his place 
and feel what he must be feeling. It's nice and it's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 But once the individual high scorers were announced, with California claiming 
five out of nine awards, the teen-agers' grim expressions gradually gave way to 
glee. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Kimberly Shapiro, 16, said it: "I know we're going to win, now. Girls 
know things that boys don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches from other schools began to console their students, like coach Larry 
Minkoff, from Whitney Young Magnet School in Chicago, who told his students 
that they were all winners. 
</P>
<P>
 A downtrodden Tukoi Jarrett, who won a gold medal for speech, would have none 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then how come I feel like a loser?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But all conversation in the ballroom was soon drowned out by the screams and 
howls of the Taft contingent, when the school's name was finally called out as 
the finest academic team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like first place," Berchin said.

O.C. AUTOPSY FAILS TO FIND CAUSE OF DEATH IN FUMES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private autopsy here of a Riverside woman who died as emergency room staff 
passed out around her failed to show why she died, or what gave off the 
mysterious fumes that apparently sickened the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent forensic pathologist, Richard Fukumoto of Orange County, 
examined the body of Gloria Ramirez over the weekend at the request of her 
family, who were given the body Thursday after weeks of court battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fukumoto's findings did not shed much more light on Ramirez's death -- or 
on the workers' sicknesses -- than did the autopsy and a follow-up removal of 
more tissue samples that were performed by the Riverside County coroner's 
office, a family lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no physical evidence for why she died," attorney Ronald Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-hour autopsy, Fukumoto determined that cervical cancer, from 
which Ramirez was suffering, didn't kill her, Schwartz said. But Fukumoto was 
not able to determine what did. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukumoto, citing advice from his lawyer, declined Sunday to be interviewed 
about the autopsy on Ramirez, which was done in a Santa Ana funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
 Six hospital workers were treated after the Feb. 19 incident at Riverside 
General Hospital, including Dr. Julie Gorchynski, who underwent knee surgery 
last week to correct a lack of circulation that is killing her bone tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has not released autopsy results pending the conclusion of its 
investigation, which is expected in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in releasing the body to the family Thursday, county officials said they 
are "90% sure" they know the cause of her death -- and that it probably was not 
linked to the mystery fumes that forced the evacuation of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bradley Gilbert, the Riverside County public health officer, wrote the 
family that scientific and medical experts have concluded that the body does 
"not currently present a public health hazard" and can be handled by a mortuary 
in preparation for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukumoto and his assistant took only normal precautions while examining the 
body, Schwartz said. County coroner's officials had dressed in airtight suits 
and used oxygen tanks when they performed their autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's sister, Maggie Ramirez-Garcia, said family members were glad they 
could get answers about the body other than those provided by the county. They 
have accused the county of a cover-up in Ramirez's death.

SHIP SUSPECTED OF CARRYING IMMIGRANTS SEIZED; SMUGGLING: TAIWANESE FISHING 
VESSEL WITH 121 PEOPLE ABOARD IS INTERCEPTED BY COAST GUARD OFF THE COAST OF 
MEXICO. CONDITIONS ABOARD ARE BETTER THAN IN PREVIOUS CASES.

<P>
 A suspected Taiwanese smuggling vessel with 121 people aboard was being 
escorted toward land by the U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday -- a day after the U.S. 
officials seized the fishing ship to inspect it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials would not say where the Jin Yinn No. 1 is heading, two 
Coast Guard cutters are apparently escorting the ship toward the Mexican coast, 
as was done in a similar case last year involving hundreds of undocumented 
Chinese immigrants aboard three vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard had tracked the 168-foot Jin Yinn for about a week after it 
was spotted as close as 240 miles southwest of San Diego. When the Jin Yinn saw 
Coast Guard vessels monitoring it, the Taiwanese ship "made a left turn" and 
headed back out to sea, said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer John Hollis. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, about 890 miles southwest of San Diego, Coast Guard law 
enforcement teams and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service interpreters 
boarded the ship and found 10 women, 101 men and 10 crew members aboard, all of 
whom appeared healthy, Hollis said. Officials also found a 10-day supply of 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word we get is that conditions aboard the vessel are much better than 
normally found on these ships," Hollis said. "It's clean. There's enough food." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taiwanese government gave its permission for the boarding of the Jin Yinn, 
Hollis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the Coast Guard intercepted more than 650 undocumented Chinese on 
three ships off the coast of Baja. The boats were allowed to dock in Mexico 
after some diplomatic discussions, and all aboard were deported to China except 
two, who were granted asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has been cracking down on political asylum seekers who, 
regardless of the merits of their claims, can stay in the U.S. for years while 
their cases are being settled. But Mexico can repatriate undocumented 
immigrants immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuter news agency quoted State Department spokeswoman Julie Reside as saying, 
"Our intention is to return those aboard the vessel to their country of origin 
as quickly as possible," as "the best means of discouraging future attempts to 
smuggle illegal aliens into the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Reside would not say whether the ship was bound for a U.S. or Mexican port, 
according to Reuter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jin Yinn was spotted by a Coast Guard aircraft on April 9, southwest of 
San Diego. The Taiwanese vessel was trailed for five days before two Coast 
Guard cutters approached. When the Jin Yinn's crew spotted the cutters, it 
started to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel faltered and stopped when an engine ran out of oil, Hollis said. 
The Coast Guard provided some oil and the vessel was able to get underway under 
escort.

CRITIC TAKES NO PRISONERS IN WAR ON UC POLICIES; EDUCATION: FORMER PROFESSOR 
CHARLIE SCHWARTZ IS A FRACTIOUS FORCE AT REGENTS MEETINGS. DEMANDING REFORMS 
AND TARGETING BUDGETS, HE BADGERS AND BAFFLES SYSTEM OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Schwartz is the University of California's one-man jeering section. 
</P>
<P>
 When he rises to speak at public meetings, regents sit stone-faced or take 
potty breaks. Even those who sympathize the most with what he has to say -- the 
students -- keep their political distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this doesn't faze him. The wiry, high-strung former Berkeley physics 
professor says he will not be deterred from his quest to expose fiscal high 
jinks and arrogance by those running UC's nine campuses, three national 
laboratories and five medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the university is in a mess and what you have is a corrupt 
administrative system," declared Schwartz, who has emerged as the UC system's 
chief critic since retiring two years ago. "I can't prove that anyone has 
committed any criminal act or violated any moral code, but the contradictions 
keep piling up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh charges, which university officials vigorously deny. 
</P>
<P>
 But what especially chafes their sensibilities is the bomb-throwing way 
Schwartz chooses to take on a bureaucracy that each year educates 163,000 
students, employs 150,000 people and spends more than $10 billion -- more than 
the gross national product of 30 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a personal magazine, or zine, that he mails to more than 200 subscribers, 
Schwartz has accused UC officials of hypocrisy, disinformation, "egregious" 
lies and the lack of "moral legitimacy." During regents meetings, he often 
presses his points by waving his newsletter and speaking in rapid-fire 
Brooklynese to squeeze the most out of his three allotted minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been hauled away for shouting from the audience. Last year, he blew a 
whistle when the regents shut off his microphone. And in November, he yelled 
"No, you're out of order!" to a regent who angrily gaveled him down. 
</P>
<P>
 In his private comments, he is no more charitable. Musing on the regents' 
apparent disinterest in his campaign, he said: "Are these people just being 
hoodwinked or are they part of a corrupt political movement to steal the 
university from the public? I have no conclusion. The fight is ongoing." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, say some regents, is their headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a one-man jeering crowd," said UC Regent Roy Brophy, a Sacramento 
developer who has walked out during Schwartz speeches. "Right now, he's just 
something we have to put up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know his rationale for the way he's doing things," he said. "What is 
he trying to get out of it? Does he want to straighten out the University of 
California? Does he want the attention? Is he trying to get known?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. Yes. Yes -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says he wants to bring democracy to an "aristocratic" system run by a 
secretive bureaucracy. He wants open debate in a public institution where 
decisions appear carefully scripted and the public, in the role of observer, is 
kept behind ropes at regents meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been mixed, said one former student leader. Although Schwartz 
has succeeded in raising legitimate questions and clashing with the 
university's button-down style, some of his budget proposals seem to "come out 
of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "He forces (the regents) to acknowledge that they are undemocratic and 
arrogant, sitting on their thrones, looking down on everyone else," said Tobin 
Freid, former UC Students Assn. president and now a White House fellow. "But as 
far as having him at the negotiating table with us, I wouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there have been incremental victories. Earlier this year, Schwartz met 
with UC Provost Walter E. Massey to pitch an "alternative budget." A Sacramento 
Bee columnist suggested his proposals deserved exploration and a San Francisco 
radio station recently invited him to an on-air discussion about the recent 
flap over UC President Jack Peltason's comments during a secretly taped staff 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a radical with a portfolio. A New York native who began his 
teaching career at Berkeley in 1959, Schwartz began locking horns with 
authority soon after his brother's 1966 death. The tragedy, he said, caused him 
to rethink his life as an unquestioning teacher of mathematical physics. 
</P>
<P>
 He veered off into the free-speech movements convulsing Berkeley at the time, 
began teaching with an anti-war bent and launched a sustained effort outside 
the classroom to get UC labs out of nuclear weapons research. He's been 
arrested an estimated half-dozen times, once at a 1982 demonstration at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hiatus during the Reagan years, Schwartz began pushing UC reform, 
calling for the direct election of nine of the 26 regents, the majority of whom 
are political appointees. He sponsored an unsuccessful ballot initiative to 
that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the 1992 scandal in which regents secretly voted a $737,000 golden 
handshake for departing President David Pierpont Gardner that riveted 
Schwartz's attention to the university's budget, 25 years' worth of which he 
has studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a professor emeritus, living on Social Security and a $55,000-a-year 
retirement check, Schwartz uses his Berkeley office and $650 in yearly research 
money to fire off anti-administration newsletters and study how best to trip up 
UC officials with their own numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 After combing through public testimony and budget documents, Schwartz has 
concluded that Peltason is lying when he says that 20% has been trimmed from 
administrative costs over the past four years. Or that fee hikes are justified 
in part because students are paying only about 30% of the cost of their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz says his own research has unearthed major contradictions: UC's 
spending on attorneys has been increasing twice as fast as spending on 
instruction; Peltason has trimmed administration by only 2.8% and there's at 
least $260 million of "excess fat" left; next year, the $4,347 charged 
undergraduates will be 87% of their true educational costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Schwartz contends, Peltason has been engaged in an elaborate budgetary 
shell game to pay administrators huge salaries while gouging students and 
depressing faculty salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie has a fixation and part of his motivation is to embarrass the 
administration," said UC Budget Director Lawrence Hershman, who has met with 
Schwartz as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz counters that he will not be "marginalized" in his crusade to "save 
this university, which I love and admire," although he admits to an "aura of 
circus" around how he is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think everyone should behave like me," he admits, "but there's very 
much of a need for some people like me, who do make noise, who are irritating, 
who are provocative -- but truthful."

OWL PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BACKFIRE; ENVIRONMENT: POLICIES TO PROTECT 
HABITAT IN SIERRA NEVADA MIGHT HELP FUEL DEVASTATING BLAZES, LOGGERS AND 
FORESTRY OFFICIALS SAY. SOME ENVIRONMENTALISTS CONTEND THE CLAIMS ARE A PLOY TO 
GAIN HARVESTING RIGHTS TO OLD-GROWTH TREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a dry spring heralding the onset of another drought in the Sierra Nevada, 
forestry officials fear that a policy intended to protect the old-growth 
habitat of the California spotted owl may have the opposite effect, heightening 
the risk of catastrophic fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As the biggest, most marketable trees in the national forests are put off 
limits to logging, sawmills are disappearing and with them the financial 
incentive to clear out the deadwood and dense stands of small trees that are 
turning the Sierra into a giant tinderbox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sitting on dynamite," said Richard Standiford, a forest management 
professor at UC Berkeley who was retained by the U.S. Forest Service to analyze 
the impact of the owl policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic, what's happened. We've cut down on the timber harvest because we 
didn't want the forests devastated. Now we've got no one to clean out the fuel 
load, and we're facing the possibility of another kind of devastation." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerod Verner, a wildlife biologist and the Forest Service's ranking expert on 
the California spotted owl, echoed Standiford's alarm. "It is a matter of deep 
concern to us," he said. "If something isn't done about the incredible buildup 
of the fuel load, we're going to face major losses." 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 10% of the state's population living in the 15-county region of 
the Sierra, Verner said, "We're not just talking about protecting the forest. 
There are a lot of people living up here now." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire danger is highest on the dry east side of the northern Sierra from 
Truckee to Susanville. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years of drought, 75 years of fire suppression, and a killer insect 
infestation have clogged the forests with dying trees and deadfall, creating a 
fuel load as lethal as many veteran forest service officials have seen in their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Logging practices also are to blame. Dating back to the Gold Rush, the timber 
industry's historic preference for cutting the big trees and leaving the small 
ones contributed to today's dense, brushy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent times, the industry had helped reduce the forest "fuel load" 
through commercial salvaging of dead and dying timber. But now timber companies 
say they can't get by on salvage operations, not without more access to the 
large, live trees favored by the California spotted owl and protected by the 
year-old owl policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestry officials acknowledge the policy contributes to the fire threat by 
limiting the amount of dead trees and woody debris that can be removed from the 
forests. Owls roost on the snags and their prey nest in the downed wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff can promote the spread of fire and presents a large hazard to 
firefighters," said Sue Hasari, a Forest Service fire management expert. "So 
there is something of a trade-off here between owl safety and human safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The California spotted owl is not a threatened species, unlike its cousin, the 
Northern spotted owl, which created so much controversy in the coastal forests 
of the Pacific Northwest. But studies show the California owl's birthrate is 
not increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Forest Service had hoped to safeguard the owl's habitat 
while granting the timber industry enough access to the forests to keep the 
mills operating and the fuel load under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy prohibits cutting trees 30 inches in diameter or larger and calls 
for retaining 40% of forest canopy in owl nesting areas and establishing 
300-acre perimeters around known nesting sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our vision was that the timber industry would be treating more acres, but 
more lightly (sparing the big trees) and doing a lot of thinning that would get 
at the fuels problem," said Verner, the principal architect of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't worked out that way. Environmental groups have fought 
successfully to put more land off-limits to logging than was contemplated under 
the policy. Many timber companies say they can't afford to retool old mills to 
accommodate the smaller trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Understaffed and underbudgeted, the Forest Service has not been able to work 
quickly enough on pending forest sales to keep modernized mills in fresh 
timber. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very wrenching transition period," said Matt Mathis, a public 
affairs officer with the Forest Service regional office responsible for the 
Sierra. "Everything is not working out the way we would have planned it." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge facing the agency, say officials, is coming up with 
money enough to make the forests safer from fire. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, environmentalists have complained that the public was subsidizing 
the cost of timber sales in national forests. Fees paid by the industry often 
were not enough to pay for roads and other expenses. But fees did help pay for 
the cost of clearing flammable debris from the forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the timber industry in retreat, Verner said, the public may have to 
foot an even larger bill. The Forest Service estimates the task of clearing out 
flammable growth from the Sierra could cost at least $100 million. The work 
would have to be repeated every decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our budget probably couldn't deal with the problem in one national forest," 
Verner said. (There are 10 national forests in the Sierra.) "The public is 
going to have to think about making a pretty big investment up here." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the owl policy has been a hard sell. While the timber industry 
argues it is tantamount to a logging ban, many environmentalists feel it is not 
enough. Some of them also dismiss the dire prediction of fire as timber 
industry propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat is being hyped by the timber industry to try to get access to more 
old trees," said Sammi Yassa, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council. Yassa represented environmentalists on a technical assessment team 
that advised the Forest Service on its owl policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yassa said the fire threat is greatest on 3 million to 4 million acres of 
younger, smaller timber -- spots where the timber industry is less interested 
in logging because trees are smaller and less valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the policy was adopted, the NRDC and other groups tied up 
millions of acres of previous timber sales, arguing they should be disallowed, 
retroactively, under the new policy. The Forest Service suspended the contested 
sales and now is reviewing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRDC also petitioned the Forest Service to place more acreage off limits 
to logging, in order to protect the habitats of the Sierra red fox, the marten 
and the Pacific fisher -- a member of the weasel family -- all of whose numbers 
may be decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The timber industry, meanwhile, has filed suit over the plan, contending it 
has accelerated the trend in mill closures, job losses and declining revenue in 
timber dependent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the owl policy, timber company spokesmen say they can't get the 
financing to convert their mills because they can't guarantee lenders of a 
sufficient supply of smaller, less valuable logs to make their operations 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the trees get smaller, the economics get more marginal, and you had to 
have access to more trees," said Tom Nelson, a forester with Sierra Pacific 
Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 But, so far, logging companies have not gotten the access they needed, Nelson 
said. "The area you can log just got smaller," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standiford, who analyzed the economic impact of the owl policy and previous 
environmental restrictions, came to a similar conclusion. Timber harvests have 
dropped by two-thirds since the mid-1980s, he said, from 1.5 billion board feet 
a year to less than 500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of national forest land in the Sierra is now off-limits to most 
commercial logging, he said, adding that "local mills will survive only if they 
can get their supply from other places." He was referring mainly to privately 
owned forest land in and outside the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the policy was announced, 10 sawmills in the Sierra have 
closed or given notice. The most recent, a 100-year-old mill in Camino, a tiny 
community 50 miles east of Sacramento, is shutting down after spending $30 
million to convert to a small log operation, said Henry Alden, the mill's chief 
forester. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supply is gone," Alden said. "The Forest Service was offering us a chance 
to bid on 2 1/2 million board feet, enough to keep us running for five days." 
</P>
<P>
 The closures are having an impact on local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service's studies project a loss of $176 million in yearly personal 
income in Sierra Nevada counties as a consequence of the owl policy and predict 
that timber industry employment in the Sierras will be cut by one-half to 
one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 But Standiford, who directed the studies, says only a handful of Sierra 
counties are truly timber dependent. "Most counties in the Sierra are pretty 
well diversified," he said, adding that jobs in the timber industry account for 
less than 5% of overall employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions include Lassen, Plumas and Sierra counties, areas dependent on 
timber revenues for much of their school and road maintenance budgets. In the 
last year alone, they saw those revenues decline by 50% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those counties are going to hurt the way the Northwest did," Standiford said, 
referring to communities in Oregon and Washington affected by a federal court 
order that prohibited logging in old-growth forests. 
</P>
<P>
 As if things weren't bad enough, many of California's hardest-hit communities 
lie on the dryer side of the Sierra. They are among the places facing the 
greatest risk of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In towns like Quincy, surrounded by the Plumas National Forest, where 
lightning has one of the highest ignition rates in the Sierra, resident 
environmentalists are less likely to minimize the threat of catastrophic fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around here, people aren't just talking about forest fires," said Michael 
Jackson, a lawyer who has spent much of his career representing the Sierra Club 
and other environmental groups. "They are talking about the fire, the one that 
burns clear from one end of the Sierra to the other."(MORE)

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A NEW TEAM, A NEW THEME FOR BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown has a new theme and a new team. She has a big lead 
and lots of loot. And she may have her gubernatorial campaign back on track 
after a series of awkward slip-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody really knows yet because the most important factor in a high-profile 
political race is the candidate's performance, not some staffer's strategy or 
contributors' checks. But she made some good moves over the weekend at the 
Democratic state convention here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked "the beginning of a new phase in my campaign," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new is all nuance -- fine-tuning and finesse -- but it does denote focus, 
which her race often has lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh look could be seen in two new campaign buttons, seemingly innocuous 
until you read the message. "One Million New Jobs for California -- Kathleen 
Brown," flashed one. The other proclaimed, "America's Best Treasurer to Revive 
America's Worst Economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as President Clinton's campaign team kept reminding itself two years ago: 
"It's the economy, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 If Gov. Pete Wilson is allowed to keep setting the campaign agenda on crime, 
he likely wins. That's usually a Republican issue and one that traditionally 
benefits male candidates. Her goal is to become "acceptable" on crime and then 
persuade voters to choose a governor they believe will pad their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among voters, the economy still outranks crime (52%-48%) as "the most 
important problem facing California," according to a recent Times poll. Nothing 
else is close. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who recently hired the wily Clint Reilly to manage her campaign, has 
decided to take her case to the voters with the question she posed to 
convention delegates on Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do you trust to create the 1 million jobs California needs to revive our 
economy -- Pete Wilson, a failed governor who has presided over the loss of 
over 550,000 jobs, or Kathleen Brown?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust" -- "jobs" -- "failed governor." Buzz words beamed directly at 
working-class swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The biased delegates whooped and hollered their reply as Brown warmed up to 
the huge crowd and displayed passion that had been missing in previous major 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good high-wage jobs. . . . Lose those jobs and we lose the California Dream," 
Brown said. "And that, my friends, is what has happened to this state. . . . 
The last 12 years of Republican rule under George 'Do Nothing' Deukmejian and 
Pete 'Pass-the-Buck' Wilson have been like a darkness slowly spreading across 
the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, of course, felt under no obligation to also blame U.S. defense cutbacks 
and a global recession for California's loss of jobs, or to mention that the 
state's economy has been improving. 
</P>
<P>
 She did address what many have considered a campaign failure: Her seeming 
inability to articulate what she stands for or why she wants to be governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand for progress and for prosperity, for enduring values and a new 
vision," Brown told delegates. Later, the fourth-generation Californian said to 
reporters: "I want to be governor because (the state) has been shortchanged 
with short leaders who have been short on vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need leaders who . . . understand (the state), who are willing to invest 
in it, to fight for it and who care about what happens to average Californians. 
. . . I'm mad that this guy hasn't done the job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The retooled Brown campaign -- several new key staffers were announced 
Saturday -- handed out not only revised buttons, but slick brochures promoting 
the candidate's record as treasurer and detailing her plans for job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her proposals included a tax credit for creating jobs, a preference for 
California companies in state contract bidding, a $1-billion infrastructure 
bond issue, regulatory relief and "no new taxes that will drive businesses out 
of state." 
</P>
<P>
 But later with reporters, Brown declined to "fall into the political trap" of 
flatly pledging no tax increase -- a caution Wilson hardly can capitalize on 
since he raised taxes by a record amount in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of a new Brown campaign strategy: Fill the voters' void about 
who she is by boosting her role as treasurer and specifying what she'd do as 
governor, while aggressively attacking Wilson. She'll spend a lot more time on 
the stump. And she'll soon begin a blitz of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's strategists believe she can't lose the Democratic nomination to 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. That's because roughly 55% of the 
registered Democrats are women and polls show they strongly support Brown. 
Also, Brown has nearly $4 million in the bank while Garamendi has a $600,000 
debt, although he plans to begin spending his own fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Wilson, Brown has a 10-point lead in the latest Times poll. And she's 
probably more of a front-runner today than when the weekend began.

WATANABE TO SEEK PREMIER'S POST IN JAPAN; POLITICS: FACTION LEADER WILL LEAVE 
FORMER RULING PARTY, FORM NEW GROUP FOR PARTNERSHIP IN COALITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Underscoring a continuing disintegration of Japan's once all-powerful Liberal 
Democratic Party, the leader of the party's third-largest faction said Sunday 
he will bolt the party to pursue the post of prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, 70, said he and his followers will 
establish a new party today to seek a partnership with parties in the ruling 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has long been my belief that parties with the largest common denominator 
(of the same policies) should come together and overcome the difficult 
situation Japan faces," he told reporters outside his office Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, I will give up my party membership," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yohei Kono, the LDP president, said last week that he would represent the 
party in running for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced his intention 
to resign April 8, Watanabe had been hinting that he would accept an invitation 
by two conservative-leaning parties in the coalition -- Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's Renewal Party and the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party -- 
to join in forming a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not make it clear until Sunday that he would accede to their demand 
that he leave the Liberal Democratic Party, which lost its 38-year grip on 
power last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe's decision immediately clouded the process of picking a new prime 
minister. Just a day before, the coalition had started hammering out an 
agreement on major policies on the unspoken premise that Hata would be chosen 
to head the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the coalition conservatives will now agree to drop Hata and choose 
Watanabe hinged mainly on how many LDP members join Watanabe's rebellion -- and 
how few liberals leave the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Koji Kakizawa, a Watanabe lieutenant, said 20 of the 45 lower-house members of 
Watanabe's faction had pledged to bolt the former ruling party with him. 
Including other LDP lawmakers, the rebellion could expand to 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Kakizawa spoke, five non-Watanabe faction members announced that 
they will join the Watanabe revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, analysts said Watanabe would have to spur a walkout of at least 80 
Liberal Democrats to make up for an expected rebellion in the governing 
coalition against him. The coalition of seven parties in the lower house now 
holds only a slim five-seat majority. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, Watanabe reiterated his intention to leave his party, but he had 
not yet submitted his resignation. He was to meet Kono this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, six LDP members had formally resigned from the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' secretary general, declared that "it is 100% 
certain that the coalition cannot unite behind Watanabe." The New Party 
Harbinger and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party also reacted 
negatively, while Hosokawa's Japan New Party was reportedly divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Although widely known as an opponent of political reforms that were enacted 
March 4, Watanabe favors stern measures against North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons and a future increase in a controversial 
consumption tax to pay for an immediate three-year reduction in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists, the largest coalition party, have dragged their feet on both 
issues.

SOLDIERS IN RWANDA RAPE, KILL CIVILIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwandan soldiers raped and hacked to death civilians while battles with rebels 
raged for an 11th day in the capital city of Kigali after the breakdown of 
cease-fire talks, witnesses said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like the mayhem has gathered pace. There are massacres all over the 
place. The army's delight is to murder civilians, while civilians turn on each 
other in ethnic revenge," said one witness trapped in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in one incident soldiers tied the hands of civilians behind their 
backs and then butchered them with machetes, or just "emptied round after round 
as if on target practice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people pleaded for their lives for 20 to 30 minutes, then the 
soldiers just shot them dead," he said. "Women are in trouble; they are raped 
first, then killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Savage fighting continued for control of strategic hilltops around the city. 
No one appeared to be in control of Kigali, and army units and rebels fought 
with heavy artillery, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, the witness said 
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,600 rebels had infiltrated the city, but army units and the 
presidential guard were still resisting fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 An interim Rwandan government official said cease-fire talks that began Friday 
between rebels and army units had stalled over stringent conditions each party 
set ahead of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not talking just now," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim government has been rejected as "a clique of murderers" by the 
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Burundi, former President Cyprian Ntayamira and two ministers 
were given a state burial Saturday. They were killed along with Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana when a rocket brought down their plane in Rwanda 
on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Habyarimana's death sparked the orgy of ethnic violence in Rwanda between the 
majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups, which have a long history of 
enmity. Thousands of people have died in Kigali and the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 A Belgian armed forces spokesman said Belgium's 420 U.N. peacekeepers in 
Rwanda can start withdrawing overland with a convoy of about 150 vehicles on 
Tuesday.

 "The closure is going to continue," Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein told

AMERICAN ALBUM: THE FLORIDA KEYS ARE QUICKLY GOING TO THE BIRDS; PRESENCE OF 
RARE SPECIES HAS LED TO ISLANDS' REPUTATION AS THE LATEST HOT SPOT FOR AUDUBON 
MEMBERS.

<P>
 For weeks now, strangers with binoculars have been showing up at the corner of 
Whalton and Johnson streets to peer into the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first," said retired Navy Capt. Aldis J. Browne Jr., who lives on the 
corner, "I didn't know what was going on. Except that it probably had to do 
with birds." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing a crowd to Browne's quiet neighborhood were reports that, for the 
fourth consecutive spring, a lone Bahamas mockingbird had shown up here, 
singing lustily in apparent advertisement for a mate. Sadly for this bachelor, 
he may be the only Bahamas mockingbird on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne, 82, is not much interested in bird-watching -- he recently earned a 
black belt in karate and is busy with that. But the other day, he said, he did 
meet "18 very nice people from San Francisco, all looking at this bird in my 
orchid tree." 
</P>
<P>
 The reappearance of this accidental tourist from the Caribbean is a brightly 
colored bit of good news for the local tourist industry -- as well as a bonus 
for the thousands of serious bird-watchers who come here each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do birders flock to the Florida Keys for the spring migration of 
warblers heading north to nesting sites, but they also come to see rare and 
unusual species -- the white-crowned pigeon and mangrove cuckoo, for example -- 
found here year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've picked up 26 new species already," said Julie Myers, a restaurant 
designer from Chicago who with a friend had planned her vacation around birding 
in the Keys. "And we haven't even been to the Dry Tortugas yet." 
</P>
<P>
 This resort town, the southernmost spot in the continental United States and 
the end of the road along the Eastern Seaboard, has long been a mecca for 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, Key West holds its annual Hemingway Days festival, and among 
the throng of literary revelers are dozens of people who look just like Papa. 
In October, Fantasy Fest turns the streets into a carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the time of year, between the winter and summer seasons, when Key 
West is host to a more sober breed of tourists, more interested in listening to 
the song of the black-whiskered vireo at dawn than in singing Jimmy Buffett 
tunes over the sunset drink specials at Mallory Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird-watchers make up only a small part of the estimated 4 million people who 
visit the Florida Keys each year. Still, thanks to the Bahamas mockingbird -- 
whose presence has been noted on national birding hot lines -- and other rare 
species, the Keys' reputation as a birding hot spot is growing, said Wayne 
Hoffman, a research scientist with the National Audubon Society's field office 
in the Upper Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a dozen people a day in here picking up maps and checklists," he said. 
"We've also got in Key West right now a short-eared owl that's come up here 
from Cuba. That's rare, and it's been getting some attention too." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the requisite stops for visiting birders is Audubon House, a restored 
early 19th-Century home and museum operated by the Florida Keys Audubon Society 
to commemorate the famed painter's visit to Key West in 1832. John James 
Audubon did not live here; he visited just long enough to add 18 species to his 
own life list. 
</P>
<P>
 Most serious birders also make a day trip to the Dry Tortugas. Lying 70 miles 
west of Key West in the Gulf of Mexico, the Dry Tortugas are seven coral reefs 
that serve as a major rest stop for migratory birds -- as well as the nesting 
ground of the sooty and noddy tern. 
</P>
<P>
 The islands, site of the 19th-Century Ft. Jefferson and overseen by the 
National Park Service, are accessible only by seaplane or boat and have no 
overnight accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
 But at this time of year, they are alive with birds. "Seabirds like the brown 
booby, the masked booby, dozens of warblers, hummingbirds, thrushes, tanagers, 
buntings, orioles, swallows -- anything might show up," Hoffman said. "I was 
there one day at the peak of the season, about May 1, and saw 95 species. I was 
pretty excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Most birders would call spotting 95 species in a day a once-in-a-lifetime 
bonanza. But Fran Ford, a Key West merchant and past president of the local 
Audubon Society, said she can almost guarantee a higher one-day count this May 
1 during the annual fund-raising Birdathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We start in the Dry Tortugas at dawn, spend an hour there, then fly back to 
Key West for breakfast in the park, and then work our way up the Keys," she 
said. "By nightfall, when we hear the screech owl in Key Largo, we could have 
130 different species. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now where else can you do that?"

CHINA CHARGES 3 WITH ROBBING, KILLING 24 TAIWAN TOURISTS IN LAKE BOAT FIRE

<P>
 Chinese officials confirmed today that 24 Taiwanese tourists and eight 
mainland Chinese were murdered aboard a lake cruise boat and said that three 
men have been charged in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst incident of violence against tourists since the founding of the 
People's Republic in 1949, Zhejiang province authorities said the three men, 
all in their early 20s, robbed the passengers and then set fire to the tourist 
boat, killing the Taiwanese and the eight mainland Chinese guides and crew 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident provoked a crisis in relations between Taiwan and China after 
relatives of the victims charged that Chinese officials blocked their attempts 
to investigate what happened March 31 on Qiandao Lake, about 200 miles 
southwest of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhejiang province officials said Wu Lihong, 22, Hu Zhihan, 24, and Yu Aijun, 
22, had all confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years Qiandao Lake, southwest of the historic city of Hangzhou in 
eastern China, had become a regular stopover for Taiwanese tourists on tours of 
the Huangshan (Yellow Mountain) region in Anhui province and Hangzhou.

 An off-duty British U.N. soldier was shot dead at a checkpoint of the 
Muslim-led Bosnian army in Sarajevo early Sunday, a U.N. peacekeeping force 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the circumstances of the incident were being investigated by the U.N. 
Protection Force and Bosnian military police. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. spokesman said the soldier's identity was being withheld pending 
notification of his family.

<P>
 Bosnian security troops maintain many road checkpoints within Sarajevo and 
enforce a nightly curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian capital remains in a state of war, although Bosnian Serb forces 
surrounding the city no longer bombard it following a NATO ultimatum.

U.S. A-BOMB CHIEF ALLEGEDLY LEAKED SECRETS; ESPIONAGE: A FORMER SOVIET 
SPYMASTER SAYS THAT THE LATE J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER PASSED NUCLEAR DATA TO 
AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Soviet spy chief's memoirs published here today claim that the late J. 
Robert Oppenheimer, head of the U.S. atomic bomb project during and after World 
War II, passed nuclear secrets to Soviet agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were made by Gen. Pavel Sudoplatov, who was in charge of 
efforts to obtain atomic secrets from the West, and excerpts of them ran in the 
Sunday Telegraph. Time magazine will print excerpts in today's issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoirs charge that Oppenheimer, a University of California physicist 
known as "the father of the atomic bomb," condoned and assisted in the flow of 
vital nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheimer was director of the Los Alamos project in New Mexico, which built 
the bomb from atomic fuel manufactured in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Hanford, Wash. 
The entire operation was known by the code name "Manhattan Project." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first test explosion July 16, 1945, two subsequent bombs were 
dropped over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, ending 
the Pacific war. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1947 to 1952, Oppenheimer was chairman of the general advisory committee 
of the Atomic Energy Commission, but in December, 1953, his top-secret security 
clearance was revoked because of his alleged Communist associations in the 
1930s and 1940s. He was never charged with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, many liberal Americans believed that Oppenheimer was a victim of 
a witch hunt led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his followers. Oppenheimer, known 
as "Oppie," became the focus of a bitter fight between liberals and fierce 
anti-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oppenheimer's reputation appeared to be rehabilitated by President John F. 
Kennedy, who invited him to a dinner at the White House for Nobel Prize winners 
in 1962. He died in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Oppenheimer won the Atomic Energy Commission's Enrico Fermi Award for 
contributions to theoretical physics and administrative leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the new book, British historian Robert Conquest, reached in California by 
the Sunday Telegraph, declared: "These memoirs show that Oppenheimer was on the 
edge of committing treason." 
</P>
<P>
 Sudoplatov charges that Elizabeth Zarubina, wife of the Soviet intelligence 
head in Washington, cultivated Oppenheimer socially. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarubina persuaded Oppenheimer to share atomic secrets with "anti-fascists of 
German origin," Sudoplatov says. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoir, "Special Tasks," declares: "We received reports on the Manhattan 
Project from Oppenheimer and his friends in oral form, through comments and 
asides, and from documents transferred through clandestine methods with their 
full knowledge that the information they were sharing would be passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all there were five classified reports made available by Oppenheimer 
describing the progress of work on the atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet spy chief said they took pains not to enlist Oppenheimer as an 
agent. "We understood that he and other members of the scientific community 
were best approached as friends, not as agents." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians also received photos of the facilities at Oak Ridge, the book 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Soviet bomb was constructed in three years," Sudoplatov says. "Without 
the intelligence contribution, there could have been no Soviet bomb that 
quickly."

MITCHELL OFFERS THREE CHEAPER HEALTH PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the backing of the White House, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) has offered Senate Democrats three cheaper versions of President 
Clinton's health plan, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each still seeks to guarantee all Americans health insurance and to require 
employers to pay some of the cost, the New York Times said in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alternatives all would cost less than the Administration proposal. 
They variously accomplish that by reducing what employers would pay, decreasing 
what the government would pay, limiting benefits or increasing what individuals 
would pay, the paper said. Mitchell offered them in an effort to get Congress 
moving on health care, the report said.

IN A '67 RAGTOP, CLINTON JOINS 'RABID MUSTANGERS'; NOSTALGIA: PRESIDENT DRIVES 
HIS 'MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION' AT A BIRTHDAY BASH FOR THE CLASSIC CAR. THE 
DOOR'S STUCK, THE CHROME'S BENT, BUT IT'S A MUSEUM PIECE NOW.

<P>
 President Clinton made a nostalgic visit to his and America's past on Sunday 
with an appearance at a Ford Mustang owners' convention at the Charlotte Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton cruised onto the oval track behind the wheel of his own turquoise 1967 
Mustang convertible and was introduced to the sun-splashed infield crowd by 
Mustang Club of America President Bill Dillard, who said the President is "a 
rabid Mustanger like the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, wearing a red "Mustang 30th Anniversary" windbreaker, stood beaming 
beside his car, which has a dented chrome strip on one side and a driver's door 
that doesn't open from the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The car has the stock six-cylinder engine, automatic transmission and a white 
top and interior. The ragtop bears an Arkansas historical vehicle plate in the 
rear and a vanity tag up front reading "Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang Club of America paid to transport the car from Arkansas, and Ford 
Motor Co. did some repairs on it Saturday so that Clinton could drive it 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President noted that "nobody lets me drive anymore" and took obvious 
pleasure in being behind the wheel of his precious car once more. His lead 
Secret Service agent, Dave Carpenter, rode shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton flew here from Williamsburg, Va., where he attended a Senate 
Democratic policy retreat on Saturday and played a round of golf Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the speedway, Clinton showed off his Mustang, which he purchased in the 
mid-1970s from his younger brother, Roger, and which is now garaged at a car 
museum in Morrilton, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has promised that he will personally retrieve it as soon as he 
completes his term of office in Washington. He has called the car his "most 
precious possession." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a proud Mustang owner, I know what an important milestone this is," 
Clinton wrote in a letter to other Mustang owners. "For many Americans, the 
Mustang remains a vibrant symbol of the excitement and optimism of the 1960s, 
when it was first conceived." 
</P>
<P>
 At the track, he signed the dented fender of one Mustang and sat in the 
"playboy pink" 1967 Mustang of Rochelle McNeal of Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charlotte show was sponsored by Ford and the Mustang owners' club to mark 
the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the Mustang, which shattered sales 
records and spawned a new class of sporty, youth-oriented automobiles known as 
"pony cars." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang swept America in the months after the assassination of President 
John F. Kennedy and as U.S. involvement in Vietnam was growing. Ford sold 
417,000 of the 1964 Mustangs, and the car has become a cultural icon. 
</P>
<P>
 The car initially sold for $2,368 with a 170-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, a 
three-speed manual transmission and a bare-bones vinyl interior. 
</P>
<P>
 In its various incarnations, from basic family transportation to supercharged, 
customized hot rod, more than 6 million Mustangs have been sold in 30 years.

CAMPAIGN NOTES; NOTHING'S OUT OF KILTER WHEN IT COMES TO GRABBING ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The men in kilts had come to party, and the Democrats didn't let them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotsmen Paul Buchanan and William Main, of Dundee and Glasgow respectively, 
were in Los Angeles for a trade show when their hotel was suddenly aswarm with 
sign-waving, sleep-deprived members of the state Democratic Party. Unfazed, the 
tartan-clad twosome pulled up their knee socks and joined in the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen anything like this in our lives," Buchanan, a representative 
of the Dundee tourist board, said happily as he stood in a buffet line at state 
Sen. Tom Hayden's Alternative Dinner party Saturday night. "Everyone comes up 
and says, 'Whose camp are you?' We say, 'Neither, but we're open to 
persuasion!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the two foreign visitors had grasped instantly what American 
political conventions are really all about: getting attention. Back home, they 
admitted, they would probably be wearing jeans. But in an atmosphere as 
frenzied as the one at the Bonaventure Hotel, they sensed that -- much like the 
candidates running for governor -- they needed to work hard to stand out. 
Intuitively, they knew what it would take: skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult not to be noticed dressed like this," Main said. 
"Sometimes people say something stupid like, 'What are you wearing under the 
kilt?' But you always get a reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, too, wanted to set himself apart (though he opted to wear pants). The 
self-appointed messenger of campaign reform hosted the $9.94-per-person buffet 
dinner party on the same night as the official $75-a-head Making A Difference 
Dinner in the convention hall. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown drew the spotlight the next day by pledging 
that as governor, she would create 1 million new jobs for Californians. 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, meanwhile, seemed determined not only to 
create jobs, but to work in as many of them as possible before the June 7 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his effort to work a day in each of the state's 58 counties, 
Garamendi donned a bow tie and joined the hotel waiters, serving bleary-eyed 
conventioneers their breakfasts one morning this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The effectiveness of this gimmick remained unclear, even after one 
enthusiastic woman approached Garamendi and announced approvingly: "You served 
my coffee this morning and your hand was so steady!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee was not the only beverage that Democrats gulped in great quantities. In 
the evenings particularly, the hotel's several saloons overflowed with 
delegates, reporters and -- for one night at least -- White House staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore had come to town for a Friday rally and Saturday 
morning keynote speech, bringing with him dozens of Secret Service agents, 
White House advance people and Democratic National Committee staff. To say that 
their presence resembled something out of a movie would be an understatement, 
considering that the climactic scenes from "In the Line of Fire" -- last year's 
Clint Eastwood movie about an aging Secret Service agent foiling a presidential 
assassination -- were filmed at the Bonaventure Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But life really began to imitate art on Friday night, when about 20 
Administration and DNC staffers converged on the hotel's revolving cocktail 
lounge on the 35th floor. As they slowly spun, a few sipped "California 
Dreaming" margaritas (served in blue ceramic mugs in the shape of California). 
But by far the nightcap of choice was a lip-puckering mix of rum, sweet and 
sour and passion-fruit juice, served with a shot of Benedictine on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its syrupy consistency, this high-octane belt of so-called "In the 
Line of Fire" cocktail was irresistible to inside-the-Beltway residents. The 
reason: It comes in a ceramic replica of the hotel Eastwood made famous. More 
than a few Washington insiders paid $12.50 for the right to take that gray, 
cylindrical and undeniably ugly mug home -- a lasting memento of the City of 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The convention was marked by valiant attempts at humor. State party chair Bill 
Press kicked it off when he defined politics as "poli-, meaning many, and - 
tic, meaning a small blood-sucking insect." Then, with apologies to David 
Letterman, Press introduced Gore with a Top 10 List of Reasons Why We're Glad 
Al Gore is Vice President. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 was: "Because he can spell." No. 6 was: "Because he makes Warren 
Christopher look wild and crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Gore tried to join in the frivolity, mocking his own wooden image and 
reciting a compendium of familiar Gore jokes, among them, "Al Gore is so 
boring, his Secret Service code name is Al Gore." Ever since his failed bid for 
president in 1988, "I heard 'em all," Gore said. "And every time I heard them, 
my response was always the same: 'Very funny, Tipper.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) told a story about a woman who, after shaking 
his hand, was heard to mutter, "That John Jr. is much better-looking in photos 
than he is in person." 
</P>
<P>
 And state Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) offered his own Top 10 list -- this 
one of political predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 was: "Gov. Pete Wilson (squeaks) out a primary victory when (GOP 
challenger) Ron Unz is called back to the mother ship." No. 8 was a bit of a 
reach: "Michael Huffington's candidacy (for U.S. Senate) falters when it is 
discovered that his wife is in fact Leona Helmsley." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the candidate who got the most laughs was understandably absent: 
Orange County Republican Rep. Bob Dornan. Thanks to an organization called 
BeatBob, which printed up and distributed hundreds of packs of BeatBob trading 
cards, Dornan was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Each card featured a memorable Dornan quotation, like his attacks on gays, 
Jews, minorities and feminists. The flip side of the cards analyzed Dornan's 
performance on the political playing field, noting that "the red-haired insult 
hurler" has physically accosted a fellow member of Congress. (Dornan allegedly 
grabbed him by the tie.) 
</P>
<P>
 "What a crazy guy!" the cards concluded.

 The federal government, citing the end of the Cold War, is abandoning an 
11-year-old, $8-billion project on ways to keep the government running after a 
nuclear attack, according to published reports. The "Doomsday Project," as it 
is known, will officially end on Oct. 1, according to military officials 
familiar with the project who were quoted in today's editions of the New York 
Times.The Pentagon spent $8 billion on the project, which sought to create an 
unbreakable chain of command for military and civilian leaders that would 
withstand a six-month war that included a sustained nuclear attack on 
Washington. "That was the requirement: six months," said Bruce Blair, a former 
Strategic Air Command officer who analyzed nuclear war programs in the 1980s. 
"And at the end we had to have a cohesive chain of command, with control over 
our remaining nuclear forces, that would give us leverage over the Soviets." 
Like many other Cold War programs, the Doomsday Project's details remain top 
secret.

 Supporters of the Branch Davidians held a memorial for church members who died 
in last year's fire and expressed anger at the events that led to the deadly 
finale of a 51-day standoff with federal agents. Emotions ran high and 
recriminations were aired over the government's handling of the incident, which 
ended in the deaths of cult leader David Koresh and about 80 followers on April 
19, 1993, when a blaze destroyed their compound outside Waco. The daylong 
memorial, held near the site of what had been the Branch Davidian complex, 
included exhibit tents and vendors of food, ice cream and T-shirts.

 A flood that buried parts of Ft. Fairfield under seven feet of water subsided, 
allowing residents to return to their homes in what one official likened to a 
war zone.No injuries were reported in the flood, which was caused by an ice 
jam. Cleanup crews used heavy construction equipment to remove large chunks of 
ice scattered across the town by the Aroostook River. Town Manager Scott 
Seabury said nearly every building in the downtown area suffered at least 
cosmetic damage from the flood, which covered the farming community's main 
street with seven feet of water. More than 50 people were evacuated from their 
homes before the ice that had formed a natural dam broke free, police said.

BILL TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS IS SHORT OF MAJORITY IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a ban on assault weapons are 15 to 20 votes short in the House 
of Representatives, a key congressman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest head count by House Democratic leaders, a bill banning 
assault-style weapons, such as Uzis and AK-47s, is shy of a majority, raising 
the prospect of a major disagreement between the House and Senate on anti-crime 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it very surprising with all the mayhem going on in the streets," Rep. 
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Sunday. "The House voted 
against an assault-weapons ban two years ago, but a lot has changed since 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime and the 
leading sponsor of the assault-weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate last fall passed a $22-billion crime bill that included the weapons 
ban. The House version, scheduled for continued debate this week, has no ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Differences between House and Senate bills are common. But if the disagreement 
packs enough political weight, it can sink an entire bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer said aggressive lobbying by the National Rifle Assn. is behind the 
soft support for the assault-weapons ban in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members kept coming to me and saying: 'Look, I voted for the Brady bill. I 
thought it was the right thing to do, and the gun lobby came down very hard on 
me, and I can't vote against them,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA was closed Sunday, and a spokesman for the lobbying group could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brady bill, signed into law last year, created a five-day waiting period 
and a procedure for background checks on people seeking to buy a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
said Sunday that he will insist that the final crime bill ban assault weapons.

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS READY ENDEAVOUR FOR LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Endeavour's astronauts test-fired their steering jets and 
wiggled their flaps Sunday in preparation for their return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour is scheduled to land just before 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, ending an Earth 
observation mission that began April 9.Weather forecasts are favorable for a 
landing at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Commander Sidney Gutierrez and pilot Kevin Chilton activated hydraulic systems 
that drive wing and tail flaps Sunday and then fired 44 steering jets on the 
shuttle's nose and tail. Mission Control said the checkout went well. 
</P>
<P>
 The $366-million radar imaging system in Endeavour's cargo bay continued to 
scan Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials said the radar system has filled 124 reels of tape on board the 
shuttle with recorded data for later analysis on Earth. Some pictures are also 
transmitted to the ground. Scientists at the Johnson Space Center in Houston 
said they were delighted with the images they were getting. 
</P>
<P>
 At a crew news conference televised to reporters at Mission Control, the 
astronauts talked about the spectacular views.

NEW AUTOPSY IN FUMES CASE CAN'T FIND CAUSE OF DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private autopsy of a woman who died as emergency room staff passed out 
around her failed to show why she died, or what gave off the mysterious fumes 
that apparently sickened the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent forensic pathologist examined the body of Gloria Ramirez over 
the weekend at the request of her family, who were given the body Thursday 
after weeks of court battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the findings of pathologist Richard Fukumoto did not shed much more light 
on Ramirez's death -- or on the workers' sicknesses -- than did the autopsy and 
a follow-up removal of more tissue samples that were performed by the Riverside 
County coroner's office, a family lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no physical evidence for why she died," said attorney Ronald 
Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-hour autopsy, Fukumoto determined that cervical cancer, from 
which Ramirez was suffering, didn't kill her, Schwartz said. But Fukumoto was 
not able to determine what did. 
</P>
<P>
 Six hospital workers were treated after the Feb. 19 incident at Riverside 
General Hospital, including Dr. Julie Gorchynski, who underwent knee surgery 
last week to correct a lack of circulation that is killing her bone tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has not released autopsy results pending the conclusion of its 
investigation, which is expected in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in releasing the body to the family Thursday, county officials said they 
are "90% sure" they know the cause of her death -- and that it probably was not 
linked to the mystery fumes that forced the evacuation of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bradley Gilbert, the Riverside County public health officer, wrote the 
family that scientific and medical experts have concluded that the body does 
"not currently present a public health hazard" and can be handled by a mortuary 
in preparation for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukumoto and his assistant took only normal precautions while examining the 
body, Schwartz said. County coroner's officials had dressed in airtight suits 
and used oxygen tanks when they performed their autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's sister, Maggie Ramirez-Garcia, said family members were glad they 
could get answers about the body other than those provided by the county. They 
have accused the county of a cover-up in Ramirez's death.

EARTH'S ANGELS; YOUNG AND OLD, ECOLOGY-MINDED HONOR THEIR PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ecologically aware came with their children and ideals in tow Sunday to 
celebrate Earth Day at the Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve and Regional 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For six hours, young and old alike filed in and out of the carnival-like 
setting to visit booths and exhibits and to experience a hands-on approach to 
honoring Mother Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the fifth annual event organized by the Upper Newport Bay 
Naturalists volunteer group in conjunction with the California Department of 
Fish and Game and the Orange County Harbors, Beaches and Parks department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Nesselroad, 33, of Lake Forest, said the experience was important for 
her son, Matthew, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to learn about the environment, all the plants and animals around 
him and how to take care of his environment," Nesselroad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which drew about 2,500 visitors, featured information booths by 
organizations ranging from the Sierra Club to the Orange County Fund for 
Environmental Defense. There were also fish-touching tanks and face-painting 
stations, both popular with young people. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps no attraction drew more attention than two llamas, Duke and 
Windwalker, standing in a booth of their own near the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 David and Cheryl Libby, who feel about their llamas the way most people feel 
about their house pets, were promoting better understanding of the gentle, 
humpless relatives of the camel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're backpackers," explained David, a 32-year-old airplane mechanic. "We can 
put 80 pounds on the white guy and the other is good for about 40 pounds," he 
said of the two llamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Libbys, who live in Orange, have volunteered their llamas to carry 
provisions for the U.S. Forest Service when it surveys frogs, newts and other 
amphibians in the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Libby, also 32 and a dental technician, said she once had a horse. But 
"the horse hated my husband and my husband hated my horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing the horse with a llama not only appeased David, it provided a 
wonderful side effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was stress relief," Cheryl Libby said. "I just sat down and listened to 
the llamas hum. They have a way about them. You stand out in the middle of the 
whole herd and you can't help but relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Kimberly Carl of Irvine took a turn feeding Duke and Windwalker. 
She had never seen a llama, except in pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like nothing she had ever felt before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels kind of weird," Kimberly said. "It has a different feeling to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an awareness -- an appreciation for the natural surroundings -- was an 
underlying theme at most booths and exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the humming llamas, Dr. Kathleen P. Hutton, a Newport Beach 
dermatologist, offered a word of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not selling anything," Hutton said. She was, however, giving away samples 
of sun block lotion provided by the product's manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutton's booth was nearly as popular as the llama feeding station because of a 
small, boxlike gadget that allowed people to see via ultraviolet light the 
as-yet-unnoticeable damaged caused by sunlight on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Freckles, Hutton explained, are no more than mildly sun-damaged blotches of 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American Academy of Dermatology says no tan is healthy," Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Hutton had ventured into the gathering of hundreds of Earth Day 
enthusiasts, knowing many of them spend much of their time outdoors, hiking, 
backpacking or bird-watching under the sun's harmful rays. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who would be at more risk because they've been out in the 
sun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, she said, all forms of skin cancer can be cured if detected 
and treated early enough. 
</P>
<P>
 As many exhibitors might agree, Hutton knows awareness is only the first stage 
in the campaign to promote a cause. Hutton said she has a running debate with 
her husband, an orthopedic surgeon, over how much sun a person can be exposed 
to without harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband, who has a tan, hides my sunscreen from me, by the way," she said.

LOCAL LAWMAKERS SAY ANTI-CRIME BILL IS TOO WEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's conservative congressmen pride themselves on being a 
law-and-order bunch. But they are likely to snub a mammoth crime package due 
for a vote in the House this week -- not because they oppose a tough anti-crime 
bill, but because they think this isn't it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is aptly named a crime bill because what the Democrats have done is a 
crime," Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) fumed Friday as the House braced 
for a week of partisan brawling. "It has Bill Clinton's fingerprints all over 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats sponsoring the package say it offers some deliverance to a 
frightened public by expanding the federal death penalty, putting 100,000 
police officers on the nation's streets over the next five years, building 
prisons and allowing 13- and 14-year-olds to be tried as adults for some 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets tough on crime, they say, without sacrificing rehabilitation and 
prevention, providing for everything from increased drug treatment to midnight 
youth basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservative Republicans, most Orange County delegates among them, 
complain the bill would more likely impede executions, hamstring police and 
squander on social experiments money better used to build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get a tough crime bill out this year, but this is not a tough 
crime bill," Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, endorsed by President Clinton, poses a dilemma for Orange County 
lawmakers. Some provisions -- mainly more police and more prisons -- are 
popular in Orange County cities where fear of crime is at a peak. A version of 
this piece of mega-legislation -- it is 21 bills rolled into one -- passed 
overwhelmingly in the Senate last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A no vote could leave a lawmaker with some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be interpreted by my opposition as a vote against crime control. I 
would hope the people in my district know I am very supportive of a strong 
piece of crime legislation," Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the onus is on us to explain our position," said Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, leading Democrats have all but defied a Republican threat to delay 
passage of a crime package in this political climate. "People want us to get on 
with this bill and not talk it to death," Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County delegates said they could not in good conscience support a 
bill that so concerns them, less for what is in it than what is not: It does 
not, they say, reform the so-called exclusionary rule, which prohibits the 
admission of illegally seized evidence in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not require that convicted criminals serve 85% of their terms, as 
Packard proposes. Currently, he said, the average inmate serves about one-third 
of the sentence imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, the lawmakers contend, the legislation continues to allow 
death-row appeals and permits consideration of racial bias in those appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they vowed to keep an open mind. Thirty-six amendments remain to be 
debated before the bill goes to a final vote, possibly as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the House, dominated by Democrats for 40 years, many Republicans were 
less than optimistic that any meaningful amendment endorsed by their party 
would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard for me to support something I think is a fraud perpetrated by 
liberal Democrats to make people think they care about crime," said Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can predict that next year we will not feel the impact of this legislation 
if we pass it as it is," said Dornan, who has recently taken to attending daily 
Mass because, he says, he is so worried about the country in the hands of 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not take a bite out of crime. It will not put a dent in crime," he 
said. "What's the sense of going through this horrible feel-good charade?"

SHARING THE WORD ON AIDS; TECHNOLOGY: PATIENTS AND OTHERS CAN COUNT ON SISTER 
MARY ELIZABETH'S ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TO PROVIDE 
EXTENSIVE INFORMATION FOR FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any good fisherman, Sister Mary Elizabeth rises early -- 4 a.m. -- for 
her day's catch. At a powerful computer in her home here, she casts her net to 
Washington and across the sea, drawing in the latest research findings and 
other information that could help people afflicted with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need information to take care of themselves," said Sister Mary, who 
founded her electronic bulletin board in 1990 to provide a free service for 
people who are isolated by their disease and cannot afford to access for-profit 
computer information networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin board, with 144,000 electronic files that include all the 
AIDS-related contents of the Washington-based National Library of Medicine and 
the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, is considered one of the most 
comprehensive depositories of AIDS information in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it is the hub of a North American network called AIDS Education 
General Information System, or AEGIS, sending information electronically to 100 
other AIDS bulletin boards scattered throughout the United States and Canada. 
And it shares data daily with overseas AIDS computer networks serving Europe, 
Asia, Africa and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are other AIDS databanks, those who use Sister Mary's system say 
it is extraordinary because it is free, easy to use and extremely 
comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Juan Capistrano system's four telephone lines operate around the 
clock, seven days a week, fielding 50 to 100 calls daily. Its 2,000 registered 
users include people afflicted with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as 
well as scientists, physicians and officials of federal organizations such as 
the Veterans Administration and the Office of National AIDS Policy 
Coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use it to keep up with what is going on in the world," said Nancy Hazleton, 
the Office of National AIDS Policy Coordination's global coordinator. "If I 
need information about what is happening in Thailand, I can shoot a message 
through the network system's e-mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazleton is not alone in relying on the system's bulletin boards. Sister Mary, 
who is a computer expert, specifically designed it so people with AIDS could, 
by signing on by name or anonymously, seek advice, talk with AIDS patients and 
advocates worldwide, or just eavesdrop to ease their loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day last week, Robin of San Francisco asked for information on 
what to do about night sweats and learned from Kevin of British Columbia, 
Canada, that using bedsheets woven with natural fibers such as cotton and silk 
is helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Segur is a former bartender with AIDS who taps into the databank and 
dialogue to supplement the AIDS electronic bulletin board he operates in 
Pittsburgh, Pa. "It is nice to hobnob with (people with AIDS), people who care 
and have an understanding of what you are going through," Segur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billi Goldberg, a retired civil engineer and AIDS activist in San Francisco, 
said she regularly feeds research information into AEGIS. "Instead of being in 
a vacuum," she said, "you have people talking to people. We have had a lot of 
heated debates about AZT and alternative treatments like ozone and DNCB, herbs 
and vitamins." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tomas Fabregas learned a few months ago that a virus associated with AIDS 
was attacking his eyes, he signed on to the San Juan Capistrano bulletin board 
from his San Francisco home. In doing so, he found out that a Bay Area hospital 
was experimenting with a promising treatment for the infection, which causes 
blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Fabregas joined the hospital experiment and had time-release 
drugs surgically implanted in both eyes. The virus, called cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, has been suppressed, saving his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so empowering to find through a phone call this mass of information," 
he said, adding that the computer bulletin boards and database enable him to 
work with his own doctor in finding life-extending treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, users of the system say, the network posts important new medical 
information before most physicians learn about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physicians today don't have the time to read everything that comes across 
their desk because of the rapid changes taking place in treatment techniques," 
Sister Mary said. 
</P>
<P>
 One patient discovered that he was suffering a harmful side effect from mixing 
drugs when he read a report that AEGIS had just copied from the National 
Library of Medicine. As it turned out, the report had not yet been published in 
the professional reference book that his doctor used. 
</P>
<P>
 At the helm of the information network is Sister Mary, who dedicates her days 
to exchanging and organizing data. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken woman, whose office walls are covered with community service 
awards and dominated by a crucifix, said she wants to help AIDS patients be 
healthier and teach everyone how to stop the spread of the incurable and deadly 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system here is the largest (AIDS) database in the world," she said, 
patting two powerful computers she keeps in her modest mobile home, which 
doubles as her office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary stirred controversy in 1988 when, in an action independent of the 
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles (which includes Orange County), she took her 
first vows in a San Clemente Episcopal church and announced her plans to create 
a religious order to serve the homeless and other outcasts of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from failing to follow religious protocol, there is another factor that 
makes her bid for recognition by the Episcopal Diocese highly unusual: She is a 
transsexual. She still hopes for formal acceptance by the diocese as a sister. 
</P>
<P>
 The sex change brought notoriety earlier in her life. As a man, she served in 
the Navy as Chief Petty Officer Michael Clark. After the sex change operation 
in 1975, she enlisted in the Army Reserve as Sgt. 1st Class Joanna M. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 When the surgery was discovered, she was dishonorably discharged. In 1982, 
however, she won $25,000 and an honorable discharge in a legal settlement of a 
lawsuit she filed against the Army in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary, 55, said she launched the computer information service in 1990 
after a trip to rural Missouri, where she saw those with AIDS who were 
geographically isolated. They were unable to talk about their disease on the 
telephone for fear that they would be overheard on party lines and ostracized 
in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what God wanted me to do," she said about her work in creating an 
AIDS information network. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay the $20,000 a year to maintain her computer service without charging 
any user fees, she accepts contributions and takes part-time jobs as a computer 
consultant. The mobile home where she lives and works belongs to her parents 
and she observes a vow of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 She is determined to keep her service free, because people with AIDS who need 
the information are often financially devastated by medical bills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sister Mary makes her databank available to the 100 other electronic 
bulletin boards in the AEGIS system, she said many people dial into her system 
directly because it contains more extensive research material. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her work on the computer network, she has also lobbied to make 
government information free to the AIDS community. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged that the National Library of Medicine required a hefty fee to access 
its AIDS database, she enlisted the help of Vice President Al Gore, and members 
of her network sent protest letters to Kristine Gebbie, the national AIDS 
policy coordinator. As a result, the medical library in January dropped public 
charges for AIDS files. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary believes her computer bank would not be necessary if the federal 
government did a better job of collecting and disseminating AIDS information. 
Federal agencies that have electronic bulletin boards, she said, have outdated 
and incomplete AIDS data or are technically difficult to access. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has the money and has made a commitment to the information 
highway, but they have not made the same commitment to AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while she finds many rewards in her work, Sister Mary conceded that her 
job carries a depressing burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficult part for me is you get to know the people," she said. "You get 
used to their keystrokes and the personality that comes through. You chat with 
them and then one day they are no longer there. 
</P>
<P>

DISNEYLAND SKYWAY RIDER HURT IN FALL; ACCIDENT: MAN LANDS IN TREE, IS RELEASED 
FROM HOSPITAL AFTER TREATMENT. OVERHEAD RIDE CONTINUES IN SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 30-year-old Highland man suffered minor injuries at Disneyland on Sunday 
when he fell from a Skyway gondola and landed in a tree 20 feet below at the 
Alice in Wonderland ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whom authorities and park officials declined to identify, was 
released after being treated at Western Medical Center-Anaheim, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney spokesman Lindsay Schnebly said the incident occurred about 10:25 a.m. 
when the gondola was approaching the midpoint of a loop between Fantasyland and 
Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
 The door to the gondola swung open and the man fell out, Schnebly said, who 
added the tree apparently cushioned the man's fall and prevented him from 
striking the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnebly said the man was helped from the tree by paramedics before being 
rushed to the hospital a few blocks away, adding that the man was able to talk 
with rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital spokeswoman confirmed that the man suffered only minor injuries. 
"He looked fine to me when he walked out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said the gondola was removed from service for investigation, 
but the Skyway ride carrying visitors from Fantasyland to Tomorrowland remained 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnebly said that park officials were still investigating the accident but 
that there was "no evidence yet" to point to an error by ride operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, anything I said about the door would get into speculation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnebly said the gondola has a two-step locking procedure in which both a 
handle and the lock must be opened from outside to release the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a car door that you could accidentally open or that you could 
unlock by mistake," Schnebly said. "At the end of the ride, the (ride operator) 
opens both the handle and the latch to open the door." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to open the door from inside, Schnebly said, "in theory, you would 
have to reach over." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnebly said all the gondolas are inspected every morning before the 
attraction opens. He said ride operators do not send the gondolas out from the 
station until the doors have been bolted and locked. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, it is entirely up to the ride operator to make sure the 
doors are fastened, and there is no automatic warning device to signal when a 
door has been incorrectly fastened. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the Skyway ride has never had a similar incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Disneyland visitors said they were not aware of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Birgit Klein, a German tourist, said that while the man's fall was 
unfortunate, it would not have dampened her frolicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing too terrible can happen on such a wonderful day," said Klein, 
slurping on a strawberry ice cream in the parking lot.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; PAIN SHARED AT PARENTING SKILLS CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 36-year-old father was looking for answers. His 14-year-old daughter and 
12-year-old son both had attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from a dysfunctional family," he said. "I want to learn better skills 
so I can give something to my kids I didn't have when I was growing up. I feel 
like I may be part of their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other parents gathered last week for a common purpose: Each was 
searching for ways to become a better parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 people attended the first session of the Buena Park Parent Project, 
which is offered through the Police Department in cooperation with Soledad 
Enrichment Action, a program that started in 1972 to offer parenting skills and 
support to families in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park parents expressed concerns, frustrations and pain over the rearing 
of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blamed themselves for problems with their children, some wanted to learn 
how to communicate and some wanted help in keeping their children away from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want help so he doesn't run into worse problems than he has already," 
explained a 29-year-old mother of three boys, whose 12-year-old has been in 
trouble at school. "I've never been to something like this. But I know we need 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The free program consists of a two-hour class once a week for 20 weeks and is 
conducted in both Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Baiz, director of the Parent Project and Buena Park's gang prevention 
adviser, said the program is aimed at parents who have troubled youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers them parenting skills and information about preventing gang 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The program empowers parents to regain control of their children and their 
families, said Brother Modesto Leon, a Catholic priest who founded the program 
after the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old prompted parents to came together to 
see what they could do about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon said that 29 parent groups are meeting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Inez Telles said that for many parents, the program is a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come with negative emotions: guilt, shame, hurt, anger. As they move 
through the program and they put skills into practice, their self-esteem grows 
and there are changes in their children. It makes them feel powerful. It's a 
good feeling when it's yours and you haven't given it away to your children," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said parents learn that they cannot change their children, but that 
they can change themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the child starts to change because they respond to a different person," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents also learn that they are not owners of their children but that 
they are the teachers, the role models and the guides." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WOODBRIDGE YOUTH PLANS GET CITY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has agreed to fund several youth activities sponsored by the 
Woodbridge Village Assn. even though the programs will be open only to 
Woodbridge residents and their invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council made the decision last week after the city attorney concluded 
that Irvine's charter does not prohibit the city from funding programs for 
private groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The association was one of several organizations that applied for grants to 
provide after-school activities for teen-agers. The city set aside $85,000 this 
year to improve youth service in an effort to reduce teen violence in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The association sought $4,170 to sponsor a haunted house and several "splash 
nights," in which youths listen to music and hang out at a pool after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Both activities would take place on Woodbridge Village Assn. grounds, and 
village officials said they are prohibited for legal and liability reasons from 
opening such programs up to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge residents can attend the events and invite several guests from 
outside the village, said Robert N. Figeira, executive director of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members expressed wariness at funding programs that are not open 
to the general public. But they agreed that the haunted house and splash nights 
are successful community activities and should be supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael Ward said the splash nights are especially worthy events because 
they give teen-agers a chance to have fun without parents hovering around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner urged other village associations to develop similar 
activities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, known for its picturesque lakes, is one of Irvine's oldest and 
largest villages. It has more than 25,000 residents. Irvine's total population 
is about 110,000. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STUDENTS, PAPERS WIN JOURNALISM AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Student newspapers in Fullerton, Villa Park and Garden Grove were among those 
honored in the 1994 Times Orange County's High School Journalism Awards, 
presented to the county's top young writers, editors, photographers and 
cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Two high schools shared this year's first-place, $1,000 prize for the best 
publication bigger than four pages: Orange's Villa Park High School Oracle and 
Fullerton's Troy High School newspaper, also called the Oracle. The money will 
be used for each school's journalism program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Villa Park newspaper used "clean design and 16 pages to offer a 
comprehensive and well-planned package of campus and related news, such as 
school board actions," the contest judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy High's newspaper was recognized for tackling tough subjects, including a 
cover story on anti-Semitism, that offered "insight and perspective," the 
judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago High School in Garden Grove won for the best publication up to four 
pages long and received a $1,000 award. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges said the school's New Cavalier newspaper combined "just the right blend 
of news, features, shorts and commentary" and "feels larger than its four 
pages." 
</P>
<P>
 The other winners are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Fillmore of Fullerton Union High School, who won a $250 prize for the 
top news story for writing about a student demonstration and rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lian Jue, also from Fullerton Union High School, who won a $250 prize for 
feature writing for her portrait of a student with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jasmine Shoukry of Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, who won a $250 
prize for best sports story for a story about wrestlers keeping healthy diets 
and maintaining their weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steve Tursi of San Clemente High School, who won a $250 prize for best 
feature photo for a shot of a water polo match. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laura Green of Corona del Mar High School, who won a $250 prize in the 
cartoon/illustration division for her graphic illustration of the agony 
experienced in child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joyce Matsumoto of Troy High School, who won $250 prize for an editorial on 
the effect of library budget cuts. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 14 WIN NATIONAL MERIT SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen Orange County residents are among 88 Californians and 1,100 students 
nationwide who have won corporate-sponsored scholarships, the National Merit 
Scholarship Corp. (NMSC) has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were chosen because they have qualifications of particular 
interest to the companies awarding the prizes, or because they have a personal 
connection to the sponsoring group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County scholarship winners are: Hsuan L. Hsu and Siddartha 
Padmanabha, Anaheim residents who attend Troy High in Fullerton; William C. 
Jones of Brea, a student at Brea-Olinda High; Fullerton residents John D. 
Hendershot of Brethren Christian Jr.-Sr. High in Cypress, Edward Y. Kim of 
Sunny Hills High in Fullerton and Oscar C. Yuan of Gretchen Whitney High in 
Cerritos; Spencer T. Cooley of Garden Grove, who attends Pacifica High in 
Garden Grove; Irvine residents David S. Choi of Irvine High and Alexander N. 
Keh and Lee A. Kenyon, both of University High in Irvine; Megan Baldwin, a 
Laguna Beach resident who attends Anderson High in Cincinnati, Ohio; Laguna 
Hills resident Genevieve S. Go of Laguna Hills High; Jill M. Van Velzer of Lake 
Forest, a student at El Toro High, and Roger S. Chang, a Foothill High student 
who lives in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.1 million students in more than 19,000 high schools entered the 1994 
scholarship competition by taking the Pre-Scholastic Aptitude Tests in 1992. 
About 14,000 of those students were chosen as finalists based on principal 
recommendations, academic achievement and extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these corporate-sponsored scholarships, the NMSC will announce 
2,000 winners of National Merit Scholarships, worth $2,000 each, at the end of 
the month. In May, NMSC will announce 3,600 winners of college-sponsored 
scholarships.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARK'S FATE MAY BE PUT ON FALL BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider putting the fate of undeveloped 
Bartlett Park on the fall ballot so that voters can decide whether it should be 
partially converted into a commercially operated, nine-hole golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The little-known city park is at Beach Boulevard and Adams Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council approved the concept of a public-private partnership in 
developing the 30-acre park site. 
</P>
<P>
 The undeveloped park land is situated behind the Newland Shopping Center and 
Newland House Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 City Community Services Director Ron Hagan said a proposed golf concessionaire 
already has spent considerable money on design and environmental studies for 
developing the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before spending more money, the concessionaire now "would like to know if the 
people of Huntington Beach support the proposed development of Bartlett Park," 
Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 A voter-approved initiative in 1990, called Measure C, requires the city to 
conduct a citywide vote whenever any public park or beach area is proposed for 
new development costing more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative was passed in a voter revolt against City Council proposals in 
1990 to put more commercial buildings on the beach and to develop part of 
Central Park into a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan, in a recent memo to the council, said that putting the Bartlett Park 
issue on the general election ballot in November would cost the city about 
$10,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He said if the city delays and has to call a special election on the subject, 
the cost would balloon to $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council puts Bartlett Park on the fall ballot, it will be the first 
Measure C referendum since the initiative was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planning Commissioner Debbie Cook, who was a leader in the drive to pass 
Measure C, said in a recent interview that she believes it is proper that 
voters citywide decide the future of Bartlett Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's up to the people to decide," Cook said. "As for my personal 
opinion, I personally feel very strongly about preserving undeveloped park 
land. I like Bartlett Park the way it is, although it might be OK to plant some 
more trees and things like that." BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; STRIKE THREAT SPURS SCHOOL, UNION TALKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Unified School District administrative officials will meet with 
classified union representatives today in a final effort to avert a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Employees Assn., Chapter 67, has authorized the union to 
stage a sickout or a strike if a controversial school board-imposed contract 
cannot be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The union represents the district's 1,160 non-teaching employees, including 
bus drivers and food service and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not disclose the meeting's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But union representatives are eager to discuss the contract, which reduces 
health benefits, imposes furloughs and empowers the district to lay off union 
members without negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have argued they imposed the March contract, which will save the 
district $484,000, to keep the cash-strapped district solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting today is seen as positive by union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is a good sign, but we are in a guarded mode," said union 
President Becky Mayers. "We've done several things to show we want to handle 
this without a strike if possible. However, we will not back down from one if 
it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials, however, stress that the meeting does not mean they 
will renegotiate the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not renegotiating the contract, absolutely not," said board member 
Bill Lewis, who discussed the prospect of a CSEA strike in closed session with 
six other board members Thursday night. "I think everyone's interest is to keep 
the lines of communication open." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the district agreed to the meeting, the union called off lunchtime 
protesters who have been picketing the district headquarters for nearly a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the union dropped a plea for court intervention, the union still has 
complaints against the district pending with the state Public Employment 
Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints accuse the district of bad faith bargaining during the 11 
months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has denied the charges. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; LIBRARY FOUNDATION GUIDELINES APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite some misgivings expressed by city staff, the City Council has approved 
guidelines for the Mission Viejo Library Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 First proposed about a year ago, the agreement, passed on a 3-2 vote, 
establishes the foundation as an entity separate from the city government, and 
gives it $5,000 in seed money to continue fund-raising activities for a 
proposed library. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members wanted more time to refine the agreement, saying the city 
needed to distance itself from the foundation for liability reasons, yet still 
retain some control over fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also disagreed about whether the goals set for stocking and 
operating the library were too unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the library would have 180,000 books and be open 60 hours 
per week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that many books could cost as much as $3 million and "we 
don't even have funding sources yet to be able to establish any service 
levels," such as hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But a council majority felt the agreement simply set goals without committing 
the city to a specific level of service. 
</P>
<P>
 After working on the pact for about a year, it was time to establish the 
foundation as a separate entity, council supporters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear colleagues and staff with legitimate concerns, but let's get this 
going," Mayor Susan Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen William S. Craycraft and Joseph D. Lowe voted against the pact. 
Craycraft said he agreed with city staff's reservations, while Lowe didn't 
favor going ahead with the pact until the library had developed definite 
sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation chairwoman Sherri Butterfield opposed a delay in signing the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like a prenuptial agreement with the complexity of the financial 
arrangements," Butterfield said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; FAMILY TIES STRONG IN BUS-DRIVING CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the daughter of former Brea Police Capt. Larry Baker, Dawn Baker knew 
growing up in Yorba Linda that her behavior would be held to a high standard. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was her mother's occupation that made it nearly impossible for her to 
even jaywalk without word getting back to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Baker, a school bus driver for the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District, said her colleagues often reported back to her about her 
children's doings around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dawn had no place to get into trouble," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the cops didn't see you, the bus drivers would," Dawn Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Dawn Baker, 23, is doing the observing, having followed in her 
mother's tire tracks with a job as a school bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Baker began driving a school bus 18 years ago, the same year Dawn 
started kindergarten in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dawn grew up in the bus yard, riding on these buses with many of these 
drivers," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping tabs on her daughter was easy then. And now that Dawn logs her daily 
goings-on into a computer at the depot, Beverly still knows what her daughter 
is up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind the wheel of their respective yellow buses, the two women share 
a strong resemblance, with the same hair color, the same smile and a similar 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bakers are one of four family units who have multiple members in the 
bus-driver corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are: sisters Renee Wallace and Sandra Minter; Martin and Sandra 
Zepeda, husband and wife; and Patricia Jarnigan, mother of Carrie Jarnigan and 
Christy Havlu. 
</P>
<P>
 The family ties help create a family atmosphere among drivers, said Charles 
Bednar, supervisor of pupil transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job requires a lot of cooperation among drivers, and having family units 
helps foster that," Bednar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and other relatives can also help new drivers learn the unwritten lore 
that governs bus drivers, from how to deal with a reluctant kindergartner on 
the first day of school to detecting spitballs without looking away from the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Baker said watching her mother drive a bus for 18 years made it easier to 
learn the job and gave her the confidence to take on responsibility for 84 
young passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My driver trainer said she couldn't believe how quickly I picked up on the 
skills," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was from watching my mom, the way she handled the bus. I have strong 
memories of her turning that steering wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Beverly drives middle school students, Dawn ferries around 
elementary and high schoolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like middle school students, because they are old enough to know what they 
should and shouldn't do but they aren't these macho high schoolers," Beverly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn, however, prefers her passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little guys are more vulnerable to taking orders, they don't talk back 
yet," Dawn said. "And the high school students just want to get to school or 
get home." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE RESTRICTIONS ON CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community activists who have been urging the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified 
School District to reinstate a chapter of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de 
Aztlan (MEChA) at Esperanza High School have expanded their demands to having 
the club at all three of the district's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, the Board of Trustees unanimously upheld the district's 
current closed-forum policy, which prohibits all clubs except those that are 
directly related to the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has said MEChA does not qualify under those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was adopted in 1989 after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that required 
schools to either grant club status to all student organizations or allow only 
those tied to the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they chose the latter, called a closed forum, in an 
effort to head off neo-Nazi and other controversial groups from forming on 
campuses. All clubs not related to the curriculum, including MEChA, were then 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Zuniga, a counselor and MEChA adviser at Fullerton College, said the 
board should change its policy to allow MEChA, because the organization offers 
Latino students a group with which they can identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "All four of my daughters graduated from Esperanza, and all belonged to MEChA 
when it was there," Zuniga said. "It is difficult hearing MEChA compared to 
Nazism when my children went through that program. MEChA is something so 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Lopez, whose daughter, Grace, initiated the effort to form MEChA at 
Esperanza, said the district should listen to what students want when setting 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as a community, need to listen to students when they say they want to be 
involved in something," Lopez said. "They don't want to be a part of sports; 
they want to look for their own identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Several trustees said the issue isn't whether MEChA is good for students, but 
rather what could happen if the district adopted an open-forum approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue as a board member is not should we have MEChA, but should we have 
all clubs" that could form if the policy was changed, said trustee Craig Olson.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 3 STUDENTS EXPELLED FOR BRINGING KNIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees has expelled three 
students for bringing knives on campuses, bringing the total number of 
expulsions since last May to 15, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided on the expulsions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 One student was expelled for carrying a 7 1/2-inch knife with a three-inch 
blade, said Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak. 
</P>
<P>
 A second student was expelled for bringing a Swiss army knife with a 2 
1/2-inch blade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third student was also expelled for bringing a Swiss army knife, Sedlak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the boy is in elementary school, trustees suspended the action, 
which will allow him to attend another school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials would not release additional information about the 
incidents to protect the confidentiality of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has a zero-tolerance policy that requires expulsion of any 
student who brings any type of weapon, including guns, knives or other 
dangerous objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak said the increasing number of expulsions is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there have been few incidents where anyone's been threatened," Sedlak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's poor judgment," he added, in explaining why he believes students are 
carrying knives to school. "And you have to look at each incident 
individually." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said in the three most recent expulsions, the knives were 
not used in a threatening manner toward students or staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedlak has also been a critic of trustees conducting the expulsion hearings. 
He believes that a panel made up of school principals should preside over the 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having the long hearings is taking away from running the business of the 
board," he added, noting that Thursday's closed-session hearings lasted two 
hours. "I believe they've taken up too much of our time."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STUDENTS PROPOSE QUAKE SAFETY IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at an intermediate school have proposed some interesting solutions to 
reduce the risk of damage during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 They include building homes atop giant springs, shaping houses like pyramids 
and making buildings of rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Carr Intermediate School offered their ideas as part of a 
earthquake safety contest sponsored by the city's Planning and Building Agency, 
said building inspector Doug Fredericksen, who helped coordinate the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 students participated and created drawings and scale models out of 
wood and paper for their task. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday at the school, 28 received awards for their designs during a brief 
ceremony in the campus auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of smart," said Lucy Mattizima, 13, after winning one of the 
first-place awards. 
</P>
<P>
 She showed off her design, which called for a home to be constructed with a 
steel-reinforced frame, a cushioned foundation and a special closet stocked 
with emergency supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earthquake, "it will bounce a bit, but it won't fall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house also would include fire detectors, an idea she got after a recent 
quake knocked over a candle in her home and started a small fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilia Rodriguez, 14, made an elaborate scale model out of paper, Popsicle 
sticks and metal springs to show her idea for a home built on top of special 
shock absorbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest taught her a lot about earthquake preparedness and might inspire 
the students to design real quake-resistant homes in the future, Lilia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I liked best about the contest was I got to build a house," she said. "I 
never built a house before. I feel really proud of it." JON NALICK

MAN, 26, KILLED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AS HE LEAVES PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified 26-year-old man was fatally wounded Sunday in a drive-by 
shooting as he left a house party given by relatives, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, struck by several bullets, was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center, 
Police Sgt. Don Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's name was not released Sunday night because police were still 
trying to notify his immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 1:51 a.m. as the man left a home in the 1400 block of 
West Cubbon Street. An unknown number of assailants drove past the residence 
and fired three shots, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police gang detail is investigating.

SCHOOL SWEETENS BID FOR AREA ANNEXATION BY YORBA LINDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of an Anaheim neighborhood near Esperanza High School are planning 
to present a petition with about 200 signatures to the Yorba Linda City Council 
on Tuesday, asking the city to annex their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past attempts by unincorporated communities to be included inside city 
boundaries, this effort contains a key ingredient that gives it a strong chance 
of being accepted by the city: a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda City Councilman John M. Gullixson suggested the annexation last 
summer after failing to persuade school officials to build a high school in the 
city, a primary goal during his 3 1/2 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson wants Esperanza, which is on Kellogg Drive in a pocket of Anaheim 
that juts into Yorba Linda, not for educational reasons but for its ball 
fields, gymnasium and other recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yorba Linda gets low priority for use of those facilities," Gullixson said 
when he discussed the idea with the council last August. If the city were to 
annex the area, "we would get a higher priority." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has received support from Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, but Anaheim 
Councilman Bob D. Simpson strongly opposes the idea of relinquishing Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine why we would release Esperanza," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the majority of residents in the proposed annexation area support the 
idea, Simpson said, he would not be in favor because the school is a citywide 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should not be decided by just residents in that area," he said. "The 
school is a regional facility, and the entire community should have a say." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Yorba Linda and Anaheim would have to agree to the annexation. But first 
a majority of residents must support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Warman, who lives on Cresthill Drive and has been leading the petition 
effort, said nearly every resident supports the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have at least 200 signatures, which represents nearly every home in the 
affected area," Warman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will benefit from increased property values if the area is annexed 
to Yorba Linda, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were looking at houses, those in Yorba Linda cost more than those in 
Anaheim," Warman said. "Property values will definitely go up with a Yorba 
Linda address." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Davis, sales manager with Coldwell Banker in Yorba Linda, said that having 
a Yorba Linda address would increase the value of the houses by 5% to 7%.

WILDERNESS PARK IDEAS DISCUSSED AT WORKSHOP; RECREATION: SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO 
USE THE LAGUNA CANYON ACREAGE RANGE FROM WHERE TO PUT ENTRANCES TO 
CONFIGURATIONS FOR TRAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of about 60 residents concluded a three-day workshop Sunday after 
trading suggestions on how to develop the Laguna Canyon Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the issues discussed was the location of park entrances and the 
configuration of hiking, biking and equestrian trails.Putting an art museum or 
art school at the northern end of the park also was suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's ideas will become part of a park plan to be put together by 
landscape engineers hired by Orange County to develop the vast unspoiled 
acreage, which reaches from the San Diego Freeway to Crystal Cove and from 
Bonita Canyon Road to Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a very positive way to do it," said Laguna Beach Mayor Ann 
Cristoph, one of the workshop participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristoph said the process, which involves representatives of a cross section 
of community interests, is designed to give the public a role in the park's 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects for the park will review the group's recommendations to determine 
if there is agreement on how to deal with development issues. On issues with no 
consensus, the architects will make proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step will be meetings in May and June to review the architects' 
response to the recommendations, Cristoph said.

CHAMBER IN TUSTIN ELECTS NEW OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local lawyer was elected president of the Tustin Chamber of Commerce last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Gorham, 64, will also serve as head of the executive committee, the 
chamber's policy-making body.His one-year term will begin July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Polston of the Tustin Boys and Girls Club was elected vice president, Al 
Shifberg-Mencher of Shifberg-Mencher Associates, was chosen as chief financial 
officer, and Jim Kane of Saddleback Chapel was elected secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive committee includes Paul Irby, the outgoing president. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorham, who moved his law practice from Irvine in 1984, said that the Chamber 
of Commerce must help retain businesses in the city by improving further an 
already "fine business climate." 
</P>
<P>
 One example is the business expo that the Chamber of Commerce is sponsoring 
April 28 at the Tustin Boys and Girls Club, in which local businesses can 
display their products and services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorham said he thinks the local economy is slowly coming out of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Thomas P. Brennan said three directors also were appointed 
to one-year terms on the board. They were Jerry Adams of I.D. Investments, Lou 
Bone of X.L. Lock Inc. and Asta Gasper of Home Savings of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said nine of the 13 members of the board are elected to three-year 
terms and three are appointed to one-year terms. The outgoing president 
completes the board membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The new officers will be installed June 25 at the Revere House Restaurant in 
Tustin.

SANTA ANA TRUSTEES DELAY CURRICULUM DECISION

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Education has postponed a decision on whether to designate two 
new campuses as fundamental schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing board of the Santa Ana Unified School District agreed last week 
to wait until after May 4 to consider what kind of curriculum to implement at 
Martin Luther King Jr.Elementary School and Raymond A. Villa Intermediate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees said they wanted to wait until after a parents advisory committee 
makes its recommendations on fundamental education districtwide, district 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. Fundamental schools often provide special 
programs in specific areas and also stress parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to find out what the community is looking for and use that 
(information) to design the new schools," Thomas said. "This is really building 
schools from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents advisory committee meeting will be at 7 p.m. May 4 at MacArthur 
Fundamental Intermediate School, 600 W. Alton Ave. The meeting will be open to 
the public.

A NEW FAMILY BIBLE; WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND WHEN MEMBERS OF A BLACK 
FAMILY 'PASS' FOR WHITE? A DAUGHTER REVEALS THE PAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a simple infinitive -- to be -- she was. 
</P>
<P>
 For three-quarters of a century, Grace Morris Cramer lived her quiet, Spartan 
life as a white woman. Her younger sister, Margaret Morris Taylor, cut off from 
most of the Morris clan, lived as black, worlds apart, haunted by their ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of these two sisters, their torn family and the geography of pain 
separating them is at the center of Shirlee Taylor Haizlip's book, "The Sweeter 
the Juice." Ostensibly a family biography, Haizlip's slim volume also examines 
the facile labels of race and identity, while exploring the varying degrees of 
privilege. (Haizlip is Margaret's daughter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Passing is a term out of an antique void. It renders the notion of "color" a 
state of mind. With a slight change of a last name, a new address, a "new 
race," some black families splintered in two or three like a branch inflicted 
with dry rot. The most complex challenge: making sure no clues were left on the 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Margaret Morris, it meant, without warning, that she was 
unceremoniously relieved of her history. No family Bibles or albums filled to 
spilling with stoic portraits of her forebears. No grandmother's hug or 
grandfather's knee.  
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C., family unraveled in 1916 when Margaret's mother died and 
her father and five older siblings scattered to live as whites. Four-year-old 
Margaret, quite fair-skinned herself, was sent to live with a cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, became what she believed herself to be: a "colored" woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, Shirlee Haizlip's sunny Hollywood living room is shot through with 
photos -- six generations of them. Portraits of the family -- immediate as well 
as extended, both black and white -- reconstructed through a bridge she built 
through time. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Morris Taylor sits beneath a wall of windows, surrounded by the faces 
that in life had eluded her. Taylor, who has been accompanying her daughter on 
the book tour, touches on just a small portion of her arduous journey; her 
reluctance to reach out to the family that had abandoned her as a child: "I 
wasn't going to try again," she says. "They had already rejected me two times. 
I couldn't do it again. So Shirlee said she would. . . ." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What was your emotional state while revisiting the sources of your 
mother's pain? 
</P>
<P>
 Haizlip: I'd heard my mother's story since I was a child, so I think probably 
the emotionalism was gone . . . . It was just a fact of life. . . . So it was 
an intellectual exercise to find the answers to this puzzle.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: At what point did you decide to turn this search for your mother's only 
surviving sister into a book? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I didn't know it was going to be a book. I was doing a personal "This Is 
Your Life" kind of manuscript for my mother's 80th birthday. Then I saw the 
drama of all the things that had happened to her. I thought, "This could be a 
book."  
</P>
<P>
 I was reading some of the things that I had written at her birthday party and 
even the waitresses were responding. . . . I have a friend who is an agent, 
Faith Childs, and I told her I had an idea. . . . The proposal (was) basically 
what I had already written, just spruced up a little and I sent it to her.  
</P>
<P>
 She took it to 10 publishers. And the only one who didn't offer was Disney 
Books . Q: For what is often an emotionally fraught topic, to what do you 
attribute the wide interest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The climate. The mass consciousness. Five years ago, a story like this 
couldn't be published. This whole thing about multiculturalism . And diversity 
statistics have shown that America is getting more and more brown. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the year 1995, 58% of the world's women will be Asian. And the 
fastest-growing group of children in this country are children of mixed race. . 
. . So the browning of America is inevitable. Corporations have known it, 
schools know it. And I think it's just getting out there in the consciousness . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how open or forward-thinking one believes he or she is, what 
Haizlip contends is sure to raise eyebrows, if not ire, in some quarters. In 
others, she hopes it mines long-buried issues at the core of race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Americans," Haizlip writes, "are not who they think they are; hundreds 
of thousands of white people in America are not 'white.' . . . If a new 
sociological method of determining race were devised, equal numbers of black 
people might no longer be black. What happened in my family and many others 
like it calls into question the concept of color as a means of 
self-definition." 
</P>
<P>
 When he lost his young wife, Rose, to cancer, Haizlip's grandfather, William 
Morris Sr. (whom Haizlip describes as being of Irish and mulatto descent) took 
the first step over the line. Figuratively shedding his skin, he hoped to find 
better fortune as a "white" man. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Morris children were soon to follow. One by one, the siblings sampled 
life on the other side, breaking ties with the youngest, Margaret and Michael. 
Only those family members who could pass for white could enter their carefully 
tended world, the rest were disappeared from the conversation, erased, as best 
they could be, from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret weathered the abrupt abandonment and the subsequent family rebuffs to 
"those black genes." She survived her "own personal middle passage," Haizlip 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret eventually married Julian Taylor, a preacher, and they raised four 
children while he ministered to congregations on the East Coast. He provided a 
wealth of love and benevolence, Haizlip says. "(My father) was a very strong 
family man and it was the strength of him that's wrapped around her." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the book's reception has most surprised you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I thought it would touch a lot of chords, and it has, but it has gone 
beyond race. Chords about abandonment . . . the reunification of family . . . 
class issues, women's issues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A woman wrote to me saying she just found out that she was Jewish and how 
angry she was with her mother for keeping her heritage from her. . . . White 
people are phoning me . . . and they start the conversations like this: " I'm 
white . . . I think. " I think! It's a new day in America, when a white person 
says that.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you concerned that some people might misread your intent as an 
obsession about white blood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Early on, I do the disclaimer that I'm not lusting after my whiteness. 
There was nothing better in my life than being black. That's all I knew. . . If 
you look at the amount of space given to the white family as compared to the 
black family, it's the same. OK, you say, but finding the white relatives is 
the dramatic arc of the story . That's true, but I say, just being black in 
America is drama enough. And for a black family to have survived so well, that 
is high drama.  
</P>
<P>
 What amazes me is that no negative response has been articulated . . . because 
this is not an issue that all black people are thrilled about . . . . What 
happens is that people get so engrossed in the search for family that it 
transcends race. And I make the point that we are looking for family that 
happen to be white, that we didn't need that whiteness to validate us. And that 
issue touches people. It melts away . . . any possible hostility.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tracing an elusive trail -- with the help of census tracts, random phone calls 
and even a private detective -- she finally struck gold, locating Grace in, of 
all places, Anaheim. "How appropriate, I thought," Haizlip writes, "that she 
should be located near Disneyland, the world of make-believe." 
</P>
<P>
 How this frail woman, now near 90, and the families who had been living as 
white would respond was impossible to predict. "Should I," Haizlip wondered, 
"visit their parents' sins upon them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did the white half of your family react when you informed them that you 
were writing a book, that the "secret" would be made public? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I didn't tell them all . . . because I didn't want a lot of "Well, what are 
you going to say?" . . . But before the book came out, I put together a very 
thoughtful memorandum that said I had been working on a book and what it was 
going to be about. I said . . . some of it may be painful, but I hoped that 
some of it may be helpful.  
</P>
<P>
 So far their response has been very positive . . . . Some parts I think have 
been more difficult. The difficult parts have mostly to do with people who are 
dead, so I think that is easier.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: But how are those "white" relatives adjusting to being "black"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One (who) was pretty removed from it found it pretty exciting . . . because 
she has a young person's view of multiculturalism. . . . She had been working 
as an au pair in San Diego, so when she told (the couple) how excited she was , 
the man said to her, "Oh, now you're a nigger." This is a woman who grew up 
believing she was white. There was no reason to think otherwise. . . . I asked 
her how she was dealing with that, and she said that she's still processing it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 I like to say that the book deals with two American themes: The American 
nightmare -- the white person waking up and finding that they are black -- and 
the American fantasy -- black people wondering what it is like to walk around 
with white skin.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You write: "My color . . . had allowed me to sit on top of and look over 
both sides of a high wall that separates the black and the white experience. . 
. ." What have you learned from that vantage point? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It has allowed me to learn how pervasive racism is in America. And it 
reinforces my personal need and drive to bring up the subject of privilege that 
white skin has brought and the privilege taken away from black people wherever 
I can , in ways that are not confrontational, but provocative. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 None of us are pure anymore and we never were. . . . We cannot be whole people 
unless we recognize all parts of ourselves . . . . Know it and be willing to 
open ourselves up to those parts that we don't know about. If black people can 
do that and white people can do that, we can get together -- that old-fashioned 
concept of brotherhood deals with a genetic reality , not a philosophical 
argument.

HATS OFF TO TEENS WITH BARE NOGGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA T. ROESSNER, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've got hat trouble in our house. Baseball hat trouble mostly, although the 
skull cap -- a red wool thing pulled tight on the crown and down on the 
forehead -- has recently reared its ugly pinhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, we think they should remove the blasted things now and again, if 
only to let their scalps breathe. They think we're trying to suffocate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the generation gap of the '90s. Once, parents and children argued 
about Vietnam, racism and sex. Today we argue with our kids about hats. Hats . 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sign of the times: Things are so horrific out there that we've seized 
on the most mundane, the most superficial, the least threatening of issues. 
Hats. It's a lot easier to debate when and where to keep the lids on than to 
muster a substantive dialogue about the deleterious effects of Mortal Kombat 
and misogynist rap lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The hat thing is essentially a teen-ager thing, which means it's first and 
foremost a control thing. We parents aren't the only ones locked in this least 
heady of contests. High school administrators are currently engaged in varying 
degrees of authoritarian crackdowns on hats in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 I am highly skeptical that a small swatch of cloth on the noggin can somehow 
impede reading comprehension or algebraic problem-solving. But I do understand 
how irritating, how galling, how intrusive those eye-concealing visors can be 
to the sensibilities of the authorities.  
</P>
<P>
 It may be difficult for the uninitiated, but you have to try to imagine what 
it's like to sit across the dining room table from nearly grown, supposedly 
intelligent people who do not speak, who consider a muffled grunt loquacious, 
who stare blankly, vaguely, in your general direction when you cheerily ask 
them how their day went. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to imagine what it's like to put a hat on such a beast, and thus be 
deprived of even the blank stare.  
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder, then, that we, their keepers, although we certainly know 
better, are quickly overcome with primal rage. It's no wonder that we find 
ourselves screeching: "Hats off! Hats off!"  
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, there have been times when I've taken the kids' side on the great 
hat issue. My father, for example, seems to find a baseball cap in his presence 
to be a grave offense against Western civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the fashion," I tell him, shrugging with indifference.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, the characters may have shifted, but the roles aren't much changed after 
all, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 And I guess I shouldn't be so surprised when, on frosty mornings when a bit of 
head-covering might actually serve some constructive, healthful purpose, 
suddenly, defiantly, the hats come off.

FLOYD ALL WET; TREVINO CLEANS UP; GOLF: WATER HAZARDS ON THE 15TH AND 17TH 
HOLES PROVE DECISIVE IN THE PGA SENIORS' CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Raymond Floyd's hopes of winning a second consecutive major seniors event 
found a watery grave Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the treacherous last nine holes remaining in the PGA Seniors' 
Championship, the senior tour leader in nearly every category was at 12 under 
and led by four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it did to every other leader in the first three days, the Champion 
course at PGA National Resort knocked him out, and Lee Trevino won his second 
championship here in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three shots into the drink cost Floyd six shots on the par threes, 15 and 17, 
and the winner of The Tradition two weeks ago finished tied for third. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, with a careful bogey on the final hole, had a final round 70 and a 
279 total, nine under. He beat Jim Colbert by a stroke, but it wasn't really 
that close. 
</P>
<P>
 With a birdie on 18, Colbert had a 67 and 280. But Trevino would have had to 
four-putt from 50 feet to put Colbert in a playoff. Water, not the greens, 
caused the problems in this weird tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton, who trailed by three shots after three rounds, hit one in the 
water on the 171-yard fifth hole to end his chances. He finished with a 72 and 
282, tying Floyd, who had a 75 -- 42 strokes on the back nine. Four hot 
golfers, Isao Aoki (66), Chi Chi Rodriguez (69), DeWitt Weaver (68) and Dale 
Douglass (72), were at 283. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffers expect an occasional quadruple bogey -- it's part of the game. But it 
comes as a shock to the stars of the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton took a quadruple bogey on the 16th by hitting two five-iron shots 
into the water Friday. And Floyd went from one shot in front to three shots 
behind when he hit two shots into the water on the 164-yard 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock and I still am," said Trevino, who was paired with Floyd. "It 
just isn't like Raymond. I had no idea of winning this tournament when we made 
the turn and Raymond was leading by four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to have hope when a couple of birdies helped me pull within a shot 
going to the 15th. Still, I felt that I needed at least a couple of birdies on 
tough holes to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe that I parred the 15th and found myself with a three-shot 
lead? I couldn't believe it. Nobody, except Jack Nicklaus, ever managed a 
course better than Raymond does. Mentally, there's no way he blows this 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The wind, a factor the first three days, was not an issue in the final round. 
It came up a bit when the leaders were heading home, but Floyd felt one inch 
was the decisive element in his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I count this as a learning experience," he said, "only I would have preferred 
a less costly lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last 10 or 15 years, on the occasions when I have had problems with 
pressure I have had a tendency to hit everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start today I was having the same trouble, but it didn't hurt me 
until the 15th when I hit a five-iron right into the water. Then from the drop 
area I had a six-iron right into the water. On 17, I hit a seven-iron right 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always before I thought the problem was coming through too fast. But when I 
hit a nine-iron for my third shot, I discovered the real problem. I had moved 
too close to the ball. I am tall, I have long-handled clubs and I have an 
upright swing. And I only moved an inch too close, but it sure caused a whole 
lot of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons why I never made adjustments was that I didn't feel 
uncomfortable standing over the ball. It just kept going a little right. 
Hopefully, I will be able to use this lesson next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he joined the seniors in 1990, Trevino, except when he was sidelined 
because of thumb surgery early in 1993, has dominated. He has now won two PGAs, 
the U.S. Senior Open and The Tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Most players trailing Floyd by four shots might have given up. Trevino never 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the back nine with a birdie on 10 when he hit a wedge to within one 
foot of the pin. After Floyd bogeyed 11, Trevino birdied 13 and suddenly he was 
in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "My caddie said, 'It's a game now,' " Trevino said. "Darned if he wasn't 
right. But I'm still in shock." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The hot, humid weather took its toll on Freddie Haas, 78. He made the cut by 
shooting below his age in the first two rounds, but finished 83-81 and his 317 
was the highest score. . . . There were 57 club professionals in the field of 
135. Low among them was Gene Borek of White Plains, N.Y., who tied for 15th at 
290. . . . By winning $115,000, Trevino, trying to top $1 million for the third 
time in four years, increased his earnings to $381, 017. Beginning with the Las 
Vegas tournament April 29-May 1, he will play 10 consecutive events. "I'm 
having fun this year," he said. . . . Jack Nicklaus, unable to get his putter 
going, finished ninth, shooting a 72 Sunday for 286.

LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX; UNSER JR. IS A WINNING TEAM PLAYER; AUTO RACING: AFTER 
MATES TRACY AND FITTIPALDI RUN INTO TROUBLE, HE TAKES OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-car racing teams have rarely proved successful in the past, but the 
wisdom of Roger Penske in adding Al Unser Jr. to his already potent Indy car 
pair of Emerson Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy paid big dividends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After pole-sitter Tracy spun out while leading and then Fittipaldi lost power 
while leading, Unser took the third red and white Marlboro Penske-Ilmor to an 
easy victory in the 20th Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. It was Unser's fifth 
victory in Long Beach, but his first for Penske. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser won four years in a row, from 1988 to '91. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris Pook changed the track on me after '91 and it took me several years to 
figure out the new configuration," Unser said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell, hampered by a blown tire in mid-race, finished second and local 
favorite Robby Gordon of Orange was third -- the only drivers on the same lap 
with Unser at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 84,000 watched the rather uneventful race under cool, cloudy 
conditions. The three-day attendance of 204,500 was the largest in race 
history, largely because of the record 46,500 on hand Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For 105 laps around the 1.59-mile circuit along the shoreline streets of Long 
Beach, Penske cars led all but two laps. Gordon had his Valvoline Lola-Ford 
Cosworth in front briefly when Unser was pitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uncle Bobby and my dad (four-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser) both drove for 
Roger Penske and both of them told me if I ever got the chance to drive for 
him, to take it," Al Jr. said. "His teams set the standard for Indy car racing, 
and I'm fortunate to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the going, however, Unser wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw Paul pulling away from me, and Emmo (Fittipaldi) closing in my 
mirrors, I thought, 'Uh, oh, they have better cars than I do,' " Unser said. 
"Then I saw Paul getting loose under braking and I felt better, I knew I had a 
car as good as the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, who set a qualifying record of 108.491 m.p.h. Saturday, led the first 
20 laps before he spun in the first turn and knocked himself and Mike Groff's 
car out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "When downshifting, my car would get hung up in the corners and start 
axle-hopping," Tracy said. "That's what caused the spins." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy dropped six laps while getting his car restarted, but his problem never 
ended. The Canadian driver spun three more times before calling it a day when 
his gearbox gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearbox problems also put Fittipaldi out, but not until he had led 22 laps and 
taken the lead when Unser was assessed a stop-and-go penalty for speeding in 
the pits during his first stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My car was flying," Fittipaldi said. "It was easy driving and I was expecting 
to have my first win at Long Beach. Then I had a problem with fourth gear. Then 
I lost third gear and second and finally fifth. I told Roger (Penske) to tell 
Junior to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Fittipaldi was grounded, and Mansell had fallen back with his flat tire, 
Unser put the Penske in cruise control and breezed home 39 seconds ahead of 
Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell was close to the pace on lap 67 when his right rear tire exploded as 
he was going down the front straightaway, forcing him to make a complete lap on 
a flat and shredded tire before he could pit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big wake-up call when it blew," Mansell said. "It can be pretty 
dicey when you're going 180 to 190 m.p.h. and suddenly you're on three wheels. 
I almost spun, but I caught it, but it was pretty exciting trying to brake the 
rear wheels when I only had one tire." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Mansell never led a lap even though he was running second a good 
deal of the time. He had a logical reason: "You've got to be in front to lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's only problem came when he exceeded the 60-m.p.h. limit in the pits 
during his first stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got so excited when I came in ahead and the crew did such a good job (18.5 
seconds for four tires and fuel) that I forgot I had sequential shifting and 
when I pulled out and hit the accelerator, the car just shot off," Unser said. 
"I knew I was going too quick and I tried to slow down, but the traffic cops 
got me." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario, who is retiring, won the Andretti family race over son Michael, who is 
returning to Indy car racing after a year in Formula One. After running with 
one another most of the race, Mario moved past Michael to finish fifth. Michael 
was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad was able to get by me on a restart (after a yellow caution flag) because 
I was in second gear when I should have been in first," Michael said. "His car 
was better than mine, so he would have passed me anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen of the 30 starters were running at the end of the 1-hour 40-minute 
53-second race as broken transmissions and a number of bumping incidents took 
their toll. Unser averaged 99.283 m.p.h. for the 166.95 mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither driver was hurt, the day's most spectacular crash occurred 
when Mark Smith tangled with Jimmy Vasser and Smith's Lola-Ford was sent 
sailing about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put Unser in a tie with Fittipaldi for the PPG Cup lead with 37 
points each after three races. Fittipaldi finished second at Surfers Paradise, 
Australia, and won last week in Phoenix. Unser was second in Phoenix. Mansell 
is third with 35.

JORDAN LEADING HIS TEAM WITH .304 BATTING AVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan has reached that magic baseball number -- .300. 
</P>
<P>
 The former NBA star extended his hitting streak to five games Sunday night, 
going 2-for-4 to raise his average to .304 in his return to his home state as a 
professional baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has gone 7-for-23 after seven games and is now the leading hitter for 
the Double AA Birmingham Barons. He also picked up his fourth stolen base 
during a 4-3 loss to the Carolina Mudcats. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the day off Saturday night, Jordan was back in the lineup batting 
seventh and playing right field, drawing an overflow crowd of 8,045 to Five 
County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind 0-2 and bouncing weakly to second base his first time at 
bat, Jordan smacked a sharp single to left field in the fourth, and his lazy 
fly to right fell in three innings later. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was picked off after his second single, but showed his athletic ability 
during the rundown as Carolina had to make six throws before getting him 
between first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan popped up to second base to lead off the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Jordan's second multi-hit game. He has all singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan had an uneventful day in the field, his only chance a one-hop single, 
which he fielded cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan last played organized baseball at Laney High in Wilmington, about two 
hours from Zebulon. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd cheered each time Jordan walked to the plate. Carolina's mascot, 
Muddy the Mudcat, had some fun by carrying around a cardboard figure of Orlando 
Magic center Shaquille O'Neil wearing a home uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Jordan took some extra hitting for about 20 minutes in a cage 
behind the stands, shaking off some rust from an all-night, 10-hour bus trip 
from Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 He was surrounded by about 100 children seeking autographs on basketballs as 
well as baseballs. Many of the youngsters wore No. 23 Chicago Bulls jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jordan didn't sign any autographs except for a few Mudcat players 
while he shagged fly balls during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan seemed annoyed at times by the attention before the game, walking to 
the other side of the batting cage to avoid about 40 reporters and 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also danced away from a cameraman and gave him several dirty looks while 
walking to the locker room and kept his distance from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans five deep lined the right-field line behind a short fence, taking photos 
and clapping every time Jordan walked to and from the locker room. But they 
went away disappointed when he didn't sign any autographs and re-emerged to run 
a few sprints and get loose just before the 6:05 p.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another pregame snag -- no Gatorade. A Mudcat batboy was summoned to 
get the thirst quencher and returned with seven different flavors for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan received a citation from Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten before the 
game, and a plane with a streamer welcoming Jordan later flew over the stadium.

LEWIS AND FRIENDS SMASH 800-METER WORLD RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting remains one of the most picturesque in the world for track and 
field, the weather is unfailingly pleasant, and the fans can be counted on to 
provide enthusiasm. But, because the Mt. San Antonio College Relays come so 
early in the outdoor season, the performances on the track do not always match 
their promise. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the case Sunday at Walnut in the 400- and 800-meter relays, which 
provided everything that was boasted beforehand -- even the rare sight of Carl 
Lewis gritting his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushed by a group of cocksure sprinters, who apparently were not overstating 
their capabilities when they dubbed themselves the World All-Stars, Lewis and 
his Santa Monica Track Club teammates ran the fastest time ever in the United 
States in the 400-meter relay, then returned 2 1/2 hours later to run the 
fastest time ever anywhere in the 800-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 In an event Santa Monica has owned in recent years, in large part because no 
one else has the depth of sprinters to even lay claim to it, the team of Mike 
Marsh, Leroy Burrell, Floyd Heard and Lewis bettered its 2-year-old world 
record in the 800-meter relay by almost half a second, completing the two laps 
in 1 minute 18.68 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record was 1:19.11, which the World All-Star team of Jon 
Drummond, Dennis Mitchell, Brian Bridgewater and John Regis also eclipsed with 
a second-place time of 1:19.10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been complaining about not having anyone to run against at the end of 
these relays," Lewis said. "Today, I did." 
</P>
<P>
 He will think twice about complaining in the future because he got too much of 
what he asked for Sunday. Anchoring Santa Monica's 800-meter relay, Lewis was 
hand-timed in a superb 19.4 and lost significant ground to Great Britain's 
Regis, the silver-medalist in the 200 meters in last year's World 
Championships, who was credited with a 19.1, the fastest leg ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Lewis, he had such a comfortable lead when he received the 
baton that Regis did not force him to grit his teeth. That was the task that 
Mitchell, Lewis' opponent on the 400-meter relay anchor leg, had assigned to 
himself earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And just so that Mitchell and the crowd estimated at 10,000 would not be 
disappointed, Lewis looked over his shoulder at his lagging adversary when they 
received their batons and showed him the results of those years in the 
orthodontist's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 He later admitted that he should have kept his mouth closed and his eyes on 
the prize. That one brief moment of showmanship was all Mitchell needed to make 
up the slight advantage that the other three Santa Monica runners -- Marsh, 
Burrell and Heard -- had provided for the world record-holder in the 100 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
 As he and Mitchell approached the finish line, Lewis was gritting his teeth 
for real. But he had one more gear than the 1992 Olympic 100-meter bronze 
medalist, managing to pull ahead in the final two meters and give Santa Monica 
the victory in 37.79 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 That was equal to the eighth-fastest time ever and the fastest in the United 
States. The previous best was the 37.83 in the 1984 Summer Olympics at the 
Coliseum recorded by the U.S. team, which also had Lewis as an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and his World All-Star teammates -- Drummond, Tony Jarrett and Regis 
-- had no reason to be ashamed. Their second-place time of 37.82 was the 
second-fastest time ever run in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the second-fastest time ever by a team that did not win. The 
fastest was run by a British team, including Jarrett and Regis, that finished 
second in last year's World Championships to a U.S. team, including Drummond 
and Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the temperature was cooler than sprinters prefer, the 36th annual 
Mt. SAC meet was dominated by them. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his three appearances Sunday, Marsh, the 1992 Olympic 200-meters 
champion, returned to the track an hour after leading off Santa Monica's sprint 
relay and won the 100 in 10.0 seconds, the world's fastest time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200 meters, Nigeria's Daniel Effiong ran 20.16, and Jeff Williams ran 
20.19, the two fastest times in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Inger Miller was hand-timed in 10.0 as she came from fourth place to lead USC 
to a victory in the women's 400-meter relay, then returned to win the 200 in 
22.73. Her USC teammate, Sau Ying Chan of Hong Kong, won the 100-meter high 
hurdles in 13.14, the world's fastest this year. Amy Acuff set a UCLA outdoor 
high jump record at 6-2, second to Tisha Waller's meet record of 6-5.

BOSTON MARATHON; KENYANS READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD'S BEST AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question was a simple one -- who is going to win today's 98th Boston 
Marathon? -- and the answer went straight to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," said Amby Burfoot, the 1968 winner, "probably somebody from 
Kenya or a Japanese or a Korean." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only safe bet is that there won't be an American man wearing the 
laurel wreath of race champion, despite the protestations of Keith Brantly, 31, 
from Ormond Beach, Fla., and one of the U.S. hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing well," he said. "We finished second and fifth at New York last 
year, and we won the World Championships, albeit with a transplanted American, 
but I'll take it. We did well at Boston last year. We won L.A. this year. What 
else do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a race dominated by foreigners, and today probably won't change that. 
Brantly's transplanted American, Mark Plaatjes, a South African who became a 
U.S. citizen last year, then won in the World Championships in Stuttgart, 
Germany, is not at Boston, piqued because he wasn't offered enough money to 
run. A race in Korea offered more, so he headed west, while Korea sent the 
Olympic gold medal winner, Hwang Young-Jo, 24, to New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang will be fighting a Boston legacy -- a reigning Olympic champion has 
never won here -- and trying to regain his form in his first marathon, and his 
first race of any kind outside Korea, since the Barcelona games. That's because 
of a bone injury in his left foot that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the injury, he had run four marathons, with two firsts and a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is his first Boston trip, Hwang knows where the focal point of 
the race will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot say the Kenyans are not in my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't be difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are defending," Ezikiel Bitok said. "That is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 They are, although he isn't. Bitok, 28, is a cross-country specialist running 
his first marathon. He draws from the leader of the 11-runner Kenyan 
contingent, Cosmas Ndeti. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after last year's race, Ndeti, 24, gave his newly born son, Gideon, 
the middle name, Boston, which in this case meant "victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory is worth $70,000 to the fastest man and woman, and Cosmas Ndeti is 
back to defend his championship, won in 2 hours 9 minutes 33 seconds when he 
ran the second half faster than the first. 
</P>
<P>
 That second half includes the hills of Newton, which tend to determine the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a hero at home, matching the acclaim of Ibrahim Hessein, who won in 
1988, '91 and '92. That gives Kenya four championships in the last six races. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Lelei, 29, and Josphat Ndeti, 23 and the brother of Cosmas, also are 
among the top Kenyan runners. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see if they are chasing Lucketz Swartbooi, of 
Namibia, who set the pace last year in Boston and at the World Championships. 
Ndeti passed Swartbooi, 28, with less than two miles to run in Boston last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started too early," Swartbooi said. "I pushed too hard and I died in the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 That race was run in 70-degree weather, an oven for marathon runners. Today's 
forecast is for 50 degrees, which has the runners excited. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Mexican runners, Andres Espinosa and Arturo Barrios, also figure to 
challenge, hoping to complete a weekend double for their country. Mexico's 
Dionicio Ceron won the London Marathon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa, 31, won the 1993 New York Marathon, outdueling Dartmouth medical 
student Bob Kempainen, 27, who finished second and is probably the best U.S. 
hope in Boston today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's competition, Olga Markova, 24, of Russia, will try to win her 
third in a row. Her toughest competition might come from Kim Jones, 35, of 
Spokane, Wash., who was second last year; Elana Meyer, 27, a South African 
Olympic silver medalist at 10,000 meters who is running her first marathon; Uta 
Pippig, 28, a German who won the 1993 New York marathon, and Valentina 
Yegorova, 30, from Russia and the Olympic gold medalist in the marathon at 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear a lot of stories about Boston," said Colleen de Reuck, 30, of South 
Africa. "Even the top people have bad days and don't do well on that course. It 
all depends on the day."

FAIR OR NOT, THE PENSKE ADVANTAGE IS THERE; AUTO RACING: THE TEAM'S WILLINGNESS 
TO EXPERIMENT USUALLY KEEPS ITS DRIVERS AHEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Way back in the early '70s, one of racing's catch phrases had to do with 
"Roger Penske's unfair advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 It was part bravado and larger part advertising for Penske-endorsed automotive 
products peddled by Sears. But there was more than a little bit of truth to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Penske did have an advantage, unfair or otherwise. He somehow managed to think 
a jump ahead of the pack. His ideas didn't always pan out, but there never was 
a shortage of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-some years and a slew of track triumphs later, not much has changed. 
Penske's willingness to plow new ground still doesn't always work -- there have 
been a few forgettable seasons -- and his drivers don't always win, but his is 
usually the team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was Sunday at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. There were two 
disappointments in what started as a Penske parade -- Penske cars ran 1-2-3 for 
the first 20 laps -- but one won, for the second week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 In three Indy car races this season, Penske's drivers -- Al Unser Jr., Emerson 
Fittipaldi and Paul Tracy -- have won twice, finished second twice and been on 
the pole twice. Unser, Sunday's winner, and Fittipaldi share the season lead 
with 37 points each. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the last two races -- last week at Phoenix and here Sunday, on a fast 
oval and a not-so-fast street course -- only one team, the Newman-Haas outfit 
with lead driver Nigel Mansell, the defending national champion, has remotely 
threatened the Penskes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no catching them. Tracy and Fittipaldi had transmission problems 
that took them out of the running, but Unser motored smartly along, always well 
out of Mansell's reach. And quite probably, had Tracy and Fittipaldi stayed in 
the running, Mansell would not have caught them, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car worked very well, we just weren't quick enough to beat them today," 
Mansell said of the Penske cars. "We go into the month of May (and the 
Indianapolis 500) knowing that we've got a little bit of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Penske has announced an Indianapolis joint venture with his Ilmor engine 
company and Mercedes-Benz, hoping to cash in on the liberal rules at Indy for 
stock-block engines where Buick never quite made it. And although no one quite 
knows what will come of that, everyone else is at least a little nervous, 
knowing Penske's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hats off to the Penske team for that," Mansell said. "I'm not a betting man, 
but I would never bet against a great team like the Penske team. They don't do 
anything by half measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "But equally, as we all know, Indianapolis is a very special event. Anything 
can happen, and normally does. So we will go there, do the best job we can and 
see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, in his first season with Penske, is more enthusiastic about his 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got a team behind you that gives 110%, and builds you the car and 
really puts the effort behind you, it opens new doors for you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go develop the race car, you're always thinking about new things -- since 
I've gotten with Penske, that's exactly what's happened. Since I started racing 
in 1983, this team sets the standard in Indy car racing. It feels good to go 
into Indy driving for Team Penske." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Little Al had the advice of a couple of multiple Indianapolis 
winners to help him decide to go along with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (uncle) Bobby Unser says it's the team to be with, and then my dad says 
it's the team to be with, and if you have any opportunity to get there, you'd 
best go -- when these two guys say that, they're not blowing smoke. They're 
both champions, and they both drove for Penske." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this Unser also knows all about that "unfair advantage."

GYMNAST'S ACADEMICS DO COMPLETE FLIP; TITANS: DELIA, HEADED TO NCAA 
CHAMPIONSHIPS, APPLIES SAME DEDICATION IN CLASSROOM AS IN HER SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About a year ago, Lynn Rogers, the Cal State Fullerton women's gymnastics 
coach, asked his team members to draw pictures of themselves "just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The drawings are still there, on a bulletin board in his office. None will be 
regarded as great art; some are little more than the kind of stick-figure 
illustrations kids draw in grade school. They show the gymnasts performing in 
various events. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one drawn by Celeste Delia stands out. There are two figures. One is 
practicing on the beam, a cartoon-like thought bubble rising up from her head 
with the words, "All-American" and "NCAA Championships." The other part of the 
picture shows her seated at a desk, studying for a test. That bubble says, 
"Honor Roll." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a revealing self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia, 21, is more than ever the person in her picture. She will compete in 
the NCAA championships, Thursday through Saturday in Salt Lake City, and will 
have a chance to be an All-American in her senior season. And it will be next 
year before she is scheduled to graduate from Fullerton with a physical 
education degree, but she clearly has made the scholar-athlete "honor roll." 
She was Fullerton's Big West female scholar-athlete of the year for 1992-93, 
when she had a 3.57 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, I'm proudest of the fact that she's done well academically 
and will graduate," Rogers said. "She was a talented athlete when she came 
here. We knew what she could do in gymnastics, but to see her grab hold of the 
academic side of college is a real treat for me as her coach. Isn't that what 
college sports are supposed to be all about?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is especially proud of Delia because she entered Fullerton as a 
Proposition 48 student, which meant she had to sit out her freshman year and 
meet the school's academic standards in her first two semesters to become 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was in her mid-teens, her life revolved around gymnastics, and her 
work in the classroom suffered. She spent so much time at the Charter Oak 
Gliders gymnastics club in her hometown of Covina that it virtually became her 
second home. "In high school, I really didn't apply myself," Delia said. "I was 
training five or six days a week, for four to five hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many gymnasts, she dreamed of becoming a member of the U.S. national team 
and competing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time she was 17, she realized it was not to be. Women's gymnastics 
on the international level had become a sport that demands so much from those 
who are still so young. If Bela Karolyi had not heard of you by the time you 
were 13, and you didn't have a gymnastics maneuver that bears your name by 18, 
you were almost like an aging, sore-armed pitcher struggling to avoid being 
sent to the minor leagues. 
</P>

 Delia became an elite gymnast in 1990, which put her in contention for one of 
20 spots on the national team. The demands on her time were immense. "The 
coaches expected so much from her," said her mother, Jacci. "She had very 
little social life of her own and couldn't do things with her friends. She also 
traveled quite a bit to meets, including one trip to Romania." 
</P>
<P>
 But she finished 26th in the all-around at a major national competition that 
she felt weighed heavily in the selections for the national team. By then, 
Delia's dream had vanished, and she was left with a Scholastic Aptitude Test 
score that didn't allow her to qualify for a Division I school under NCAA 
rules. Her academic record at Covina Northview High School was average. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grades were certainly nothing to brag about, an average of something like 
2.3 or 2.4," she said. "I wasn't even thinking about going to college at the 
time. When I took the SAT test, it was just another test I had to take. I 
didn't think at all about how important those scores really were, and how much 
they meant." 
</P>
<P>
 So then what? 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers had recruited her for Cal State Fullerton, and she accepted, but 
because of Prop 48, she couldn't receive any scholarship money, practice with 
the team or compete in meets her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting out that year was very difficult for me," she said. "There was no one 
telling me where to be and what to do, and it was all new for me. There were a 
lot of new challenges for me academically. Gymnastics always had been my 
challenge before, and now it wasn't there. But I learned to discipline myself 
that first year. I had learned discipline from gymnastics and that carried 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those trying times, she emerged from that first year with a more 
balanced perspective, and on solid ground academically. "I realized that 
gymnastics won't carry you through life, that it won't be there forever," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also quickly returned to top form, winning the Big West all-around title 
as a sophomore, qualifying for the NCAA championships and finishing 25th in the 
all-around. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia also won the Big West all-around championship as a junior and again this 
year in her senior season, but there also was the disappointment of not 
advancing to the nationals last year when she didn't perform well in the 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 She also starred in the classroom her junior year. In addition to being chosen 
as the school's Big West female scholar-athlete of the year in 1992-93, she 
also earned a national academic honor in 1993 given by the gymnastics coaches' 
association and was on the dean's list that spring with a 3.8 GPA. Her college 
average is 2.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Her bubbly, engaging personality and quick laugh have kept practices mostly 
lively and relaxed. Her teammate, Cristi Clifford, who also has qualified for 
this year's nationals, said Delia has been a positive influence with her work 
ethic as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a sophomore, I really look up to her," Clifford said. "She keeps everyone 
going in the gym. She's very dedicated and very energetic." 
</P>
<P>
 And now Delia is eagerly awaiting her final college meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot of pressure from myself this year to make it to the nationals, 
because this is my last year," she said. "It was a real relief when I made it. 
I really want to finish well and end my career on a positive note."  
</P>
<P>
 Delia finished fourth in the all-around at the West Regional a week ago in 
Boise, Ida., scoring 9.7 or better on all four events, including 9.775 on the 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it difficult for Celeste in national competition is that she's 
very good in all four events but not overwhelming in any one," Rogers said. 
"She's consistently in the high 9.7 range but not in the 9.8 or 9.85 range in 
any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The top six performers in each event at the nationals will be named 
All-Americans, the second six on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this preparation comes down to a relatively few minutes of 
opportunity. In gymnastics, as in figure skating and some other individual 
performance sports, a routine can be performed flawlessly day after day, only 
to turn to shambles when the spotlight is brightest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The individual events are 10 times more difficult than the team sports from 
that standpoint," Delia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger the event, the greater the pressure, but Delia said she has become 
a more consistent gymnast now than she was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm mentally stronger now," she said. "I've been competing for so long 
that I feel I'm better able to deal with all the emotional feelings and 
thoughts that go through your mind in big competitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what happens this weekend, she'll be happy, and so will her 
parents. "We're very proud of her," said her father, Ron, a landscaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia said she hasn't decided what she will do after graduating next year. 
'I've been thinking about getting my credential and teaching, but there are so 
many different things going through my mind. . . . ," she said. "I sort of feel 
like I'm still too young to decide anything so important about my life right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 She thought for a few seconds and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so thankful now for the direction my life has gone," she said. "College 
has been a great experience for me. I wouldn't change a thing. Just getting my 
degree will be an awesome feeling."

TIFT SET TO GIVE ONE SPORT HIS BEST SHOT; PREPS: NEWPORT HARBOR SENIOR SKIPPED 
BASKETBALL SEASON TO CONCENTRATE ON TRACK. HE'LL COMPETE FOR UCLA NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Give Wade Tift some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor senior rushed for more than 200 yards in a single game, 
kicked a field goal in excess of 40 yards and, on the basketball court, hit 
three-point baskets with amazing regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Sailors' most versatile athletes, Tift is also among the nation's 
elite prep shotputters. He leads the county this season with a personal-best 
mark of 60 feet 10 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tift already has learned that in order to excel at one sport, something is 
bound to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading Newport Harbor's football team to the first round of the 
Southern Section Division IV playoffs, Tift decided to forgo his senior 
basketball season to concentrate on track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made somewhat easier when he signed a letter of intent to 
attend UCLA on a track scholarship and a new basketball coach was hired at 
Newport Harbor during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just got too tiring trying to lift weights after a full basketball 
practice, and with a new coach coming in in basketball, it made the decision to 
skip it a lot easier," said Tift, who started at forward his junior season and 
helped the Sailors reach the section III-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 As for missing basketball this past season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the big games," he said. "And when it came down to the end, I 
wished that I could have been in there to see how we would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the Sailors reached the playoffs, but again, they lost their 
first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Tift could have made a difference. He seems to achieve goals he sets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Newport Beach Junior Lifeguard, Tift regularly outran Sailor teammate and 
distance standout Trent Bryson, who has covered 3,200 meters in 9 minutes 48.1 
seconds this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to kill those guys back then," Tift said, "but running just wasn't 
that much fun for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Until high school, Tift played soccer with current Corona del Mar standout 
Jason Boyce on a regional AYSO squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Tift) would have chosen to direct the attitude he took toward football or 
throwing as a freshman into distance running, there is no doubt in my mind that 
he could be one of the best around," Newport Harbor Coach Bim Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just got an abundance of talent and a great work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Those attributes helped the 6-foot-1, 215-pound senior compete against much 
larger athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love looking up at those 6-4, 250-pound men before the competition who are 
glaring down at me trying to psyche me out," Tift said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when it's all over, they can't even look me in the eye. That's the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 With his personal-best effort earlier this spring, Tift became Orange County's 
23rd shotputter to surpass 60 feet. (The county record is 69-6 1/2, set by 
Capistrano Valley's Brian Blutreich in 1985.) But his mark is not even good 
enough to crack the top five all-time list at his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's strength coach, Tony Ciarelli, has been instrumental in 
Tift's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been able to take the guys with the quick fibers and strength and 
make them good throwers," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the upcoming State meet, where he finished fourth last year, 
Tift is eagerly awaiting a shotput showdown with Ciarelli, who won the national 
masters javelin throw (213 feet) two years ago. There will be no medals for the 
winner, but if Ciarelli loses, which he has yet to do against Tift, he has 
vowed to wear a dress to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got confidence," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although beating bigger throwers has been fun in high school, Tift's size 
might eventually limit his track and field career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really would be tough at his size to throw much beyond 62 or 63 feet," 
Ciarelli said. "But he's proven me wrong before."

FRIESZ TO SIGN WITH REDSKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Friesz, a free-agent quarterback who played with the San Diego Chargers 
last year, has agreed on a one-year, $900,000 contract with the Washington 
Redskins, the Daily Press of Newport News reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing is scheduled for today, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to playing in Washington," Friesz said. "The opportunity 
to start is what I like." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Mark Rypien was waived by the Redskins on Wednesday, and 
free-agent backups Cary Conklin and Rich Gannon are unlikely to be offered 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz suffered a knee injury in 1992 and lost his starting job with the 
Chargers to former Redskin Stan Humphries.

TRIAL TO START FOR WOMAN ACCUSED OF ABUSING CHILD; COURTS: DEFENSE ATTORNEY 
SAYS THE WESTLAKE HOMEMAKER WAS TRYING TO DO WHAT WAS BEST. PROSECUTORS BELIEVE 
THAT SHE DID MORE THAN ATTEMPT TO HELP HER DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Charlotte Russo a caring Westlake homemaker who adopted a young girl to 
give her a better life? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is the 51-year-old woman an abusive parent who made the girl sleep inside 
the bathroom of a small back-yard racquetball facility for months on end to 
keep her from raiding the kitchen and violating her salt-free diet? 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 10 months after she was arrested on suspicion of child abuse, Russo is 
scheduled to go on trial in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with one count of felony child abuse and one count of misdemeanor 
child abuse, Russo faces a maximum of three years in state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Richard, a 49-year-old stockbroker, pleaded guilty in September 
to misdemeanor child abuse in connection with the case. He was sentenced to 30 
days in jail and placed on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo's attorney said prosecutors and sheriff's investigators fail 
to realize the extent of the Russos' love for the girl and how they were only 
doing what was best for her. The Russos adopted the girl, who is now 16, when 
she was 1. The couple have five biological children and one other adopted 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case of child neglect or abuse," defense attorney James M. 
Farley argued. "It's a case of a mother who is trying desperately to have her 
daughter, who has some serious medical problems, do what is proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona said prosecutors believe that Russo did more 
than simply try to help her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's being prosecuted for abusing her child, and that's what the prosecution 
believes she did," Corona said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing in which Russo was ordered to stand trial, 
sheriff's investigators recalled how the case came to their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 24, some of Russo's neighbors on Outlook Circle heard screaming as they 
were walking by the family's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors could see Charlotte Russo, her husband and their daughter -- who 
was 15 at the time -- in the garage, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors told investigators that they watched for about five minutes as 
Charlotte Russo battered the child with her fist and Richard Russo yelled at 
the girl. After about five minutes, the child fell to the ground, the neighbors 
told investigators. The girl moaned and appeared to vomit, said the neighbors, 
who rushed home and phoned the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies took the girl to the station. Her face appeared swollen and was 
scratched, Sheriff's Detective Robert LeMay testified during a preliminary 
hearing in Municipal Court. She also had numerous marks on her arms, including 
bite marks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child told detectives that her mother frequently bit her. She also said 
that her parents were upset with her and that her mother took out the 
frustration by "battering her, biting her and scratching her," LeMay testified. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMay testified that the girl told him that for nearly two years, she lived in 
the bathroom of the $75,000 racquetball facility, which has linoleum-tile 
flooring, a sink, a toilet and no windows. The racquetball court is behind the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, LeMay described the bathroom as being seven feet by four feet. He 
said that the girl slept on a mattress on the floor and that her blankets, 
pillows and mattress would be taken away "as the level of discipline 
increased." 
</P>
<P>
 What would she sleep on in those cases, Corona asked in court? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," was LeMay's reply. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was in the 10th grade at the time in a home-study program, told 
investigators that she had first been ordered to sleep in the racquetball 
court's bathroom 2 1/2 years earlier. She said she had slept there on a regular 
basis for nearly a year before the neighbors reported abuse in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the bathroom locked from the inside, but that Richard Russo 
changed the lock to work from the outside and effectively kept her 
incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst part, she told investigators, would come on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were occasions when the family had gatherings at the residence there on 
Sunday where she was also locked . . . in the racquetball court, incidents when 
her parents would go away for the day and choose not to take her and keep her 
locked in the racquetball court," LeMay testified. "And she also related that, 
as a form of punishment, she spent the entire week in there during one period 
without having the opportunity to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the girl did her homework while locked in the bathroom, investigators 
said, unless her father disconnected the light. 
</P>
<P>
 On most days, according to investigators, Charlotte Russo would let the girl 
out of the racquetball court. She would escort her to the side of the house, 
make her disrobe and, once naked, rinse her down with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
 After the girl lathered up using "dishwashing soap," her mother would rinse 
her again before ordering her to dress without drying off, investigators 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl would then go inside the main house and do chores before being 
confined to the racquetball court bathroom after she was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also testified that the girl was given the same meal every day, 
four times a day -- oatmeal, eggs and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 And she was not allowed to watch television or use the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl has a heart condition, and Farley said she was on a special diet to 
keep her away from salty foods. "Salt causes her to blow up like a balloon," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys who have represented the Russos at various times have also 
said the case has been blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 They have pointed out that a day before the neighbors called the Sheriff's 
Department, the girl had been arrested for three break-ins at Westlake High. 
They have also said the girl is a juvenile delinquent who is lying about being 
abused to avoid prosecution for the break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 One lawyer, Joseph Hackett, said at the preliminary hearing that the Russos 
were justified in locking the girl out of the house because they were worried 
that if she ate too much salt, she would have a seizure, as she had in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl also admitted to detectives that she broke into the campus store at 
Westlake High to steal candy and that she slept on the sidewalk outside the 
school the night of the break-ins because she had been thrown out of her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this whole thing has been misread by the authorities," Farley said. 
"It's blown tremendously out of proportion. This is a case that does not 
deserve this type of attention. If there was an error, counseling could have 
solved it and not felony prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is expected to begin today before Superior Court Judge Charles 
W. Campbell.

CITY TO WEIGH REPAIR OF AGING WATER SYSTEM; SIMI VALLEY: COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER 
SEEKING BIDS TO FIX PIPELINES AND FOUR TANKS DAMAGED IN THE JAN. 17 EARTHQUAKE. 
A CONSULTANT COULD BE PAID UP TO $500,000. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to brace Simi Valley's aging water system against cracks and ruptures, 
the City Council tonight will consider seeking bids to repair four damaged 
water tanks and the pipelines that link them to residents' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for the city to pay a consultant up to $500,000 to devise a 
repair plan for lines and tanks that burst during the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
flooding homes and leaving some residents without running water for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're going for now is a way to fix up our most vulnerable 
spots," Councilman Bill Davis said. "We don't want to have this kind of trouble 
the next time we get hit by an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 As Water District No. 8, the city provides water to about two-thirds of Simi 
Valley's 102,000 residents. The rest of the city is supplied by Southern 
California Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the water district, the council last year budgeted the $500,000 to 
launch the first phase in upgrading the water system, parts of which are more 
than 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The system includes 380 miles of pipeline connected to 37 storage tanks, which 
can hold about 1 million gallons of water apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the council agreed to focus on the tanks that were hardest 
hit. Staff set to work gathering information on the extent of the damage from 
city crews that worked around-the-clock after the quake to patch the fractured 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the water tanks targeted for repair are at the top of Stow Street, 
near Barnard Street and Placerita Drive in Indian Hills. The fourth tank is at 
the north end of the city on Walnut Street near Felix and Black avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are parts of the system that will benefit greatly from some repair and 
upgrade work," said John Watring, assistant director of public works. "This 
project would be a big help in making that happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine active earthquake faults run under Simi Valley, according to the city's 
General Plan. The Northridge quake was the most severe in the city's 24-year 
history, causing more than $350 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe repair project is one of many steps the city has taken in the last 
three months to ease itself into recovery from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other actions include a soil stability study by state geologists, fee waivers 
for quake-related repair projects and a two-year extension on building permits 
for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can to get the city back on its feet," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the city received a boost in the form of an unexpected $5.5-million 
grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The city is 
still talking with federal officials to determine exactly how the funding can 
be used. Residents and businesses interested in applying for part of the funds 
should submit a written proposal to the city by April 26.

STREET SMART: FINANCIAL BARRIER DELAYS INSTALLING BERM AT INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an accident waiting to happen: 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the California 118 construction in east Ventura, eastbound 
Henderson Road near the highway has been made into a right-turn-only lane. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I regularly see people turning left from Henderson so that they can 
enter the Santa Paula Freeway or Wells Road. 
</P>
<P>
 This is very dangerous because at the same time these cars are turning left 
from Henderson, there are cars turning left onto Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to install a cement barrier to prevent cars from turning left 
from Henderson, since the sign does not seem to be working? 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Kitchens, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 A barrier is possible, Ventura City Engineer Rick Raves says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Department of Transportation and the city of Ventura share 
responsibility for that intersection, and getting one of them to agree to pay 
to install a berm could be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we insist on it, we could get Caltrans to build it," Raves said. "But they 
would want us to pay for it, and we would want them to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Caltrans has agreed to consider installing a berm, getting somebody 
to agree to foot the bill can take years, Raves says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the money could be found to pay for the project, there may not be 
enough room at the intersection to install it, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Your best bet, he says, is to use extra caution near that intersection.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, there was an accident at the intersection of Foothill and Day roads 
in Ventura. It was just one of many at this spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the police admit that this is one of the most dangerous intersections in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidding and honking occur all day long, and accidents are a regular event. 
</P>
<P>
 The blind curves, combined with speeding traffic, make it impossible to turn 
left onto Foothill from Day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also very difficult for pedestrians to cross Foothill into Arroyo Verde 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill needs stop signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Must someone die for the city to address this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mayfield, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city is aware of the dangers at Foothill and Day roads, and is closely 
monitoring the traffic volume, City Engineer Rick Raves says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city must follow state guidelines before it installs stop signs 
or signals, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the city counts enough traffic to warrant a stop sign or signal, the 
intersection goes onto a list of projects and must wait its turn for funding, 
Raves says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the city is working on a plan to improve visibility at the 
intersection by shaving a hillside west of Day Road. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the same project, the city plans to straighten Foothill Road 
slightly. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Your Feb. 7 and April 11 columns both discuss bicycle lanes and when cars are 
allowed to drive in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The general rule for solid white bike lane lines is the same as for solid 
yellow lines: Do not cross. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why bicycle lane stripes are broken at corners. The broken lines 
indicate that it is OK to cross into the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 If everyone would obey this rule, bicycle lanes would be much safer! 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit Heid, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 As you point out, motorists planning to turn right should not enter the bike 
lane until they are near the intersection, when the solid white line becomes a 
dashed line. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, motorists should not automatically veer into the bike lane at first 
sight of the dashed line. They should check first for bike riders. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between bicyclists and motorists can be an uneasy one, and 
following the rules of the road could go a long way toward keeping tempers cool 
and roads safe.

COLLEGES REPORTED NEAR CRISIS IN FINANCIAL AID; EDUCATION: STUDY CONTENDS THAT 
COUNTY'S THREE CAMPUSES MAY BE LOSING UP TO 5,000 POTENTIAL STUDENTS BECAUSE 
CUTS HAVE LEFT THE OFFICE STAFFS UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of Ventura County residents who want to enroll in community colleges 
are failing to do so, unaware that financial aid is available or because they 
cannot get school loans processed in time, a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District may be losing as many as 5,000 
such potential students a year -- nearly a fifth of the combined student bodies 
of Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges -- because funding shortages have left 
financial aid offices severely understaffed and unable to keep up with demands 
for help, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Two consecutive years of tuition increases have exacerbated the problem, 
officials say, sending a flood of students already enrolled at the colleges to 
financial aid offices seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our campuses need to declare an emergency and re-prioritize staffing," 
Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said. "We are strangling students' educational 
dreams with red tape and bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is particularly alarming because the district already faces the 
prospect of losing $1.3 million in state funding next year due to declining 
enrollment, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the district is "near a crisis in the delivery of 
financial aid" and should nearly quadruple its campus-based financial aid staff 
of 11 employees. The document was written by the district's three financial aid 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Trustee Pete Tafoya said, each campus should add one or two 
financial aid employees immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College President Jim Walker said he wishes that he could hire more 
financial aid employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is we're just inundated," he said. "Every time the student fees 
go up, the financial aid applications just skyrocket, and we don't have the 
staff to handle it. We've been decimated, and it's hard to get our priorities 
in such a way that we can afford to hire." 
</P>
<P>
 Figures show that financial aid applications at Moorpark College have been 
increasing steadily in recent years, Walker said. Between the past school year 
and the 1993-94 year, financial applications increased from slightly less than 
1,500 to almost 2,000, he said. Student fees also rose from $10 per unit to $13 
per unit in the same period. The financial aid office staff of three remained 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "With only three people over here doing financial aid, we get way behind," he 
said. "We're unable to process forms fast enough and students don't enroll, 
they leave. We'd love to add just one person. It would make us happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation at Ventura College, where there are five full- and part-time 
employees, is similar to that of Moorpark, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College is struggling even more than Moorpark and Ventura, the report 
said, employing less than a quarter of the staff needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent day at Oxnard College's financial aid office was typically hectic, 
with small clusters of students crowding the main desk seeking assistance. 
Behind the counter, one staff employee and a student worker struggled to keep 
up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just lacking in people, that's all," said Oxnard College student 
Terrie Farr, 30, a single mother of an 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr is supporting her family with the help of welfare, and is putting herself 
through school with federal and state grant programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need about four more people in here," she said. "There's so many 
questions people ask and there's not enough staff to answer them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr said her worst wait in recent memory was on a rainy Thursday several 
weeks ago when grant checks arrived; Farr waited in the cold and the rain for 
two hours to get her money. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was after cutting in line," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Robles, 23, another Oxnard College student who receives financial aid, 
agreed that the problem is not the quality of the employees, but the quantity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're knowledgeable about financial aid, but often there's a crowd of 
people around the desk and, after a while waiting, the people get irritated," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in the financial aid offices are among the most stressful on the 
campuses, said Leanne Colvin, president of the union for non-teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial aid employees "are extremely overworked," Colvin said. "Some of them 
are working a lot of overtime; some have given up vacation time to get the work 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the student fees going up and the economy going bad, a lot of people are 
turning to financial aid to go to school," she said. "It's just getting harder 
and harder for the staff to keep up."

KINKO'S INTENT ON BRANCHING OUT; GROWTH MAY AFFECT UPPER AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 At a time when most companies are cutting back and laying off, Ventura-based 
Kinko's Service Corp. has its own construction company to build the 70 
photocopying stores added yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when most companies are hesitant about expanding too aggressively, 
Kinko's is pushing into the international market, adding stores in Japan and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when most companies are reluctant to make major investments in new 
products, Kinko's has embarked on a $20-million gamble to build 
video-conferencing rooms in most of its 696 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's, which got its start catering to college students, is at a critical 
juncture in its development as the company changes its focus from the 
university crowd to corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a local level, the multimillion-dollar photocopying firm is causing a 
stir by backing a project in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. That 
project could make Kinko's a major part of the revitalization of Ventura's old 
industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's one of the most exciting years in our history," President Dan 
Frederickson said. "Our image is changing from a campus-based copy shop to the 
world's branch office." 
</P>
<P>
 The branch office campaign emphasizes that Kinko's offers more than photocopy 
machines: It touts video-conferencing, free local calls, faxing, mail service, 
printing and computer rentals -- all geared toward business clients. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the firm works to increase its presence internationally and locally, 
company officials say they hope to expand Kinko's corporate headquarters at 225 
W. Stanley Ave. in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, however, say Kinko's is wasting time on video-conferencing, which 
they view as a fad. 
</P>
<P>
 And some neighbors of the headquarters are resentful and wary of how the 
corporation may change the Ventura Avenue district, which has traditionally 
served the oil industry and not service-oriented companies such as Kinko's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's began in Santa Barbara 24 years ago in a former taco stand. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $5,000 bank loan, founder Paul Orfalea -- who named the company after 
the texture of his hair -- opened a copy business in a storefront so cramped 
that the copy machine had to be wheeled onto the sidewalk when a customer 
wanted to squeeze into the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, under the guidance of Orfalea, Kinko's grew by successfully 
targeting the college market. Many Kinko's stores stayed open 24 hours to 
attract students. 
</P>
<P>
 The company moved to Ventura in 1988, when it outgrew its corporate 
headquarters in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its arrival six years ago, Kinko's has made a considerable impact on the 
community. By all accounts, the firm has been a generous corporate donor, 
giving thousands of dollars to various charities and sponsoring the city's 
recycling program. When Kinko's opened its newest store on Main Street in 
November, it donated $5,000 worth of copying service to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kinko's goal is to be a good corporate citizen in our communities," 
Frederickson said. "The company culture of being a family gets extended into 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's recent moves have also attracted industry attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kinko's has woken up to the fact that there's a much bigger market out there 
than the college market, which had traditionally been their core business," 
said Jeff Hayzlett, a consultant to the printing industry. "Kinko's carries 
more marketing muscle than most, and they're becoming a brand name." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol LaPorta, marketing director for the Agoura Hills-based printing company 
PIP, said rival printers are looking at Kinko's with more alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many printers in the industry did not regard them as serious competition," 
LaPorta said. "They were pretty much restricted to a niche in the industry. 
They've changed all of that. . . . I think Kinko's can be a formidable 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's officials say their $20-million investment in video-conference rooms 
is part of their overall strategy to lure more business customers to their 
stores. By June, the first 100 rooms will be connected in an electronic 
network, and the goal is to install them in most of Kinko's stores within two 
years. The project, a joint venture with long-distance phone company Sprint, 
will create the largest video-conferencing network in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint spokesman Norman Black said the idea is to take video-conferencing to 
the average consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw in Kinko's was the commitment of a company to spend the time and 
money to drive video-conferencing down to the mainstream," Black said. "They 
were convinced that video-conferencing had reached a point, in terms of costs 
and ease of use, that it was something they could take to mainstream America." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts, however, say Kinko's is getting entangled in an expensive and 
fruitless endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's completely bogus," said Thad McIlroy, a San Francisco-based electronic 
publishing consultant. "Teleconferencing will be convenient when it's in 
offices. People aren't going to want to go down to Kinko's for a phone call. 
The people they're marketing to can't even program their VCRs; they're not 
ready to go into Kinko's and do teleconferencing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kinko's executives say the company is on the cutting edge of something 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident that we can make this successful," Frederickson said. "Our 
customers told us what to focus on." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason that Kinko's moved beyond the college market stems from a 
1989 lawsuit the company lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's paid $1.9 million in damages after eight publishers successfully sued 
the company for copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's had come up with the idea of approaching college professors and 
offering to create customized anthologies by copying different portions of 
textbooks. But textbook manufacturers said the company frequently neglected to 
get permission or pay royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to bother; it was easier to go ahead and just copy without 
getting permission," said Carol Risher, vice president of the American Assn. of 
Publishers. "They were becoming publishers, but they weren't paying royalties 
and doing it with permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's argued unsuccessfully that its copying of the textbook excerpts was 
allowed under the "fair use" clause of federal copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's executives acknowledge that the lawsuit was a blow to how they 
operated their campus-area business. Eventually, Frederickson said, "the 
complexity of compliance with copyright laws" spurred the company to expand to 
other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's still caters to college students with some of its 24-hour stores, but 
the company is no longer pursuing professors. In June, the company announced 
that it would stop publishing customized college course packets and concentrate 
instead on its branch-office concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the effects of the lawsuit affected how we did business," 
Frederickson said. "But we've seen a natural evolution in our business that's 
more driven by the marketplace than anything. As our business developed, we had 
many opportunities in the commercial market. We went where the business was." 
</P>
<P>
 The company prides itself on emphasizing customer service. Every Kinko's 
employee undergoes vigorous customer service training and takes refresher 
courses periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's employees say they like working for the corporation, with its 
progressive management, competitive salaries and generous health benefits. In 
September, 1991, the company built a 5,500-square-foot child-care center at its 
corporate headquarters and pays half of its employees' day-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit-revenue sharing plan is a big motivator, employees say, and 
turnover tends to be low. About 375 employees work at the corporate 
headquarters, and the company employs about 11,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's has an egalitarian corporate work culture; people are referred to as 
co-workers, and no one is called a boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so good to us," said Mona Hernandez, who works at the Kinko's copy 
store on Garden Street in Ventura. "They're always stressing family." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's shops are run as partnerships, similar to franchise operations, 
between the company and 120 independent entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orfalea, 46, is still involved in running Kinko's and owns most of the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's executives declined to release sales figures or other financial data, 
but a 1993 Dun & Bradstreet financial report lists sales of $70.4 million for 
81 of the 696 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they had only modest hopes for the photocopying company 
when it moved to Ventura six years ago. Much to their relief, Kinko's had 
decided to pay $13.5 million for a 122,000-square-foot facility that had been 
vacant for years in the Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Baker recalls that Kinko's employees filled barely a quarter 
of the sprawling, two-story stucco-and-glass building formerly occupied by 
Vetco Offshore, a manufacturer of automated equipment for oil platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they've gone bonkers, and they're bursting at the seams," Baker said. 
"They've gone well beyond our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kinko's arrival has not pleased all its neighbors. Some businesses say 
Kinko's is unfairly using its clout to help push a project that could 
dramatically change the character of the old industrial neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is endorsing a development proposal on the upper Avenue that would 
add 330 townhouses, a park, bike trails and business offices to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel and Huntsinger families of Ventura, with Kinko's support, are 
lobbying city officials to change the zoning from heavy industrial to allow 
residential and commercial office uses. The two families own property adjacent 
to Kinko's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the project would be built on about 55 acres, the Neels and 
Huntsingers are requesting that the City Council change the zoning on about 25 
acres of their neighbors' properties to help upgrade the area. A majority of 
the council members said they are in favor of the project, and a final vote is 
expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's executives say they have not yet decided to expand their corporate 
headquarters, but changing the zoning in the neighborhood would influence their 
decision. The company is considering a 60,000-square-foot addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't want to build an office on one parcel and next door someone 
could come in and put an auto repair junkyard there," said Greg Lowe, 
facilities manager for Kinko's. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors say they don't care about Kinko's expanding or even the 
proposed townhouses, but are fighting the change in zoning that would benefit 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Menick, who owns Lynn's Heavy Duty Towing, noted that Kinko's would be 
allowed to expand without the development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew the area where they were buying into," said Menick, who has owned 
his business on the Avenue since 1980. "They're trying to push out other 
businesses in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Prince, whose wife owns a plumbing supplies company near Kinko's, said he 
doesn't think that city officials would be as enthusiastic about the 
development proposal if it were not for the endorsement of one of the city's 
biggest employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kinko's wanted it, so it got shoved down our throats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials and real estate agents say the proposal could be the start 
of a revitalization of Ventura's west side, which has been sagging since the 
oil boom ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's presence in the area may eventually draw other companies to the 
neighborhood, said Everett Millais, the city's community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll see it incrementally," he said. "As more people move into the 
area, it will take away from the stigma of the Avenue and cause people to take 
a second look in investment as the opportunity arises." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Frederickson said Kinko's has no plans to move from Ventura, he 
doesn't know if the company will relocate later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's will concentrate more on expanding its foreign stores, as well as 
continuing to push its branch office concept, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinko's has six stores in Canada, two in Japan and one in the Netherlands. 
Another is scheduled to open in Japan next year. International domination of 
the market is the company's long-term goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've enjoyed good growth as a company," Frederickson said. "Our vision is to 
be the branch office for the world."

RENT FEUD ON MOBILE HOMES IS REIGNITED; HOUSING: PARK OWNERS ARE PUSHING A 
STATEWIDE INITIATIVE TO ABOLISH PRICE CONTROLS. RESIDENTS CALL THE CAMPAIGN 
MISLEADING AND THE AIM UNFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rent control tug of war between mobile-home park owners and their tenants 
has residents of the movable coaches in Ventura County fearful that they could 
one day be priced out of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mobile-home park residents enjoy safeguards from spiraling rents, but 
park owners are mobilizing to recoup the millions of dollars of income they 
complain is wrongly diverted from their investments every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants for the park owners are circulating petitions that would place 
before California voters an initiative to do away with state rent controls and 
leave subsidies solely to the discretion of landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say the measure -- being promoted as the "Mobile Home Fairness and 
Rental Assistance Act" -- already has almost 80,000 supporters, although 
385,000 signatures are needed by June 27 to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparent differences in what the title implies and what the measure would 
actually do have prompted cries of foul from park residents, many of whom are 
senior citizens living on Social Security or pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds wonderful," said Cherie Allen, president of the homeowners 
association at Buenaventura Mobilehome Estates in east Ventura. "But it's the 
complete opposite of what it says it is. It would do a tremendous amount of 
damage to people living on fixed incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure, which would almost certainly face a court challenge 
if approved by voters, argue that legislating rent subsidies for mobile-home 
owners rubs against the grains of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only industry I know of where they say you must subsidize your 
tenants," said Jim Murdock, a board member of the Western Mobilehome Assn. and 
property manager who oversees the 219-unit Royal Duke park in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It grates against the whole American way." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics accuse park owners of attempting to trick vulnerable tenants with 
confusing language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to provide meaningful assistance at all," said Maurice A. 
Priest, a Sacramento attorney representing mobile-home residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Park owners "have basically come up with a tricky title that sounds good," 
Priest said. "They are trying to achieve through a misleading initiative what 
they have not been able to accomplish before local governments, the state 
Legislature or in the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters, the mobile-home initiative would supersede existing 
state and local rent control laws as well as prohibit new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also limit rent subsidies -- which would be administered by park 
owners -- to 10% of residents and allow for annual rent hikes equal to the 
annual increase in the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 What has opponents most concerned, however, is that as mobile homes are sold 
or leased, 90% would not be subject to any rent control. The park owners would 
be able to charge whatever the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Hilton, a 76-year-old retired teacher from Moorpark, is so worried about 
the initiative that he has been signing his neighbors up for membership in the 
Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (park owners) would own us if this thing passes. They'd run us right out 
of here," said Hilton, who estimated that league membership among park 
residents has doubled in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senior citizens would be unable to stay if they (park owners) were 
allowed to charge whatever they wanted," he said. "They'd have us paying $600, 
$700 a month" for the space on which the homes sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, when Hilton first moved into the Villa Del Arroyo Mobile Home Park 
on Los Angeles Avenue, his rent has risen from $302 to $390 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "And at that time, we were provided water, sewage and trash," he said. "Now we 
have to pay those, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's mobile-home rent control ordinance, upheld in a special election in 
April, 1993, allows park owners to impose a 4% rent increase annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The state measure is sponsored by a group calling itself Californians for 
Mobile Home Fairness, a coalition chiefly made up of mobile-home park owners, 
who stand to gain millions of dollars if the initiative becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Property managers and mobile-home park owners say they are being unfairly 
singled out to help subsidize the poor and underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Mobilehome Assn., the most powerful alliance of park owners in the 
Western United States, is not officially endorsing the measure. But it does 
support qualifying it for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since rent control came in, we have been trying to balance the playing 
field," said Barry McCabe, an association board member and president of De Anza 
Assets of Beverly Hills, which manages more than 40 mobile-home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the free market come back into play again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 105 mobile-home parks scattered across Ventura County with more than 
10,000 coaches, according to the state division of codes and standards, which 
regulates mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each mobile home is owned privately. But the residents pay a monthly fee for 
their space -- much like a boat owner pays a slip fee to harbor or marina 
owners -- that often tops hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of California cities and counties regulate mobile-home rents 
through local ordinances. In most Ventura County cities, the rent control laws 
generally limit annual increases to a percentage -- typically three-fourths -- 
of the annual increase in the consumer price index, which last year was 2.6% 
for the Los Angeles metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the local ordinances also allow park owners to apply for additional 
rate hikes due to increases in operating expenses or to recoup capital 
improvement costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controls, residents of the mobile-home parks say they have watched 
their rents climb steadily over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're renting from the park is a piece of dirt with a driveway on it," 
said Alice-Jean Davis, an Oxnard mobile-home resident of 23 years who is also a 
regional manager of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could afford better, do you think I'd live in a tin house?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Jarrell, a retired civilian employee of the U. S. Air Force, said his 
rent at Buenaventura Mobilehome Estates has risen from $165 in 1978 to the $364 
a month he pays now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went up another $12 the first of April," Jarrell said. "That's awfully 
high for someone that owns their own home." 
</P>
<P>
 The methods used by signature-gatherers are often misleading, opponents of the 
measure complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going into the parks saying, 'Sign here for rental assistance,' " 
said Steve Hopcraft, a political consultant hired by the Golden State 
Mobilehome Owners League. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're afraid people are going to believe this is rent assistance, when the 
only assistance you get is a big rent increase," he said. "We have gotten calls 
from senior citizens in tears, saying they signed the thing and don't know what 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Even state officials say they have heard more inquiries about the mobile-home 
initiative than most in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hot issue," said Cathy Mitchell of the California secretary of 
state's office, which administers state initiatives. "We've had a lot of 
requests for copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions that has come up is how to withdraw signatures from 
petitions," she said. "The only other time I've heard that question was during 
the school voucher campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 People who have signed any petition can request that their names be withdrawn 
by contacting their county elections office before the petitions are turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in Ventura County has requested that their name be removed from the 
rent control petitions, said Bruce Bradley, Ventura County assistant registrar 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Petition signatures are verified by county clerks before they are sent to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative proponents, however, claim that mobile-home rent control advocates 
have improperly harassed those collecting signatures to qualify the measure for 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may seek judicial relief to restrain them from interfering with peoples' 
rights," said attorney Charles Bell, who works for sponsors of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative is at a critical juncture in the qualification process, so 
anything that interferes impedes the (qualification) process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), a longtime advocate for 
mobile-home tenants, is not worried about the signature-gatherers. He called 
the measure "definitely misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be characterized as the mobile-home unfairness act," said 
O'Connell, who has sponsored several bills on behalf of mobile-home tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach owners "have an investment that cannot, for the most part, be picked up 
and moved to another space," he said. "We need some predictability and some 
stability for the mobile-home residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that the government helps perpetuate rifts between park owners 
and tenants because voters outnumber park owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mobile-home parks are unique, but rent stabilization is not necessary," said 
Bill Schweinfurth, property manager for the 231-unit Lemon Wood park in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's not the economics," he said. "It's the process that leads to 
(disputes) between the owners and the tenants."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK VIEW; LAND DONATED TO HABITAT FOR HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after Habitat for Humanity volunteers provided a home for 74-year-old 
Charles Henderson, the Oak View resident returned the favor by donating two of 
his three small parcels to the nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Using donations of money, building materials and manpower, Habitat for 
Humanity, which builds housing for poor families, will construct houses on 
Henderson's land for two west Ventura County families, Habitat Chairwoman 
Elaine Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is set to begin later this month. The groundbreaking ceremony for 
the project was held Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pioneer concept of barn-raising where people help their 
neighbors," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, expected to cost about $30,000 per house, is being funded with 
donations and $20,000 in federal Community Development Block Grant funds from 
the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Presbyterian Church pledged another $20,000 over three years, and several 
local businesses and homeowners have promised to donate tile, lumber, windows 
and other building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, who have not been chosen, will buy the houses at a low price 
and have a no-interest mortgage. Habitat hopes to have the families selected by 
July and the first family moved in by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The families selected must provide 500 hours of work, called sweat equity, as 
a down payment. Seventy-five of those hours will be spent in a training course 
on how to maintain the house. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the Habitat project, applicants must need housing, not have 
resources to buy or build shelter, and be unable to qualify for a government 
housing loan, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, applicants must have lived or worked in the west county area for at 
least a year and have steady incomes of from $13,000 to $27,000 for a 
four-person family, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are four-bedroom homes, so we will be looking at larger families," she 
said. Habitat also plans to build houses in Ventura and Fillmore for smaller 
families and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said Habitat needs people to help choose the families and is holding 
two community meetings this week to form a selection committee. The first 
meeting will be at 7 tonight at Ojai Methodist Church. The second will be at 7 
p.m. Thursday at the Oak View Community Center. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PARK'S VISITORS CENTER TO OFFER LIVE VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors to the Channel Islands National Park center in Ventura will see 
something new this summer -- a live, underwater video of divers cavorting 
through kelp forests near Anacapa Island, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a giant television screen at the visitors center in Ventura Harbor, people 
can watch as two divers point out different types of sea life in a deep kelp 
bed near the island.Visitors will be able to ask the divers questions using a 
remote two-way device, park spokeswoman Carol Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 The video will be sent to the mainland via microwave, making it possible for 
landlubbers to see what ocean life looks like 11 miles from the real thing, 
Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the five-island chain is a national park open to the public, many 
people cannot afford the price of a boat ride to it, she said, adding that 
others are afraid of diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment for the show will be paid for with a $28,000 grant given to 
Ventura's visitors center by the National Park Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine life living in habitat surrounding the islands range from microscopic 
plankton to one of the largest creatures, the blue whale, Spears said. KAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON IN BANK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beverly Hills man whose bad checks cost Ventura County-based Bank of A. Levy 
$212,000 received a two-year federal prison sentence last week for writing 
checks on a nonexistent bank account at a nonexistent bank. 
</P>
<P>
 David Alan Wolfson, 38, was also ordered to repay $30,000 in the sentence 
handed down Friday by U. S. District Judge John G. Davies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank fraud case dates to 1989, when Wolfson agreed to invest in a business 
venture with a Camarillo man, Stuart J. Levy, who is not related to Bank of A. 
Levy founders. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to March, Wolfson gave Stuart Levy six cashier's checks worth 
$260,000, purportedly drawn on a Canadian bank called Western Pacific Overseas 
Bank. Stuart Levy then cashed the checks at the Bank of A. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to find the bank to honor the cashier's check and, much to their 
chagrin, discovered there was no bank," Assistant U. S. Atty. Peter G. Spivack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found that Wolfson's bank was "a sham institution with no assets 
and conducted no business operations," according to an FBI release. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not even incorporated, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time that the Ventura County bank discovered Wolfson's fraud, Stuart 
Levy had already committed much of the money. He has not been charged in the 
case and was not aware of the fraud, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfson was indicted in September on six counts of federal bank fraud charges 
and pleaded guilty to one count in January in U. S. District Court. PHYLLIS W.

WOMAN ESCAPES ATTACKER AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 61-year-old Ojai woman narrowly escaped being raped in her home by fighting 
off a young attacker and running to a neighbor's home, a Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman suffered minor injuries during the struggle early Saturday morning 
and was treated at Ojai Community Hospital and released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the assailant may be the same person who sexually 
assaulted a woman in her Meiners Oaks home in early March. The assailant is 
described as 5-foot-10, in his mid-20s with brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is asking that anyone with information about either incident 
contact Detective Maureen Hookstra or Detective Danny Thompson in the Sheriff's 
Department. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCENIC ROAD MAY GET SHOPPING CENTER 
SIGN

<P>
 A plan to post a sign for a shopping center along a scenic Simi Valley roadway 
will be considered today by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, a sign for the Village Shopping Center would be posted on the 
south side of Madera Road near Wood Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs along scenic roadways are strictly regulated in the city's General Plan. 
There are no other signs along that stretch of roadway, save a low stone marker 
at the entrance to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
 In considering whether to allow the sign, the council will have to decide 
whether to make an exception or change the restrictions on signs along scenic 
roads. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER OPTIONS ON GARBAGE 
</P>

<P>
 A month after a countywide trash panel decided to scuttle plans for a regional 
waste authority, the Simi Valley City Council tonight will consider other 
options for controlling the city's trash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also discuss asking the county to refund $22,600 that the 
city paid toward an audit of existing countywide trash agencies as part of an 
effort to form the new authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar fees were paid by the county and its other nine cities before the 
Ventura County Waste Commission in March agreed to abandon plans to form a 
countywide waste authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said that he was glad that plans for the authority 
collapsed and that he hopes that the city can recover its share of the audit 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The differences in trash philosophy just run too deep for all of us to get 
together as a single agency," he said. "Letting us go our own separate way is a 
much more viable approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The city had planned to add a five-cent-a-month surcharge to residents' trash 
bills to cover the cost of the audit. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM OFFERED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Council on Aging is offering an emergency alert system to 
low-income residents over the age of 55 who spend a lot of time alone in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The devices, called Lifeline Systems, are hooked to a telephone and a 
mechanized cord that hangs around the user's neck.When the wearer pushes a 
button attached to the cord, it triggers a call for help to Simi Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers from the Council on Aging install the systems and check on them 
once a month to make sure that they are operating correctly, said Kathryn 
Oliver, senior services coordinator for the city of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful program because it allows people to feel independent, but 
with help available when they need it," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who make less than $35,000 a year may qualify for free service 
through the council. Residents who don't qualify for the free program can get 
the same service for $15 a month through Simi Valley Hospital, Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for the service, call the Simi Valley Senior Center at 526-9237. A

<P>
 A proposal to uproot five oak trees on two acres of overgrown property near 
Haigh Road in Newbury Park to make way for a townhome development is expected 
to meet approval by the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes 13 three- and four-bedroom townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the surrounding neighborhood submitted a letter to the city 
saying they generally supported the project, but objected to placement of a 
proposed recreation area near adjacent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is approved, architect Frank Montesinos said construction would 
begin in August and take about one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing on the project is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at City Hall, 
2400 Willow Lane, Thousand Oaks. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LEADERS TO ADDRESS SPEED HUMP PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about safety and noise, Simi Valley residents near Royal High School 
have signed a petition aimed at persuading the city to install speed humps on 
their street. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider the petition, signed by 75% of the 
residents of Arcane Street between Erringer Road and 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary study conducted by the city showed that more than 85% of traffic 
on the street exceeded the 25-m.p.h. speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go flying down here and don't even look to see of there are any kids 
around," said Robert Vick, a homeowner with four children ranging in age from 3 
to 17. "They use it as a quick way to get from Erringer to 1st, and all of us 
have to suffer because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen streets have speed humps in Simi Valley, which first agreed to allow 
them in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed humps are wider and do not jolt vehicles as harshly as the speed bumps 
found in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is one of four Ventura County cities that allow speed humps. The 
others are Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula and Camarillo. SARA CATANIA

ART REVIEW; PIONEERING PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THEIR 'PALETTE OF LIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Historically it's not uncommon for new technologies to echo the old mechanisms 
they replace. When automobiles were invented they retained running boards like 
a vestigial bone from the carriage era. Today computers imitate the typewriters 
they made virtually obsolete. A thought-provoking small exhibition at the J. 
Paul Getty Museum shows that something very similar happened in the early days 
of photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palette of Light: Handcrafted Photographs, 1898-1914" was organized by 
curator Weston J. Naef and consists of 32 vintage prints by camera artists who 
wanted to make their brand-new art look like old art. In mood, the show might 
be called "In the Gloaming." It's thoughtful and a little nostalgic as if, 
unconsciously, these pioneers sensed the eventual impact of mechanical 
picture-making with considerable regret. 
</P>
<P>
 American Edward Steichen is the best known of the five represented. 
Significantly, he was also a practicing painter. The first of his works on view 
is a 1901 self-portrait depicting him as an old master holding his palette. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just the trappings that are painterly. Photographers dissatisfied 
with the glossy albumen paper that was the standard for early printing came up 
with a gum bichromate process that allowed for more variety of texture and 
coloration. Steichen and the rest used it to achieve a soft-focus effect that 
has the atmospheric quality of a painting. This "pictorialist" mode was 
institutionalized as the Photo-Secession movement back in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its votaries was Gertrude Kasebier, a kind of photographic Mary 
Cassatt. Along with Steichen and like-minded others she attached herself to 
Alfred Stieglitz's Gallery 291. Her portrait of him resembles an early 
Expressionist print. Maybe she was thinking about Edvard Munch with his air of 
devil-dandy. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Stieglitz was the pictorialists' great Satan. He came to 
champion the crisper, more graphic "straight" photographic style that was more 
in line with the reductive trends of modernist thinking. It wasn't long before 
the pictorialists were forced to go straight or be cast as dodos. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, they made some touching and finely nuanced work. Austrian Heinrich 
Kuehn left images like "Miss Mary (Warner) at Her Night Table." It reflects a 
characteristic pictorialist attraction to figures silhouetted against the 
light, Rembrandt-style. 
</P>
<P>
 American Alvin Langdon Coburn clearly had Whistler on the brain in his "Grand 
Canal, Venice." There's something considerably more original about a 1911 view 
of Ocean Park. Locals will like it for its revelation of what our beach town 
looked like back then. Artniks may pick up a sense of surreal power in the way 
Coburn managed to capture the roiling surf as if it had frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of local matters, there is a surprisingly significant image by George 
Seeley. It shows a landscape near Stockbridge, Mass., but its smoky silhouette 
style resembles nothing so much as the recent paintings of Ed Ruscha. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if our contemporary hero, poet of Pop and intuitive pioneer of 
Conceptual art, had looked back at this supposedly outmoded work and found 
something that speaks to the ominous Postmodern present. 
</P>

MOVIE; ONLY ICE-T UP TO 'SURVIVING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have the feeling you've already seen "Surviving the Game" you may very 
well have, for it's basically the same story as "Hard Target." That film may 
not have been top-drawer John Woo, but alongside "Surviving the Game," it's a 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Bernt's hopeless script spends an incredible 37 minutes to set up an 
action picture that runs only 96 minutes. Worse yet, we can see what the film's 
hero, a Seattle homeless man played by Ice-T, is getting into long before he 
can. Apparently having lost his wife and child in some kind of fire for which 
he somehow holds himself responsible and now having just had his boozy sidekick 
Jeff Corey and his dog die on him, he throws himself in front of a truck but is 
saved by Charles S. Dutton's forceful homeless shelter volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutton is no ordinary do-gooder. He's in a partnership with a steely Rutger 
Hauer in Hell's Canyon Outfitters, which charges its clients a whopping $50,000 
each to join its very special hunting expeditions in the Northwestern 
wilderness. (At least the film has gorgeous scenery.) 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think a guy as wary as Ice-T's Jack Mason has been established to be 
would be a tad suspicious when, despite having no experience whatsoever, he's 
offered the job of hunting guide. It cannot come as a shock to you when 
eventually Hauer, pointing a gun at him, tells him, "We're the hunters, you're 
the hunted." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's remaining 59 minutes are ultra-violent and entirely predictable as 
Mason is given a sportsmanly head start in his run for life by a bunch of 
sickos, which include Gary Busey, F. Murray Abraham and John McGinley. There's 
more than a hint that if Hauer and company are successful in capturing Ice-T, 
they'll roast him for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is exceedingly hard to understand why Spike Lee's great cameraman Ernest 
Dickerson, in his second outing as a director -- his first was the uneven but 
promising "Juice" -- was attracted to such trite material, which his direction 
frankly makes all the more obvious. Ironically, Ice-T, in only his fourth 
feature, holds on to his cool and carries the picture while most everyone else 
hams it up. If you're in the mood for a good running-the-gauntlet movie, you're 
better off renting Cornel Wilde's classic "The Naked Prey" (1966). 
</P>

Incessant graphic and mindless bloodshed and brutality rules this one out for 
children.

 While Christopher Knight is entitled to his opinion, even going so far as 
calling the "Mexico Through Foreign Eyes" exhibition "one of the sillier shows 
of the season," as curators of the exhibition and authors of the accompanying 
catalogue of the same name, we feel we must correct the many factual errors in 
his review ("Mexico Show Not a Pretty Picture," Calendar, March 31). 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Mexico Through Foreign Eyes' might be most succinctly described as a NAFTA 
show," Knight writes. This is an interesting but unfounded assertion since we 
began working on the exhibition in 1989, long before NAFTA became an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He writes further: "A sentimental travelogue masquerading as a photography 
exhibition, it seems less interested in examining works of art than in selling 
a mythologized picture of Mexico." Perhaps Knight thinks that we are in the 
services of the Mexican government? 
</P>
<P>
 As independent curators and editors, we have been responsible for presenting 
the work of photographers of the caliber of William Klein and Sebastiao 
Salgado. Between the two of us, we have authored or co-authored seven books on 
photography. Knight impugns our integrity by suggesting that we are "marketing 
the image of a country currently in the forefront of popular consciousness" 
when in fact, for the 3 1/2 years spent researching this exhibition, Mexico was 
far from the forefront of popular consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight might also be interested to know that when "Mexico Through Foreign 
Eyes" opened in Mexico City, the exhibition was criticized for focusing too 
much on an older Mexico and excluding its modern economy -- for being what 
might be characterized as "anti-NAFTA." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's commentary also states that the viewer is "coaxed to search for a 
missing common denominator that makes Cartier-Bresson and Modotti, Levitt and 
Siskind somehow alike. Maybe it's something in the water?" We never suggest 
that all of these photographers are alike. In fact, we emphasize the 
multiplicity of vision by these and many other photographers throughout the 
history of the medium. The only constant is their attraction to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 As our introduction to the catalogue puts it, the exhibition's intent is "to 
sample how so many have envisioned the country and in various ways have been 
inspired by it." The 14 separate catalogue essays and other texts by writers 
from Mexico, Europe and the United States on subjects ranging from native 
religions and surrealism to the burning of the Lacandon rain forest further 
make it clear that there is no homogenizing principle. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Knight's aforementioned "water" joke, it hardly adds to the process of 
"examining works of art" that he suggests should be at the exhibition's core. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight also claims that "few (of the exceptional photographs) are likely to be 
a surprise." In fact, while Knight may not consider them exceptional or 
surprising, many of the artists -- Andre Kertesz, Kent Klich, Arthur Tress, Via 
Wynroth, among many others -- have never exhibited their Mexican work in this 
country. What's more, one of the show's curators discovered Kertesz's pictures 
on contact sheets and had them printed for the first time for this exhibition. 
Specialists in Mexican photography in the United States, Mexico and Europe have 
generally been surprised at the large proportion of the work that had never 
been seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight need not like the exhibition. He might have chosen, however, to 
critique it with more respect, beginning with the facts. (Even the telephone 
number given for the Armand Hammer Museum of Art, where the exhibition is 
currently on view, is incorrect. It is actually (310) 443-7000.)

COUNTERPUNCH: LET'S LET THE KIDS GET ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALDINE LAYBOURNE, Geraldine Laybourne is president of Nickelodeon and 
vice chairman of MTV Networks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As leaders of the electronic communications industry, politicians and media 
pundits conjure images of the coming information superhighway, the only people 
left out of all this talk are those most likely to be its first travelers -- 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 As tomorrow's users of the new technology, kids are already telling us they 
won't be satisfied with programming like "Gilligan's Island" on demand and a 
bunch of souped-up shopping channels. They are asking us for more. And it is 
time that we listen. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time business leaders have overlooked the needs of kids 
in charting the course of technological change. The $7-billion video game 
industry was spawned by kids' curiosity, sense of self-discovery and 
instinctive grasp of electronic technology. But the industry has ignored those 
very attributes in manufacturing and marketing their products. The result has 
been a steady stream of video games, some very profitable, that quickly settled 
on delivering G-rated violence and a mindless way to pass the time.  
</P>
<P>
 By marketing to the lowest common denominator, they and other manufacturers 
have failed to tap the vast potential that interactivity holds. Interactive 
media enables kids to do more things -- access information, communicate and 
play -- in ways that never existed before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most companies have taken little, if any, advantage of opportunities to give 
kids interactive technology that empowers them to explore their world through 
entertainment and education in an active and creative way. 
</P>
<P>
 In experiments conducted by Nickelodeon and other companies, kids have already 
demonstrated their ability to push the use of television to its technological 
limits. We call these "dirt roads tests," and they indicate that the true 
programming breakthroughs that surface in the next decade are likely to come 
from kids. They need plenty of guidance and encouragement from creative adults 
whose goals are to shape programs that meet kids' emotional and psychological 
needs and take advantage of the way kids think and play. 
</P>
<P>
 We should also learn from other interactive pioneers who have made "kid input" 
a key part of their programs. The Hueneme School District, a school system in 
Oxnard, has drawn on such input in developing a phenomenally successful 
CD-ROM-based curriculum. Shop classes, for example, have turned into high-tech 
laboratories where boys and girls design animation and build robots, cars and 
buildings with computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Hueneme's computer-aided performance gains in science, math, 
literature and language have been remarkable. Since 1984, when they first 
introduced technology into the classroom, Hueneme students' statewide test 
scores have increased from below the 40th percentile to the 92nd percentile. 
Based on the experience at Hueneme, it is clear that interactivity could have a 
major impact on education -- both in the classroom and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a lesson from the shortcomings of the video game industry, America's 
corporate leaders need to aim higher. They need to listen closely to consumers 
in developing software and programming that not only entertains, but also 
informs and enlightens. And they need to start by talking to kids, because they 
will play a critical role in our interactive future. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike adults, kids have little vested interest in the past and are not 
creatures of habit. They are more inventive and more willing to accept change 
than their elder counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What this means is that we need to spend a little less time arguing about who 
will pay for the new technology and a little more time talking about the 
programming it will carry. As anyone who has bought a personal computer knows, 
the hardware is just a starter; it is the software that makes magic things 
happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's ask consumers -- the kids in particular -- what they prefer to see and 
how they want to interact with the new technology as it develops. 
</P>
<P>
 If we fail to learn from our mistakes by continuing to allow bottom-line 
concerns to take precedence over human needs, the information superhighway will 
surely not fulfill its potential. But if we take a different path, consumers 
may lead us to unimagined and wondrous possibilities.

COUNTERPUNCH: MEDIA PAINT A DISTORTED PORTRAIT OF BLACK AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEWEY EDWARD CHESTER, Dewey Edward Chester, a Los Angeles screenwriting 
professor, has been certified by UCLA's Writers' Program, holds a literature 
degree from the University of Pittsburgh and has taught screen and novel 
writing at the college level. He also played football for Pitt and as a 
professional.

<P>
 I've watched with great alarm the tendency among blacks in Hollywood to tear 
the heart from the African American community. Black creative artists like 
Martin Lawrence are getting a chance to tell their stories but too often they 
use this opportunity to reinforce ugly stereotypes of their own people ("Martin 
Lawrence: Dr. Dirt or Mr. Clean?," Calendar, March 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence's sitcom, "Martin," and some of his other performances contribute to 
the distorted image that some people hold of African Americans as immoral, 
uneducated people. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider his television caricature Sheneneh, the garish man-chaser wearing 
braided wigs and female padding. Consider his distasteful references to women's 
body parts, oral sex and derogatory hygiene tips to youngsters on the Feb. 19 
"Saturday Night Live" that caused NBC to cancel his planned appearance on "The 
Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 As a writing professor, trained in classical storytelling methods, I am 
saddened by the portrait of black people that too often is being conveyed on 
television, in the movies and in the media, in general. Inner cities are 
perceived as areas filled with grotesque, terrifying people -- all lurking 
behind shadows of poverty, hatred and horrible ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But there are tens of thousands of black Americans who are heroes -- working 
hard, studying hard, maintaining high levels of ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 We are now watching the self-destruction of young black America, caused in 
part by a small group of black filmmakers and other artists who are selling 
stereotypical garbage to the world at a ridiculously high price. 
</P>
<P>
 Few blacks in the movie and television industry would argue for censorship, 
fearing that would close off opportunities to work. Yet, there are a number of 
African American actors, directors and writers who are so intent on getting 
paid that they are willing to co-sign ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd call this a black-on-black crime.

DANCE; GOODE ALTERS 'WHISPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An injury to one of the dancers left the Joe Goode Performance Group 
scrambling to rework "Whisper It to Me in My Ear" less than a day before it 
received its West Coast premiere Saturday at the Richard and Karen Carpenter 
Performing Arts Center at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be an unanswerable question, nonetheless, whether the presence of 
Suellen Einarsen, who had torn a ligament in a workshop for students on Friday, 
would have made enough of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced (and spoken) by choreographer Goode and his San Francisco company 
members Marit Brook-Kothlow, Elizabeth Burritt, Miguel Gutierrez and Wayne 
Hazzard to an original score by Beth Custer, "Whisper" is concerned with an 
effort to find or define a sense of acceptable "place." 
</P>
<P>
 Action is confined to a large square outlined on the floor or else to 
isolating circles lit from above. Traversing the space, sometimes in mirror 
images or in fluent partnerships, the dancers occasionally hold branches in 
front of their faces as if spoofing Martha Graham. But Goode, speaking in the 
guise of an exotic Romantic poet, apparently is serious. Even so, the 
quarter-hour piece remained fragmentary and obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 Goode reportedly also reworked his hourlong theater piece, "Convenience Boy" 
since it was seen last year in Irvine and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the witty, superficially giddy but dark-toned morality vignettes 
apparently have been retained, but heroin and sex-for-sale references have been 
deleted. The result: The work is perhaps more simply entertaining than it was 
in the previous version. 
</P>
<P>
 When Goode attempted to get too overtly didactic, the piece turned 
heavy-handed indeed. Miguel told a story of how he lost his unbounded 
expectations as he got older. This was presented as a kind of sad, cautionary 
tale. But, as he said, children don't merely just get bigger. Most of them grow 
up. CHRIS PASLES

DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS; BEN-DOR SHINES IN SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight down, one to go. As the penultimate candidate for the post of music 
director/conductor of the Santa Barbara Symphony, the young Boston-based 
conductor Gisele Ben-Dor showed formidable musical wares on Saturday at the 
Arlington Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Dor being the sole female candidate of the lot, cynical parties might cry 
"equal opportunity auditioning." Suspicions of tokenism were quickly allayed 
this night, however, as Ben-Dor -- who was born in Uruguay of Polish parents -- 
dispatched both a firm sense of organization and an expressively flexible hand. 
Overall, she proved as strong as -- if not stronger than -- any candidate in 
the running thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 This evening, Ben-Dor performed impressive, intelligent feats, first by 
bringing minimalism -- in the form of John Adams' delightfully devious fox-trot 
variation, "The Chairman Dances" -- to this generally contemporary-phobic 
organization. The concert then backslid through time, past Khachaturian's 
Violin Concerto (1940), into the romantic bosom of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, matching the objective machinery of America's star minimalist with 
the rolling expressive landscape of Russian romanticism would seem problematic. 
To Ben-Dor's credit, she made it all work, by balancing clarity with charisma 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked up infectious appeal in the Adams and painted sweeping dynamic 
vistas in Tchaikovsky. Ever alert and efficient, Ben-Dor avoided turning the 
romantic score into gushing mush. French violinist Christophe Boulier, who made 
his United States debut in Santa Barbara four years ago, brought requisite 
virtuosic flourish to the Khachaturian. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, it was an evening of memorable music-making, and the standing ovation 
seemed more than just a rote ritual. Is it possible that the symphony has found 
the best person for the job? JOSEF WOODARD

DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS; SOUTHWEST CHAMBER IN INTRIGUING SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chamber music took a beating in Pasadena, Saturday night, when an hourslong 
freeway traffic jam having to do with a rock concert at the Rose Bowl made 
concertgoers late in arriving at their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the April event by the Southwest Chamber Music Society, this time devoted 
to 20th-Century music for woodwinds, the scheduled pre-concert speaker, 
composer Mel Powell, never spoke; he arrived at Pasadena Presbyterian Church an 
hour late, just in time to hear the first half of the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ambassador Auditorium, the Times' representative never got there at all; as 
a result, no review of the Waverly Consort's latest Ambassador concert is 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For the small but deeply attentive audience gathered in the airy sanctuary at 
Pasadena Pres (as the cognoscenti call it), the Southwest Wind Quintet 
introduced recent music written by Powell and Milton Babbitt, revived worthy 
and attractive pieces by Ruth Crawford-Seeger and Villa-Lobos and concluded, 
scrappily, with a genuine masterpiece, Janacek's "Mladi," wherein they were 
joined by bass-clarinetist David Sherr. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's Wind Quintet proved the high point of this intriguing program. In a 
bracing 10 minutes, it offers consistent richness, instrumental transparency, 
bright harmonies -- whatever the composer's self-named "pitch-tableau 
procedures" are, he should share their secrets with the dullards of younger 
generations -- and glimpses into a brilliant aural imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, the newish piece sounds unique; as played by the 
Southwest five -- flutist Dorothy Stone, oboist Stuart Horn, clarinetist 
Michael Grego, hornist Jeff von der Schmidt and bassoonist Leslie Lashinsky -- 
it certainly proved irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford-Seeger's melancholy but provocative Suite (1952) for wind quintet 
opened the program; Janacek's emotionally resonant "Mladi" closed it. In 
between, there were pleasures aplenty in Stone and Lashinsky's virtuosic and 
effortless playing of Villa-Lobos' "Bachianas Brasileiras," No. 6, and in 
Stone's commanding performance of a piece written for her, Babbitt's "None but 
the Lonely Flute" (1991). DANIEL CARIAGA

DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS; UCLA MAKES ITS COMMITMENT CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of a transition to a new academic profile, the UCLA Dance 
Department demonstrated a reassuring commitment to modern dance creativity and 
technical excellence in the 29th annual program by its faculty and student 
company, Friday in Room 200 of the Dance Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest choreographer Janis Brenner collected anecdotes from her 
multi-generational cast for "The Memory of All That," an uneven but generally 
persuasive text-based piece boasting a mellow commissioned score by Howard 
Richman.Gestural motion and group-bonding processes reinforced the spoken 
reminiscences, with Brenner placing the various stories in the context of 
physical relationships. Linked together, the silent partner(s) shaped the mood 
and rhythm of the speaker through movement and, especially, weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop for Tea and Gas" found guest choreographer Dan Wagoner hitching together 
music by Henryk Gorecki, Philip Glass and Kris Kristofferson in an unlikely 
suite accompanying a compulsively antic, ultimately enervating exploration of 
contemporary spirituality. References to religious figures from many cultures 
occurred in both the Allen Ginsberg poems of the Glass section and in Wagoner's 
dance images, but his relentlessly twitchy choreography looked less inspired by 
Christ or Krishna than St. Vitus. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, faculty choreographer Ronald Brown provided balm for the eyes with 
his conventional but unfailingly graceful woman's septet "Heaven's Gate" to 
music by Oregon. Like Brenner and Wagoner, he pushed the technical capabilities 
of the UCLA Dance Company to the limit in certain instances, but his sense of 
musicality offered the dancers a lifeline that also sustained him in the 
mercurial showpiece solo "Save You" (music composed and performed by Lisbeth 
Scott).

premieres. LEWIS SEGAL

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FUTURE IS NOW IN PROVOCATIVE 'CYBERPUNK' AT NUART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marianne Trench and Peter von Brandenburg's provocative and enlightening 
"Cyberpunk" (Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. at the Nuart) pays homage to 
Vancouver-based science-fiction writer William Gibson whose novels, the 
filmmakers persuasively demonstrate, have had a profound effect on the way 
science and technology are shaping the future. They put special emphasis on 
cyberpunks, those computer hackers dedicated to accessing and liberating the 
world of information. 
</P>
<P>
 This documentary, much of which is also a dazzling display of the 
possibilities of computer-generated animation, explores the impact of 
cyberpunks on culture -- e.g., music and design -- as well as the burgeoning 
universe of virtual reality. When the unpretentious Gibson, a visionary who's 
no computer specialist, says, "The future has already happened," you believe 
him. (310) 478-6379. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thumb up, the other down for this week's midnight movies. Tsui Hark's 
enchanting 1983 "Zu: Warriors From the Magic Mountain" (Monica 4-Plex Fridays 
and Saturdays) is a blithe, quaint fantasy in which a civil war in ancient 
times gives way to a supernatural struggle between good and evil as a young 
soldier, Ti (Yuen Biao), and his monk sidekick I-Chen (Meng Hai) embark upon a 
quest for the Celestial Swords, whose combined force is needed to defeat the 
Blood Monster. The movie's moral is that young people must unite to save the 
universe from their elders. (310) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan McCormack's 55-minute "Minotaur" (at the Sunset 5 Fridays and Saturdays) 
is an arty, breathtakingly pretentious parable on the decline and fall of an 
Elvis-like pop star (Michael Faella) that presents an overly familiar 
phenomenon as if it were some kind of profound revelation. Preceding it, 
however, is a real dazzler: Robert Beebe's award-winning, 14-minute "In the 
Aquarium," a gorgeous, surreal underwater odyssey that was produced in UCLA's 
animation workshop. (213) 848-3500. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1922 "Monte Cristo," which screens Saturday at 2 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz 
Theater, has got to be one of the key rediscoveries in the UCLA Film Archive's 
ongoing Festival of Preservation. It's astounding that such an ambitious and 
skillfully made production of Alexandre Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo" and 
starring such a major star as John Gilbert could have sunk into such obscurity 
that it was regarded lost until it surfaced in the Czech Republic Film Archive, 
where it was restored to its tinted beauty. (Think how familiar the Douglas 
Fairbanks "Robin Hood," made the same year, is in comparison.) "Monte Cristo" 
will be accompanied on the organ by Robert Israel, playing Erno Rapee's 
original score. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert was a great romantic matinee idol and, like Rudolph Valentino, was 
expected to roll his eyes in especially feverish moments. But under Emmett J. 
Flynn's direction, Gilbert gives one of his most restrained and subtle 
performances as the sorely wronged sea captain Edmond Dantes, betrayed by three 
erstwhile friends into life imprisonment in solitary confinement. A miraculous 
escape after 20 years of captivity allows Dantes, calling himself the Count of 
Monte Cristo, to exact an elaborate and gratifying revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographed by Lucien Andriot, "Monte Cristo" is a durably stirring work of 
visual grandeur with its sumptuous period settings and costumes, which have the 
stylized look of the popular illustrators of the day -- e.g., N. C. Wyeth or 
Maxfield Parrish. Bernard McConville was responsible for adapting Dumas to the 
screen, preserving his spirit intact in this William Fox Super Production. (Be 
on the lookout for a single scene with Renee Adoree, who three years later was 
Gilbert's leading lady in King Vidor's classic "The Big Parade.") Also of 
special note in the Festival of Preservation offerings: the impressive and 
engaging "James Dean on Television: Three Dramas" (Melnitz Tuesday at 7:30 
p.m.). Information: (310) 206-FILM.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; SCHOTTENFELD GIVES A LESSON IN CABARET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Schottenfeld's opening night performance at the Cinegrill last week 
was an impressive illustration of how to do contemporary cabaret. Not only did 
the New York-based artist sing with the panache and style of a veteran 
nightclub performer, she also wrote all the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenfeld's singing was smooth as silk, supported by an easy, 
three-octave-plus range and a versatile vocal timbre; she added additional 
spice to her performance with high-spirited comedic interludes. 
</P>
<P>
 At their best -- especially in "Revision," a set piece describing the miseries 
of rewriting -- Schottenfeld's songs had the feel, if not always quite the 
depth, of Sondheim. "Two Lifetimes" (written with Jule Styne) and "The Thought 
Behind Your Smile" (written with Henry Mancini) were well-crafted ballads, but 
a children's piece written with Steve Allen was interminably long, and should 
be omitted from her act. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a problem with Schottenfeld's presentation, it was a tendency 
toward a one-note theme exploring contemporary mating rituals. Witty as songs 
such as "I Can Depend on You Like I Can Float on Air" may have been, their fey 
cuteness tended to undercut the more substantial qualities of her ballad 
writing, which was far superior. 
</P>
<P>
 * Schottenfeld performs today at the Cinegrill, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 
7000 Hollywood Blvd., 8 p.m. $12. (213) 466-7000. DON HECKMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; PINK FLOYD'S APPEAL SPANS AGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm surprised to see so many old people here," said Dana Gerth, 19, looking 
around the Rose Bowl before Pink Floyd took the stage on Saturday for the first 
of two nights there. It was Gerth's first time seeing his favorite group in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of him, 44-year-old Roubye Hart, who first saw Pink Floyd in 1972 at 
Winterland in San Francisco, turned around and replied, "I'm surprised to see 
so many young people." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the generation gap.  
</P>
<P>
 Somehow Pink Floyd -- without the rock power or flashy rebellion of Led 
Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones or the counterculture pull of the Grateful Dead 
-- has managed to span several age groups. The appeal to Hart and her peers was 
clear -- with its emphasis on '70s material and '70s-style laser-light 
spectacle, this was a show about memories. (The concert was reviewed in full 
from San Diego in Saturday's Calendar.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gerth and his friend Kevin Reash, who each paid a broker $200 for a $75 
ticket, have no such memories. Wearing flannel shirts and backward caps, they 
looked as if they'd be more at home at a Pearl Jam concert, but they insisted 
that it was Pink Floyd that speaks to them with its lyrics about searching for 
meaning in a confusing world. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of ages made for a respectful crowd Saturday, dutifully cheering each 
favorite song and special effect. Inevitably, though, it left Hart longing for 
her more unruly youth.  
</P>
<P>
 "People used to make a band work more -- demand four or five encores," she 
said. "Now they're more worried about beating the traffic home." STEVE HOCHMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; MACIAS' INFECTIOUS BEAT ROCKS SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enrico Macias may not be a household name to American audiences, but he 
managed to draw a full house at the 6,000-seat Shrine Auditorium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular French entertainers of the past 25 years, Macias was 
performing in Los Angeles for the first time since 1984.He moved easily through 
a 2 1/2-hour program, generating shouts of enthusiasm after the first two or 
three bars of each number. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias' warm-sounding voice and articulate lyricism were especially effective 
on the French love songs in his program; like Yves Montand, he brings a rakish 
quality to his readings that adds a sly whimsy to nearly every phrase. But 
Macias is far more than a ballad singer. Working in five or six different 
languages, he touched upon flamenco, rai , Neapolitan and Israeli music -- 
among many others. And he did it with style, substance and an infectious 
rhythmic energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all were Macias' originals, a set of tunes ranging from love ballads 
to political anthems: "Suzy," a sweetly tender piece written for his wife; 
"L'Enfant de Mon Enfant" composed for his grandfather; "Un Berger Vient de 
Tomber," written in memory of the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt (who 
brought Macias to Cairo in 1979 to sing at a concert for peace); and his first 
major hit, "Adieu Mon Pays," for more than two decades a spirited musical 
rallying point for emigrants who -- like the Algerian-born Macias -- were 
forced to leave the countries of their birth. DON HECKMAN

DESMOND MADE HER TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leigh Silverton writes about the "Sunset Boulevard" plot from the color of her 
agenda, not from the plot ("All Things Are Not Equal in 'Sunset,' " April 
11).She calls Norma Desmond a "mature woman" who is struggling with gaining a 
"modicum of respectability" and isn't being "taken seriously into midlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, please! 
</P>
<P>
 Desmond is not a tragic figure of the prejudice against middle-aged women -- 
she is a tragic figure of herself! She never grew and developed herself to face 
a rapidly changing industry. She never developed her personal life to include 
intimates and family. Her myopic narcissism kept her brief experience with 
success the focal point of her universe.

TV REVIEW; 'RIDE WITH THE WIND' A TRIP INTO LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes an unpretentious TV movie comes along that treats sentimental 
material with such modesty and simplicity that it succeeds beyond its 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such a movie is "Ride With the Wind," about a washed-up, booze-drenched 
motorcycle racer (Craig T. Nelson) whose life is salvaged by a chance encounter 
with an ailing little boy and the youth's single mother (the affecting Helen 
Shaver). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that scenario sounds so derivative of a zillion weepy two-hankie 
movies one hesitates to describe even that much of the plot. But what salvages 
and distinguishes this story, besides the unstressed direction of Bobby Roth 
and a low-key teleplay by Harry Grant and Nelson himself, is the shaggy honesty 
and charm of Nelson's floundering raceway biker. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is as real as a gob of mud. From the moment this broken-down, one-time 
racing idol wakes up in a stupor on a desert plateau, empty beer bottles 
jangling around him, through his comically rugged, slam-bang sex with a 
lascivious blond bartender (Linda Dona), Nelson's burned-out case is an 
unadorned portrait of physical and emotional bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's weary Everyman is most crucially a specific guy whose bonding with 
the boy and his mom retrieves his life and makes possible his one last race for 
the Nationals, however hokey that setup is. In real life he would have hung it 
up and not chanced another crash on his fragile bones, but by then you don't 
mind because the movie has earned the right to cheat a little. 
</P>
<P>
 And check out Shaver's nervous laugh as she begins to fall for this big, 
silent mug with the long hair and honky-tonk past who won't take no for an 
answer and has no memory of having ever been in love -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ride With the Wind" airs tonight on ABC at 9 p.m. (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42).

FRIEDKIN SIGNING KEEPS 'JADE' IN LANSING FAMILY; MOVIES: SELECTION OF PARAMOUNT 
CHIEF'S HUSBAND AS DIRECTOR RAISES EYEBROWS, EVEN IN AN INDUSTRY KNOWN FOR 
NEPOTISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nepotism isn't a dirty word in Hollywood. In fact, quite often in the 
industry, it's not just who you know, but who you're related to. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, more than a few eyebrows were raised around town last week when it was 
learned that Paramount Pictures has signed William Friedkin to direct "Jade," a 
high-profile Joe Eszterhas thriller that has yet to be cast. Friedkin, whose 
recent basketball movie, "Blue Chips," was a costly disappointment for 
Paramount, happens to be married to studio head Sherry Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up the trades, saw (the Friedkin signing), and said, 'Oh, geez,' " 
remarked a producer with ties to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning director for 1971's "The French Connection" 
and a onetime industry powerhouse, has not had a hit movie in more than two 
decades. Nevertheless, Friedkin was the only director to see the Eszterhas 
script when it was completed April 7, and he immediately "jumped" at the chance 
to make the picture, according to the screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas, also the film's executive producer, maintains that Friedkin had 
long been his first choice to direct "Jade." He vehemently objects to the 
insinuation of nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody raises that issue with (Nicole) Kidman and (Tom) Cruise, or (Alec) 
Baldwin and (Kim) Basinger," he said. "I think it's unfair. Billy Friedkin has 
made as much money and is as successful in his own right as any of those people 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 The project had attracted some attention in November, 1992, when Lansing, in 
her first acquisition after becoming chairman of Paramount's Motion Picture 
Group, agreed to pay a hefty $2.5 million for the script (provided that the 
movie gets made) based on a four-page outline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As another sign that a large budget is envisioned, Craig Baumgarten, who is 
producing the movie along with Robert Evans and Gary Adelson, said the team is 
urging the studio to go after Cruise for a starring role. (Snaring Cruise is 
unlikely, however, since the actor has already committed to Paramount's 
"Mission: Impossible" as his next film, acknowledged a senior studio executive 
who wished to remain anonymous.) 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said Friedkin was on his short list of three directors when he first 
presented the project to Lansing's predecessor, Brandon Tartikoff, more than 
two years ago. "There isn't a good actor I know who wouldn't want to work with 
Billy," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eszterhas: "What (Friedkin) brings to the party is a kind of spooky, dark 
energy, which fits perfectly into 'Jade.' He has a great sense of visual 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas said he was also impressed when Friedkin "told me he doesn't want to 
change a comma." 
</P>
<P>
 But more skeptical observers say that Friedkin would never have been given 
this opportunity if not for his marriage to Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't take a piece like this without going to the top 10 directors in 
town," said a veteran agent who is not among Friedkin's admirers. "You don't go 
to him exclusively. . . . At another studio, he wouldn't have a prayer to get 
this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Dolgen, the new head of Paramount's parent company, Viacom 
Entertainment Group, was traveling last week and could not be reached. Lansing 
declined to comment publicly on "Jade." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumgarten said he hopes to begin production of "Jade" by July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But the senior Paramount official said: "That's nice, but he'd better have a 
cast. What Jonathan signed off on was a desire to make the movie with Friedkin 
as director, subject to the appropriate budget and cast." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nepotism in Hollywood dates to the industry's earliest days and is certainly 
nothing new at Paramount. In the 1980s, for example, Paul Bluhdorn was senior 
vice president of acquisitions for Paramount Pictures while his father, 
Charles, was chairman of the parent Gulf & Western Corp. Bob Jaffe became vice 
president of production while his father, Stanley, was president of the 
studio's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lansing-Friedkin relationship has drawn criticism before. After the 
director made several deals to develop pictures at Paramount, Lansing said that 
to avoid any conflict of interest, she would leave all business matters 
involving her husband to Stanley Jaffe, who personally oversaw the making of 
"Blue Chips." 
</P>
<P>
 That role has apparently now fallen to Jaffe's replacement, Dolgen, who 
reportedly gave a green light to "Jade" last week during his first two days on 
the job. Dolgen, known as a hard-nosed cost-cutter, is widely expected to 
curtail some of the budgetary excesses for which Jaffe was known. Cost control 
is said to be a priority, given the debt pressures that Viacom Inc. will be 
under in the wake of its recent merger with Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount executive said "Blue Chip" was completed for about $20 million, 
but other knowledgeable sources estimate the movie cost at least $35 million to 
make and another $20 million to market. The picture, which received mixed 
reviews, has so far grossed less than $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the industry rise to Lansing's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's obviously some political element to the whole thing, but that's not 
to say he's not the right director for the movie," said a prominent young 
agent. "She (Lansing) believes so tremendously in the talents of her husband 
that I don't think it occurs to her that there's any favoritism or anything but 
good for her company in giving him a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Eszterhas said he is enamored not only of Friedkin's biggest hits -- the 
Academy Award-winning "The French Connection" and the Oscar-nominated "The 
Exorcist" (1973) -- but also with "Cruising" (1980) and "To Live and Die in 
L.A." (1985). 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Jade' is dark, but at the same time it's a roller-coaster ride and it has a 
certain kind of humor to it . . . and I think Billy can do that," Eszterhas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot line of "Jade" is a closely guarded secret, although the screenplay 
is said to revolve around three upscale San Franciscans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a story about how everyone has their dark side, and you never quite know 
who your husband, your wife, your lover or your partner really is," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who produced Eszterhas' steamy "Sliver," described the new work as 
"sensual rather than sexual."

Q&A WITH HENRY MANCINI; TURNING 70, WITH WINE, ROSES AND A FEW THORNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry Mancini turned 70 Saturday and the event will be celebrated Tuesday 
night in a benefit concert at UCLA Pauley Pavilion. It comes at a particularly 
difficult time. In February, Mancini was diagnosed as having inoperable cancer. 
He nonetheless remains alert and optimistic, and is close to completing the 
music for a Broadway version of "Victor / Victoria."  
</P>
<P>
 Mancini's list of achievements and honors is long and varied. "Moon River," 
"Days of Wine and Roses" and "Charade" have become pop song classics, and "Baby 
Elephant Walk," "Pink Panther" and the theme for "Peter Gunn" are instrumental 
perennials. His film scores range from "The Glenn Miller Story" and "Breakfast 
at Tiffany's" to "Touch of Evil," "10" and "Victor / Victoria."  
</P>
<P>
 Mancini has received 72 Grammy nominations and won 20. Fourteen Academy Award 
nominations have resulted in four Oscars, and his more than 90 albums have 
produced eight gold records.  
</P>
<P>
 Born in Cleveland on April 16, 1924, he was raised in Aliquippa, Pa. His 
studies at the Juilliard School of Music were interrupted in 1943 for Army Air 
Corps and infantry service. After World War II, he arranged music for the Tex 
Beneke Orchestra before starting his film career at Universal-International in 
1952.  
</P>
<P>
 Mancini married the former Ginny O'Connor -- an original member of Mel Torme's 
MelTones -- in 1947. They have three children.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I know that you're aiming for a late November opening of the stage 
version of 'Victoria," your big project of the moment. How's it coming along? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The only thing I have left right now, and it's a big one, is the Jim 
Garner character's number. I'm about halfway through, and the harder part is 
yet to come, but I'm not worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the show flowed fairly easily from the film version? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the first song we wrote was in 1982, then Blake Edwards got sick and 
we had to put it aside for a while. But the stage version is very different. 
We're not using any of the music from the picture. And, frankly, I'm kind of 
happy about that, although there were a couple of good songs in the movie. But 
we wanted to get new. We wanted to get fresh approaches. And Julie Andrews, 
who'll be starring again, wanted that, too. You know, the words have to come 
out of her mouth. I just try to give Julie and Leslie (Bricusse, the lyricist) 
that platform so that the words are right. A lot of times I've done music 
first, and occasionally Leslie's done the words first. But the words are what 
Julie is singing, not la, la, la, la. And she knows what she wants and what 
feels right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does it feel to be thinking about music from a Broadway, rather than a 
film, point of view? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've lived my life in the movies since I started out in 1952 at Universal. 
"Here kid, here's the picture. We need music; put it here, here, here, here and 
here. Do it." That was what they said. Then, as you get more successful, they 
get more kind to you. But on stage, as you move along, you move along with the 
director and the choreographer and the lyricist. You gotta start thinking alike 
or else it falls apart. But it's a good thing, if you have any pride in what 
you do. It's not a gig. Let me put it that way. I mean, look at me, for Pete's 
sake. Here I am trying to step in to a place with Fritz Loewe and Richard 
Rodgers. You know what that does? It keeps you honest, knowing these other cats 
have come before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With this 70th birthday coming up, is there anything in particular that 
stands out in memory for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that popularity-wise, it was "Peter Gunn." But as far as 
emotionally and artistically, I think it was the score I did for Orson Welles' 
"Touch of Evil." If you listen to that score you'll hear a lot of things that 
finally developed further in film music. Because Welles didn't want the 
ordinary kind of thing. He hired a whole new band for the score. He didn't use 
the Universal orchestra. Shelly Manne came in, and Pete Candoli, Milt 
Bernhardt, and the bongo whiz, Jack Costanza. Of course, while something like 
that is happening, you're so busy that you kind of forget to smell the roses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And the hot part of your career? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That started after I left Universal, with "Breakfast at Tiffany's." And I 
went right from "Tiffany" to "Experiment in Terror," and then "Days of Wine and 
Roses." Then "Charade" came along, and "Pink Panther." It was just a roll. It 
was a burst of energy. And the one thing that I remember about it is that I was 
never hassled. There's a mentality in the film community that everything is 
late, everything is a hassle, the director's going to kill you. All that stuff. 
All the negative stuff. And sometimes it does happen that way. But I just went 
through it and enjoyed the hell out of it. And I still do. I just love what I 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When did that feeling of enjoyment begin? When did you first sense that 
there was something magical in this work that you do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It took a while for magical to show up. Because when you're a young 
arranger -- and I started when I was 13 or 14 -- just to get the notes down on 
the paper, and then hear it, was something. It wasn't like magic, it was like 
you built something and it worked. That was good enough. Then, when I started 
to write for big bands in the Army, I began to step back and listen, not just 
to the notes on paper, but to actually think about musical lines and stuff. 
That's when it started to get magical. And then later on with the Tex Beneke 
band, with strings, that was a big step. And it's been that way ever since, 
when you say magical. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you had to define one, central aspect of the Mancini magic, what would 
it be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Melody, I guess. I don't want to say that I can't write a bad melody, but I 
try not to. I'm very conscious of melody. But it's not only the long sweeping 
lines that people think of in some movies. A good theme -- like the "Pink 
Panther" or "Baby Elephant Walk" -- can work all the way through the picture, 
which is what I did with them. So, for me, a good melody is not just a pretty 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So the work still captivates you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, sure. It always has. I haven't changed, not since I was 13 years old, 
copying sax choruses off Artie Shaw records and not knowing what the hell I was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And this development with your health? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, when that first came about, I was thinking, "What's going to happen 
when I go upstairs and try to write?" And, I'll be damned, I came up here and 
wrote, that's all, like nothing's wrong. I had no worries about the 
inevitability or where the thing's going. Can't. Can't do that. I don't know. 
Maybe it'll hit me later. Way later.

 Wedding Bells Ring at Box Office: Moviegoers are saying "I do" to Gramercy 
Picture's "Four Weddings and a Funeral." The comedy starring Hugh Grant and 
Andie MacDowell, which has been slowly growing in popularity, was No. 1 during 
the weekend with $4.3 million in box-office revenues, according to early 
industry estimates. The film was No. 6 last week. In the No. 2 spot was 
TriStar's new release, "Cops & Robbersons," the comedy starring Chevy Chase and 
Jack Palance, with $3.8 million. Universal's "The Paper" was third with $3.3 
million. The sports comedies, Warner Bros.' "Major League II" and Disney's "D2 
The Mighty Ducks," were running neck and neck with box scores of $3.2 million. 
A box-office note: Savoy Pictures' new release, "Serial Mom," the comedy from 
John Waters, took in about $2 million during what was a slow weekend overall.

TV CONTROL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Joan Van Tassel's Counterpunch, " 'V' Chip Solution a Cop-Out" 
(April 11): There is a technology available that allows you to control not only 
the type of explicit content you see and hear but also the amount (intensity). 
</P>
<P>
 This patented technology is called VideoFreedom, and it offers home viewers 
and the industry a technology-based solution to the single-source, 
multiple-viewer dilemma of conventional entertainment.Information is coded into 
four categories: (1) sex/nudity; (2) violence; (3) adult situations; (4) 
language. In each category you have four intensity levels: (1) nearly complete 
elimination of controversial or explicit material, suitable for children; (2) 
some blurring, suitable for young adults; (3) mild blurring, suitable for 
adults; (4) untouched.

Q & A WITH ERIC BRAEDEN; FROM A 'RAT' TO PLAYING 'YOUNG AND RESTLESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past 14 years, Eric Braeden has portrayed wealthy Victor Newman on 
CBS' top-rated daytime soap opera, "The Young and the Restless."  
</P>
<P>
 A powerful, sophisticated and sometimes ruthless international businessman, 
his character has been involved for most of those years in a volatile , 
on-again , off-again relationship with ex-stripper and one-time wife Nikki 
Abbott, played by Melody Thomas Scott, and is now in love with blind farmer 
Hope Adams, played by Signy Coleman.  
</P>
<P>
 Braeden came to the daytime series after a successful acting career in films 
and in prime-time television, including a starring role in the 1966-68 
action-adventure series "The Rat Patrol" under his real name, Hans Gudegast.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Kiel, Germany, he was pressed to change his name upon landing a 
leading role in the 1969 Universal feature "Colossus: The Forbin Project," when 
he says studio chief Lew Wasserman told him that no German actor would star in 
American films. Braeden had come to the United States about 10 years earlier 
after his high school graduation.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his "Y & R" character, Braeden has been married to one woman, Dale, for 
28 years and has a 24-year-old son, Christian, a UCLA Film School graduate. A 
lifelong athlete, he won the 1958 German Youth Championship in track and field 
and the 1972-73 National Soccer Championship with a Los Angeles-based team, the 
Maccabees. In 1990, he co-founded the German-American Cultural Society to 
promote a positive, realistic image of Germans in this country and to advance 
German/Jewish dialogue.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Daytime television is often compared to performing in Siberia, by 
actors and the entertainment industry at large. But you thrive on it. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Prior to my work on "The Young and the Restless," I'd worked for 16 
years in this town, mostly as a bad guy. I'd run dry.  
</P>
<P>
 I think there was an enormous need in me as a German actor to show that we 
have feelings just like anyone else, that we have enormous conflicts just like 
anyone else, that we are very emotional people. I think that because of the 
dehumanizing effect of playing nothing but bad guys -- and often, as it was in 
the very early parts, Nazis -- there was an enormous need to connect with 
something in my work that had warmth, empathy, commiseration, that conveyed 
more positive feelings. I'm eternally grateful to this medium and specifically 
this soap for having given me that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Victor's relationship with Nikki has registered an enduring appeal among 
viewers. Why do you think it has so captured their fancy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a 
woman who comes from the wrong side of the tracks into his life, and shaping 
her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or 
form anyone -- she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that 
causes conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the outward appearances. But what I think happens to us on screen is 
that she and I fight very well. When Mel and I have these emotional scenes, and 
there are many of them, something just clicks. I can't explain it, except to 
say that you always hope to reach with an actor or actress some truth, some 
honesty, some reality, and in scenes with her I approximate that. And now I 
have that with Hope -- Signy Coleman. I don't know why that happens between 
some actors and not with others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "The Young and the Restless" celebrated its 21st anniversary last month. It 
has been the No. 1-rated soap for the past five years, week in and week out. 
How do you account for that astonishing track record? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because (co-creator/senior executive producer) Bill Bell deals with basic 
emotions -- love, hate, greed. Then he intertwines social issues in the stories 
that affect our lives in one way or another, be it alcohol, AIDS, divorce, 
teen-age pregnancy, teen-age marriage. So he taps into things people can 
identify with. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, you embellish that by creating characters like Victor Newman, for 
example, who's enormously wealthy and can call up his pilot any day to fly to 
Paris at the wink of an eye, and is mixed up with beautiful women. So you have 
what Hollywood has always provided: a visual pleasure but also a means by which 
the audience can identify with the characters' emotional metamorphoses, 
conflicts and ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Unlike most soap actors, you also appear occasionally on prime-time 
television, such as a Perry Mason movie, the miniseries "Lucky/Chances" and, 
most recently, "The Nanny." 
</P>
<P>
 A: I usually do not do prime time, for a very specific reason. In the early 
1970s, a studio -- and I won't say who -- summarily lowered its guest-star 
salaries by two-thirds. That, to me, was one of the most egregious affronts to 
actors. Agents cowardly acquiesced, and nothing was done about it. I still 
resent that situation and will not help perpetuate it. That's one of the major 
reasons I'm doing the soap. I did "The Nanny" because I have great respect for 
(series star, co-creator and co-producer) Fran Drescher and the way she brought 
the whole thing about. And my wife thought it was a funny show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your soap role is not your only outlet to communicate the fact that Germans 
are not the cold, heartless people that historically inspired stereotypes would 
hold. Why did you help create the German-American Cultural Society? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've listened for over 30 years to vilification of where I come from. The 
concept of Germany is usually synonymous with that 12-year period (surrounding 
World War II). I've always been deeply, deeply upset and angered by that, but 
it's a kind of impotent anger, because what happened, happened. 
</P>
<P>
 We are trying to have open dialogues between Germans and Jews. You openly talk 
to each other and discover what we have in common as human beings, not what 
differentiates us from a stupid religious point of view. We've talked about 
whether normal relations are possible, about German and Jewish contributions in 
America, present-day Germany, the consequences of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 What it really boils down to is this: Jews must not make the same mistake that 
was made about them. They were collectively and dismissively called "The Jews." 
Don't collectively and dismissively call us "The Germans."

ART REVIEW; PERFORMANCE PIECES MAR EXHIBIT OF ROBERT STIVERS PHOTOS; HIS BEST 
WORK ON VIEW IN LAGUNA IS HIS SIMPLEST, WHILE HE SOMETIMES PUTS TOO MUCH STOCK 
IN MANNERED POSES AND SET-UPS. 
</P>

 What mysteries can you evoke in a photograph of a clay-slathered nude body? 
What if it's wrapped in a layer of plastic instead? Or suppose you posed a nude 
woman with an antler protruding from her head? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stivers, whose experiments in this vein are at BC Space in Laguna Beach 
(through May 7), came to photography relatively late in life. After graduating 
from UC Irvine as a history major, he spent eight years in New York, where he 
danced briefly with the Joffrey Ballet, and then tried his hand at dance 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, at the age of 34, he returned to the creative side of the arts after 
taking a UCLA Extension workshop with noted photographer JoAnn Callis. 
</P>
<P>
 Stivers' dance background comes through clearly in the innate theatricality of 
his work and its concern with the expressive potential of the body. Adept at 
lighting his subjects, most of whom are dancers and actors, he is equally handy 
at coaxing out a range of velvety blacks in his silver gelatin and platinum 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Still feeling his way, Stivers sometimes puts too much stock in mannered poses 
and set-ups. In "Clay Series (Man Holding Stone)" -- an impassive man whose 
head is covered with dried clay -- the photographer seems to be trying to give 
Richard Avedon's confrontational photography of the early '80s a quasi-mystical 
Men's Movement spin. But this faux primitif image is as vacuous as a fashion 
magazine layout, revealing no inner life. 
</P>
<P>
 While an artist with a cooler sensibility might profit from this stylishly 
self-conscious approach, it makes Stivers' earnest attempts at psychological 
discovery come across as labored and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-portraits in which Stivers lies on a bed of nails, crouches in the midst 
of a coiled length of garden hose and wears a strait-jacket are all 
performances .  
</P>
<P>
 This work isn't really convincing on an emotional level, yet its evident 
sincerity precludes understanding it as an acknowledgment of audience 
complicity in the game of theatrical illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The best photograph in the show is one of the simplest: a self-portrait in 
which Stivers, dressed in a pajama top, appears to be sleeping on his side at 
the luminous center of a large body of water. 
</P>
<P>
 At once peaceful and unsettling, the image brings to mind some of the 
qualities associated with sleep (isolation, peacefulness, vulnerability) as 
well as the liquid environment of the fetus. Stivers' deadpan mournfulness 
recalls silent-movie actor Buster Keaton -- a connection that makes the image 
seem more ironic and distanced, and helps remove it from the banalities of 
confessional art. 
</P>
<P>
 Images by Stivers in which the sitter's face is turned away or obscured tend 
to seem more assured, probably because the body becomes a plastic object 
stripped of obvious clues to personality and psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 In one photograph, a woman's head is wrapped in a bandage that spills a lush 
fall of hair between her bare breasts. The mixture of eroticism and repression 
remains tantalizingly unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Stivers' showmanship works most handily in "Still Life," a photograph of a 
trio of what initially appear to be small objects set on a wooden surface: an 
egg-shaped stone, a coil of metal chains and a fall of hair apparently 
suspended in air. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the hair cascades down the body of a woman (whose foot can be seen if 
you look closely), obliging the viewer to recalculate the scale of the other 
objects. Like the children's game, "Rock, Scissors, Paper," the trio of objects 
implies a power struggle. The woman is the sexual center -- but doubtless not 
the power center -- of this tiny universe. 
</P>
<P>

Ave., Laguna Beach. Hours: 1:30-5:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays. Free. (714)

JAZZ REVIEW; SHEARING'S SOFT SELL; THE PIANIST PLAYS GENTLY AND INTIMATELY, 
MAKING MELODY THE STAR AND LETTING THE CERRITOS CENTER AUDIENCE IN ON THE 
SECRET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 George Shearing knows how to get through to an audience: Forget about pounding 
the piano, and gather in your listeners with delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the approach taken Saturday, anyway, at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts where the distinguished Englishman, who will be 75 in August, 
was joined by bassist Neil Swainson for an eight-song set. Shearing sat 
straight up at a nine-foot-long Steinway and played as gently and intimately as 
if he were whispering secrets in a corner at a party. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? Mostly silence as Shearing and Swainson wended their wondrous way 
through such numbers as Dave Brubeck's "The Duke" and Shearing's own "Lullaby 
of Birdland" and "Just a Mood." 
</P>
<P>
 People didn't even applaud the succulent solos, waiting instead until a piece 
had finished before displaying their rousing approval. Only during a comic 
melding of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" and Cole Porter's "Night and Day" did 
outbursts accompany a selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get the idea that the use of softness -- as if it were a third player on 
the stage -- translated into any lack of energy. Rather, Shearing glided 
gracefully from phrase to phrase, insistently making melody the star. 
</P>
<P>
 Famous for his verbal wit, Shearing established immediate rapport with the 
audience: The blind musician sat at the piano and proceeded to announce that 
he'd done "16 concerts in 23 days, and I finally got tired and let somebody 
else drive." Between tunes, he would offer more light, often funny chatter, and 
then would get back to the serious art of music making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Duke," probably Brubeck's finest composition, began with Shearing playing 
hide-and-seek with the falling-rising melody -- exposing the tune in a line of 
single notes, then quickly tucking it in among dusky chords. During his solo, 
he picked his notes precisely, like a shopper carefully choosing only the very 
best apples. There was a sweetness to these tones; obviously, all the fruit he 
selected was ripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Swainson, meanwhile, played fat, buoyant notes that either fit ideally 
with what Shearing was doing, or provided resonant countermelodies to the piano 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The engaging "Just a Mood" varied between a pensive somber quality and a quiet 
glee, and was played as slowly as the sun sets, though Shearing did drop in the 
occasional brisk aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Can't Be Love" was played at a sprightly medium tempo; Shearing added 
zippy lines with Oscar Peterson-like flair. During "Handful of Stars," Swainson 
compellingly contrasted complex statements with groups of scant, well-placed 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the recently reviewed Joe Williams during the second half of the 
program, Shearing (still with Swainson and joined by drummer Sherman Ferguson) 
offered ripples of flowing melody, a swirling backdrop that seemed to inspire 
the singer during "End of a Beautiful Friendship," "Here's to Life" and "I 
Didn't Know About You." Shearing's affinity for the blues was evident during 
such gutsy numbers as "I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water" and its dandy 
boogie-woogie phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening, the Cerritos concert showed that Shearing's position 
as one of the modern masters of melody remains secure.

MUSIC REVIEW; A CAPPELLA ENSEMBLE'S MASTERY SPANS CENTURIES AT IRVINE CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 It started 16 years ago as a group of friends meeting weekly to sing music of 
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, periods during which women were not 
permitted to sing in church. Saturday night at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, the 
male a cappella vocal ensemble Chanticleer demonstrated its mastery of works 
from the 16th Century as well as a variety of 20th-Century styles and genres. 
</P>
<P>
 Technical excellence conquered every test of this eclectic program: Each 
phrase began and ended with minute synchrony, intonation never wavered, a 
characteristically mellifluent tone quality withstood changes of vocal range 
and dynamic level, and texts received careful enunciation. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplined 12-member group, led by music director Joseph Jennings, 
negotiated the polyphony of Cristobal de Morales with seamless clarity. Divided 
into three choirs, the men traversed the gamut of Andrea Gabrieli's Magnificat 
precisely and with apparent ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Strauss' "Drei Mannerchore" benefited from an ever-refined balance and 
touching attention to the lush harmony changes and to text-meaning. Steven 
Sametz's modest "I Have Had Singing" captivated through simplicity, while a 
composition that was commissioned for Chanticleer -- "Charm Me Asleep," by 
David Conte -- proved more memorable for its quiet, sustained performance than 
for its conservative choral writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble also offered a group of folk songs, popular songs and spirituals. 
Countertenor Christopher Fritzsche's soprano rang clear for a solo in the 
British folk song "O Waly Waly" and Eric Alatorre's bass lent memorable 
richness to Jennings' lively adaptation of "Wade in the Water."
